17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,270
Stop!

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,320
You, stop!

19
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,240
Over there! Someone is over there!

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,440
Keep up.

21
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,320
This way.

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,190
Someone is here. Go.

23
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,440
Eldest Brother.

24
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,320
This is too risky.

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,080
I worry about her no less than you.

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,550
I have something

27
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,520
that I need to ask her in person.

28
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,830
Take care.

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,550
I'll lead the guards away.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,030
I'll meet you at the prison.

31
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,800
You should also take care.

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,160
I'll bribe the Lead Prison Guard,

33
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,110
it'll help you get into the prison

34
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,240
more easily.

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,110
Let's go.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,630
Who is there? Stop!

37
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,670
Stop!

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,630
Here, dishes are here.

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,190
So slow.

40
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,110
Come, come, come.

41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,720
We have alcohol and meat.
Let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest.

42
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,880
You, come to the toilets with me.

43
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,880
Continue drinking.

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
Slow down.

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
Who are you?

46
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,200
Official Xiao asked me to ask
Her Highness some questions.

47
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,110
Official Xiao?

48
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,270
Do you have a token?

49
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,480
Does Official Xiao need a token

50
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,350
to ask questions?

51
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,510
Asking questions privately is

52
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,950
probably Her Majesty's order.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,790
A token is too ostentatious.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,640
Lead Prison Guard, do you know what I mean?

55
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,040
I understand.

56
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,670
She is a major criminal. You should be quick.

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,640
Tan Er.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,000
Cheng Cheng.

59
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,320
Yan Chen.

60
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,000
Why is it you?

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,390
Sorry, I just woke up.

62
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,390
How did you come in?

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,670
Are you here to rescue me?

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
You surely are a good bro.

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,230
I appreciate your kindness,

66
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,600
but you should leave.

67
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,920
It's the death penalty.

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,390
I've never doubted you.

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,390
I chose to forgive and understand

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,350
all your strange behaviours.

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
I even convinced myself

72
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,000
that staying by your side is enough.

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
However, today,

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,480
I wavered,

75
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,000
I was confused.

76
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,720
Tell me.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
Are you still my Qu Tan Er?

78
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,600
As long as you answer me,

79
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
I'll believe whatever you say.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,440
I...

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,230
What should I say?

82
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,670
No one will believe me other than Cheng Cheng.

83
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,000
Should I fool him with a fake story?

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
No, no, no.

85
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,880
It's too evil to lie at this moment.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,640
The Mo Yan Chen in this world
loves Qu Tan Er deeply.

87
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,040
How can I tell him the truth?

88
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm not Qu Tan Er,

89
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,440
so I've never loved you.

90
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,830
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,440
Stop right there.

93
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,320
You are not her?

94
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,600
Then who are you?

95
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,200
Where is Tan Er?

96
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,110
How should I tell you?

97
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,160
This body

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
belongs to Qu Tan Er.

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,390
But it's me who currently lives

100
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,600
in this body.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,070
I'm

102
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,440
Qu Xiao Tan.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,830
Then tell me, where is Tan Er?

104
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,200
She was killed by Qu Mei Er way before.

105
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,950
But should I tell him the truth at this moment?

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
Cheng Cheng.

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,510
The real Qu Tan Er died

108
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,000
when she fell into the water that time.

109
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,720
Tan is

110
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,920
from another world.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She makes

112
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,070
this body continue to be alive.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,790
As for why Qu Tan Er fell into the water,

114
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,070
you should know the reason
behind it after thinking a bit.

115
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,790
How is this possible?

116
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,440
How can such an absurd incident
exist in this world?

117
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,640
Eldest Brother.

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,480
Even if you don't believe

119
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,160
the absurd incident we speak of,

120
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,880
you should believe

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,550
the actual Qu Tan Er

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,440
will not fail you.

123
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,080
Tan Er will never fail me.

124
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,200
I'll get her back.

125
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,960
Yan Chen.

126
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,550
Is it okay

127
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
that we told him the truth?

128
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,640
Although it's cruel,

129
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,280
it's the truth.

130
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,960
I missed you so much.

131
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,110
We need to go now.

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
No.

133
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,590
Her Majesty definitely knows that

134
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,000
we're meeting each other here tonight.

135
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,640
She permitted you to come

136
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
for some reasons.

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,790
I don't want you to suffer here.

138
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,000
Not even for a second.

139
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
It's okay.

140
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,670
Take it easy.

141
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,110
You?

142
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,910
Heart?

143
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,110
I know

144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,880
that no matter where we are,

145
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,670
no matter what situation we are in,

146
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,960
and no matter if we are poor or rich,

147
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,910
you will always

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,350
be in my heart.

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,400
Take care of yourself.

150
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,790
Go.

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,710
Go.

152
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:47,710
Tan Er.

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Go.

154
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,840
So,

155
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,280
suffering in this kind of place,

156
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,400
being in this kind of situation

157
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,840
for the one you love

158
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,790
can bring such happiness.

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,640
You really don't know anything
about the incident

160
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,280
that Second Princess fell into the water?

161
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,150
I don't.

162
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,910
I have asked Tan Er.

163
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,000
When she brought the wedding invitation to me,

164
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,400
she was pushed into the water
by Eldest Princess herself.

165
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,520
I saw you being nervous after that.

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,640
How do you explain that?

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
She is posing as Second Princess.

168
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,400
She is trying to sow discord
among you and Eldest Princess.

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,280
Why did you go to
Second Princess's Residence?

170
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,150
Why did Eldest Princess
go to Second Princess's Residence?

171
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,320
We...

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,590
We went there merely to visit.

173
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,710
When I asked Eldest Princess if she had seen

174
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
Tan Er that day,

175
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,880
she said she hadn't seen her.

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,520
Are you saying

177
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,280
that Eldest Princess was lying?

178
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
My memories fail me.

179
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,280
Days have passed, I...

180
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,590
Don't say anything more.

181
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,670
Now that you know the truth,

182
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,640
feel free to take revenge for her.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Since the first time I met you,

184
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,670
I knew,

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,470
in this world,

186
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,470
I am the only one who can see the real you

187
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,640
and help you make achievements with your talent.

188
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,350
No matter how capricious I am,

189
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,320
I only hope

190
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,000
that you can see

191
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,520
my sincere and fragile side.

192
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,520
But you wanted to kill Tan Er.

193
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,910
I can only see your cold and emotionless side.

194
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,150
I did that because I wanted to give you
the best in the world.

195
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,760
Only then

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,110
would you be with me willingly.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,790
Yan Chen.

198
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,030
I still want to say,

199
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,790
no matter what you want to do,

200
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,110
I'll do it with you.

201
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,320
Even if we need to defy the world's opinion,

202
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,440

<i>Mo Residence</i>

219
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,080
Chen Er.

220
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,400
Does it still hurt?

221
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,590
Eldest Princess sent over some tonics,

222
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,710
and I've accepted on your behalf.

223
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,000
Chen Er.

224
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:51,030
Do you still remember
what I told you at the pavilion

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,590
the day you married Eldest Princess?

226
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,760
You said you would give your all
for the Mo Family.

227
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,350
You would bear any grievances

228
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,910
after

229
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,790
marrying Eldest Princess.

230
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,960
I don't know why you came back to

231
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,550
Mo Residence.

232
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,910
However, I want you to remember
what you said before.

233
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,710
Eldest Princess

234
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,470
treats you well.

235
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,520
You should be content.

236
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,470
Father, I'm sorry for letting you down.

237
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,880
My destiny with her has already ended.

238
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,640
Chen Er,

239
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,280
you are the only one I can count on

240
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,190
in this family.

241
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,710
How can you say such unreasonable words?

242
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,590
Second Princess is going to be abolished soon.

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,400
Cheng Er is handling a lot.

244
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,400
Xuan Er is still young.

245
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,400
Feng Yang is an unfilial daughter...

246
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,190
You shouldn't be so capricious when it comes to

247
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,590
the fate of the Mo Family.

248
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,950
Also,

249
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,110
what I'm planning now is meant to

250
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
fulfill your mother's last wish.

251
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,760
Mother's last wish?

252
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,920
What do you mean?

253
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,400
I have never told you about this before.

254
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,230
In fact,

255
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,710
our Mo Family was the feudal lord of this land

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
before this kingdom was established.

257
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,000
Her Majesty relied on our power

258
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,470
to unite the country

259
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,280
and establish Dongyue.

260
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,800
However, nowadays,

261
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,430
Her Majesty is tyrannical.

262
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,400
Collecting extra taxes and
not listening to the people's wills.

263
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,880
People are suffering.

264
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,110
Your mother's last wish

265
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,590
is to replace Her Majesty.

266
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,640
Our Mo Family

267
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,400
had such great achievements?

268
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,280
Chen Er.

269
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,040
Your mother did everything

270
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,190
for you.

271
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,350
I'm planning everything

272
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,000
for you too.

273
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,830
Don't act on emotions.

274
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,280
I made this medicine for you.

275
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,160
Rest well.

276
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,110
Remember what I said.

277
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,920
After you recover,

278
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,190
return as soon as possible.

279
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,710
Get some rest.

Your Majesty.

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,560
We can activate the magic circle today.

283
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,280
I don't need to

284
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
drink this medicine.

285
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,000
Your Majesty.

286
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,800
I've already

287
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,470
finished composing the Soul-destroying Song.

288
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,560
Go get everything ready.

289
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,830
What else?

290
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,680
Since Your Majesty saved me

291
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,000
from the wolves,

292
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,560
I swore to live

293
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,880
only for you.

294
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,350
Time passed rapidly.

295
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,430
Now you can rebuild your body.

296
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,640
I'm very happy for you.

297
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,640
Yes.

298
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,800
You were so little back then,

299
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,760
but you fought with the wolf pack all night.

300
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,000
I really couldn't believe it.

301
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,880
Your Majesty wasn't any older than

302
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,560
I was at the time.

303
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,400
Why are you so emotional today?

304
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,280
I'm just

305
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,400
missing the days

306
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,560
when I played instruments with Your Majesty.

307
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,950
After I am reborn,

308
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,040
you'll be

309
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,520
the first person to play instruments with me.

310
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,070
Does that sound good?

311
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,950
I'll

312
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,310
remember this.

313
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,000
Official Xiao?

314
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,830
I can leave?

315
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,760
I can wash up once I'm back at my residence.

316
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,430
You don't have to go through such trouble.

317
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,800
I'll feel bad.

318
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,190
Crown Princess,

319
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,880
please get yourself ready as soon as possible.

320
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,040
This looks so much like getting ready

321
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,920
for the execution.

322
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,350
Anyway,

323
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,350
I'll try to prolong the process as much as I can.

324
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,040
Official Xiao.

325
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,430
Why are you so loyal to Her Majesty?

326
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,760
How did you meet?

327
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,710
Why are you so loyal to her?

328
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,040
Is poker face also popular here?

329
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,920
According to my observations,

330
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,830
with this solid employer-employee
relationship between you,

331
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,830
you must've been tricked by Her Majesty.

332
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,040
Simply speaking,

333
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,470
you fell into

334
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,880
Her Majesty's setup.

335
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,800
If you want to win her heart,

336
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,190
you need to do the same to her.

337
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,920
Your Highness,

338
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,280
your words are more and more presumptuous.

339
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,760
I have a few tips and tricks,

340
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,400
do you want to know?

341
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,680
First,

342
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,000
a four-character short phrase,

343
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,070
and a five-step trap.

344
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,230
They are

345
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,640
triggering curiosity,

346
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,110
gaining attention,

347
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,830
building relationship,

348
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,280
criticizing misunderstandings

349
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
and abusing feelings.

350
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
If Your Highness keeps rinsing,

351
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,000
you will eventually lose your mouth.

352
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,920
I haven't finished.

353
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,800
These are only some of the setups

354
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,710
Her Majesty may have used,

355
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,430
I have more...

356
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,400
I know you are trying
to hold off from getting ready.

357
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,040
Never mind,

358
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,920
this is going to be the last time
we see each other.

359
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,680
The last time we see each other?

360
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,310
What does that mean?

361
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,680
You just asked me

362
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,430
how I met Her Majesty.

363
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,800
Her Majesty

364
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,230
saved my life.

365
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,430
Saved your life?

366
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,190
She appeared at my most helpless moment.

367
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,110
The whole world had abandoned me at that time.

368
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,400
She was the only one who helped me
without any hesitation.

369
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,040
She taught me how to read.

370
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,400
She is only a few years older than me,

371
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
but she always appeared to be so mature.

372
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,350
She made me want to take care of her.

373
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,640
Sadly, I was too young at the time.

374
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,070
I didn't understand anything.

375
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,160
I could only hide behind her.

376
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,000
You like her?

377
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,000
After we had grown up,

378
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,040
I got mad when I saw

379
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,920
other men being nice to her.

380
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,470
When I saw her being tired,

381
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,230
I blamed myself for not being a better man.

382
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,920
She always laughed at my foolishness

383
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,000
and childishness.

384
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,470
But I know,

385
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,190
she is the foolish one,

386
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,110
because she doesn't know true love.

387
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,000
Your Highness,

388
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,230
you should get changed

389
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,920
in the next room.

390
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,110
You haven't finished your story.

391
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,230
What happened next?

392
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,430
Did you tell her your feelings?

393
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,950
We grew up together

394
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
away from secularization.

395
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,950
She was born for people to look up to.

396
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,830
I knew she didn't like me.

397
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,800
That was good.

398
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,000
She wouldn't like others either.

399
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,070
I once thought we could be like this

400
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,070
until we grew old.

401
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,190
Who knew...

406

00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,040
my only wish is

408
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,160
to see her smile when I look up.

409
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:16,440
♪Lonely music-playing looks to the waning lights♪

410
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,160
Her smile is like warm sunshine in the winter,

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,830

Your Highness,

418
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,880
let's go.

419
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,710
Senior.

420
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,710
Prince Consort.

421
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,880
You look

422
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,280
exhausted today.

423
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,560
Tan Er was imprisoned despite being innocent,

424
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,560
I really couldn't sleep.

425
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,920
I came to ask you

426
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,800
if there are any signs

427
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,830
of the Red Star of Demise.

428
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,800
Don't worry Your Highness.

429
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,640
Before you came,

430
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,710
I did the divination for you.

431
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,400
Let me tell you.

432
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,560
The "Shi Star" moved three times from the north,
<i>*Should be "Di Star", a constellation in ancient China</i>

433
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,350
the two poles are in anti-phase,

434
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,430
indicating a great chance.

435
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,310
However, the moon has grown an angular light,

436
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,760
indicating danger.

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,350
Senior.

438
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,110
Can you say everything in simpler terms?

439
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,400
What do you mean?

440
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,070
I felt good today,

441
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,880
and have done the divination for Your Highness.

442
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,520
Even if there is a great chance

443
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,950
to change fate today,

444
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,430
two stars clash,

445
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,520
only one of them can stay.

446
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
And there appears to be

447
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
uncertain danger.

448
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,040
Thank you, Senior.

449
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:05,920
I...

450
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,710
I haven't finished, why did you leave?

451
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,310
Fate has been settled,
external forces can hardly change it!

452
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,000
Your Majesty.

453
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,040
The process of body-usurping

454
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,920
will be tortuous.

455
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,160
There will be a process when
two people's consciousnesses

456
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,880
exist in the same body.

457
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,070
You should remain clear-headed
and strong the entire time.

458
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,160
Otherwise,

459
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,160
you will lose yourself
in Qu Tan Er's consciousness.

460
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,830
I'm telling you,

461
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,470
my consciousness is very strong.

462
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,310
I have already experienced this twice.

463
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,640
You are playing with fire.

464
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,350
Let go.

465
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,520
Let go of me.

466
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,040
Let go of me.

467
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,040
Let go.

468
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,470
Let go of me, let go of me.

469
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Let go...

470
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,280
You've lost your mind.

471
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,950
Qu Xiang Tan.

472
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,830
Do you dare to play fair in a competition with me?

473
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,640
I must get

474
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,190
what I want.

475
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,880
Your Majesty.

476
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,430
Your Majesty.

477
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,070
I wondered why you let Cheng Cheng marry me

478
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,560
even though you deeply liked
Eighth Young Master of Mo family,

479
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,400
and even made me Crown Princess.

480
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,590
It turns out

481
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,110
that you've planned everything.

482
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,280
You knew you were dying,

483
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,230
so you planned to take over my body.

484
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,950
You planned to have Cheng Cheng and the country

485
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,040
in your hands.

486
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,920
How despicable.

487
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,710
Don't worry.

488
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,560
I've been waiting for this moment

489
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,430
for so many years.

490
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,000
No one's consciousness

491
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,040
is stronger

492
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,190
and more solid

493
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,560
than mine.

494
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,600
Let's begin.

495
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,910
I'm looking forward

496
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,080
to playing instruments with you.

497
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,710
Okay.

498
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,150
What is this?

499
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,430
Qu Xiang Tan.

500
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,360
Completing this altar

501
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,230
will sacrifice Xiao Zhen.

502
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,470
Do you know that?

503
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,560
Do you want

504
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,870
Xiao Zhen to sacrifice himself for you?

505
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,040
To die for you?

506
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,150
What should I do?

507
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,280
Bring me to Her Highness.

508
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,950
Crown Princess left a while ago.

509
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,430
Really.

510
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,150
Official Xiao brought Her Majesty's message,

511
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,320
suggesting that Crown Princess is innocent.

512
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,800
Her Majesty worried Crown Princess would feel
uncomfortable staying in the palace,

513
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,800
so she ordered Official Xiao

514
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
to send her back to her residence.

515
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,600
They all saw it.

516
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,520
Take me inside.

517
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,000
Okay, okay.

518
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,430
See?

519
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,800
Now,

520
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,230
do you believe me?

521
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,630
Mo Lian Cheng.

522
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,320
Cheng Cheng.

523
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,120
Cheng Cheng.
