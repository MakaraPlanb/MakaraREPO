Episode 23

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,320
You have to be more affectionate.

18
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,559
Speak clearly.

19
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,240
Look her in the eyes.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,039
Okay.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,520
Okay.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,360
General Mo has arrived.

23
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,119
She's here.

24
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:45,399
She's here.

25
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,119
Didn't you say we were
competing in martial arts today?

26
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,279
We're doing it here?

27
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,039
Feng Yang.

28
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,000
Feng Yang.

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Actually, Yun Xiu...

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll give him a three-move advantage.

31
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:05,960
Come on.

32
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,199
Feng Yang.

33
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,839
Why are you being so cowardly?

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,399
Again.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,759
One knee.

36
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,839
Feng Yang.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,360
Will you take me as your husband?

38
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,919
You prepared so much to say,

39
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,720
why did you only say the last sentence?

40
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,759
I forgot everything once I saw Feng Yang.

41
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:53,679
Feng Yang.

42
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,720
Answer him.

43
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,919
This is just a proposal.

44
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,279
You don't have to announce it
and hold a wedding right away.

45
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,679
It's just a ritual to tell each other your feelings.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,080
I

47
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,199
do.

is what every girl fantasizes about.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,160

I'll always care for you,

68
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,839
love you,

69
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,399

love of three lifetimes.

♪For you, who is willing to turn
the world upside down♪

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,079
Your Majesty.

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,040
You're going to grant Mo Feng Yang and
Yun Xiu's wishes just like that?

83
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,959
Aren't we letting them off too easily?

84
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:05,679
Yun Xiu

85
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,079
is of the Pugu clan,

86
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,320
which is quite prestigious in Xiyue.

87
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,079
Once the Mo family gains an ally like this,

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,760
they will become more arrogant.

89
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:15,119
If Mo Yuan Long makes a move,

90
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,720
then Xiyue

91
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,160
will be implicated for sure.

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,160
This move

93
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,559
can both lead the Mo family to become restless

94
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,239
and keep Xiyue in check.

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,399
How is Mo Lian Cheng doing?

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Mo Lian Cheng

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
has recovered.

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
But I cannot figure out

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,359
why he has the ability to
rival the Soul-guarding Bead.

100
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,000
Before executing the grand scheme,

101
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,959
I need to know the answers to everything.

102
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:53,320
Princess's Residence

104
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,760
By the grace of heaven's will,
Her Majesty hereby proclaims...

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,399
Secondary Prince Consort Mo Lian Cheng
has continuously acted out of jealousy,

106
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,600
forced two main prince consorts out,

107
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,079
disregarded three cardinal guides
and five constant virtues,

108
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:03,799
and tainted the royal family's reputation.

109
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,399
He is ordered to the palace for morality training.

110
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:09,839
What?

111
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,720
Separating us again?

112
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,559
Yun Xiu and General Mo's feelings are mutual,

113
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,959
Mo Lian Cheng had nothing to do with that.

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm merely in charge of announcing the decree.

115
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,720
Didn't Her Majesty agree?

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,040
Why is she making moves after the fact?

117
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,200
I humbly accept the decree.

118
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,920
I have something to say to Prince Consort.

119
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:35,959
I will wait quietly.

120
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,279
Cheng Cheng, what do we do?

121
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,200
I think

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,600
Her Majesty must be suspicious

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,799
of what happened at Altar of Souls.

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,440
Since Her Majesty already knows

125
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,839
that you can rival the Soul-guarding Bead,

126
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,000
it means she has found out
about your unusualness.

127
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,679
If your identity gets revealed,

128
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,519
then...

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,720
Don't worry,

130
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,479
I'll act accordingly.

131
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,760
I can use this opportunity

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,719
to investigate

133
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:02,039
the other requirements,
aside from the Soul-guarding Bead,

134
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,760
we need to meet in order to go back.

135
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:05,280
You must be careful,

136
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,039
especially of that Xiao Zhen.

137
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,799
Prince Consort,

138
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,719
it's time for you to leave.

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,119
Cheng Cheng.

140
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,320
I'm leaving.

141
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:44,716
When the heart doesn't think
about the good, evil enters into it

142
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,479
I've etched what I've learned today

143
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,880
into my memory.

144
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,760
The reason I am this strict with you

145
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,520
is that you're smart and clever,

146
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,799
different from the average man.

147
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,760
Compared to others,

148
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,960
I am not different.

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,039
I just put in more time and effort

150
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,840
into studying.

151
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,080
You know

152
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,039
that I've always thought highly of you.

153
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,760
I've been missing the times

154
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,039
you came to the palace

155
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,200
to recite poetry, paint,

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
and drink with me,

157
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,520
before you got married.

158
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,119
Do you know

159
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,039
why I like having you by my side?

160
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
Forgive me,

161
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
I do not.

162
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,039
Because you

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,760
remind me a lot of the old friend
I used to mention.

164
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,280
His eyes,

165
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,280
clear and deep.

166
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,520
His nose bridge,

167
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:32,119
tall and delicate.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,599
Thin lips,

169
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,280
beautifully outlined,

170
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,799
just like

171
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,039
the gentle hills.

172
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,919
He always wore a set of white, cotton robes,

173
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,080
with a paper fan in his hand.

174
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,840
Poised,

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,679
he wandered towards me,

176
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,840
like the clouds floating above the mountains,

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,960
and

178
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,559
the flowing water during the night.

179
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,760
From Your Majesty's descriptions,

180
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,960
this gentleman

181
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,239
sounds extraordinary indeed.

182
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
He must be

183
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,119
from a family of scholars.

184
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:20,359
He is a doctor.

185
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
We met

186
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,840
while he was on his way to pick herbs.

187
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:31,889
Xuanling Continent

188
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,520
Miss. Miss.

189
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,280
The old friend Her Majesty speaks of

190
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,000
is extremely similar to Young Master Lian Cheng,

191
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,919
and she looks so much like Tan Er.

192
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,559
Could it be possible that she knows Qu Xiang Tan

193
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,719
or…?

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm tired.

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,719
Leave me.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

197
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,000
His handwriting is definitely not

198
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,679
as elegant as Young Master Lian Cheng's.

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,760
But he clearly thought of something just now.

200
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:25,799
Please, Your Majesty.

201
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,000
When the heart doesn't think about the good,

202
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,119
evil enters into it.

203
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Very good.

204
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,479
No mistakes.

205
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,320
Since

206
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,039
you already know it so well...

207
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,760
Prince Consort will be sent back tomorrow.

208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

209
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,559
Your Majesty,

210
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,520
Official Chen has a report to make

211
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,840
and is waiting in Jingyi Pavillion.

212
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,599
You may go.

213
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:13,781
Zhang
Taiwei Wall

214
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:30,864
Tianshi Wall

215
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,400
Red Star of Demise.

216
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,159
Looks like the star image

217
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,039
is related to Her Majesty's conspiracy.

218
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,159
If so,

219
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,479
us going back not only requires
the Soul-guarding Bead,

220
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:56,520
we'd also have to wait for the appearance
of Red Star of Demise.

221
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,000
Princess's Residence
Tan,

222
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,840
you've walked around for the entire day

223
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,719
and haven't bought anything.

224
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,400
Let's go back to your chambers and rest.

225
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
No.

226
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,000
I can't stay in a room without Cheng Cheng,

227
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,719
not even for a second.

228
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,239
Tan.

229
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,359
What's this?

230
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:36,831
M, A, R, R

231
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:37,359
Why

232
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,959
can't I recognize any of it?

233
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,199
Y

234
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,520
I know this one.

235
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
"Ya"?
*"Y" looks like a character which pronounces "ya"

236
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:54,834
M, E

237
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,820
Mountain?
*"M" looks like the image of a mountain

238
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,680
Cheng Cheng.

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,199
Cheng Cheng, you're back!

240
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,880
Oh my gosh.

241
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,984
♪The night was spent in yearning♪

242
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:28,208

Tan Er.

246
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,880
We have

247
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,400
already

248
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,359
gotten married three times,

249
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,839
but

250
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,680
I still owe you

251
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,920
an official proposal.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,599
Even though we've known each other for so long,

253
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,439
but when I see you,

254
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,439
my heart still pounds in my chest,

255
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,119
I still feel

256
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,079
this overwhelming happiness,

257
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,280
and I still want to

258
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,359
marry you thousands of times over.

259
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
I do.

260
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,199
I do.

261
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,479
Thousands of times,

262
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,640
I do.

263
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:18,801

♪Your most beautiful moments

272
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,880
I wanted to make it up to you

273
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,439
with this proposal.

274
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,479
I don't want you to have any regrets.

275
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,439
As expected,

276
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,199
if one falls for the right person,

277
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,040
every day is Valentine's day.

278
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,599
Cheng Cheng,

279
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,479
I want to be with you forever.

280
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm here.

281
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,239
Every hour, every minute.

282
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,520
It's always Valentine's day.

283
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,839
Tan Er.

284
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
Spending these few days in the palace,

285
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,280
I may have discovered

286
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,560
another requirement we need to meet

287
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,640
in order to go back to our original world.

288
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,079
Tell me.

289
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,280
The other day. I found an astronomy chart

290
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,040
of Red Star of Demise

291
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,959
in the royal study.

292
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,160
Perhaps

293
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,599
it has something to do with
Her Majesty's conspiracy.

294
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,680
Or

295
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,479
it has something to do with
us going back to our original world.

296
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,959
It looks like,

297
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,040
not only do we need the Soul-guarding Bead,

298
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,640
we also need to wait for

299
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,119
the Red Star of Demise.

300
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,359
Why didn't I think of it before?

301
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,640
I've lived all these lifetimes in vain.

302
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,359
We

303
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,680
need to calculate the exact date

304
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,599
of the Red Star of Demise.

305
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,479
If we miss this opportunity,

306
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,479
we may

307
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,040
never be able to return to our original world.

308
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,719
But

309
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,719
we only have

310
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,880
a fake Liu Qian Shui.

311
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,439
When you were in the palace,

312
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,439
did Her Majesty talk to you about the past?

313
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,800
No.

314
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,239
Every day,

315
00:20:46,239 --> 00:20:47,640
I'd recite

316
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,439
the moral codes for men.

317
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,640
Look at you being all scared.

318
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,880
I know you're a good boy.

319
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,880
Should I tell Tan Er

320
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,280
that Her Majesty may be related to Qu Xiang Tan?

321
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Never mind.

322
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:07,000
Before everything gets verified,

323
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,319
it's better not to let Tan Er misunderstand.

324
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,959
As expected, with my dear husband by my side,

325
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,199
I can sleep well.

326
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,880
After you recovered your memories,

327
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,599
you got taken away

328
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,079
before we got to spend time together.

329
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,560
We should really take a break.

330
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,359
Say,

331
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,920
should we go on a field trip?

332
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Or

333
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,239
go horseback riding?

334
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,479
Or

335
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,920
go shopping?

336
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,280
Didn't Tan Er say

337
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,160
that only children have to make choices,

338
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,400
adults

339
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
will do them all?

340
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:50,520
Prince Consort and Princess
are about to get up.

341
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,199
Why isn't

342
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,000
breakfast ready yet?

343
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,040
Wait,

344
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,400
why are only you three working?

345
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,160
They...

346
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,760
they're still sleeping.

347
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,560
Still sleeping?

348
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,239
Wake all of them up.

349
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,599
Go to the kitchens and prepare breakfast.

350
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:05,560
There is no food left in the kitchens.

351
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,160
The servants who are in charge of groceries

352
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,479
haven't gone grocery shopping in a while.

353
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:10,319
What? Seriously?

354
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,719
Do you have a death wish?

355
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,959
- Let's go take a look.
- It's not all their fault.

356
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,280
Aunty Zhang, the treasurer,

357
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,680
went back to her hometown,

358
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,520
so no one was there to give them money,

359
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,959
and of course, the shopping stopped.

360
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,439
How can this happen?

361
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,160
Princess.

362
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,319
Leave us.

363
00:22:27,959 --> 00:22:28,800
Yes, Your Highness.

364
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
Yu Hao,

365
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,079
what is happening?

366
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,479
Before, Eldest Young Master

367
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
took care of all the housekeeping affairs.

368
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,479
After Young Master left,

369
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,680
the house was left unattended.

370
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:41,760
The servants

371
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,839
have become a little lazy.

372
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,599
When Eldest Brother was here,

373
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,680
it was him

374
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,199
who took care of all this.

375
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,479
What do we do now?

376
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
We can't just leave everything in a mess.

377
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,199
You are the head of the household,

378
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,760
so it should be you...

379
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,800
Don't look at me.

380
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,040
I can't do it.

381
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,599
Don't look at me either,

382
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,359
I don't...

383
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,239
I

384
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:08,880
don't know much about the house affairs,

385
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,599
so I don't think I can be in charge.

386
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,560
Your Highness.

387
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Your Highness.

388
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,040
I've finally found you.

389
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,119
Early this morning, Her Majesty sent all these

390
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:21,479
Memorial
and said that starting today,

391
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,959
Your Highness will start reviewing memorials

392
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,079
and assist Her Majesty in governmental affairs.

393
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,160
Memorial
Memorial?

394
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,319
It seems Her Majesty wants to

395
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,839
train you to govern the country.

396
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,920
As per traditions,

397
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,599
you're about to be made Crown Princess.

398
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,640
Her Majesty must have ulterior motives.

399
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:54,680
When it rains, it pours.

400
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,199
The affairs in our residence are a mess

401
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,400
and now I have to deal with this.

402
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,439
Looking at these

403
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:06,719
is like looking at all the college
entrance examination materials.

404
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:09,680
All my nightmares are coming back to me.

405
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,479
What are you laughing at?

406
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,160
Being happy about other people's misfortunes?

407
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:19,920
When did I laugh?

408
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,439
Back in the days,

409
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,160
wasn't I the one taking care of
all these trivial matters?

410
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,359
Reviewing memorials

411
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
is just a daily task, very easy.

412
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,800
You can take care of it easily,

413
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,839
but I was born dumb

414
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,680
and I have to worry about these trivial matters?

415
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,599
When did I say these are easy?

416
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,239
I just know how bothersome

417
00:24:38,239 --> 00:24:40,160
dealing with governmental affairs is.

418
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,160
It's a lot of trouble, and definitely not easy.

419
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,599
But

420
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,239
seeing how smart you are,

421
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,719
you'll be able to get a hold of it soon enough.

422
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,479
That's better.

423
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,880
Now we can't go on a trip,

424
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,280
go horseback riding,

425
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:55,839
let alone go shopping.

426
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,319
Since

427
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,199
you have nothing to do,

428
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,560
how about you take care

429
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,000
of all the house affairs?

430
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,479
How can I?

431
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,959
Mo Yan Chen can take care of the affairs

432
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,280
and have everything running smoothly,

433
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,640
why can't you?

434
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,239
We are different people.

435
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,319
We have different strengths.

436
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,079
I can learn to deal with governmental affairs,

437
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,560
why can't you learn
to take care of house affairs?

438
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,959
When you were emperor,

439
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,719
you had a proper excuse not to.

440
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,880
Now that

441
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,520
you don't have to do anything,

442
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,439
how can you still avoid it?

443
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,560
I'm not doing it.

444
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:51,504

You just deal with governmental affairs,

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,880
I'll take care

447
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,359
of the household affairs.

448
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,599
That's better.

449
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,520
My chicken.

450
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Young Master, are you alright?

451
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,000
Where is my chicken?

452
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,560
Where did my chicken go?

453
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,599
What's wrong with you?

454
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

455
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Young Master.

456
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,599
My bad, my bad.

457
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,439
Young Master, are you alright?

458
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,839
Young Master,

459
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,839
today, we have to buy

460
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,439
10 kilograms of radish,

461
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,199
25 kilograms of brown rice,

462
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,119
four kilograms of beef,

463
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,199
120 kilograms of green beans,

464
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,880
and...

465
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:06,079
Isn't this beef?

466
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,119
Slaughtered on site.

467
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,079
This is pork.

468
00:27:09,719 --> 00:27:10,719
They're easy to differentiate.

469
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,040
Beef is redder in colour.

470
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,640
Then we'll buy pork.

471
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,319
I am from Yu County.

472
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,040
Just became

473
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
a Jinshi.
*The highest degree in the imperial examination

474
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,160
A spare

475
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,160
Xingren.
*A governmental official position

476
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,680
My first post

477
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,239
was out of the county.

478
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,719
I was then posted to

479
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,160
host the imperial examinations
in Pei Prefecture.

480
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,119
Having "Mercedes-Benz" for four years.
*It's "working away from home", she misunderstood

481
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,959
"Mercedes-Benz"?

482
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:00,805
Mercedes-Benz

483
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,000
Young Master,

484
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,599
these are the items

485
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,920
Ledger
we still have to buy today.

486
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,520
Eight more to go.

487
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,199
We need this many

488
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,560
daily necessities.

489
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:22,719
Let's keep going.

490
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,760
Young Master,

491
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,160
the money sachet is empty,
we don't have any more money.

492
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,319
Didn't I tell you to bring a fair amount?

493
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,239
How did it run out so quickly?

494
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,520
Young Master, I did bring enough.

495
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,199
I brought enough money.

496
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,520
But you

497
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,640
didn't ask for the price,

498
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,640
you didn't haggle either,

499
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
and you let them keep the change,

500
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,119
and then, that was all.

501
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,800
Who knew there was

502
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,199
so much to know about buying things?

503
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,520
"Working away from home for four years".

504
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,839
Hey.

505
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,599
Wake up.

506
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,920
I did my homework,

507
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,839
I really forgot to bring it this time.

508
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,560
You scared me.

509
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,359
It's you?

510
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,599
I had a dream about my high school math teacher.

511
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Scared me to death.

512
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,439
How was it going today?

513
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,599
Just reviewing memorials,

514
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,439
easy.

515
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,319
I've done the majority.

516
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,760
"Having 'Mercedes-Benz' for four years

517
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,719
is not proper.

518
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,199
The luxurious lifestyle

519
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,479
of households

520
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,959
should not be encouraged."

521
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,119
What is all that?

522
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,280
Give it back.

523
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,680
Give it back.

524
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,359
I heard that you

525
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,640
went grocery shopping yourself.

526
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,319
How did it feel running the house
for the first time?

527
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,760
It's no big deal.

528
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,319
Of course it went well.

529
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
Then what is this?

530
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,599
I think

531
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,000
it was a mess,

532
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,160
a huge mess, wasn't it?

533
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,160
You...

534
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:39,160
We're not done talking about the memorial.

535
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,280
If you submit

536
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:42,239
these memorials to Her Majesty,

537
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:44,160
things will go wrong.

538
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,359
You're looking down on me.

539
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,319
Then you do it.

540
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,199
How can I...

541
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,920
We can give it a try.

542
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,599
But you have to help me

543
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,119
with the house affairs.

544
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,920
How can you negotiate with me?

545
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,640
Fine, house affairs.

546
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,439
But

547
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,640
there are more women than men in this residence.

548
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,119
If all guards have to

549
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,839
deal with housekeeping affairs...

550
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,319
Since our work has been reversed,

551
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,520
then according

552
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,439
to the superiority principles,

553
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,839
every man and woman in the residence

554
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,280
must have their work reversed.

555
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,199
Regarding household affairs,

556
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,800
you need not discuss them with me,

557
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,119
you can make the decisions by yourself.

558
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,280
Okay.

559
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,520
It's settled, then.

560
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,199
Starting today,

561
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,439
the Princess's Residence is about to
push a major reform.

562
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:53,920
Could it be

563
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:56,239
a residence-wide salary raise?

564
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,160
Some people must be getting dismissed.

565
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,239
Quiet.

566
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,520
I haven't announced anything yet,

567
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,319
why do you have so much to say?

568
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,199
You talk too much.

569
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,479
Starting today,

570
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,319
all the men and women in the residence
will have their work reversed.

571
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:27,280
The women who were in charge of keeping guard

572
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,800
will now

573
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:29,880
do laundry,

574
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,760
cook,

575
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,680
sew,

576
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,959
clean, and etc.

577
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,239
The men who were originally
in charge of the work mentioned

578
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,760
will now be

579
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,120
guards,

580
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,000
drivers, etc.,

581
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,000
taking over for the women.

582
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,639
This...

583
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,639
Wouldn't it be a huge mess?

584
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:48,239
We've

585
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,199
never worked in the kitchens before.

586
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,520
Exactly.

587
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
And if other people find out,

588
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,560
it will be so embarrassing.

589
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,040
Right.

590
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,639
Those who do not do as they're told

591
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,719
will lose a month's salary.

592
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,120
You'll be dismissed.

593
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,479
You'll be dismissed.

594
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,919
You'll be dismissed.

595
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,000
Make way.

596
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,760
So weak.

597
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,120
Don't add so much water.

598
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,239
Add more flour.

599
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,439
Do I look cool?

600
00:34:43,479 --> 00:34:44,919
Yes.

601
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:51,639
That's enough.

602
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:58,360
I've been a guard for so many years.

603
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,800
I can definitely

604
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,000
conquer

605
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
this little dough ball.

606
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,959
Tan.

607
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,040
What happened to you?

608
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:19,360
Kneading dough made you resentful?

609
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,800
It's not me,

610
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,439
it's the female guards.

611
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:24,120
They really can't

612
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,959
work in the kitchens.

613
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,239
But I heard someone was quite into it.

614
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Anyway,

615
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,600
different people have different ambitions.

616
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,760
I think

617
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,719
it's better if you let the female guards

618
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,120
play with swords and sabers.

619
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
And those male servants,

620
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,239
they keep hurting themselves

621
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,479
practicing swordsmanship every day.

622
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,800
They're a real mess.

623
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,239
Alright.

624
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,199
I got it.

625
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,919
Leave work for today.

626
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:50,000
Okay.

627
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,159
It looks like

628
00:35:56,879 --> 00:35:59,120
making all the men and women switch

629
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,959
doesn't work.

630
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,879
To achieve gender equality,

631
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,600
one-size fits all

632
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,800
isn't realistic.

633
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,080
What should we do?

634
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,199
You finished this much

635
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,000
in one day?

636
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,959
This is only half.

637
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,120
He's in his element,

638
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,399
going back to what he did before.

639
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,000
Good work

640
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,040
today,

641
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:43,800
work harder tomorrow.

642
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,399
By the way,

643
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:47,719
how is

644
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
your reform going?

645
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,239
Quite effective,

646
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
of course.

647
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,639
Everything is in perfect order.

648
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,800
Princess.

649
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:58,360
Princess.

650
00:36:58,919 --> 00:36:59,479
Do you have a minute?

651
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,000
The backyard...

652
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,679
Wait.

653
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:01,800
Wait.

654
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:02,840
Wait.

655
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,600
Princess, do you have a minute?

656
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,439
Out.

657
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,520
So, no.

658
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:17,000
This is the "in perfect order"

659
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,719
you were talking about?

660
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,800
Weren't you in the study the entire day?

661
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:26,199
Why did you come here?

662
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,600
I need to understand your work.

663
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,000
This way, I can help you.

664
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:31,320
You're just here to laugh at me.

665
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,159
Letting men and women switch their job

666
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,320
is indeed

667
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,120
a groundbreaking initiative,

668
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,159
but we ignored

669
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,439
one issue.

670
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,159
What issue?

671
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:45,959
Is the division of labour

672
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,840
really based on gender?

673
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,199
No fundamental difference is made

674
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,959
just by having the men and women switch.

675
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,679
A meaningful reform

676
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,679
should be appointing people
on their merit, not gender.

677
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,199
This is the true meaning

678
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:58,040
of gender equality.

679
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,239
Her Majesty is asking Qu Tan Er to review memorials

680
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,560
and assist her in governmental affairs.

681
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,959
What from I've heard,

682
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,479
she's just reviewing memorials.

683
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,719
I don't think that Her Majesty gave her actual power.

684
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,120
Your Highness is
the Commander of the Capital Guards.

685
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:39,919
You needn't be scared of Qu Tan Er.

686
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,679
It's difficult to fathom Her Majesty's thoughts.

687
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,959
Her Majesty has never shown

688
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,320
who she favours out of the both of us.

689
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,919
You are Eldest Princess,

690
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,719
and with Princess Consort and
the Mo family as your ally,

691
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,439
of course you have the upper hand.

692
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,800
Before Crown Princess is announced,

693
00:38:59,959 --> 00:39:01,560
we must not show any weakness.

694
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:06,719
If Your Highness is willing to listen,

695
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,760
I have a plan.

696
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,600
Speak.

697
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,879
Princess's Residence

698
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:22,239
Starting today, each person
needs to submit a report on

699
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,159
their skills, hobbies, and things they're good at.

700
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,639
After a comprehensive assessment,

701
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:29,360
you will be reassigned.

702
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,879
You get to take half the credit

703
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,679
for the residence being so orderly today.

704
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,679
Sure enough, someone who has been the emperor

705
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:52,800
thinks about things

706
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,520
critically and efficiently.

707
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,560
It's you

708
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,199
who thought of the starting point,

709
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:58,239
so the credit

710
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,439
is all yours.

711
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:00,679
Then,

712
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
should I help you

713
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:04,399
with the governmental affairs after I get back?

714
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
You don't have to wait till you go back,

715
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
the rest of the memorials

716
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,840
are all yours.

717
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,199
I'm talking about the kind

718
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,600
that involves being in a high position,

719
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,719
looking down on all the officials,

720
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,520
and commenting on state affairs.

721
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
You

722
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,080
don't want to help me with work at all,

723
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,840
you just want my power and prestige.

724
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,760
Now I am Princess,

725
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,360
do I need to take away your power and prestige?

726
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:26,719
Since

727
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,000
it's not proper to participate in politics,

728
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,120
you're allowed

729
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:30,360
to take care of our child then.

730
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:31,080
Allowed?

731
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,320
Didn't you tell me

732
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,439
that it's what I should do

733
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,479
as a father?

734
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:38,280
Why do you have all these ready?

735
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,080
Just tell me,

736
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,879
will you take care of him or not?

737
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,439
This...

738
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:47,600
Of course I will.

739
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:49,520
But

740
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,959
one isn't enough.

741
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,919
Who gave you the nerve

742
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,520
to write down such treacherous things?
