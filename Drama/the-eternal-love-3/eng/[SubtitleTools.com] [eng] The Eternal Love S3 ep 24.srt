<i>Episode 24</i>

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,580
How dare you!

18
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,220
How dare you disrespect me with such words!

19
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:21,514
<i>Her Majesty's Grace</i>

20
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,539
My loyalty to Your Majesty and Dongyue

21
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,619
will never waver.

22
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:35,139
I would never write anything
to humiliate Your Majesty.

23
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,139
You still refuse to admit your crime.

24
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,820
Official Chen.

25
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,059
Yes.

26
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,020
Read it for her.

27
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,419
She should know what she has written.

28
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,380
Yes.

29
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,460
The people must follow and they
must stay ignorant.

30
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,699
The nation should be clouded by folly.

31
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,500
There should only be a handful
who are knowledgeable.

32
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:05,979
<i>There is no way</i>

33
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,059
<i>Cheng Cheng would write such a thing.</i>

34
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,179
Based on Her Highness's opinion,

35
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,139
the people must follow

36
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:13,339
whatever path the government set for them,

37
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:15,779
yet they should not know the reason.

38
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,100
Her Highness even hopes that

39
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:18,860
the nation is full of fools

40
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:20,580
and the scholars should dwindle in number.

41
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,460
Better virtues, finances, and
knowledge for the people.

42
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:28,179
Such is the motto

43
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:29,380
Her Majesty rules Dongyue with.

44
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,619
Her Highness

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,220
disobeyed the imperial order

46
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,940
and encouraged policies
that would instill folly.

47
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,220
That's not true.

48
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
<i>There shouldn't be any errors or issues
with the files I marked.</i>

49
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,660
<i>Should Her Majesty ask,</i>

50
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:45,779
<i>follow the text and interpret it
the simplest way.</i>

51
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,100
Such words

52
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,820
did come from me.

53
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,539
But Official Chen took it wrongly.

54
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:07,820
May I have the permission

55
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,059
to use the brush?

56
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,380
Official Chen.

57
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,579
The black dots

58
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,019
are where the sentences pause.

59
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:51,260
Please

60
00:04:51,299 --> 00:04:52,739
read it again.

61
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,459
Should the people be able,

62
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,579
we should allow them freedom.

63
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,660
Should the people not be able,

64
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:02,700
we should show them guidance.

65
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,619
May this nation be cleansed of foolishness,

66
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,459
may scholars and erudite fill every household.

67
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,019
What I meant was,

68
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:16,500
if the people

69
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,700
have wisdom and knowledge,

70
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,339
so we should allow them freedom.

71
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,100
For those without such qualities,

72
00:05:21,179 --> 00:05:23,459
we should guide them.

73
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,980
I hope that Dongyue

74
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,820
is a country free of foolishness.

75
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,619
May scholars and erudite

76
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,779
be a common sight.

77
00:05:32,059 --> 00:05:32,820
So

78
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:35,380
this is what Her Highness meant.

79
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:38,260
The dots make things much more straightforward.

80
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,660
The dots I used

81
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,859
are called punctuation.

82
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,059
There are many forms

83
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,700
and functions.

84
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,100
Today,

85
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,299
I simply showed one of them.

86
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,380
When you write,

87
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,859
you should be cautious with wording.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,500
Ambiguity should be avoided.

89
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,820
Not all people who read

90
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,100
are smart to interpret the meaning

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,660
as you just did.

92
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:02,019
Your Majesty is right.

93
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,179
Normal articles

94
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,940
do not have any marking to indicate the pauses.

95
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,220
Should the military files have any ambiguity,

96
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,660
the consequences can be severe.

97
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,339
Your Highness should employ cautions

98
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,179
while writing.

99
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:13,859
Yes.

100
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,260
I will keep Your Majesty's lesson in mind.

101
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,019
Your Majesty.

102
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,140
I am quite interested

103
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,100
in those markings Her Highness showed us.

104
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:24,579
If

105
00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:25,899
some symbols are capable of

106
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,779
pointing out the correct structures
of sentences,

107
00:06:27,899 --> 00:06:28,500
it would

108
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:31,019
help to prevent misinterpretations.

109
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,179
Its risk will be greatly reduced.

110
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,420
May I suggest

111
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,579
for Her Highness

112
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,779
to implement this marking system

113
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,940
for our civil officials?

114
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,140
I object.

115
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,700
These markings make the pages look congested.

116
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,380
Furthermore,

117
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,779
the problem with ambiguity

118
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:52,579
can be avoided by using better wording.

119
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,779
Ambiguity

120
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,220
is usually noticeable only by the readers.

121
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,739
The person who writes

122
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:01,220
might never notice it.

123
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,339
These markings are simple and clear.

124
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,700
Official Chen,

125
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,459
you should learn to accept

126
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,779
new things in life.

127
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:10,540
Official Sun's suggestion

128
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,260
seems viable.

129
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:17,459
Starting tomorrow,

130
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:19,260
Princess Tan Er

131
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,179
will teach all the civil officials
the usage of these symbols.

132
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
We shall observe its effectiveness
in the palace.

133
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,260
Whether it should be used widely in the nation,

134
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,459
the result of this trial will decide it.

135
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,459
Yes.

136
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:32,779
I accept the order.

137
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,660
I always write with vigilance.

138
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:38,420
This line

139
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,779
was clearly added by someone

140
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,859
who copied my handwriting.

141
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,579
The memorials

142
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,739
will be sent

143
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,940
to Her Majesty every morning

144
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,899
by someone

145
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,859
working for the palace.

146
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:50,579
Someone must have intercepted it.

147
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,660
Such scheme...

148
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,980
There is no doubt about it.

149
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,940
This must be the doing of Qu Mei Er.

150
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,019
Just ignore her.

151
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,619
You should be ready for tomorrow's work.

152
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:03,859
<i>Jingyi Pavilion</i>

153
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:05,100
Punctuation

154
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,339
is used

155
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:07,420
in writing

156
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,220
to indicate sentence structures
and intonations.

157
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,380
Normally, when we read,

158
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,660
we interpret the sentences

159
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,260
with our feelings and particles.

160
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,019
By that, I mean,

161
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,220
using "Zhi Hu Zhe Ye"
<i>*Four grammatical particles of Classical Chinese</i>

162
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,500
to break the sentences.

163
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:25,980
But doing so

164
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:27,899
often causes ambiguity.

165
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,099
That will lead to misinterpretation
of an article.

166
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,260
The exclamation mark

167
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,460
is often used

168
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,739
to indicate strong feelings.

169
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,419
For example,

170
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,780
"They are cutting my pay for the
next year as punishment!"

171
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,219
The sentence...

172
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,419
must end with

173
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,700
the exclamation mark.

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,820
The question mark,

175
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:51,619
as its name implies,

176
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:53,820
is used at the end of a question.

177
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:54,619
For example,

178
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,419
"What?"

179
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,940
"Why are you cutting my pay for the
next year as punishment?"

180
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,580
The sentence must end

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,020
with a question mark.

182
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:05,460
The ellipsis

183
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,940
is sometimes used to impliy
there are many examples.

184
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:08,739
Sometimes,

185
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,460
it's used to indicate continuous
pausing of a sentence

186
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,260
or to express frustrations.

187
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,340
For example,

188
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,140
"Come on..."

189
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,020
"They cut my pay for a whole year again..."

190
00:09:20,179 --> 00:09:21,179
At the end

191
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:22,739
of these two sentences,

192
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,299
we must use

193
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,700
the ellipsis.

194
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,659
Is that clear now?

195
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,340
Well said.

196
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,739
Your work was too sloppy.

197
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,619
You ended up benefiting Qu Tan Er.

198
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,659
She only invented the shift work

199
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,219
and punctuation systems.

200
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,979
Official Sun used this achievement

201
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,140
to recommend Qu Tan Er as the heir apparent.

202
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:45,700
It was my mistake.

203
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,179
But there are rumors in the palace about
Her Majesty's health deteriorating.

204
00:09:49,219 --> 00:09:49,820
The air

205
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,299
in the court is stifled with unease.

206
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,979
Her Majesty has been on the throne
for over a decade.

207
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,099
She has no spouse

208
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,340
or heir apparent.

209
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,340
However,

210
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,140
Her Majesty's intention isn't clear yet.

211
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,900
Your Highness still has a 50-50 chance of winning.

212
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:03,659
Official Chen.

213
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,260
You and your colleagues

214
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,539
are always cautious and discreet.

215
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,979
I'm glad to see that.

216
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,419
But desperate times

217
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,580
call for actual actions.

218
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,179
If Qu Tan Er became the next Crown Princess,

219
00:10:16,299 --> 00:10:18,219
you would be the first to face her wrath.

220
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,260
Yes.

221
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,059
I have no intention to be the heir apparent.

222
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:23,979
I don't have any ambition.

223
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,260
I just want to enjoy love.

224
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,739
I just want to be with you every day of my life.

225
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,299
Of course you have your ambition.

226
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:33,739
Your achievements since you became a princess

227
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:36,020
had already outmatched mine of the same time.

228
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,580
I can only fool around.

229
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:42,979
If I was to be given real responsibility,

230
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,299
there would be no way

231
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,539
I could ever handle it.

232
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,539
Not only that.

233
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,619
Having more power

234
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:49,900
also means

235
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,460
you have more resources

236
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,179
to protect those you love.

237
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,059
Not to mention

238
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,340
the secret of the Soul-guarding Bead,

239
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,619
Soul-parting Flute,

240
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,020
and the Red Star of Demise

241
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,380
are still in the empress's hands.

242
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,340
We cannot give up on any opportunity

243
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,020
to get a step closer to them.

244
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,659
But

245
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,580
Her Majesty never made any stance.

246
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:11,340
Only my fan Official Sun

247
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,820
is rooting for me.

248
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:14,940
Don't forget.

249
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:16,820
I am your fan too.

250
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,020
Spare me your fancy words.

251
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:23,219
However,

252
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,340
Her Majesty was seriously ill

253
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,299
and used your blood

254
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,140
to unlock the Soul-guarding Bead's power

255
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,700
as a means to treat her condition.

256
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:32,739
If she falls sick again,

257
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,299
the disaster at the Altar of Souls
might repeat itself.

258
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,859
In that case,

259
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,580
it's likely she will appoint a crown princess.

260
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,340
And the perfect candidate

261
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,859
will be you.

262
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,260
But...

263
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:48,700
if we want to return to the original Dongyue,

264
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:50,340
we must get close to her.

265
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,140
When we get too close to her,

266
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,260
our lives will be in danger.

267
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,820
What do we do now?

268
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,460
This matter

269
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
is beyond our capability to change anything.

270
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,340
However,

271
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,979
whatever may come to pass,

272
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,099
I will keep you safe.

273
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,900
But...

274
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:13,700
if I became Crown Princess of Dongyue,

275
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:16,059
I would have to work overtime every day.

276
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,460
I wouldn't have time to spend with you.

277
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,140
If it's a love life you want,

278
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,299
you can have it now.

279
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,739
Right.

280
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,700
Go to a place with me.

281
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,020
Where to?

282
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:38,539
You'll know when you're there.

283
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,619
I will play the song.

284
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,460
As for the flirting,

285
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,659
you're the expert.

286
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,820
I love you.

287
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,219
I love you.

288
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,979
I love you.

289
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,619
Is there any song

290
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,460
that is more mesmerizing, mystical,

291
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,299
and entrancing?

292
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,940
I do know a song.

293
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,659
It's been a while since I last played it.

294
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,380
It's been so long

295
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,380
since we had a quiet date

296
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,500
without any distractions.

297
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,619
Then make the world

298
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,059
even quieter.

299
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,820
Pretend there are

300
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,099
only the two of us in this world.

301
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,179
What did you say?

302
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:03,419
Mo Lian Cheng knows how to play
Love's Reflection.

303
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,419
This is an exclusive song in the
Xuanling Continent.

304
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,179
It was also...

305
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,179
the same song he once played for me.

306
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,940
Where is the Soul-parting Flute?

307
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:15,940
Play it for me.

308
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,460
I shall address you

309
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,580
as Young Master Mo as I did in the past.

310
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,659
What do you think?

311
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,299
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,260
Judging by Your Majesty's words,

313
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:53,179
this man

314
00:16:53,299 --> 00:16:54,700
must be extraordinary.

315
00:16:55,299 --> 00:16:56,299
He must be

316
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,460
from a family of erudite.

317
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,819
He was a healer.

318
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,900
It is him.

319
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,459
It must be him.

320
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,459
Mo Lian Cheng...

321
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,380
He really is my dear Young Master Lian Cheng!

322
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,180
He may not recognize me,

323
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,219
but I am always her Xiang Tan!

324
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,420
Do you really not remember me?

325
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:45,939
Your Majesty.

326
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:49,339
I can only wish

327
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,500
to share this pain with you.

328
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,859
With my health going downhill,

329
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,300
my power and duty are only a burden to me.

330
00:18:06,699 --> 00:18:08,459
Official Sun was right.

331
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,020
It is time for Qu Tan Er

332
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,140
to succeed me.

333
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:17,380
Your Majesty's rule is in its zenith.

334
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,699
The people of Dongyue

335
00:18:18,739 --> 00:18:20,420
still need you.

336
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,540
All I want...

337
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,859
before this body perishes...

338
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,699
is to reunite with Lian Cheng as who I was.

339
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:38,859
Your Majesty.

340
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,859
I understand

341
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,099
your endless longing

342
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,660
for Master Lian Cheng.

343
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,619
But Mo Lian Cheng might now...

344
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,780
Insolence!

345
00:18:47,699 --> 00:18:49,780
Are you calling me a fool?

346
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,339
I wouldn't dare.

347
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,819
I trust my feelings.

348
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,819
It must be him.

349
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,739
Qu Tan Er's investiture is tomorrow.

350
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,859
I lost.

351
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:46,420
Do you regret

352
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,260
marrying me?

353
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,780
There is no victor in this matter.

354
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,900
You gave me the only vacancy in your heart.

355
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,219
I will always be grateful for that.

356
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,260
Yan Chen.

357
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,739
We still have a chance.

358
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,380
I will send some assassins.

359
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:06,819
Before the investiture,

360
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,939
there is still a chance to change our fate.

361
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,140
You must not do so.

362
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,699
You couldn't watch her die.

363
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,300
Your Highness will surely be suspected.

364
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,660
Doing so

365
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,660
will ruin your future.

366
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,420
Mei Er.

367
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,300
Are you sure...

368
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,180
Her Majesty

369
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,699
is handing over the throne?

371

As decreed by Her Majesty,

372
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,979
Second Princess Qu Tan Er

373
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,859
has displayed outstanding character
and wisdom.

374
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:56,619
Hence,

375
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,540
the will of Heaven must be followed
and the people must be convinced.

376
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,260
She will be the next Crown Princess

377
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,260
and granted the East Palace.

378
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:05,939
The end.

379
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,619
It's been yet another long day.

380
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:51,020
I'm so tired.

381
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,859
If you're tired,

382
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,339
let me help you get changed.

383
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:55,619
You should rest early.

384
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,660
The East Palace,

385
00:22:58,859 --> 00:22:59,900
the title of Crown Princess,

386
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,339
I...

387
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:03,579
I couldn't even dream

388
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,459
that I would have these to my name.

389
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:07,939
I think

390
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,939
you are enjoying it.

391
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,819
You aren't a crown prince.

392
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,219
Yes.

393
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,819
I...

394
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,500
should help Crown Princess get changed
so she could rest early.

395
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,859
But the bed here

396
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,300
isn't as soft and big

397
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:24,979
as those from the Snow Court.

398
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:29,140
This is bad.

399
00:23:31,219 --> 00:23:32,459
The yard

400
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,859
is not pleasant either.

401
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:35,660
It's so empty.

402
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,819
The Snow Court looked so much better.

403
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,780
This is bad.

404
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,819
Even the incense isn't as good
as those in the Snow Court.

405
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,859
This place doesn't feel like a home.

406
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:52,219
Everything is bad!

407
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,180
This place isn't

408
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:59,380
a top-of-the-line mansion.

409
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,099
The houses I sold in the past were much better.

410
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,739
This may be private property,

411
00:24:06,939 --> 00:24:08,380
but its value is stale

412
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,380
and it doesn't provide the best experience.

413
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,140
But you still have me here.

414
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:21,459
Are you saying

415
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:22,979
I was better when I was in the Snow Court?

416
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,780
Is everything about me bad too?

417
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,459
Of course not.

418
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,859
You are the only thing

419
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,420
that is good in here.

420
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,459
So

421
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,459
you should stop getting upset.

422
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,660
As long as we are together,

423
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:36,739
any place can be our home.

424
00:24:38,219 --> 00:24:39,859
I will always be with you.

425
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,180
Don't bring that up now!

426
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,859
It gets on my nerve.

427
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,420
Tomorrow,

428
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,380
I must start learning how to mark
the memorials in the royal study.

429
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,859
You will be teaching

430
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,619
the consorts of harem how to play the zither.

431
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:54,020
Think,

432
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,380
think about it.

433
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,060
They are separating us by force.

434
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,020
Had I known sooner,

435
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,619
I wouldn't come here.

436
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,500
Now that we are in the palace,

437
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,380
there must be a reason for it.

438
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,939
Besides,

439
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,260
the sooner we find out what she wants,

440
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,900
the sooner we can be ready.

441
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:13,859
It might be a blessing for us

442
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,339
to move into the palace.

443
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,180
It might be a great chance.

444
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,780
You call this a blessing?

445
00:25:19,579 --> 00:25:21,579
Why did we even come here?

446
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:24,459
To return to our universe

447
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,339
and reunite with Yu Er.

448
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,339
Yes.

449
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:29,420
The Altar of Souls and Soul-guarding Bead

450
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:31,020
are both inside the palace.

451
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:32,979
Therefore,

452
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,500
our ticket home is also in the palace.

453
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,099
You have a point.

454
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,660
In that case,

455
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,140
we will make the best

456
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,780
of this blessing in disguise.

457
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,540
So...

458
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,380
You should go to bed now.

459
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,260
You don't want to get

460
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
sleepy while working tomorrow.

461
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,300
Aren't you going to sleep?

462
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,380
There are some matters to tend to.

463
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,819
I want to sneak out at night.

464
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,939
No, you don't want to!

465
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,380
This is our first day here.

466
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,099
How could you leave me here all by myself?

467
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:04,300
Don't forget.

468
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
What is the other thing

469
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:08,060
that we need in order to go home?

470
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,540
The Red Star of Demise?

471
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,420
Liu Bai Shui

472
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:15,579
once mentioned

473
00:26:15,979 --> 00:26:17,660
that he is an expert in astrology.

474
00:26:17,739 --> 00:26:19,660
But he is also a fraud.

475
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:22,540
Even if he was,

476
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,020
he must have come

477
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:24,819
into our life

478
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,099
for some reason.

479
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,020
It wouldn't hurt to ask him.

480
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,180
I will go with you then.

481
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,099
No.

482
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,660
You are now

483
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,260
inside the palace.

484
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,459
I can go on my own.

485
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:38,099
But if I had to take you with me,

486
00:26:38,219 --> 00:26:39,180
it would be

487
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:40,459
more than challenging.

488
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060
Fine.

489
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,380
Make sure you come back early then.

490
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:47,300
If I don't see you

491
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,939
when I wake up tomorrow,

492
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,660
I will be very upset.

493
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,099
Don't worry.

494
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,579
Make sure you come back early.

495
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,900
Why are you sighing, Senior?

496
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,339
You're the Prince Consort!

497
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:43,979
Have you come

498
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,699
at this hour

499
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,060
to acquire my help?

500
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
You once told us

501
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,060
you are a master of astrology.

502
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,660
Of course.

503
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:52,859
I may be good for nothing,

504
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,619
but when it comes to astrology,

505
00:27:54,699 --> 00:27:55,780
I'm the right guy for you.

506
00:27:55,859 --> 00:27:56,780
Let me put it this way.

507
00:27:56,859 --> 00:27:58,739
I've loved astrology since I was a kid.

508
00:27:58,939 --> 00:28:01,260
I observe the sky whether it's day or night.

509
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,180
After decades of squinting,

510
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:03,260
my eyes became smaller.

511
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:05,660
But my knowledge and skills
have become impeccable.

512
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,099
My prediction is more accurate

513
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,540
than what the Bureau of Celestial
Forecast has to show.

514
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:12,219
Just now,

515
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,859
you were observing the stars.

516
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,780
But why were you sighing?

517
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,500
The stars

518
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,020
show a bad omen.

519
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:22,979
What is it?

520
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,979
The Red Star of Demise

521
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,540
might show itself again.

522
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:28,459
When will it show up?

523
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,099
Where?

524
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,180
Prince Consort,

525
00:28:31,219 --> 00:28:32,420
why you so excited?

526
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,300
I apologize.

527
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,180
This omen is important to me.

528
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,099
It concerns

529
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,219
my chances of reuniting with my family

530
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
and my odds of

531
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,500
making the world normal again.

532
00:28:42,699 --> 00:28:43,459
Senior, I need you

533
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,140
to calculate

534
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,579
the time and location of the Red Star
of Demise's appearance.

535
00:28:50,459 --> 00:28:52,260
Don't be so formal with me.

536
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,579
Don't stand on ceremony.

537
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,579
Mother! Mother!

538
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,099
My mother!

539
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:12,140
Did you hear that?

540
00:29:12,939 --> 00:29:14,979
Someone believes me!

541
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,699
I finally have someone who believes me!

542
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:21,939
So

543
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:23,099
you agreed to help me.

544
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,540
Yes, certainly.

545
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,699
There is a saying,

546
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:28,500
"A true man can die for those
who know the worth of him."

547
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,459
Don't worry, I will do my best to help you.

548
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:31,819
Wait here, please.

549
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,140
Wait here.

550
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:34,819
Yes, it's in here!

551
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:36,979
All right.

552
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,339
Come here!

553
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,020
Prince Consort, over here.

554
00:29:53,739 --> 00:29:55,579
Sorry.

555
00:29:59,099 --> 00:29:59,780
Prince Consort.

556
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,180
I, Liu Bai Shui,

557
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,339
have many talents.

558
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,500
I thought my talents

559
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,459
would never see the light of days,

560
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,739
just like this thing.

561
00:30:10,699 --> 00:30:12,140
But today,

562
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,060
someone finally has use of me.

563
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,540
Stars in the night sky,

564
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,420
thank you!

565
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:38,859
Based on

566
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,140
the orbits of Saturn and Mars,

567
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,260
the Red Star of Demise

568
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,939
will come to pass soon enough.

569
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,780
But I can't be too sure

570
00:30:46,819 --> 00:30:47,900
about the timing.

571
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,099
It might be anywhere between

572
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,300
two weeks to two months.

573
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,540
What about the location?

574
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,900
Prince Consort, come with me.

575
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,099
Come.

576
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:04,660
Mars

577
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:06,579
invades the constellation.

578
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,619
The closest location to see it

579
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,660
would be

580
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:12,420
north of the imperial palace.

581
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:13,979
The palace?

582
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,140
Yes.

583
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,380
I can't be very precise,

584
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,699
but I am certain about the general direction.

585
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,739
What's wrong?

586
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,979
A star has fallen from the Dipper.

587
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,300
The Dipper indicates troubles in marriage

588
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:35,780
and challenges in undertakings.

589
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,420
But with a falling meteor,

590
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:39,300
I'm afraid

591
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,060
someone's life is in grave danger.

592
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Are you still awake?

593
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:42,020
I can't fall asleep without you.

594
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:44,180
Holding your clothing didn't work.

595
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,339
I felt so worried and scared.

596
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,900
What's wrong?

597
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,819
Did Liu Bai Shui tell you something?

598
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:58,060
Did something bad happen?

599
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,260
I feel so anxious.

600
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:06,619
You...

601
00:33:06,699 --> 00:33:08,260
should stop being so paranoid.

602
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,500
I have good news for you.

603
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:14,219
About two weeks from now,

604
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:14,939
we might...

605
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,060
be reunited with our son.

606
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,380
Really?

607
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,500
Are you sure you weren't fooled

608
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,900
by that old fraud's tricks?

609
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:26,619
No.

610
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,619
He really is an expert in astrology.

611
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,300
Before I went over there,

612
00:33:30,339 --> 00:33:31,579
he had already foreseen

613
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,739
that the Red Star of Demise

614
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,060
is going to appear.

615
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,819
What should we do next?

616
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:40,099
Two weeks...

617
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,020
Two weeks from now,

618
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,660
we can see Yu Er again!

619
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,140
You sound overjoyed

620
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,939
when you say your son's name.

621
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,979
Of course.

622
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,579
He holds the top spot in my heart,
right above you.

623
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:53,660
Tell me.

624
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,739
What do we need to do now?

625
00:33:57,859 --> 00:33:58,900
Calm down.

626
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,020
We must not alert the enemy.

627
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,180
We need to get our hands on
the Soul-guarding Bead

628
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,219
and the Soul-parting Flute

629
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,500
as a precaution.

630
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:07,780
One more thing.

631
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,219
Be wary of Her Majesty.

632
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,219
I have a feeling

633
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,219
this is too good to be a coincidence.

634
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,340
She has the Soul-guarding Bead,

635
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:18,379
but she also looks exactly like you.

636
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,020
I think...

637
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,060
she might be...

638
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,939
What about her?

639
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,699
It's nothing.

640
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,860
Go to sleep.

641
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,939
You need to save up your strength.

642
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,739
Then we can

643
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,939
improvise in time.

644
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,379
I'll do nothing

645
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,860
but hoping

646
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,340
to see our son sooner.

647
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:53,820
I miss him so much.

648
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,179
Prince Consort, this way, please.

649
00:35:34,459 --> 00:35:35,860
I, Mo Lian Cheng,

650
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:37,620
has been ordered by Her Majesty

651
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,780
to give a music lesson.

652
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:03,100
Before I start,

653
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:04,379
I first need to know

654
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:06,060
your proficiency with the instrument,

655
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,939
so...

656
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,939
<i>I know this melody.</i>

657
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:16,739
<i>It sounds like Love's Reflection.</i>

658
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,820
<i>The only person</i>

659
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,540
<i>who knows this song besides Tan Er
is none other than her.</i>

660
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,419
<i>It was just a few notes.</i>

661
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,459
<i>Is this a coincidence?</i>

662
00:36:47,483 --> 00:37:17,483
