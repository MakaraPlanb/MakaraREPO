<i>Episode 24</i>

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,080
How dare you!

18
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,720
How dare you disrespect me with such words!

19
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:50,014
<i>Her Majesty's Grace</i>

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,039
My loyalty to Your Majesty and Dongyue

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,119
will never waver.

22
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:03,639
I would never write anything
to humiliate Your Majesty.

23
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,639
You still refuse to admit your crime.

24
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Official Chen.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,559
Yes.

26
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,520
Read it for her.

27
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,919
She should know what she has written.

28
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,880
Yes.

29
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,960
The people must follow and they
must stay ignorant.

30
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,199
The nation should be clouded by folly.

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
There should only be a handful
who are knowledgeable.

32
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,479
<i>There is no way</i>

33
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,559
<i>Cheng Cheng would write such a thing.</i>

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,679
Based on Her Highness's opinion,

35
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:39,639
the people must follow

36
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:41,839
whatever path the government set for them,

37
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,279
yet they should not know the reason.

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,600
Her Highness even hopes that

39
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,360
the nation is full of fools

40
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,080
and the scholars should dwindle in number.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,960
Better virtues, finances, and
knowledge for the people.

42
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,679
Such is the motto

43
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,880
Her Majesty rules Dongyue with.

44
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,119
Her Highness

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,720
disobeyed the imperial order

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,440
and encouraged policies
that would instill folly.

47
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,720
That's not true.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,320
<i>There shouldn't be any errors or issues
with the files I marked.</i>

49
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,160
<i>Should Her Majesty ask,</i>

50
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,279
<i>follow the text and interpret it
the simplest way.</i>

51
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,600
Such words

52
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,320
did come from me.

53
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,039
But Official Chen took it wrongly.

54
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,320
May I have the permission

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,559
to use the brush?

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,880
Official Chen.

57
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,079
The black dots

58
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,519
are where the sentences pause.

59
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,760
Please

60
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,239
read it again.

61
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,959
Should the people be able,

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,079
we should allow them freedom.

63
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
Should the people not be able,

64
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:31,200
we should show them guidance.

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,119
May this nation be cleansed of foolishness,

66
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,959
may scholars and erudite fill every household.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,519
What I meant was,

68
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:45,000
if the people

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,200
have wisdom and knowledge,

70
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,839
so we should allow them freedom.

71
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,600
For those without such qualities,

72
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,959
we should guide them.

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,480
I hope that Dongyue

74
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,320
is a country free of foolishness.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,119
May scholars and erudite

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,279
be a common sight.

77
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,320
So

78
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,880
this is what Her Highness meant.

79
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,760
The dots make things much more straightforward.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
The dots I used

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,359
are called punctuation.

82
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,559
There are many forms

83
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
and functions.

84
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,600
Today,

85
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,799
I simply showed one of them.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,880
When you write,

87
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,359
you should be cautious with wording.

88
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Ambiguity should be avoided.

89
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,320
Not all people who read

90
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,600
are smart to interpret the meaning

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,160
as you just did.

92
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,519
Your Majesty is right.

93
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,679
Normal articles

94
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,440
do not have any marking to indicate the pauses.

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,720
Should the military files have any ambiguity,

96
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,160
the consequences can be severe.

97
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:38,839
Your Highness should employ cautions

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,679
while writing.

99
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,359
Yes.

100
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,760
I will keep Your Majesty's lesson in mind.

101
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,519
Your Majesty.

102
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,640
I am quite interested

103
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,600
in those markings Her Highness showed us.

104
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:53,079
If

105
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,399
some symbols are capable of

106
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,279
pointing out the correct structures
of sentences,

107
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,000
it would

108
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,519
help to prevent misinterpretations.

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,679
Its risk will be greatly reduced.

110
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,920
May I suggest

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,079
for Her Highness

112
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,279
to implement this marking system

113
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,440
for our civil officials?

114
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,640
I object.

115
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,200
These markings make the pages look congested.

116
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,880
Furthermore,

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,279
the problem with ambiguity

118
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,079
can be avoided by using better wording.

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,279
Ambiguity

120
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,720
is usually noticeable only by the readers.

121
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,239
The person who writes

122
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,720
might never notice it.

123
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,839
These markings are simple and clear.

124
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Official Chen,

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,959
you should learn to accept

126
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,279
new things in life.

127
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,040
Official Sun's suggestion

128
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,760
seems viable.

129
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,959
Starting tomorrow,

130
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:47,760
Princess Tan Er

131
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:50,679
will teach all the civil officials
the usage of these symbols.

132
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,200
We shall observe its effectiveness
in the palace.

133
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Whether it should be used widely in the nation,

134
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:57,959
the result of this trial will decide it.

135
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,959
Yes.

136
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,279
I accept the order.

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
I always write with vigilance.

138
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:06,920
This line

139
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,279
was clearly added by someone

140
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,359
who copied my handwriting.

141
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,079
The memorials

142
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,239
will be sent

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
to Her Majesty every morning

144
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,399
by someone

145
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,359
working for the palace.

146
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,079
Someone must have intercepted it.

147
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Such scheme...

148
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
There is no doubt about it.

149
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,440
This must be the doing of Qu Mei Er.

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,519
Just ignore her.

151
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,119
You should be ready for tomorrow's work.

152
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:32,359
<i>Jingyi Pavilion</i>

153
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,600
Punctuation

154
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:34,839
is used

155
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,920
in writing

156
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,720
to indicate sentence structures
and intonations.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,880
Normally, when we read,

158
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,160
we interpret the sentences

159
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,760
with our feelings and particles.

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,519
By that, I mean,

161
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,720
using "Zhi Hu Zhe Ye"
<i>*Four grammatical particles of Classical Chinese</i>

162
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
to break the sentences.

163
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,480
But doing so

164
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,399
often causes ambiguity.

165
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,599
That will lead to misinterpretation
of an article.

166
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,760
The exclamation mark

167
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,960
is often used

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,239
to indicate strong feelings.

169
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,919
For example,

170
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,280
"They are cutting my pay for the
next year as punishment!"

171
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,719
The sentence...

172
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:13,919
must end with

173
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,200
the exclamation mark.

174
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,320
The question mark,

175
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,119
as its name implies,

176
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,320
is used at the end of a question.

177
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:23,119
For example,

178
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:23,919
"What?"

179
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,440
"Why are you cutting my pay for the
next year as punishment?"

180
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,080
The sentence must end

181
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,520
with a question mark.

182
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,960
The ellipsis

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,440
is sometimes used to impliy
there are many examples.

184
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,239
Sometimes,

185
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,960
it's used to indicate continuous
pausing of a sentence

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,760
or to express frustrations.

187
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,840
For example,

188
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,640
"Come on..."

189
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,520
"They cut my pay for a whole year again..."

190
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:49,679
At the end

191
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,239
of these two sentences,

192
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,799
we must use

193
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,200
the ellipsis.

194
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,159
Is that clear now?

195
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
Well said.

196
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,239
Your work was too sloppy.

197
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,119
You ended up benefiting Qu Tan Er.

198
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,159
She only invented the shift work

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,719
and punctuation systems.

200
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,479
Official Sun used this achievement

201
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,640
to recommend Qu Tan Er as the heir apparent.

202
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,200
It was my mistake.

203
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,679
But there are rumors in the palace about
Her Majesty's health deteriorating.

204
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,320
The air

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,799
in the court is stifled with unease.

206
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,479
Her Majesty has been on the throne
for over a decade.

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,599
She has no spouse

208
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,840
or heir apparent.

209
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,840
However,

210
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,640
Her Majesty's intention isn't clear yet.

211
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,400
Your Highness still has a 50-50 chance of winning.

212
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,159
Official Chen.

213
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,760
You and your colleagues

214
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,039
are always cautious and discreet.

215
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,479
I'm glad to see that.

216
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,919
But desperate times

217
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,080
call for actual actions.

218
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,679
If Qu Tan Er became the next Crown Princess,

219
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,719
you would be the first to face her wrath.

220
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,760
Yes.

221
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,559
I have no intention to be the heir apparent.

222
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,479
I don't have any ambition.

223
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,760
I just want to enjoy love.

224
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:57,239
I just want to be with you every day of my life.

225
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,799
Of course you have your ambition.

226
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,239
Your achievements since you became a princess

227
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,520
had already outmatched mine of the same time.

228
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,080
I can only fool around.

229
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,479
If I was to be given real responsibility,

230
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,799
there would be no way

231
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,039
I could ever handle it.

232
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,039
Not only that.

233
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,119
Having more power

234
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,400
also means

235
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
you have more resources

236
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,679
to protect those you love.

237
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,559
Not to mention

238
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,840
the secret of the Soul-guarding Bead,

239
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,119
Soul-parting Flute,

240
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,520
and the Red Star of Demise

241
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,880
are still in the empress's hands.

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
We cannot give up on any opportunity

243
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,520
to get a step closer to them.

244
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,159
But

245
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,080
Her Majesty never made any stance.

246
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,840
Only my fan Official Sun

247
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,320
is rooting for me.

248
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,440
Don't forget.

249
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,320
I am your fan too.

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,520
Spare me your fancy words.

251
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,719
However,

252
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,840
Her Majesty was seriously ill

253
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,799
and used your blood

254
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,640
to unlock the Soul-guarding Bead's power

255
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,200
as a means to treat her condition.

256
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:01,239
If she falls sick again,

257
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,799
the disaster at the Altar of Souls
might repeat itself.

258
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,359
In that case,

259
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,080
it's likely she will appoint a crown princess.

260
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,840
And the perfect candidate

261
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,359
will be you.

262
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,760
But...

263
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,200
if we want to return to the original Dongyue,

264
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:18,840
we must get close to her.

265
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,640
When we get too close to her,

266
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,760
our lives will be in danger.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,320
What do we do now?

268
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,960
This matter

269
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
is beyond our capability to change anything.

270
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,840
However,

271
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,479
whatever may come to pass,

272
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,599
I will keep you safe.

273
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,400
But...

274
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,200
if I became Crown Princess of Dongyue,

275
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,559
I would have to work overtime every day.

276
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,960
I wouldn't have time to spend with you.

277
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,640
If it's a love life you want,

278
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,799
you can have it now.

279
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,239
Right.

280
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,200
Go to a place with me.

281
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,520
Where to?

282
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,039
You'll know when you're there.

283
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,119
I will play the song.

284
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,960
As for the flirting,

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,159
you're the expert.

286
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,320
I love you.

287
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,719
I love you.

288
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,479
I love you.

289
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,119
Is there any song

290
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,960
that is more mesmerizing, mystical,

291
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,799
and entrancing?

292
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,440
I do know a song.

293
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,159
It's been a while since I last played it.

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,880
It's been so long

295
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,880
since we had a quiet date

296
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,000
without any distractions.

297
00:13:59,119 --> 00:14:00,119
Then make the world

298
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,559
even quieter.

299
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Pretend there are

300
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,599
only the two of us in this world.

301
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,679
What did you say?

302
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,919
Mo Lian Cheng knows how to play
Love's Reflection.

303
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,919
This is an exclusive song in the
Xuanling Continent.

304
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,679
It was also...

305
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,679
the same song he once played for me.

306
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Where is the Soul-parting Flute?

307
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,440
Play it for me.

308
00:16:11,359 --> 00:16:12,960
I shall address you

309
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,080
as Young Master Mo as I did in the past.

310
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,159
What do you think?

311
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,799
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
Judging by Your Majesty's words,

313
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,679
this man

314
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,200
must be extraordinary.

315
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,799
He must be

316
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
from a family of erudite.

317
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,319
He was a healer.

318
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,400
It is him.

319
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
It must be him.

320
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,959
Mo Lian Cheng...

321
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
He really is my dear Young Master Lian Cheng!

322
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,680
He may not recognize me,

323
00:16:57,239 --> 00:16:59,719
but I am always her Xiang Tan!

324
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
Do you really not remember me?

325
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,439
Your Majesty.

326
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,839
I can only wish

327
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,000
to share this pain with you.

328
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,359
With my health going downhill,

329
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,800
my power and duty are only a burden to me.

330
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,959
Official Sun was right.

331
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,520
It is time for Qu Tan Er

332
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,640
to succeed me.

333
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,880
Your Majesty's rule is in its zenith.

334
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,199
The people of Dongyue

335
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,920
still need you.

336
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,040
All I want...

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,359
before this body perishes...

338
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,199
is to reunite with Lian Cheng as who I was.

339
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,359
Your Majesty.

340
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,359
I understand

341
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,599
your endless longing

342
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,160
for Master Lian Cheng.

343
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,119
But Mo Lian Cheng might now...

344
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,280
Insolence!

345
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:18,280
Are you calling me a fool?

346
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,839
I wouldn't dare.

347
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,319
I trust my feelings.

348
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,319
It must be him.

349
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:05,239
Qu Tan Er's investiture is tomorrow.

350
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,359
I lost.

351
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,920
Do you regret

352
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,760
marrying me?

353
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:21,280
There is no victor in this matter.

354
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,400
You gave me the only vacancy in your heart.

355
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,719
I will always be grateful for that.

356
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,760
Yan Chen.

357
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,239
We still have a chance.

358
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,880
I will send some assassins.

359
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:35,319
Before the investiture,

360
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,439
there is still a chance to change our fate.

361
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,640
You must not do so.

362
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,199
You couldn't watch her die.

363
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,800
Your Highness will surely be suspected.

364
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,160
Doing so

365
00:19:54,199 --> 00:19:56,160
will ruin your future.

366
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,920
Mei Er.

367
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,800
Are you sure...

368
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
Her Majesty

369
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,199
is handing over the throne?

371

As decreed by Her Majesty,

372
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,479
Second Princess Qu Tan Er

373
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,359
has displayed outstanding character
and wisdom.

374
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,119
Hence,

375
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,040
the will of Heaven must be followed
and the people must be convinced.

376
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,760
She will be the next Crown Princess

377
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,760
and granted the East Palace.

378
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,439
The end.

379
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,119
It's been yet another long day.

380
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm so tired.

381
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,359
If you're tired,

382
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,839
let me help you get changed.

383
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,119
You should rest early.

384
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,160
The East Palace,

385
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,400
the title of Crown Princess,

386
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,839
I...

387
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,079
I couldn't even dream

388
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,959
that I would have these to my name.

389
00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:36,439
I think

390
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,439
you are enjoying it.

391
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,319
You aren't a crown prince.

392
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,719
Yes.

393
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,319
I...

394
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:46,000
should help Crown Princess get changed
so she could rest early.

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,359
But the bed here

396
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,800
isn't as soft and big

397
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,479
as those from the Snow Court.

398
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,640
This is bad.

399
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,959
The yard

400
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,359
is not pleasant either.

401
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,160
It's so empty.

402
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,319
The Snow Court looked so much better.

403
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,280
This is bad.

404
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,319
Even the incense isn't as good
as those in the Snow Court.

405
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,359
This place doesn't feel like a home.

406
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:20,719
Everything is bad!

407
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,680
This place isn't

408
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,880
a top-of-the-line mansion.

409
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,599
The houses I sold in the past were much better.

410
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,239
This may be private property,

411
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:36,880
but its value is stale

412
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,880
and it doesn't provide the best experience.

413
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,640
But you still have me here.

414
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:49,959
Are you saying

415
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,479
I was better when I was in the Snow Court?

416
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,280
Is everything about me bad too?

417
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,959
Of course not.

418
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,359
You are the only thing

419
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
that is good in here.

420
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,959
So

421
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:01,959
you should stop getting upset.

422
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,160
As long as we are together,

423
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,239
any place can be our home.

424
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,359
I will always be with you.

425
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't bring that up now!

426
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,359
It gets on my nerve.

427
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Tomorrow,

428
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:16,880
I must start learning how to mark
the memorials in the royal study.

429
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,359
You will be teaching

430
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:21,119
the consorts of harem how to play the zither.

431
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,520
Think,

432
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,880
think about it.

433
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
They are separating us by force.

434
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,520
Had I known sooner,

435
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,119
I wouldn't come here.

436
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,000
Now that we are in the palace,

437
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,880
there must be a reason for it.

438
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,439
Besides,

439
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,760
the sooner we find out what she wants,

440
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,400
the sooner we can be ready.

441
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,359
It might be a blessing for us

442
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,839
to move into the palace.

443
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,680
It might be a great chance.

444
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,280
You call this a blessing?

445
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,079
Why did we even come here?

446
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:52,959
To return to our universe

447
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,839
and reunite with Yu Er.

448
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,839
Yes.

449
00:24:55,959 --> 00:24:57,920
The Altar of Souls and Soul-guarding Bead

450
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,520
are both inside the palace.

451
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:01,479
Therefore,

452
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:03,000
our ticket home is also in the palace.

453
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,599
You have a point.

454
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,160
In that case,

455
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,640
we will make the best

456
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,280
of this blessing in disguise.

457
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,040
So...

458
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
You should go to bed now.

459
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,760
You don't want to get

460
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
sleepy while working tomorrow.

461
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,800
Aren't you going to sleep?

462
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,880
There are some matters to tend to.

463
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,319
I want to sneak out at night.

464
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,439
No, you don't want to!

465
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,880
This is our first day here.

466
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,599
How could you leave me here all by myself?

467
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:32,800
Don't forget.

468
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
What is the other thing

469
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,560
that we need in order to go home?

470
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,040
The Red Star of Demise?

471
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:42,920
Liu Bai Shui

472
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,079
once mentioned

473
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:46,160
that he is an expert in astrology.

474
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,160
But he is also a fraud.

475
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:51,040
Even if he was,

476
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,520
he must have come

477
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,319
into our life

478
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,599
for some reason.

479
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,520
It wouldn't hurt to ask him.

480
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,680
I will go with you then.

481
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,599
No.

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,160
You are now

483
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:03,760
inside the palace.

484
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,959
I can go on my own.

485
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:06,599
But if I had to take you with me,

486
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,680
it would be

487
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,959
more than challenging.

488
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
Fine.

489
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,880
Make sure you come back early then.

490
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,800
If I don't see you

491
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,439
when I wake up tomorrow,

492
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,160
I will be very upset.

493
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,599
Don't worry.

494
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,079
Make sure you come back early.

495
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,400
Why are you sighing, Senior?

496
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,839
You're the Prince Consort!

497
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,479
Have you come

498
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,199
at this hour

499
00:27:14,239 --> 00:27:15,560
to acquire my help?

500
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
You once told us

501
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,560
you are a master of astrology.

502
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
Of course.

503
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,359
I may be good for nothing,

504
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,119
but when it comes to astrology,

505
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,280
I'm the right guy for you.

506
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,280
Let me put it this way.

507
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,239
I've loved astrology since I was a kid.

508
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,760
I observe the sky whether it's day or night.

509
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,680
After decades of squinting,

510
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:31,760
my eyes became smaller.

511
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,160
But my knowledge and skills
have become impeccable.

512
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,599
My prediction is more accurate

513
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,040
than what the Bureau of Celestial
Forecast has to show.

514
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,719
Just now,

515
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,359
you were observing the stars.

516
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,280
But why were you sighing?

517
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,000
The stars

518
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,520
show a bad omen.

519
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,479
What is it?

520
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,479
The Red Star of Demise

521
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,040
might show itself again.

522
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:56,959
When will it show up?

523
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,599
Where?

524
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,680
Prince Consort,

525
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,920
why you so excited?

526
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,800
I apologize.

527
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,680
This omen is important to me.

528
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,599
It concerns

529
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,719
my chances of reuniting with my family

530
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and my odds of

531
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,000
making the world normal again.

532
00:28:11,199 --> 00:28:11,959
Senior, I need you

533
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,640
to calculate

534
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,079
the time and location of the Red Star
of Demise's appearance.

535
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:20,760
Don't be so formal with me.

536
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,079
Don't stand on ceremony.

537
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,079
Mother! Mother!

538
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,599
My mother!

539
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,640
Did you hear that?

540
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:43,479
Someone believes me!

541
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:47,199
I finally have someone who believes me!

542
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,439
So

543
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,599
you agreed to help me.

544
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,040
Yes, certainly.

545
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,199
There is a saying,

546
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,000
"A true man can die for those
who know the worth of him."

547
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,959
Don't worry, I will do my best to help you.

548
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,319
Wait here, please.

549
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,640
Wait here.

550
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:03,319
Yes, it's in here!

551
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,479
All right.

552
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,839
Come here!

553
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,520
Prince Consort, over here.

554
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:24,079
Sorry.

555
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,280
Prince Consort.

556
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,680
I, Liu Bai Shui,

557
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,839
have many talents.

558
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,000
I thought my talents

559
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,959
would never see the light of days,

560
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,239
just like this thing.

561
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,640
But today,

562
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
someone finally has use of me.

563
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,040
Stars in the night sky,

564
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,920
thank you!

565
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,359
Based on

566
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,640
the orbits of Saturn and Mars,

567
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,760
the Red Star of Demise

568
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,439
will come to pass soon enough.

569
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,280
But I can't be too sure

570
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,400
about the timing.

571
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,599
It might be anywhere between

572
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,800
two weeks to two months.

573
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,040
What about the location?

574
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,400
Prince Consort, come with me.

575
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,599
Come.

576
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,160
Mars

577
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:35,079
invades the constellation.

578
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,119
The closest location to see it

579
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,160
would be

580
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,920
north of the imperial palace.

581
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,479
The palace?

582
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,640
Yes.

583
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
I can't be very precise,

584
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,199
but I am certain about the general direction.

585
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,239
What's wrong?

586
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,479
A star has fallen from the Dipper.

587
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,800
The Dipper indicates troubles in marriage

588
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,280
and challenges in undertakings.

589
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,920
But with a falling meteor,

590
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,800
I'm afraid

591
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,560
someone's life is in grave danger.

592
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Are you still awake?

593
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:10,520
I can't fall asleep without you.

594
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,680
Holding your clothing didn't work.

595
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,839
I felt so worried and scared.

596
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,400
What's wrong?

597
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,319
Did Liu Bai Shui tell you something?

598
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,560
Did something bad happen?

599
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,760
I feel so anxious.

600
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,119
You...

601
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,760
should stop being so paranoid.

602
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,000
I have good news for you.

603
00:32:41,439 --> 00:32:42,719
About two weeks from now,

604
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,439
we might...

605
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,560
be reunited with our son.

606
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,880
Really?

607
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,000
Are you sure you weren't fooled

608
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,400
by that old fraud's tricks?

609
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,119
No.

610
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,119
He really is an expert in astrology.

611
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,800
Before I went over there,

612
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,079
he had already foreseen

613
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:01,239
that the Red Star of Demise

614
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,560
is going to appear.

615
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,319
What should we do next?

616
00:33:07,439 --> 00:33:08,599
Two weeks...

617
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,520
Two weeks from now,

618
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
we can see Yu Er again!

619
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:13,640
You sound overjoyed

620
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,439
when you say your son's name.

621
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,479
Of course.

622
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,079
He holds the top spot in my heart,
right above you.

623
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,160
Tell me.

624
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,239
What do we need to do now?

625
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,400
Calm down.

626
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,520
We must not alert the enemy.

627
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,680
We need to get our hands on
the Soul-guarding Bead

628
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:32,719
and the Soul-parting Flute

629
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,000
as a precaution.

630
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,280
One more thing.

631
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,719
Be wary of Her Majesty.

632
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,719
I have a feeling

633
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,719
this is too good to be a coincidence.

634
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,840
She has the Soul-guarding Bead,

635
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,879
but she also looks exactly like you.

636
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,520
I think...

637
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,560
she might be...

638
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,439
What about her?

639
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,199
It's nothing.

640
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,360
Go to sleep.

641
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,439
You need to save up your strength.

642
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,239
Then we can

643
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,439
improvise in time.

644
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,879
I'll do nothing

645
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,360
but hoping

646
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,840
to see our son sooner.

647
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:22,320
I miss him so much.

648
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,679
Prince Consort, this way, please.

649
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,360
I, Mo Lian Cheng,

650
00:35:04,439 --> 00:35:06,120
has been ordered by Her Majesty

651
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,280
to give a music lesson.

652
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,600
Before I start,

653
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,879
I first need to know

654
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,560
your proficiency with the instrument,

655
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,439
so...

656
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,439
<i>I know this melody.</i>

657
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:45,239
<i>It sounds like Love's Reflection.</i>

658
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,320
<i>The only person</i>

659
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,040
<i>who knows this song besides Tan Er
is none other than her.</i>

660
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,919
<i>It was just a few notes.</i>

661
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,959
<i>Is this a coincidence?</i>

662
00:36:15,983 --> 00:36:45,983
