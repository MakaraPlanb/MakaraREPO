16
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,220
<i>Episode 26</i>

17
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,279
Why are you here?

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,600
We are worried about you two.

19
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,399
There are several vacancies for the position

20
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,479
of commandant.

21
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,600
I was ordered to come here

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,479
and handpick candidates
from the imperial guards.

23
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,880
I dropped by to visit you.

24
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,639
I'm surprised that you,

25
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,559
the strict and impartial General Mo,

26
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,279
can also be slacking off for your personal affair.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,119
She wanted to be strict and impartial.

28
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,080
But she couldn't help it

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,160
because I never stopped talking about you two.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,360
Since everyone is here,

31
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,320
we should have a gathering.

32
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,559
We should have a hearty drink together!

33
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,520
- Sure.
- Great.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,479
Jing Xin, Yu Hao.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,880
Prepare some snacks

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,600
and bottles of fine wine.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,679
- Yes.
- Yes.

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:10,759
Sit down.

39
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,479
Okay. Let's go.

40
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,119
Cheers.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,240
Come.

42
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,800
Today...

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,320
I have an announcement to make.

44
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,800
It's a secret only my closest friend

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,479
and family members know.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,759
What is it?

47
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,520
The truth is,

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,880
I came from another Dongyue.

49
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:57,839
Over there,

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,559
my name was Qu Xiao Tan, not Qu Tan Er.

51
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,279
Tan Er was another person, not me.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,240
She had passed away.

53
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
It's only me now.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,559
Is that true?

55
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,440
So this was why you seemed like
a different person after you fell ill.

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,399
You even started to treat me differently.

57
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,880
You became much friendlier.

58
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,720
So this was the reason.

59
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,679
What about the original Eighth Brother?

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,160
The original Eighth Brother...

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,559
might have passed away while he was sick.

62
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,160
Fourteenth, are you mad at me?

63
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,079
Whenever it is,

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,040
you've always treated me well.

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Without you,

66
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,959
I would have lost my Eighth Brother

67
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,440
and never know the joy you brought me.

68
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,760
I had this feeling long ago

69
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:37,040
that you were different from before.

70
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,959
I had my guesses.

71
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,720
But I couldn't believe it.

72
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,119
If...

73
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,760
both you and Princess were here,
that would be great.

74
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,519
I could protect both of you.

75
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,040
Jing Xin.

76
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Sorry.

77
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,320
I should have told you long ago.

78
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:16,239
I know you and Tan Er shared a deep bond.

79
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,600
I know you wouldn't be mad at me.

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,600
But I still feel sorry about it.

81
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
You may not believe it,

82
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,000
I actually met Qu Tan Er in the past.

83
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
She was a nice person.

84
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,079
We were good friends.

85
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,519
She even saved my life.

86
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:51,880
All right.

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,320
Don't be too upset.

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,239
In my heart,

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,880
you are just as important as the original Princess.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,600
I will always be with you and protect you.

91
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,679
All right.

92
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,959
All right.

93
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,679
Don't cry.

94
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,959
Don't forget,

95
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,760
you are a cold-hearted guard.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,239
All right.

97
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,799
Why is everyone crying?

98
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,440
I don't really understand

99
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
all the stories you told us.

100
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,880
But one thing is certain.

101
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
You are all good people.

102
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,760
You are all my friends.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,239
That's all that matters.

104
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:45,760
He's right.

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,160
The whole story was baffling,

106
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,200
but you have my gratitude nonetheless

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,040
for being honest with us.

108
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:58,440
We will return to our world someday,

109
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:03,880
but I'm grateful that we met.

110
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,079
Since we will part ways sooner or later,

111
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,040
why not drink to our hearts' content?

112
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,480
Cheers.

113
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,480
Cheers.

114
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,160
Cheers!

115
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:25,679
Official Xiao, couldn't you visit us aboveboard
through the front door?

116
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,039
Why must you break into East Palace at night?

117
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,799
Young Master Lian Cheng, you are
as fearsome as the rumors say.

118
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,719
Now that you captured me,

119
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,080
my life is yours.

120
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,799
I wouldn't dare execute you.

121
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:44,200
We both know why you are here.

122
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,799
Send this message to Her Majesty.

123
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,880
I will fulfill my end of the promise.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,159
I will protect what is precious to me.

125
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,359
Are you going to let me go?

126
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,559
This might be your only chance

127
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,239
to get rid of me for good in a righteous way.

128
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,080
You saved her life once.

129
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,159
You have an honorable heart.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,719
I've never thought about taking your life.

131
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,000
He was Mo Yi Feng's right-hand man.

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,559
His skills in strategies and martial arts
are undoubtedly outstanding.

133
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,960
I got careless.

134
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,640
But there is a matter

135
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,359
that might be beneficial to Your Majesty.

136
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,799
What is it?

137
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,320
According to our agent
working in Mo Family's Troops,

138
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,320
several commandants are retiring.

139
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,719
This was supposed to be normal.

140
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,280
But as a precaution,

141
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,880
I sent my men to investigate the lead.

142
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,200
According to our agent's letter,

143
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,080
those retired commandants

144
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,159
showed up in the border garrison.

145
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,119
They all had their names changed.

146
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,599
Mo Yuan Long...

147
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,840
Mo Feng Yang shall be stationed
at the border indefinitely.

148
00:10:22,479 --> 00:10:23,200
Yes.

149
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,475
<i>Mo Residence</i>

150
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,000
Father.

151
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:44,919
Feng Yang.

152
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,799
The yin imperial token has been retrieved.

153
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
You will soon be stationed at the border.

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Her Majesty is stripping you
of power and banishing you

155
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,000
as a warning for me.

156
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
I must discuss with you our plan

157
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,719
to get the imperial token back.

158
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,400
Father, why are you doing this?

159
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,919
Defending the border is my duty.

160
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,919
I'm willing to join the campaign.

161
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,880
Do you think you've got this far

162
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
on your own capability?

163
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,960
When our Mo family needs you the most,

164
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,520
you have no right to turn us down!

165
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,520
What is Mo family you speak of?

166
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,440
Is it the Mo family that needs me?

167
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,159
Or is it you that wants my help?

168
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,000
It's the Mo family!

169
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,119
Feng Yang.

170
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,159
You are the only daughter of our Mo family.

171
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Your future is also the future of the Mo family.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,039
My future is at the frontier,

173
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:39,039
on the battlefield, and on my steed.

174
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,159
My future will not be part of your scheme.

175
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,359
So you know everything.

176
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,919
I couldn't believe what you've done.

177
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't want to believe it either.

178
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,039
That's because in my heart,

179
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,640
you are still the man who teaches me virtues

180
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,840
and value of bravery.

181
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,799
Indeed, Feng Yang.

182
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,799
I put all my hope in you.

183
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,559
I value your strength the most.

184
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,880
Do not become the one

185
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,719
who disappoints me the most.

186
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,080
Do you not care

187
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,919
about your children's happiness?

188
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,599
Eldest Brother, Eighth Brother,

189
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,799
and I share the same fate.

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,880
Fourteenth has a kind heart,

191
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,679
yet you think nothing of him.

192
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,719
You've even shown him more berating than love.

193
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,119
Everyone has let you down.

194
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,320
But you have disappointed us too!

195
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840
Stop it!

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,880
You...

197
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,400
Have you forgotten

198
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,960
your mother's last wish for caring all the people?

199
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:51,719
I have never forgotten it.

200
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,039
I will never forget it.

201
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,960
Father.

202
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,599
Take care.

203
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:10,039
You...

204
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,919
Her Majesty demoted me
to the rank of commandant.

205
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,719
I will set out on a campaign three days from now on.

206
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,280
I will follow you to the edge of the world.

207
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,799
We might never come home.

208
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,760
I don't care.

209
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,159
Are you upset that I made the decision

210
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,479
to bring you into war again?

211
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I was already tired of this boring place.

212
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:51,440
The frontier may be a harsh land,
but at least we'll be free there.

213
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,400
Not to mention...

214
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,840
I had longed to fight by your side.

215
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,479
Jing Xuan, behave.

216
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,159
Don't make our father mad.

217
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,400
You must stop fooling around.

218
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,039
Otherwise, Jing Xin might
choose another man over you.

219
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,080
Don't worry.

220
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,239
I will keep Fourteenth Young Master safe.

221
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,080
All right.

222
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:49,760
Is this a confession or a farewell?

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,679
Feng Yang, I know you're a fearsome warrior.

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,000
But the blades can cut anyone.

225
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,000
You must be careful while you're there.

226
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:01,239
After all, you have someone to look after.

227
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,919
Don't worry.

228
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,880
I will never let my man live in fear.

229
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,440
Look at yourself.

230
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,479
You are acting tough again.

231
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,440
How is it wrong to let him live with ease of mind?

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,840
Not at all. Love me with all you can.

233
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,239
What matters is for us to stay happy.

234
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,960
Ignore what she said.

235
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,159
Ungrateful.

236
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,919
I shouldn't have given you
the repudiation paper.

237
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,080
I should have made you suffer
a life of loneliness in your room.

238
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,719
All right, it's time to leave.

239
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,640

the main force's departure.

Do you need me to cut off the loose ends?

00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,959
Mo Feng Yang is from the Mo family

294
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,400

296
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,119
that she is much stronger and resilient
than the worthless and fawning fools

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,280
on the court.

00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:03,199
Now that she's gone,

299
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,800
she must have had a falling-out with Mo Yuan Long.

300
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,280
She has no power in the army
and no politician to root for her.

301
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,760
We could spare her life.

302
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,119
For once, she can be herself again.

303
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,359

00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:38,079

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,599
Is that all?

323
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,719
I've made my stance
as Prince Consort of Crown Princess

324
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:51,599
very clear.

325
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,959
But I have yet to speak to you, Qu Xiang Tan,
as Lian Cheng.

326
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,040
Xiang Tan. It's time to let go.

327
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,199
I had told you when we first met

328
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,359
that you could end my life after you recovered,

329
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,239
so we are now even.

330
00:21:09,479 --> 00:21:10,760
It's time to realize that.

Don't you remember that?

334
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,319
Why must you let this pain haunt you even now?

335
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,719
Qu Tan Er is the cause.

336
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,400
Who exactly is she?

337
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,760

You only love her because she looks like me!

341
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,439
You will see that truth!

342
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,119
I've told you everything.

343
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,160
If I let you down,

344
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,359
you could seek revenge on me.

345
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,680
But please don't harm others.

346
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:50,719
I hope our former bond

347
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,800
wouldn't be ruined by what we've become.

348
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,959
Your Majesty must take care.

349
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,400
You've been agitated too many times,

350
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,920
if you don't restrain your emotions...

351
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,479
your body won't be able to take the toll.

352

My body

353
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,839

It's time to give it up.

355
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,119

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,599
you will always love her.

359
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,680
So be it!

360
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,719
Why has Her Majesty summoned me to the palace?

361
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,800
Your Highness, I do not know.

362
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,599

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,359
Try it out.

369
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,959
These are your favorite osmanthus
cakes from your childhood.

370
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,160
Thanks, Your Majesty.

371
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,199
It does remind me of my childhood.

372
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,160
It's been too long since I last tried this.

373
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,280
It was your favorite.

374
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,479
But Tan Er hated it.

375
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,760
But she always pretended to like it

376
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,479
just to cheer me up.

377
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,959
Indeed. My sister had been sensible
since her childhood.

378
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,680
But somehow,

379
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,239
she seemed to have taken
a liking to different things.

380
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:27,520
<i>Even Her Majesty has noticed it.</i>

381
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,319
<i>This is a perfect chance.</i>

382
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,199
I thought it was strange too.

383
00:24:31,479 --> 00:24:33,920
Crown Princess has become
much carefree than she was.

384
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,000
She had multiple attempts
to realize gender equality.

385
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,920
She behaved as if she was a different person.

386
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,880
Her handwriting is an even more bizarre story.

387
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,040
Not to mention...

388
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,880
I shouldn't disrespect Her Highness.

389
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,400
I deserve punishment.

390
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,239
Never mind. Carry on.

391
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,280
I've heard rumors from servants
working in Her Highness's residence

392
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,479
that Her Highness had been acting
like a different person.

393
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,839
She couldn't remember anything from the past.

394
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,839
Is that true?

395
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,040
I would never lie to Your Majesty.

396
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
This is certainly weird.

397
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:14,680
It concerns the royal bloodline.

398
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,359
We must never draw conclusions
without hard evidence.

399
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,680
I appreciate your concerns.

400
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,640
As you know,

401
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,239
I have always been impartial in treating you two.

402
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,520
But compared to Qu Tan Er,

403
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,959
you and I have more things in common.

404
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,680
As Eldest Princess, you have great duties.

405
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,959
I will do anything within my capability
to aide Your Majesty

406
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,359
and cleanse Dongyue of any evil.

407
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:53,920
Dismiss.

408
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,439
I take my leave now.

409
00:26:05,594 --> 00:26:08,218
<i>Memorial</i>

410
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,959
Your Majesty, I doubt it
that Eldest Princess could get this done.

411
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,239
She is proud and competitive since young.

412
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:18,040
She is never tired of her
competition with Qu Tan Er.

413
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:20,920
She will make the best of this opportunity.

414
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
How long will it take?

415
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,359
There was an anomaly with the Soul-guarding Bead.

416
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:31,839
I have subdued with by force.

417
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,040
But as precautions,

418
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,560
I need two more days for my preparation.

419
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,319
Tan, you should stop swinging it.

420
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,880
We've only finished building it just now.

421
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I think it's not very stable.

422
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,560
I could reinforce the structure a little.

423
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,920
No.

424
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:55,439
This is the swing of love.

425
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,800
Only we can build it.

426
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,239
Isn't that right, Cheng Cheng?

427
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,640
I think I built this on my own.

428
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,319
The Royal Officer requests for an audience.

429
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,640
How may I assist you?

430
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,680
Her Majesty summoned Your Highness
to the royal study for a discussion.

431
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,319
What is it?

432
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,000
I do not know, Your Highness.

433
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,359
It's all right, Cheng Cheng.

434
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
It's the first time

435
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,959
we've seen this kind of behavior.

436
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,000
After all, I am Crown Princess.

437
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:48,160
Don't worry about it.

438
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:49,920
Be cautious.

439
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:55,000
Make sure to finish the swing before I come back.

440
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,100
<i>Yong</i>
<i>*Forever</i>

441
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,119
Your Majesty.

442
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,319
I must confront the woman next to me

443
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,319
for impersonating my sister Qu Tan Er,

444
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:27,599
sullying the royal bloodline
and the treason against the throne.

445
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,479
She attempted to usurp the title of Crown Princess

446
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,040
to seize control over Dongyue.

447
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,239
I fear that my real sister

448
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,119
has met her demise.

449
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,119
Please be our judge, Your Majesty.

450
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,800
My sister deserved justice.

451
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,199
Mei Er.

452
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,560
Do you know what the punishment
for slander against Crown Princess is?

453
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,239
Your Majesty, she is framing me.

454
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,719
She is clearly jealous of my title,

455
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,280
so she decided to tarnish my name.

456
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,760
My sister used to have fair handwriting.

457
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,479
But this woman has inferior handwriting.

458
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
According to the servants
in Second Princess's Residence,

459
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,719
my sister used to master all forms of art.

460
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,560
This woman is nothing compared to her.

461
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,079
This woman prefers spicy food

462
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:11,079
and wears brilliant colors,
all while behaving abnormally.

463
00:29:11,439 --> 00:29:13,359
The differences between her
and my sister are apparent.

464
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:16,640
I do not believe in her stories of amnesia.

465
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,199
They are clearly two different people.

466
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,439
I hope Your Majesty brings her to justice.

467
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,439
What is your counterargument?

468
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,199
Your Majesty, my handwriting changed

469
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:36,680
because of the side-effect after I drowned.

470
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,680
My hands became too weak.

471
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,319
As for the statements from her eyewitnesses,

472
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,119
she could have bought them off easily.

473
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:46,119
Not to mention asking me to prove

474
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,839
my own identity

475
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,920
is illogical at best.

476
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,680
Eldest Princess,

477
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,959
how can you prove you're not an impostor?

478
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,199
I have always acted the same way.

479
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,400
Unlike you, you've changed so much.

480
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,079
Your Majesty. After the accident,

481
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,839
I had issues with my memories.

482
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,000
After my close encounter with death,

483
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,040
I decided to change my way of living.

484
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,920
I didn't want anyone to pick on me.

485
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,880
My changes in behavior

486
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,079
were caused by the accident.

487
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,560
If Your Majesty wishes to investigate,

488
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,719
we could start by investigating
why I fell into the water.

489
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,400
Do not shift the topic.

490
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,000
There is no connection between
your identity and the accident.

491
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
It could be you who murdered her

492
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:51,160
and took her place.

493
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Your Majesty, my poor sister
deserved to have justice.

494
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,800
I am Qu Tan Er!

495
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,160
Nothing will change that fact.

496
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,000
Your Majesty, look at my cute face,

497
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,119
my slim figure,

498
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,199
this is who I am!

499
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,119
Mei Er's doubts

500
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,400
raised some questions for me.

501
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,040
But Tan Er's statements are logical.

502
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,199
Princess's identity is a serious matter.

503
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,599
Mei Er.

504
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,439
I leave the investigation to you.

505
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,280
Qu Tan Er shall be imprisoned for the time being.

506
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,920
She may retain her title
as the heir apparent in East Palace.

507
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,439
We shall take further action
after we've known the truth.

508
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:54,800
Your Majesty.

509
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,680
Wise judgment, Your Majesty.
I will carry out the order.

510
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,479
Guards.

511
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,959
Take Second Princess to the prison.

512
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,920
Cheng Cheng!

513
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,880
What happened?

514
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,400
She is an impostor.

515
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,839
She will wait for her hearing in prison.

516
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,760
Wait.

517
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,880
This must be a setup.

518
00:33:09,439 --> 00:33:11,280
Are you going to disobey Her Majesty's order?

519
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,359
Cheng Cheng, don't worry.

520
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,119
Whatever the case is,

521
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,239
I still retain my title as Crown Princess.

522
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,920
As my lesson to become the next Empress,

523
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,520
I should experience the harshness of life.

524
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,599
Don't worry. I won't be gone for long.

525
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,319
Tan Er, wait for me.

526
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,000
Let's go.

527
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,159
Snobs.

528
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,679
The watery rice isn't that bad.

529
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,800
It would be great with some pickles

530
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,800
and chili sauce.

531
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,959
Her Majesty arrives!

532
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

533
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:21,879
I can't believe

534
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,040
you have the appetite to eat even at such a place.

535
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,000
Your Majesty, I knew

536
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:28,399
this was part of your plan.

537
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,159
Your Majesty is wise,
so there must be a reason to this.

538
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,040
The meal is decent.

539
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,280
The cell provides shelter from the wind and rain.

540
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,560
I'm not dying either.

541
00:36:37,959 --> 00:36:39,479
Why shouldn't I be happy?

542
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,600
You are a lot smarter than Qu Tan Er.

543
00:36:44,439 --> 00:36:48,199
But there is one thing that still baffles me.

544
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,239
Who exactly are you?

545
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,000
What is your connection with Mo Lian Cheng?

546
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,959
Why have you come here?

547
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:02,040
What I am about to tell
Your Majesty is the entire truth.

548
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,959
As for how much is understandable,

549
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,560
that's out of my reach.

550
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,399
I came from the Kingdom of Dongyue
founded by Mo Yi Feng.

551
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:12,560
That is a parallel universe.

552
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,080
I was the reincarnation
of Qu Xiang Tan in that world.

553
00:37:16,399 --> 00:37:17,560
In other words,

554
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,560
I am also Qu Xiang Tan.

555
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,159
Absurd!

556
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,159
I am Qu Xiang Tan. I am the ruler of Dongyue!

557
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,879
I knew you wouldn't understand.

558
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,320
In any case, Cheng Cheng and I
came from the same place.

559
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:33,959
He has been my Cheng Cheng in every lifetime.

560
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:35,159
He has nothing to do

561
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,560
with your precious Young Master Lian Cheng.

562
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:39,639
You can only dream

563
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,959
of having the bond Lian Cheng and I share.

564
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,560
Even if Mo Lian Cheng was your lover,

565
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,040
he would be wise to ditch
such a lousy ex-girlfriend like you.

566
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,919
Do you not fear for your life?

567
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,479
Your Majesty, it's almost time.

568
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,120
Stay calm.

569
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,080
Behave while you're here

570
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,159
unless you wish to bring harm to Mo Lian Cheng!

571
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,080
You wouldn't have the heart to do that.

572
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,520
If I can't have him for myself,

573
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,159
I wouldn't mind ending him.

574
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,199
Cheng Cheng is smarter.

575
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,239
I couldn't get any information from her.

576
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:43,399
Why is she trapping me in here?

577
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,840
What did he mean by "it was almost time"?

578
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,080
Your Highness confronted
Qu Tan Er for being an impostor.

579
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,560
But where is the evidence?

580
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:14,000
Did she not present any argument?

581
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,679
Why is she already sent to prison?

582
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,600
Is the evidence even true?

583
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,239
Yan Chen. You doubt me.

584
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,000
Do you not care about my feelings?

585
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,159
How will you explain everything that is going on?

586
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,000
She is an impostor.

587
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,679
The woman you love is long gone.

588
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,959
How can I believe you
if you don't have any solid evidence?

589
00:39:30,959 --> 00:39:32,760
Her changes in behavior

590
00:39:32,959 --> 00:39:35,199
and the eyewitnesses in her residence
are the evidence you need.

591
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,080
I had already known

592
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:43,879
about how she behaved differently.

593
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:45,879
It's an after-effect of her accident.

594
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,560
She once told me

595
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,760
if I wished to find out what happened to her,

596
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,320
I would have to investigate
the place where she almost drowned.

597
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:54,560
Your Highness.

598
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,560
Do you know anything about the accident?

599
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,520
How should I know?

600
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,479
In that case,

601
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:11,320
I must find the answers myself.

602
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,679
Your Highness, if Prince Consort found out...

603
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,239
Do not bring this up again!
