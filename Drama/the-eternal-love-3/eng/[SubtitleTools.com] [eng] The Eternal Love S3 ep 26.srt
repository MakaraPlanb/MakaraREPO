16
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,720
<i>Episode 26</i>

17
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:09,779
Why are you here?

18
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,100
We are worried about you two.

19
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,899
There are several vacancies for the position

20
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:14,979
of commandant.

21
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,100
I was ordered to come here

22
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,979
and handpick candidates
from the imperial guards.

23
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:19,380
I dropped by to visit you.

24
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,139
I'm surprised that you,

25
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,059
the strict and impartial General Mo,

26
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,779
can also be slacking off for your personal affair.

27
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,619
She wanted to be strict and impartial.

28
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:26,580
But she couldn't help it

29
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,660
because I never stopped talking about you two.

30
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,860
Since everyone is here,

31
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,820
we should have a gathering.

32
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,059
We should have a hearty drink together!

33
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,020
- Sure.
- Great.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,979
Jing Xin, Yu Hao.

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,380
Prepare some snacks

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,100
and bottles of fine wine.

37
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,179
- Yes.
- Yes.

38
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:42,259
Sit down.

39
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:42,979
Okay. Let's go.

40
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:48,619
Cheers.

41
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,740
Come.

42
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,300
Today...

43
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,820
I have an announcement to make.

44
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:13,300
It's a secret only my closest friend

45
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,979
and family members know.

46
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,259
What is it?

47
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,020
The truth is,

48
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,380
I came from another Dongyue.

49
00:03:28,179 --> 00:03:29,339
Over there,

50
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,059
my name was Qu Xiao Tan, not Qu Tan Er.

51
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,779
Tan Er was another person, not me.

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,740
She had passed away.

53
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,660
It's only me now.

54
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,059
Is that true?

55
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,940
So this was why you seemed like
a different person after you fell ill.

56
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,899
You even started to treat me differently.

57
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,380
You became much friendlier.

58
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,220
So this was the reason.

59
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:28,179
What about the original Eighth Brother?

60
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,660
The original Eighth Brother...

61
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,059
might have passed away while he was sick.

62
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,660
Fourteenth, are you mad at me?

63
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:47,579
Whenever it is,

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,540
you've always treated me well.

65
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,100
Without you,

66
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,459
I would have lost my Eighth Brother

67
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,940
and never know the joy you brought me.

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,260
I had this feeling long ago

69
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:08,540
that you were different from before.

70
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,459
I had my guesses.

71
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,220
But I couldn't believe it.

72
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,619
If...

73
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,260
both you and Princess were here,
that would be great.

74
00:05:28,739 --> 00:05:31,019
I could protect both of you.

75
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:35,540
Jing Xin.

76
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Sorry.

77
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:41,820
I should have told you long ago.

78
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,739
I know you and Tan Er shared a deep bond.

79
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:51,100
I know you wouldn't be mad at me.

80
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,100
But I still feel sorry about it.

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
You may not believe it,

82
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,500
I actually met Qu Tan Er in the past.

83
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,940
She was a nice person.

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,579
We were good friends.

85
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:15,019
She even saved my life.

86
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:23,380
All right.

87
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,820
Don't be too upset.

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,739
In my heart,

89
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,380
you are just as important as the original Princess.

90
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,100
I will always be with you and protect you.

91
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,179
All right.

92
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,459
All right.

93
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:52,179
Don't cry.

94
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,459
Don't forget,

95
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,260
you are a cold-hearted guard.

96
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,739
All right.

97
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:04,299
Why is everyone crying?

98
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,940
I don't really understand

99
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,260
all the stories you told us.

100
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:10,380
But one thing is certain.

101
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,380
You are all good people.

102
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,260
You are all my friends.

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,739
That's all that matters.

104
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,260
He's right.

105
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,660
The whole story was baffling,

106
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,700
but you have my gratitude nonetheless

107
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,540
for being honest with us.

108
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,940
We will return to our world someday,

109
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:35,380
but I'm grateful that we met.

110
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,579
Since we will part ways sooner or later,

111
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,540
why not drink to our hearts' content?

112
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:41,980
Cheers.

113
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,980
Cheers.

114
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,660
Cheers!

115
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:57,179
Official Xiao, couldn't you visit us aboveboard
through the front door?

116
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,539
Why must you break into East Palace at night?

117
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,299
Young Master Lian Cheng, you are
as fearsome as the rumors say.

118
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:04,219
Now that you captured me,

119
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,580
my life is yours.

120
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,299
I wouldn't dare execute you.

121
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,700
We both know why you are here.

122
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,299
Send this message to Her Majesty.

123
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,380
I will fulfill my end of the promise.

124
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,659
I will protect what is precious to me.

125
00:09:29,619 --> 00:09:30,859
Are you going to let me go?

126
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,059
This might be your only chance

127
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,739
to get rid of me for good in a righteous way.

128
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:41,580
You saved her life once.

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,659
You have an honorable heart.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,219
I've never thought about taking your life.

131
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,500
He was Mo Yi Feng's right-hand man.

132
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,059
His skills in strategies and martial arts
are undoubtedly outstanding.

133
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,460
I got careless.

134
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,140
But there is a matter

135
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,859
that might be beneficial to Your Majesty.

136
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:22,299
What is it?

137
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,820
According to our agent
working in Mo Family's Troops,

138
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,820
several commandants are retiring.

139
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:29,219
This was supposed to be normal.

140
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,780
But as a precaution,

141
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,380
I sent my men to investigate the lead.

142
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,700
According to our agent's letter,

143
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,580
those retired commandants

144
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,659
showed up in the border garrison.

145
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:42,619
They all had their names changed.

146
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:44,099
Mo Yuan Long...

147
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,340
Mo Feng Yang shall be stationed
at the border indefinitely.

148
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:54,700
Yes.

149
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,975
<i>Mo Residence</i>

150
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,500
Father.

151
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:16,419
Feng Yang.

152
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,299
The yin imperial token has been retrieved.

153
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
You will soon be stationed at the border.

154
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,940
Her Majesty is stripping you
of power and banishing you

155
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,500
as a warning for me.

156
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,340
I must discuss with you our plan

157
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,219
to get the imperial token back.

158
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,900
Father, why are you doing this?

159
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,419
Defending the border is my duty.

160
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,419
I'm willing to join the campaign.

161
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:44,380
Do you think you've got this far

162
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,020
on your own capability?

163
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,460
When our Mo family needs you the most,

164
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,020
you have no right to turn us down!

165
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,020
What is Mo family you speak of?

166
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,940
Is it the Mo family that needs me?

167
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,659
Or is it you that wants my help?

168
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:57,500
It's the Mo family!

169
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,619
Feng Yang.

170
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,659
You are the only daughter of our Mo family.

171
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,140
Your future is also the future of the Mo family.

172
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,539
My future is at the frontier,

173
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,539
on the battlefield, and on my steed.

174
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,659
My future will not be part of your scheme.

175
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,859
So you know everything.

176
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,419
I couldn't believe what you've done.

177
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,500
I didn't want to believe it either.

178
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,539
That's because in my heart,

179
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:38,140
you are still the man who teaches me virtues

180
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,340
and value of bravery.

181
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:45,299
Indeed, Feng Yang.

182
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:49,299
I put all my hope in you.

183
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:51,059
I value your strength the most.

184
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,380
Do not become the one

185
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,219
who disappoints me the most.

186
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,580
Do you not care

187
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,419
about your children's happiness?

188
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:02,099
Eldest Brother, Eighth Brother,

189
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:03,299
and I share the same fate.

190
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,380
Fourteenth has a kind heart,

191
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,179
yet you think nothing of him.

192
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,219
You've even shown him more berating than love.

193
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,619
Everyone has let you down.

194
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,820
But you have disappointed us too!

195
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,340
Stop it!

196
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,380
You...

197
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,900
Have you forgotten

198
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,460
your mother's last wish for caring all the people?

199
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,219
I have never forgotten it.

200
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,539
I will never forget it.

201
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:31,460
Father.

202
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:37,099
Take care.

203
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:41,539
You...

204
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,419
Her Majesty demoted me
to the rank of commandant.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,219
I will set out on a campaign three days from now on.

206
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,780
I will follow you to the edge of the world.

207
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,299
We might never come home.

208
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,260
I don't care.

209
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,659
Are you upset that I made the decision

210
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,979
to bring you into war again?

211
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
I was already tired of this boring place.

212
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,940
The frontier may be a harsh land,
but at least we'll be free there.

213
00:14:28,979 --> 00:14:29,900
Not to mention...

214
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,340
I had longed to fight by your side.

215
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:05,979
Jing Xuan, behave.

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,659
Don't make our father mad.

217
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,900
You must stop fooling around.

218
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,539
Otherwise, Jing Xin might
choose another man over you.

219
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:14,580
Don't worry.

220
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,739
I will keep Fourteenth Young Master safe.

221
00:15:17,619 --> 00:15:18,580
All right.

222
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:21,260
Is this a confession or a farewell?

223
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,179
Feng Yang, I know you're a fearsome warrior.

224
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,500
But the blades can cut anyone.

225
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:29,500
You must be careful while you're there.

226
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:32,739
After all, you have someone to look after.

227
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,419
Don't worry.

228
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:39,380
I will never let my man live in fear.

229
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,940
Look at yourself.

230
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:43,979
You are acting tough again.

231
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:46,940
How is it wrong to let him live with ease of mind?

232
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,340
Not at all. Love me with all you can.

233
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,739
What matters is for us to stay happy.

234
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,460
Ignore what she said.

235
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,659
Ungrateful.

236
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,419
I shouldn't have given you
the repudiation paper.

237
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:01,580
I should have made you suffer
a life of loneliness in your room.

238
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,219
All right, it's time to leave.

239
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,140

the main force's departure.

Do you need me to cut off the loose ends?

293
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,459
Mo Feng Yang is from the Mo family

294
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:23,900
and I was wary of her presence.

295
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,500
But I knew for sure

296
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,619
that she is much stronger and resilient
than the worthless and fawning fools

00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,780
on the court.

298
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:34,699
Now that she's gone,

299
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,300
she must have had a falling-out with Mo Yuan Long.

300
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:41,780
She has no power in the army
and no politician to root for her.

301
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,260
We could spare her life.

302
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,619
For once, she can be herself again.

303
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,859

320
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,579

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,099
Is that all?

323
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:22,219
I've made my stance
as Prince Consort of Crown Princess

324
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,099
very clear.

325
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,459
But I have yet to speak to you, Qu Xiang Tan,
as Lian Cheng.

326
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,540
Xiang Tan. It's time to let go.

327
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,699
I had told you when we first met

328
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,859
that you could end my life after you recovered,

329
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:40,739
so we are now even.

330
00:21:40,979 --> 00:21:42,260
It's time to realize that.

331
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,780

Don't you remember that?

334
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,819
Why must you let this pain haunt you even now?

335
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,219
Qu Tan Er is the cause.

336
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,900
Who exactly is she?

337
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,260
She is the woman I love.

338
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,819

00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:09,619
You only love her because she looks like me!

341
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,939
You will see that truth!

342
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,619
I've told you everything.

343
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,660
If I let you down,

344
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,859
you could seek revenge on me.

345
00:22:17,859 --> 00:22:19,180
But please don't harm others.

346
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,219
I hope our former bond

347
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:24,300
wouldn't be ruined by what we've become.

348
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,459
Your Majesty must take care.

349
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,900
You've been agitated too many times,

350
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,420
if you don't restrain your emotions...

351
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,979
your body won't be able to take the toll.

352

My body

353
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,339

354

It's time to give it up.

355
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,619
Your Majesty, are you sure about this?

356
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,900
Whoever she is,

357
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,099
you will always love her.

358

359
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,180
So be it!

360
00:23:26,699 --> 00:23:29,219
Why has Her Majesty summoned me to the palace?

361
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,300
Your Highness, I do not know.

362
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:47,099

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,859
Try it out.

369
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,459
These are your favorite osmanthus
cakes from your childhood.

370
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:15,660
Thanks, Your Majesty.

371
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,699
It does remind me of my childhood.

372
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:29,660
It's been too long since I last tried this.

373
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:32,780
It was your favorite.

374
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,979
But Tan Er hated it.

375
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:39,260
But she always pretended to like it

376
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,979
just to cheer me up.

377
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,459
Indeed. My sister had been sensible
since her childhood.

378
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,180
But somehow,

379
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,739
she seemed to have taken
a liking to different things.

380
00:24:56,739 --> 00:24:59,020
<i>Even Her Majesty has noticed it.</i>

381
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,819
<i>This is a perfect chance.</i>

382
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,699
I thought it was strange too.

383
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,420
Crown Princess has become
much carefree than she was.

384
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:07,500
She had multiple attempts
to realize gender equality.

385
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,420
She behaved as if she was a different person.

386
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,380
Her handwriting is an even more bizarre story.

387
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,540
Not to mention...

388
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,380
I shouldn't disrespect Her Highness.

389
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,900
I deserve punishment.

390
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,739
Never mind. Carry on.

391
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,780
I've heard rumors from servants
working in Her Highness's residence

392
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,979
that Her Highness had been acting
like a different person.

393
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,339
She couldn't remember anything from the past.

394
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,339
Is that true?

395
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,540
I would never lie to Your Majesty.

396
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,660
This is certainly weird.

397
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,180
It concerns the royal bloodline.

398
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,859
We must never draw conclusions
without hard evidence.

399
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,180
I appreciate your concerns.

400
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,140
As you know,

401
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,739
I have always been impartial in treating you two.

402
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,020
But compared to Qu Tan Er,

403
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,459
you and I have more things in common.

404
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,180
As Eldest Princess, you have great duties.

405
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,459
I will do anything within my capability
to aide Your Majesty

406
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:22,859
and cleanse Dongyue of any evil.

407
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,420
Dismiss.

408
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,939
I take my leave now.

409
00:26:37,094 --> 00:26:39,718
<i>Memorial</i>

410
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,459
Your Majesty, I doubt it
that Eldest Princess could get this done.

411
00:26:43,699 --> 00:26:45,739
She is proud and competitive since young.

412
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:49,540
She is never tired of her
competition with Qu Tan Er.

413
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:52,420
She will make the best of this opportunity.

414
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,140
How long will it take?

415
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,859
There was an anomaly with the Soul-guarding Bead.

416
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,339
I have subdued with by force.

417
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,540
But as precautions,

418
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,060
I need two more days for my preparation.

419
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,819
Tan, you should stop swinging it.

420
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,380
We've only finished building it just now.

421
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,300
I think it's not very stable.

422
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,060
I could reinforce the structure a little.

423
00:27:23,619 --> 00:27:24,420
No.

424
00:27:25,099 --> 00:27:26,939
This is the swing of love.

425
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,300
Only we can build it.

426
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,739
Isn't that right, Cheng Cheng?

427
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,140
I think I built this on my own.

428
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,819
The Royal Officer requests for an audience.

429
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:01,140
How may I assist you?

430
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,180
Her Majesty summoned Your Highness
to the royal study for a discussion.

431
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:05,819
What is it?

432
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,500
I do not know, Your Highness.

433
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:13,859
It's all right, Cheng Cheng.

434
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
It's the first time

435
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,459
we've seen this kind of behavior.

436
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,500
After all, I am Crown Princess.

437
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:19,660
Don't worry about it.

438
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:21,420
Be cautious.

439
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,500
Make sure to finish the swing before I come back.

440
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,600
<i>Yong</i>
<i>*Forever</i>

441
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:52,619
Your Majesty.

442
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,819
I must confront the woman next to me

443
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,819
for impersonating my sister Qu Tan Er,

444
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,099
sullying the royal bloodline
and the treason against the throne.

445
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,979
She attempted to usurp the title of Crown Princess

446
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,540
to seize control over Dongyue.

447
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:04,739
I fear that my real sister

448
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,619
has met her demise.

449
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,619
Please be our judge, Your Majesty.

450
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,300
My sister deserved justice.

451
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:11,699
Mei Er.

452
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,060
Do you know what the punishment
for slander against Crown Princess is?

453
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:20,739
Your Majesty, she is framing me.

454
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:25,219
She is clearly jealous of my title,

455
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:26,780
so she decided to tarnish my name.

456
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,260
My sister used to have fair handwriting.

457
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,979
But this woman has inferior handwriting.

458
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,020
According to the servants
in Second Princess's Residence,

459
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,219
my sister used to master all forms of art.

460
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,060
This woman is nothing compared to her.

461
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,579
This woman prefers spicy food

462
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:42,579
and wears brilliant colors,
all while behaving abnormally.

463
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:44,859
The differences between her
and my sister are apparent.

464
00:29:45,939 --> 00:29:48,140
I do not believe in her stories of amnesia.

465
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,699
They are clearly two different people.

466
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,939
I hope Your Majesty brings her to justice.

467
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,939
What is your counterargument?

468
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,699
Your Majesty, my handwriting changed

469
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:08,180
because of the side-effect after I drowned.

470
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,180
My hands became too weak.

471
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,819
As for the statements from her eyewitnesses,

472
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,619
she could have bought them off easily.

473
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,619
Not to mention asking me to prove

474
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,339
my own identity

475
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:21,420
is illogical at best.

476
00:30:22,939 --> 00:30:24,180
Eldest Princess,

477
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,459
how can you prove you're not an impostor?

478
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,699
I have always acted the same way.

479
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:33,900
Unlike you, you've changed so much.

480
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,579
Your Majesty. After the accident,

481
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,339
I had issues with my memories.

482
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,500
After my close encounter with death,

483
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,540
I decided to change my way of living.

484
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,420
I didn't want anyone to pick on me.

485
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,380
My changes in behavior

486
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,579
were caused by the accident.

487
00:31:03,979 --> 00:31:06,060
If Your Majesty wishes to investigate,

488
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:09,219
we could start by investigating
why I fell into the water.

489
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:11,900
Do not shift the topic.

490
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:14,500
There is no connection between
your identity and the accident.

491
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
It could be you who murdered her

492
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:22,660
and took her place.

493
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,780
Your Majesty, my poor sister
deserved to have justice.

494
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:31,300
I am Qu Tan Er!

495
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,660
Nothing will change that fact.

496
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,500
Your Majesty, look at my cute face,

497
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,619
my slim figure,

498
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,699
this is who I am!

499
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,619
Mei Er's doubts

500
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,900
raised some questions for me.

501
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,540
But Tan Er's statements are logical.

502
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,699
Princess's identity is a serious matter.

503
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,099
Mei Er.

504
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,939
I leave the investigation to you.

505
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,780
Qu Tan Er shall be imprisoned for the time being.

506
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,420
She may retain her title
as the heir apparent in East Palace.

507
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,939
We shall take further action
after we've known the truth.

508
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,300
Your Majesty.

509
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,180
Wise judgment, Your Majesty.
I will carry out the order.

510
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,979
Guards.

511
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:42,459
Take Second Princess to the prison.

512
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:15,420
Cheng Cheng!

513
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:19,380
What happened?

514
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,900
She is an impostor.

515
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:25,339
She will wait for her hearing in prison.

516
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,260
Wait.

517
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,380
This must be a setup.

518
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:42,780
Are you going to disobey Her Majesty's order?

519
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,859
Cheng Cheng, don't worry.

520
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,619
Whatever the case is,

521
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:51,739
I still retain my title as Crown Princess.

522
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,420
As my lesson to become the next Empress,

523
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:57,020
I should experience the harshness of life.

524
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,099
Don't worry. I won't be gone for long.

525
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:03,819
Tan Er, wait for me.

526
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,500
Let's go.

527
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,659
Snobs.

528
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,179
The watery rice isn't that bad.

529
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,300
It would be great with some pickles

530
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,300
and chili sauce.

531
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,459
Her Majesty arrives!

532
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

533
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:53,379
I can't believe

534
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,540
you have the appetite to eat even at such a place.

535
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,500
Your Majesty, I knew

536
00:36:57,739 --> 00:36:59,899
this was part of your plan.

537
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:02,659
Your Majesty is wise,
so there must be a reason to this.

538
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:05,540
The meal is decent.

539
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,780
The cell provides shelter from the wind and rain.

540
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm not dying either.

541
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:10,979
Why shouldn't I be happy?

542
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,100
You are a lot smarter than Qu Tan Er.

543
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:19,699
But there is one thing that still baffles me.

544
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,739
Who exactly are you?

545
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:24,500
What is your connection with Mo Lian Cheng?

546
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,459
Why have you come here?

547
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:33,540
What I am about to tell
Your Majesty is the entire truth.

548
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,459
As for how much is understandable,

549
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,060
that's out of my reach.

550
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,899
I came from the Kingdom of Dongyue
founded by Mo Yi Feng.

551
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,060
That is a parallel universe.

552
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,580
I was the reincarnation
of Qu Xiang Tan in that world.

553
00:37:47,899 --> 00:37:49,060
In other words,

554
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,060
I am also Qu Xiang Tan.

555
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,659
Absurd!

556
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,659
I am Qu Xiang Tan. I am the ruler of Dongyue!

557
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,379
I knew you wouldn't understand.

558
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,820
In any case, Cheng Cheng and I
came from the same place.

559
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,459
He has been my Cheng Cheng in every lifetime.

560
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:06,659
He has nothing to do

561
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,060
with your precious Young Master Lian Cheng.

562
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,139
You can only dream

563
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,459
of having the bond Lian Cheng and I share.

564
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,060
Even if Mo Lian Cheng was your lover,

565
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,540
he would be wise to ditch
such a lousy ex-girlfriend like you.

566
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,419
Do you not fear for your life?

567
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,979
Your Majesty, it's almost time.

568
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:38,620
Stay calm.

569
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:42,580
Behave while you're here

570
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,659
unless you wish to bring harm to Mo Lian Cheng!

571
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,580
You wouldn't have the heart to do that.

572
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,020
If I can't have him for myself,

573
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,659
I wouldn't mind ending him.

574
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,699
Cheng Cheng is smarter.

575
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,739
I couldn't get any information from her.

576
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:14,899
Why is she trapping me in here?

577
00:39:16,219 --> 00:39:18,340
What did he mean by "it was almost time"?

578
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:41,580
Your Highness confronted
Qu Tan Er for being an impostor.

579
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,060
But where is the evidence?

580
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:45,500
Did she not present any argument?

581
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:48,179
Why is she already sent to prison?

582
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:50,100
Is the evidence even true?

583
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,739
Yan Chen. You doubt me.

584
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:54,500
Do you not care about my feelings?

585
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,659
How will you explain everything that is going on?

586
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,500
She is an impostor.

587
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,179
The woman you love is long gone.

588
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:02,459
How can I believe you
if you don't have any solid evidence?

589
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:04,260
Her changes in behavior

590
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,699
and the eyewitnesses in her residence
are the evidence you need.

591
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,580
I had already known

592
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:15,379
about how she behaved differently.

593
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:17,379
It's an after-effect of her accident.

594
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:19,060
She once told me

595
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:21,260
if I wished to find out what happened to her,

596
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,820
I would have to investigate
the place where she almost drowned.

597
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:26,060
Your Highness.

598
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,060
Do you know anything about the accident?

599
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,020
How should I know?

600
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,979
In that case,

601
00:40:40,979 --> 00:40:42,820
I must find the answers myself.

602
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:52,179
Your Highness, if Prince Consort found out...

603
00:40:52,179 --> 00:40:53,739
Do not bring this up again!

604
