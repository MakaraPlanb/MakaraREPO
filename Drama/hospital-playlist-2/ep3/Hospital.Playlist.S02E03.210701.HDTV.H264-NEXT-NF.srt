HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,159
<i>Your wife is about to faint right now.</i>

3
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,662
<i>She's pushing, but the baby won't drop.</i>

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,957
A natural birth is simply not possible
in this situation.

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:19,461
If the head is stuck in the birth canal
for too long, it's not good for the baby.

6
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:22,006
The fetal heart rate
is becoming erratic as well.

7
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,216
This is probably taking a toll
on the baby too.

8
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:27,261
We'll go into surgery right away.

9
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:29,138
Your wife wants it too.

10
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,973
No. I can't allow that, Doctor.

11
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,183
Let's wait just a little longer. Please?

12
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:50,868
-Can you park my car?
-Okay.

13
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:55,664
My wife has to have a natural birth
no matter what.

14
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,792
She probably agreed to surgery
because she's in too much pain.

15
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:02,171
-If she gets through this--
-Both she and the baby are at risk.

16
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:03,922
She's already exhausted

17
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:07,092
and the baby is face-up
and just won't drop.

18
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:10,554
It hasn't budged for over three hours,
so she needs surgery.

19
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,308
It's past 4 a.m. now,
which means it's been almost four hours.

20
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:18,187
My daughter-in-law promised me
that she'd give a natural birth.

21
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:21,565
Doctor, let's wait a little longer.

22
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,151
If it really doesn't work,
she can go into surgery then.

23
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:26,195
Right, that is now.

24
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,197
We cannot wait any longer.

25
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,032
This is an emergency situation!

26
00:01:31,074 --> 00:01:33,410
What are you doing?
Why isn't she in the OR yet?

27
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:37,206
Professor Yang, her family is insisting
she must give a natural birth.

28
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:38,290
They won't let us--

29
00:01:38,373 --> 00:01:41,710
They say babies who are
born vaginally are smarter.

30
00:01:41,794 --> 00:01:43,796
Can't we wait just a little longer?

31
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,466
Back in my day, women gave birth naturally
without any problems

32
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,426
even after being in labor for three days.

33
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:52,846
I guess your goal is
to have a natural delivery,

34
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:57,101
but ours is to ensure that the delivery
is safe for both the mother and the baby.

35
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,727
It's already late.

36
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,146
Ms. Choi Ye-rim needs surgery,

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,148
and she has already given her consent.

38
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,777
We'll go into surgery now.

39
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,072
-Hurry and get ready.
-Okay.

40
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:19,289
<i>-Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin.
-Yes.</i>

41
00:02:19,373 --> 00:02:22,292
<i>Here you go.
Please wait in front of Room 4.</i>

42
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:33,971
It's so busy today, as usual.

43
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:37,599
This is nothing.

44
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:41,270
-Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin, please come in.
-Sure.

45
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,314
We need to confirm your date of birth.

46
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,233
January 25, 1974.

47
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,076
Mr. Kim Hyeong-jin is next.

48
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:00,330
I remember him! He lives in Yesan.
When he came in last month,

49
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,874
his AST level was 150.

50
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,710
Do we have his results already?

51
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:06,628
Do you even remember such details?

52
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,631
Quiz Champion.

53
00:03:13,343 --> 00:03:14,636
Don't you know <i>Janghak Quiz</i>?

54
00:03:15,345 --> 00:03:18,348
I've heard of it, but I grew up
watching <i>The Golden Bell Challenge</i>.

55
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,229
So did I. I watched <i>Star Golden Bell</i>.

56
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,650
Hello. It's been a month, right?

57
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:30,652
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

58
00:03:34,907 --> 00:03:36,241
So how's everything? Good?

59
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,368
Yes, I feel great.

60
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,954
I think the surgery went very well.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,292
But you don't look so well today.

62
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,253
I was on duty last night,
so I didn't get any sleep.

63
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:51,632
You got blood work done this morning.

64
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:53,842
It doesn't look like
we have the results yet.

65
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,720
They're sending you the results now.

66
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,305
Great, thank you.

67
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:00,891
It looks like
you've gained a bit of weight.

68
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:04,811
Mr. Cho Seon-ho.

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,440
Here's your prescription
for one more week.

70
00:04:08,523 --> 00:04:10,901
Call this number to book your appointment.

71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,069
Okay, thank you.

72
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:30,629
Professor,
we don't have all the lab results yet.

73
00:04:30,712 --> 00:04:32,297
We'll start ten minutes late.

74
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:34,049
Your gown is in the treatment room.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,760
Really? Good timing.

76
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,513
I just finished the surgery.
I won't be late, then.

77
00:04:39,596 --> 00:04:40,889
I'll head there right away.

78
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:53,988
HOSPITAL PLAYLIST 2

79
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,529
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

80
00:05:01,493 --> 00:05:02,995
<i>Doors are closing.</i>

81
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,664
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

82
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,082
Let's hurry.

83
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,042
Thank you.

84
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,671
Hi. How's the candy?

85
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:16,967
I have three more at home.

86
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,095
Strawberry, orange…

87
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,431
and toasted rice!

88
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:31,523
Strawberry, orange, and…

89
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:33,775
Plum, maybe?

90
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,739
Apple?

91
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:42,409
No! That's not it!

92
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:46,371
Okay, all right.
Ha-yul, are you upset with me?

93
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,127
Let's see.

94
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:56,798
It's dropped a little.
Her jaundice is definitely getting better.

95
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,135
The color of her eyes
looks much better now.

96
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:03,346
I was worried as it was going up.
But thankfully, it's dropping now.

97
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,806
How was she the past two weeks?

98
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,268
Pretty good,
but she did have a fever last week.

99
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,145
Stop! Don't tell him that.

100
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,481
Okay, I won't tell him.

101
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:14,608
-Does she still have it?
-No, she's fine now.

102
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,026
When she's running a fever,

103
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,445
-I get scared--
-Stop. Don't say that.

104
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:20,113
Okay, I won't.

105
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:21,406
Hold on.

106
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,076
Just a second, Ha-yul.

107
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:27,829
Let's see.

108
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,752
You're wearing a hairpin.

109
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:37,964
Your hair looks nice.

110
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:43,553
Ha-yul, this is you.

111
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,722
You can play with this, okay?

112
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,640
Okay.

113
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:52,395
We tested her vitamin levels last month,

114
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,272
and everything looks good.

115
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,024
So I suggest we change it all up.

116
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:59,194
No more vitamin injections.
Let's switch to oral medications.

117
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,071
I see. What about Vitamin K?

118
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,366
Yes, that too.
Let's simplify the treatment plan.

119
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,743
That should be okay, right?

120
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,286
Yes, she'll be fine.

121
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,746
This is you.

122
00:07:10,414 --> 00:07:11,706
That's me?

123
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,588
My gosh, what a nice drawing.

124
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,840
Yes!

125
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,427
Please draw me again next time.

126
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,095
Okay, sure!

127
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:27,681
Let's go.

128
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,058
Say "Thank you, Doctor."

129
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,269
Thank you.

130
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,609
What did she say?

131
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,820
"Toasted rice flavor." She remembered it.

132
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:46,950
Bye, Ha-yul. Bye!

133
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,494
Bye!

134
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,002
-Hello.
-Hello.

135
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,046
Yes, take a seat.

136
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:16,438
Everything looks good.

137
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:18,815
It looks fine.

138
00:08:20,358 --> 00:08:24,988
I'm relieved to hear that.
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

139
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:29,075
Does the X-ray look okay too?

140
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,702
Yes.

141
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:34,539
What about the blood test
and electrocardiogram results?

142
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:37,250
I just told you everything's fine.

143
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:43,590
Doctor.

144
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:48,470
My husband has been getting
leg cramps at night--

145
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:51,264
That has nothing to do with the heart.

146
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:53,016
No other questions, right?

147
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,521
-No.
-Then I'll see you next time.

148
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:05,278
Hello?

149
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:10,242
Who?

150
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,118
Thank you.

151
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:15,205
Take care. And don't forget to exercise.

152
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,382
-Hello.
-Hello, please have a seat here.

153
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,770
You had your surgery
over two months ago, right?

154
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,398
Yes, it's already been two months.

155
00:09:50,532 --> 00:09:51,992
You got a haircut.

156
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,703
Yes, I did.

157
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:56,454
I looked like a crazy person before.

158
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:03,920
Professor Kim, did my condition get worse?

159
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:05,630
No, everything looks good.

160
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:09,801
I reviewed everything
starting with your pre-surgery X-ray.

161
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:12,429
Your X-ray and blood test results
from today look good.

162
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,389
And your electrocardiogram is normal too.

163
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,853
This one was taken before the surgery,

164
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:22,147
and the one on the right is from today.

165
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,482
The lungs show up as black
and the heart is white.

166
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:27,736
Your right atrium and ventricle
were enlarged before the surgery.

167
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,739
You don't have to be a doctor
to see the difference.

168
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,824
Your heart looks notably smaller
than before.

169
00:10:32,907 --> 00:10:35,243
Yes, I can see the improvement.

170
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:38,997
Yes, everything looks good.
Did you experience any other symptoms

171
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,082
after your appointment last month?

172
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:45,712
No. Oh, right. Everything's been good,

173
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:48,381
but when I get up suddenly,

174
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,342
I feel lightheaded.

175
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,303
-Does it happen often?
-No, just once in a while.

176
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:57,015
Is it common after the surgery?

177
00:10:57,098 --> 00:11:00,769
Yes, it can happen after the surgery.
I've seen it in some cases,

178
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,937
but it will go away with time.

179
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:05,523
As I've explained before, your heart is

180
00:11:05,607 --> 00:11:09,069
at the same level as your brain
when you're lying down.

181
00:11:09,152 --> 00:11:13,073
But when you get up, your brain is
suddenly higher than your heart.

182
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:15,784
So your blood vessels must contract
the moment it happens.

183
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:17,911
Squeezing the tip of your garden hose

184
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:19,954
makes the water shoot out farther, right?

185
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:23,625
It's the same thing. The vessels
must contract to pump blood to the brain.

186
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:27,921
If that doesn't happen right away,
you can experience lightheadedness.

187
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:30,298
I see. I totally get it now.

188
00:11:30,382 --> 00:11:33,551
You were given diuretics
and antihypertensives after the surgery,

189
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,929
which can throw you off balance
temporarily.

190
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:39,974
Rather than testing yourself to see
whether your condition is improving,

191
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:44,396
I suggest you try to get into the habit
of getting up slowly.

192
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,731
-Okay.
-She's awfully impatient.

193
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,692
She always gets up quickly.
She doesn't have the patience.

194
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:51,319
I'll be careful from now on.

195
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:53,279
-Any other questions?
-No.

196
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:54,739
-All right, then.
-Thank you.

197
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:10,964
-Professor Cheon will be here shortly.
-Thank you.

198
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:15,176
Sir, our resident doctors
in Cardiothoracic Surgery

199
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,763
perform tube thoracostomy most often
on pneumothorax patients.

200
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,265
They do it several times a day.

201
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:25,478
Should I also call a resident
in Cardiothoracic Surgery just in case?

202
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:31,317
We'll wait for Professor Cheon.

203
00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:32,777
Okay.

204
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,322
He's coming?

205
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,075
Professor Cheon is on his way now?

206
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,829
Yes. He moved all his appointments
to come here right away.

207
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,747
I thought he'd say no.

208
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,001
I called him,
thinking I'd probably get yelled at.

209
00:12:48,084 --> 00:12:50,044
But he said he'd come and take care of it.

210
00:12:50,128 --> 00:12:51,629
My goodness.

211
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,216
But he hasn't treated lung disorders
for over 20 years.

212
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,760
Yes, but it's considered
a basic task in CS.

213
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:01,848
That's right. Because it's a basic task,

214
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,100
the last time he did it in the ER,
not in an OR,

215
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,019
was probably well over 20 years ago.

216
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:10,440
Who is the patient though?

217
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:14,362
Who is the patient though?

218
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,030
An assemblyman.

219
00:13:16,114 --> 00:13:18,449
He represents the district
where Professor Cheon lives.

220
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,576
They play golf together.

221
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:26,040
-Where is he?
-This way.

222
00:13:43,683 --> 00:13:45,184
Why isn't this working?

223
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,858
Why isn't this going in?

224
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:58,573
What is wrong with this?

225
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:00,533
This is a piece of crap.

226
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,577
Pass me the mosquito forceps. Quick!

227
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:10,668
Gosh, why isn't this working?
What is wrong with this?

228
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,588
Wait. Hang in there, okay?

229
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:19,886
Goodness.

230
00:14:20,636 --> 00:14:21,804
What is wrong with this?

231
00:14:23,097 --> 00:14:24,265
Come on!

232
00:14:26,225 --> 00:14:28,644
Your liver somatic index is normal

233
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,938
and you don't have jaundice anymore.

234
00:14:31,022 --> 00:14:34,609
You had cancer,
so we ran the tests to check for relapse.

235
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,739
Your blood vessels are fine.

236
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,577
Here, look at the screen.

237
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:50,625
This is your vein.

238
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:55,254
The hepatic portal vein looks fine too.

239
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:59,509
This is your hepatic artery.
This thin one here.

240
00:14:59,592 --> 00:15:01,135
This one looks fine too.

241
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,306
So as for your blood vessels,
they're fine.

242
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:07,767
Thank you, Professor Lee.

243
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:10,853
I've been coming to the hospital
for so long

244
00:15:10,937 --> 00:15:14,565
that I can now tell how good or bad it is
from the X-rays alone.

245
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:18,611
He got the transplant done two years ago

246
00:15:18,694 --> 00:15:22,782
but still has a hard time falling asleep
the night before his appointments.

247
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,368
He's worried the cancer might recur.

248
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,870
My mom and I stay up all night too.

249
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:35,670
Your father's cancer wasn't that serious,
and he had the surgery over two years ago,

250
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:41,050
so I think it's safe to assume
that he's fully recovered now.

251
00:15:41,968 --> 00:15:42,969
Pardon?

252
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,725
My gosh, Doctor Lee.

253
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:51,310
Really?

254
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:55,022
I thought we had to wait five years
to assume he's fully cured.

255
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,609
My gosh.

256
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,654
We should still monitor his condition.

257
00:16:01,737 --> 00:16:04,824
But statistically,
a recurrence is unlikely

258
00:16:05,408 --> 00:16:08,202
unless it happens
within two years of transplantation.

259
00:16:08,286 --> 00:16:10,621
Only in not-so-severe cases like this,
of course.

260
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:13,749
Thank you, Professor Lee.

261
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:17,461
I'm so grateful to my son

262
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,548
and to you as well, Professor Lee.

263
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:26,429
It's a miracle
that I'm still alive like this.

264
00:16:26,512 --> 00:16:30,892
I'm so grateful to see
that you've recovered like this.

265
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,728
I'd say you're almost fully cured now,
but it's important

266
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:36,689
that you keep taking care of yourself
and exercise regularly.

267
00:16:36,772 --> 00:16:39,150
Also, don't miss your appointments

268
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,777
-and get your tests done on time.
-Of course.

269
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:45,948
Then I'll see you in three months.

270
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:49,911
-Okay, thank you.
-Take care.

271
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:50,995
Bye.

272
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,962
This is a record.

273
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:03,674
You were booked back-to-back
after working the night shift.

274
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,551
Do you want some bread?

275
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:09,305
No, thank you. I want real food.
I'm going to have a proper dinner.

276
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,058
You still have one patient left.

277
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,894
-Liar.
-You're right. I was just kidding.

278
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,065
I'm hungry. Let's go eat something.

279
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:21,859
Sure.

280
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:26,489
Gosh, I'm tired.

281
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:39,210
You can't see Min-chan and Eun-ji
from here.

282
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:45,424
I brought some side dishes from home.
Let's have dinner together.

283
00:17:45,508 --> 00:17:46,509
Sure.

284
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:48,970
-Let's go.
-Okay.

285
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:50,429
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER
PICU

286
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:01,148
They're serving beef bone soup today.

287
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:04,860
Enjoy. I have a date.

288
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,999
Let's go have some beef bone soup.

289
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,252
I'm having dinner with my mom.

290
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,713
Hey, don't push me.

291
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,175
Those jerks.

292
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,597
<i>Please leave a message after the tone…</i>

293
00:18:33,681 --> 00:18:36,183
Ik-jun should be done
with his appointments by now.

294
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,185
He's never around when I need him.

295
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:45,568
Professor Kim!

296
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:48,821
As of today, I'm free.
Even the second exam is done.

297
00:18:48,904 --> 00:18:51,032
-Let's have dinner.
-Did the interview go well?

298
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:55,119
Of course.
I have such a likable face, you know.

299
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,830
I came straight here
because I missed the cafeteria food.

300
00:18:58,664 --> 00:19:01,709
I've got some intel that beef bone soup
is on the menu today.

301
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,711
Intel, my foot. Hey.

302
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,171
<i>Beef bone soup. Come down.</i>

303
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:09,508
Let's go. You had to study so hard.
Dinner's on me.

304
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,260
Then we should eat out.

305
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,805
You should take me out
to a nice restaurant.

306
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:17,141
I have a lecture in 30 minutes. Bye.

307
00:19:18,434 --> 00:19:19,810
I know that!

308
00:19:19,894 --> 00:19:22,605
I know your schedule
like the back of my hand.

309
00:19:22,688 --> 00:19:25,232
Of course,
I know you have a lecture today.

310
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,525
I was just joking.

311
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:29,236
Dear Jae-hak,
look at you cracking jokes with me.

312
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,490
Did you just say "dear Jae-hak"?

313
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,783
Jeez.

314
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:34,867
"Dear Jae-hak"?

315
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:38,204
-That's what you said.
-Shut it.

316
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,375
I'm sick of the food here.

317
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,128
That's why I bring a few dishes from home.

318
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:47,755
I prefer to eat like this.

319
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,298
This way, I can save money too.

320
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:51,383
Who knows how much longer
we'd have to wait?

321
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,427
We can't eat out every meal.

322
00:19:53,511 --> 00:19:57,890
Thank you. I didn't even know
there was a place like this.

323
00:19:57,973 --> 00:19:59,850
How could you have known?

324
00:19:59,934 --> 00:20:02,728
Min-chan has only been hooked up
to the VAD for a week.

325
00:20:02,812 --> 00:20:04,563
I'm sure you still feel frazzled.

326
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:07,108
I'll bring some side dishes tomorrow.

327
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,401
I had to rush Min-chan to the hospital,

328
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:11,904
so I still have all the side dishes
in the fridge.

329
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,447
I can just bring them tomorrow.

330
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,949
Tomorrow's the weekend.

331
00:20:15,032 --> 00:20:18,327
You should go home and get some sleep
even just for a day.

332
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,746
You need to catch up on sleep to recharge.

333
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,668
And we can only see the kids
twice a day anyway,

334
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:29,213
so don't stay here all day.
Go home and come back when you need to.

335
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:30,589
It's okay to do that.

336
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:36,137
I told you. We're like marathoners.

337
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,889
Yes, thank you.

338
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:43,185
Oh, you should add some calorie boosters
to Min-chan's food or milk.

339
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,272
I know he's older than Eun-ji,

340
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:49,066
but he's on the smaller side.

341
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:54,488
The faster he grows, the easier it'll be
for him to find the right heart donor.

342
00:20:54,572 --> 00:20:55,573
Right.

343
00:20:57,116 --> 00:21:00,494
It always worried me
that he's smaller than average.

344
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,415
I guess I didn't do a good job
raising him.

345
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:07,668
Goodness. Don't say that.

346
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:10,546
Here, have this and cheer up.

347
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:14,091
Min-chan's blood type is A.

348
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:17,469
He can get a heart from someone
with an A or O blood type,

349
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,346
so he'll have more chances.

350
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:22,558
Only think positive thoughts, okay?

351
00:21:24,226 --> 00:21:25,186
Okay.

352
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:27,938
The food must be cold now.
Hurry up and eat.

353
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:30,107
Thank you.

354
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:34,820
I hope Eun-ji finds a donor soon
so Min-chan can find one too.

355
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:40,201
I really hope they can find
the right donor for Eun-ji soon.

356
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:41,994
Thank you.

357
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:44,872
I believe

358
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,125
in miracles.

359
00:21:53,214 --> 00:21:54,340
Eat up.

360
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,178
You have many surgeries booked
next week, right?

361
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,389
Yes, I'm all booked
for the next two weeks.

362
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:04,225
There's one Chief Kwon asked me to do.

363
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:07,978
Chief Kwon? Professor Kwon Sun-jeong
asked you to operate on a patient?

364
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:10,231
-Yes, his sibling.
-Oh, no.

365
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:12,566
He said he couldn't operate
on his own brother,

366
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,401
so I told him I'd do it next week.

367
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:16,070
I'll do it before my appointments.

368
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:21,617
I see.

369
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,623
What is it?

370
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:33,379
It's about Daddy-Long-Legs.

371
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,507
I told you how it works, right?

372
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,342
Yes, you did.

373
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:41,679
We received this inquiry
from Ji-am Medical Center in Mokpo.

374
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,013
It's a pretty big hospital

375
00:22:43,097 --> 00:22:45,349
that performs
three to four transplants a year.

376
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,350
Mokpo?

377
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:49,395
Wasn't it just for Yulje and KWMC?

378
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:52,856
I've expanded it a little.

379
00:22:54,817 --> 00:22:57,695
The more people it can help, the better.

380
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:01,699
I sent an anonymous email
to every hospital in the country,

381
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:03,492
explaining how the program works

382
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,371
and telling them
that they can inquire anytime.

383
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,626
Don't ever complain
that you're tired again.

384
00:23:13,502 --> 00:23:15,254
I'm totally fine.

385
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,968
So? What's the inquiry
from the hospital in Mokpo?

386
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,887
At first,
they asked for financial support.

387
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:27,057
The patient is a sailor who's been
battling liver cancer for years.

388
00:23:27,141 --> 00:23:28,851
He doesn't have health insurance,

389
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,270
so he's exhausted his savings
on his hospital bills.

390
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:34,940
He's on welfare at the moment
and can barely make ends meet.

391
00:23:35,607 --> 00:23:39,278
He has a son,
but his son had no idea about his illness

392
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,156
because he and his wife didn't tell him.

393
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,994
One day, his son suddenly got worried
and went to Mokpo to see them.

394
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,913
But he was in the ER at the time
due to hepatic encephalopathy,

395
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:52,458
and his belly was quite swollen.

396
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:55,252
When the son saw that,

397
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:58,047
he flopped down and started bawling,

398
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,341
saying that he's a terrible son
and asking them to save his father.

399
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:03,010
Can't the son be a donor for him?

400
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:05,679
The son said
he'd happily donate his liver right away.

401
00:24:05,763 --> 00:24:07,514
The wife was seeing a neurosurgeon

402
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:10,059
for a cerebrovascular disorder,
so she couldn't do it.

403
00:24:10,893 --> 00:24:12,853
But as soon as he regained consciousness,

404
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:16,148
he said he'd never let his son
go through surgery for him.

405
00:24:16,231 --> 00:24:18,108
He was strongly against it,

406
00:24:18,192 --> 00:24:21,987
but his wife and son finally managed
to persuade him.

407
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,656
I'm surprised you asked
for all these details.

408
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,910
Of course, I need to make sure
the money is put to good use.

409
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:28,827
That's true.

410
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:31,497
We can help them, right?

411
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,624
Yes, I told them we would.

412
00:24:33,707 --> 00:24:36,877
But I got an email from the doctor there
three days later.

413
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,838
They were going to liaise
with a local university hospital,

414
00:24:39,922 --> 00:24:43,300
but while testing for compatibility,
they concluded it'd be too difficult

415
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,512
and were hoping to transfer him
to a hospital in Seoul.

416
00:24:47,387 --> 00:24:49,723
But they're good.
One of my old professors is there.

417
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,350
I wonder what the problem is.

418
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:54,937
The father is a big guy. He weighs 90kg,
but his son weighs less than 60kg.

419
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,022
-The size is the problem.
-Right.

420
00:24:57,106 --> 00:24:59,650
They said they couldn't do it
due to the size difference.

421
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,027
They wanted to see
if it could be done in Seoul

422
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:06,240
and if we'd still be able to provide
financial support in that case.

423
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:08,700
-That doesn't matter.
-Right, I told them that.

424
00:25:08,784 --> 00:25:11,829
But I got another email from them
this morning.

425
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:14,957
They received feedback from KWMC
and Seojung Hospital.

426
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,626
Apparently, they also said
they wouldn't be able to do it.

427
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:21,380
Jae-an Medical Center is willing to do it
if there are two donors,

428
00:25:21,463 --> 00:25:23,132
just to be safe.

429
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:25,634
That's impossible, though.

430
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,930
The son is the only person
who can do it at the moment,

431
00:25:30,556 --> 00:25:34,017
and the father is strongly against
getting liver grafts from two donors.

432
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:37,062
Every hospital has
its own rules and standards.

433
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:41,483
The doctor there said he would ask
Yulje for his patient as a last resort.

434
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,443
So I told him I could ask Yulje directly

435
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,237
because I've done business with them.

436
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:48,490
The patient's not doing well,
so we don't have time.

437
00:25:48,574 --> 00:25:50,701
Why waste time going back and forth?

438
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,286
I told him I'd ask Yulje for him.

439
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:53,370
Good.

440
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:56,874
Can you take a look?

441
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:02,129
If you think the surgery can't be done,

442
00:26:03,547 --> 00:26:07,509
then I'll give up
because that means it's not possible.

443
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:10,053
You can do that, right?

444
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:12,055
Okay, I'll have a look.

445
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,643
Ask them if they can send over
his CT scan and other test results.

446
00:26:16,727 --> 00:26:18,353
The sooner, the better.

447
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:20,189
Okay, I'll ask them right away.

448
00:26:20,272 --> 00:26:22,733
-Hurry up and eat. It must be cold now.
-Right.

449
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,866
Is it someone you know? Who is it?

450
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:34,411
-How did you know?
-It sounded as if you knew the doctor.

451
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,206
Who is it?

452
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:41,001
Hyeong-do, Baek Hyeong-do.

453
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,006
The Baek Hyeong-do who was on my team?

454
00:26:46,089 --> 00:26:49,968
The Baek Hyeong-do I know,
with that charming, deep voice?

455
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:52,179
Yes, that Baek Hyeong-do.

456
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:53,805
Your rival.

457
00:26:54,514 --> 00:26:56,767
"Rival"? Oh, please.
What are you talking about?

458
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,519
He thought of you as his rival
for six years.

459
00:26:59,603 --> 00:27:01,438
That's why he hated your guts.

460
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,857
Me? How can anyone hate me?

461
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:06,193
This is probably why he hated you.

462
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:12,449
Anyway, it turns out that he's actually
the director of the hospital in Mokpo.

463
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:14,660
My, I'm impressed.

464
00:27:14,743 --> 00:27:17,621
Performing transplants there…
It can't be easy.

465
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:19,289
He said it's not easy.

466
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:22,209
I played dumb
and asked a bunch of questions.

467
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:25,963
He said they're short-staffed,
and the medical office is small.

468
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,590
But he's doing his best
out of a sense of duty

469
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,635
so that the people there
wouldn't have to go

470
00:27:31,718 --> 00:27:34,388
all the way to Seoul.

471
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:36,515
I have huge respect for him.

472
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,851
I should give him a call
if I end up taking the patient.

473
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:42,896
He and I were quite close,
although you hated him.

474
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,982
Who? You're friends with everyone.

475
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:46,024
-Hi.
-Hello.

476
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,443
Hello. Hey, you know Hyeong-do, right?

477
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,737
Baek Hyeong-do?
I sure do. He's your rival.

478
00:27:50,821 --> 00:27:53,907
-A "rival"?
-Hyeong-do. We went to school with him.

479
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:55,784
He wanted to beat Ik-jun so badly

480
00:27:55,867 --> 00:27:58,036
that he gave him tickets to a club
during exams.

481
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,289
He bought it with his own money

482
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:02,291
so Ik-jun would party hard
and bomb the exam.

483
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,876
Wait, Hyeong-do bought that ticket?

484
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,546
He said it was free
because his uncle owned that club.

485
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:11,008
Hyeong-do's uncle is a Buddhist monk.

486
00:28:11,717 --> 00:28:14,136
He's the chief monk
at the biggest temple in Mokpo.

487
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:15,887
He's still well-respected.

488
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:18,557
So did you bomb the exam?

489
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,935
No. He kept getting the highest marks
because he got to unwind

490
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,312
and de-stress at the club.

491
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:27,899
You guys know that I was totally crazy
about Park Jin-young back then.

492
00:28:27,983 --> 00:28:30,193
My pelvis popped out,
and it's still missing.

493
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:33,322
Then what is that
between your waist and butt now?

494
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:34,865
-My pelvis.
-You said it's gone.

495
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:37,534
It just came back.

496
00:28:37,618 --> 00:28:41,079
Didn't you see that?
It came back like this just now.

497
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:44,541
-That's so lame.
-My gosh.

498
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,419
I thought that was hilarious.

499
00:28:49,212 --> 00:28:53,383
Look at you, Dr. Do Jae-hak.
You have such a keen sense of humor.

500
00:28:55,177 --> 00:28:56,678
Send me the results right away.

501
00:28:57,262 --> 00:28:58,096
All right.

502
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:52,442
Let's go.

503
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:55,028
Get in. It's cold.

504
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,030
Hurry.

505
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,465
What if people see us?

506
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,593
Sorry, it totally slipped my mind.

507
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:21,221
Was someone there? There's no one.

508
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:22,431
Let's go.

509
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:47,289
That was Dr. Jang Gyeo-ul
and Professor Ahn Jeong-won, right?

510
00:30:47,372 --> 00:30:49,207
-Yes.
-I'm sure of it.

511
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:54,546
Did Professor Ahn just open the car door
for Dr. Jang?

512
00:30:55,297 --> 00:30:58,467
Yes, and it was so natural.

513
00:31:05,807 --> 00:31:08,602
-Professor Ahn is such a gentleman.
-Totally.

514
00:31:08,685 --> 00:31:10,145
He's incredibly well-mannered.

515
00:31:10,228 --> 00:31:12,564
The way he opened the door for her
was so natural.

516
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,817
He's such a gentleman.

517
00:31:16,318 --> 00:31:17,778
I should have applied to GS.

518
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,238
I envy Dr. Jang.

519
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:26,286
Professor Chae gave you this car?
For free?

520
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:29,748
Yes. She gave me her old car
because she bought a new one.

521
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,254
-Are your hands cold?
-Yes, a little.

522
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,662
Are you not seeing anyone?

523
00:32:10,288 --> 00:32:12,833
-What do you mean?
-I mean a girlfriend.

524
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,460
-No.
-Don't you want to date?

525
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,213
No, I don't.

526
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,800
I'll figure it out.

527
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:25,178
Don't worry. Just eat.

528
00:32:25,887 --> 00:32:28,974
Is it because of me?
Are you worried I'd fight again?

529
00:32:29,057 --> 00:32:32,602
No, I just really like how things are now.

530
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,939
I'm the happiest when I'm alone.

531
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,149
Don't you feel the same way?

532
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:40,360
Aren't you relieved that Dad's gone now?

533
00:32:40,443 --> 00:32:41,695
Jeez.

534
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,405
I mean it.

535
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,866
I love being single.

536
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:47,742
It is nice to be single.

537
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:50,745
It's comfortable, and you don't need
to worry about anyone else.

538
00:32:51,746 --> 00:32:53,164
But you see,

539
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:57,460
it's nothing compared to the joy
of being with someone you love.

540
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:02,465
Even <i>New Journey to the West</i>
would be much more enjoyable then.

541
00:33:05,468 --> 00:33:06,678
That being said,

542
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,848
-my friend has a daughter--
-Excuse me.

543
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,059
Could we get the bill?

544
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:20,567
No, Professor Ahn.
Then everyone will know.

545
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,111
No one will know.

546
00:33:25,113 --> 00:33:28,700
We're not at the hospital now.
Why are you still calling me "Professor"?

547
00:33:32,495 --> 00:33:34,247
I don't want to be called that.

548
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:37,500
Everyone will find out at this rate.
Because of you.

549
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:40,629
You're like a ticking bomb now.

550
00:33:42,297 --> 00:33:44,716
-Me?
-Did you already forget

551
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,843
what you did in the Medical Office
yesterday?

552
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:56,311
Hey, you made it.
Looks like everyone's here now.

553
00:33:56,394 --> 00:33:59,397
Did you have to gather everyone
for the retirement symposium?

554
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,191
Professor Ahn isn't here yet.

555
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,577
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

556
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:13,912
My apologies.

557
00:34:16,414 --> 00:34:17,457
What's this for?

558
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,834
The video and certificate of merit

559
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,253
for Professor Kim Jin-mo's
retirement symposium.

560
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:23,630
Right.

561
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:26,299
We've received all the video files.

562
00:34:26,383 --> 00:34:28,593
They'll compile and edit them
this weekend,

563
00:34:28,677 --> 00:34:31,262
so if you have any photos or videos…

564
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:52,742
-Jeong-won never disappoints.
-Such a gentleman!

565
00:34:52,826 --> 00:34:54,619
-We should learn from him.
-Yes!

566
00:34:54,703 --> 00:34:56,454
Hey, you should've done that for her.

567
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,748
She assisted you in two surgeries today.

568
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:01,960
My gosh, Professor Ahn. You're so good.

569
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:03,920
You take great care of the residents.

570
00:35:04,004 --> 00:35:06,297
Professor Ahn, you're so sweet.
I give you that.

571
00:35:06,381 --> 00:35:08,883
-Yes, totally.
-My goodness.

572
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:14,389
People would think that he is
Dr. Jang's boyfriend or something.

573
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:32,157
I mean, people could think that.

574
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:36,995
-Come on!
-My gosh.

575
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:39,247
-You startled me.
-No way!

576
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,833
-Who'd think that?
-You went too far with that one.

577
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,627
Professor Lee, you and your absurd jokes.

578
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:47,839
-What if things get awkward between them?
-Yes, seriously.

579
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:50,508
Right? My bad. I'm sorry, Professor Ahn.

580
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,762
No worries. It's fine.

581
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:57,140
By the way, have we decided
on the lecture topic yet?

582
00:35:57,223 --> 00:36:00,018
Yes. The director of KWMC's Cancer Center
will give a lecture

583
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,062
on the future
of minimally invasive surgery.

584
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,897
Let's talk after this, you crazy jerk.

585
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:07,358
I'm busy. I need to get
my immigration documents ready.

586
00:36:08,318 --> 00:36:12,322
We should also organize a talent show.
You're listening, right?

587
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:14,157
That feels nice.

588
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,036
Why are your cheeks so cold?

589
00:36:18,578 --> 00:36:21,456
We've only been outside for a moment,
but even your nose is red.

590
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:22,957
Go inside quickly, okay?

591
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,959
I can't, until you let go of me.

592
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,294
Right.

593
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,132
Sweet dreams.

594
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,260
Wait.

595
00:37:53,256 --> 00:37:55,592
Gosh. You're heading out now?

596
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:57,260
Yes. You should get more sleep.

597
00:37:58,636 --> 00:38:00,513
You really are something.

598
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,322
Mom, did you just make this?

599
00:38:17,822 --> 00:38:19,407
The perilla leaves taste so fresh.

600
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,827
Yes. I marinated them this morning,
one leaf at a time.

601
00:38:23,786 --> 00:38:27,874
I wanted my son to eat
the freshest perilla leaves today. Here.

602
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,127
I can't finish this, Mom.

603
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:33,463
Why can't you? You're still growing.

604
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:36,257
I'm still growing at age 41?

605
00:38:36,341 --> 00:38:39,260
I can't believe my son is already 41.

606
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:40,929
I suppose I've lived too long.

607
00:38:41,888 --> 00:38:44,015
Mom, 70 is the new 50.

608
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:46,267
You'll live another 30 years
at the very least.

609
00:38:52,774 --> 00:38:54,275
-It's so good.
-What?

610
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,028
This is the best.
The best perilla leaves I've ever had!

611
00:39:04,035 --> 00:39:07,080
That bowl is deceptive.
It's actually not that much.

612
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,292
-I can finish this.
-Good.

613
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:21,678
Mom, I like these big chunks of potatoes
in the soybean paste stew.

614
00:39:21,761 --> 00:39:25,515
Right? They're from my neighbor.
They were small, so I didn't cut them up.

615
00:39:25,598 --> 00:39:27,141
But it's actually quite nice.

616
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:28,226
Indeed.

617
00:39:29,811 --> 00:39:31,646
-Did you cook these bracken ferns?
-Yes.

618
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,357
Did you even cook bracken ferns for me?

619
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,734
-Yes.
-Here.

620
00:39:39,904 --> 00:39:40,947
-Delicious.
-Is it good?

621
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,740
Yes, because my son fed me.

622
00:39:46,452 --> 00:39:49,080
Mom, do you want coffee? Black or sweet?

623
00:39:49,163 --> 00:39:50,331
Sweet, please.

624
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:51,708
Sweet, got it.

625
00:39:53,751 --> 00:39:55,003
Who is it so early?

626
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:57,547
There's only one person
who'd come here at this hour.

627
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:11,436
Is everything okay?
Why are you staring at the falling leaves?

628
00:40:13,563 --> 00:40:14,772
Because they're like me.

629
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:22,864
Those falling leaves remind me of myself.

630
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:26,993
Is it because of your kids?

631
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:31,289
Your eldest kid's visiting Korea and
you were excited to have dinner together.

632
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:35,293
He hadn't seen me for months,
but as soon as he saw me,

633
00:40:36,294 --> 00:40:38,087
he said I should decide

634
00:40:38,629 --> 00:40:41,049
how I want to divide my assets
when I'm still healthy.

635
00:40:45,636 --> 00:40:50,183
If I just leave it until I become senile
and lose sound judgment,

636
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:53,436
my children would get into a big fight
over my assets.

637
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:57,440
He said I should sell everything now
and divide it equally.

638
00:40:57,523 --> 00:40:59,734
Did he say it in such a heartless manner?

639
00:41:01,235 --> 00:41:03,488
Yes, that's exactly what he said.

640
00:41:03,571 --> 00:41:07,033
It was actually worse than how I said it.

641
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:12,914
Gosh, I'm getting upset again
now that I'm talking about it.

642
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,460
I know that he's right.

643
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:22,715
But I have to say,
I feel so hurt and resentful.

644
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,346
I'll give them everything I own.

645
00:41:28,429 --> 00:41:32,183
Who will get all my assets
if my two sons don't?

646
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:35,436
But they're flat out asking me
to pass everything on to them.

647
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,856
It really hurt my feelings. I'm so pissed.

648
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:41,025
Darn it.

649
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,113
You said you'll give them everything
anyway.

650
00:41:46,072 --> 00:41:49,534
Go ahead and divide your assets equally
among your kids.

651
00:41:50,201 --> 00:41:53,329
Geon-tae must've hesitated for days
before he brought it up to you.

652
00:41:53,913 --> 00:41:55,790
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

653
00:41:57,542 --> 00:42:02,547
Rosa, my son is not like Jeong-won.

654
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:08,094
Jeong-won is one of a kind.

655
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,348
Even if he told me he'd go on
to become a priest now,

656
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:14,225
I wouldn't doubt him for a second.

657
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:15,768
-Hey!
-Watch.

658
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,022
Jeong-won.

659
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:24,110
-Yes?
-You know that your mother owns

660
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,988
some land in Hwaseong, right?
It's well over 10,000 <i>pyeong</i>.

661
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:29,782
She inherited it from her father.

662
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:32,326
Yes, I think I remember hearing about it.

663
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:36,038
She'll give it to you, as inheritance.

664
00:42:36,122 --> 00:42:37,165
What?

665
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:40,835
Mom, really?

666
00:42:40,918 --> 00:42:43,337
Yes, really. It's all yours.

667
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:46,257
Why?

668
00:42:47,842 --> 00:42:50,136
Why would you give it to me?
I don't need it.

669
00:42:55,808 --> 00:42:59,395
Just sell it and buy a nice apartment
so you can live comfortably.

670
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:02,732
Working on your vegetable garden
will make your back worse.

671
00:43:03,357 --> 00:43:06,819
If you need more money,
I'll take out a loan and help you out.

672
00:43:08,196 --> 00:43:09,197
A loan?

673
00:43:10,031 --> 00:43:11,949
You're a doctor! Are you that broke?

674
00:43:13,117 --> 00:43:14,952
Do you need a loan?

675
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:18,956
No, that's not what I meant.
A loan is an asset too.

676
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,250
-Not everyone can get a loan, Mom.
-Be quiet!

677
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,851
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

678
00:43:41,646 --> 00:43:46,025
JI-AM MEDICAL CENTER
JANG JONG-GIL

679
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:53,783
-<i>Hey.</i>
-I'll do it.

680
00:43:53,866 --> 00:43:55,618
-<i>Really?</i>
-I think I can do it.

681
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:59,038
<i>I'm so relieved.
I hope it's not too much to ask though.</i>

682
00:43:59,914 --> 00:44:01,290
It won't be easy,

683
00:44:01,374 --> 00:44:03,668
but it's a borderline case,
so I'd say it's doable.

684
00:44:03,751 --> 00:44:06,420
I have operated on a patient
with a lower GRWR,

685
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:08,464
and the surgery went well.

686
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:11,759
And the test results tell me
that his son is young and healthy.

687
00:44:11,842 --> 00:44:13,761
It's a borderline case, but it's doable.

688
00:44:13,844 --> 00:44:15,638
His liver is barely functioning,

689
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,598
and we can't find another donor for him.

690
00:44:17,682 --> 00:44:20,518
So I think we should take the risk
and give it a shot.

691
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:23,354
Let's have him come in on Monday
and get him tested.

692
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:25,940
<i>Okay, I'll text Hyeong-do.</i>

693
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:28,859
No, just text me his number.

694
00:44:28,943 --> 00:44:31,320
I'll call him.
I have some questions for him anyway.

695
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:34,907
<i>Really? He doesn't know
that I'm Daddy-Long-Legs.</i>

696
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,578
Hey, what do you take me for?

697
00:44:39,954 --> 00:44:43,040
I'll tell him Social Services
gave me the deets.

698
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:44,917
<i>Okay, we'll tell him that.</i>

699
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:46,794
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye.

700
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:00,391
Did you wash your hands?

701
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:05,604
Well done.

702
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:07,648
What do you want to eat?

703
00:45:07,732 --> 00:45:10,776
I have to do some work from home,
so we'll order in. Is that okay?

704
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,403
-Yes.
-Great.

705
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:15,406
How about I guess
what you feel like eating?

706
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,408
Sure, it's a multiple-choice question.

707
00:45:18,117 --> 00:45:19,827
You know what that means?

708
00:45:21,412 --> 00:45:22,538
Tell me the options.

709
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:25,541
Choose the dish
U-ju is craving the most right now.

710
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:28,954
Wait, that sounds too hard.
I don't think I can do this.

711
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:31,917
Choose the dish
U-ju is craving the most right now.

712
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,379
Wait, that sounds too hard.
I don't think I can do this.

713
00:45:35,963 --> 00:45:37,339
Number one, a hamburger.

714
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:40,801
Number two, a burger.

715
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:43,721
-Number three.
-Yes.

716
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,557
Wait, hold on.

717
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,101
Hang on…

718
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:51,353
Don't you remember?

719
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:55,190
Then hold on, U-ju.

720
00:45:55,274 --> 00:45:59,319
Let's hurry home. You can try to remember
what it was while eating your burger.

721
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,320
Let's go.

722
00:46:02,364 --> 00:46:03,782
Let's see.

723
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,457
Did you have lunch?
Tell me what kind of burger you want.

724
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,041
I had lunch just now.

725
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:15,586
I'll go pick up the packages.

726
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:18,630
Okay. U-ju, I'm going to order you
a Happy Meal. Which one?

727
00:46:18,714 --> 00:46:21,967
-The bulgogi burger, nuggets--
-I want the bulgogi burger combo.

728
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,762
I want French fries and juice.

729
00:46:25,345 --> 00:46:27,473
Goodness, he knows the menu by heart.

730
00:46:27,556 --> 00:46:29,808
-What about you, Dad?
-Me?

731
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,186
What should I get?

732
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,855
You? You should order
the supreme shrimp burger.

733
00:46:34,938 --> 00:46:37,858
-Supreme shrimp?
-Yes, the large set.

734
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:40,194
Get cheese sticks instead of French fries.

735
00:46:40,277 --> 00:46:43,030
And get cola.
I'm going to have a sip, okay?

736
00:46:43,113 --> 00:46:44,072
Yes, sir.

737
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:52,748
Is it good?

738
00:46:54,792 --> 00:46:56,710
I make really good burgers.

739
00:46:58,045 --> 00:47:00,839
How about I flaunt my cooking skills
sometime next week?

740
00:47:01,757 --> 00:47:04,092
Let's just order in. This tastes better.

741
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,766
Is everything going well
with Mo-ne and Ma-ne?

742
00:47:11,934 --> 00:47:14,770
Ma-ne and Mo-ne always go camping
with their dad.

743
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:16,647
-Camping?
-Yes.

744
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,358
They brag every day
about going camping with their dad.

745
00:47:19,441 --> 00:47:21,360
They go every weekend.

746
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:24,404
-Do you want to go camping too?
-Yes.

747
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:26,949
We can go too. Let's go camping.

748
00:47:27,032 --> 00:47:28,367
-Really?
-Yes.

749
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,330
-Hey.
-<i>Professor, Kim Eun-sun is vomiting blood.</i>

750
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:35,207
<i>Gastric variceal bleeding is suspected.</i>

751
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,334
<i>We're using the SB tube. It's better,</i>

752
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:39,753
<i>-but the bleeding won't stop.</i>
-I'll be there soon.

753
00:47:39,837 --> 00:47:43,507
Check her vitals and call Gastroenterology
for an emergency endoscopy.

754
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,968
We may not be able to do it,
so get a CT scan done

755
00:47:46,051 --> 00:47:48,387
and see if she can get TIPS done.

756
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:50,347
Okay.

757
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:54,726
See you later, Dad.

758
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:57,896
It's okay. I'm used to it.

759
00:47:59,022 --> 00:48:00,315
I'm sorry, sweetie.

760
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:03,944
No, Dad. You don't need to be sorry.

761
00:48:05,821 --> 00:48:07,614
You're doing good deeds.

762
00:48:08,407 --> 00:48:10,492
You want to spend time with me,
your universe.

763
00:48:10,576 --> 00:48:13,871
But you're busy saving
the bigger universe out there.

764
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:17,249
-Who said that?
-Auntie Ik-sun.

765
00:48:25,507 --> 00:48:26,925
I'll be quick.

766
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:30,470
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

767
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:33,098
ANESTHESIA DURATION, CURRENT TIME,
ELAPSED TIME

768
00:48:36,894 --> 00:48:40,522
Chief Kwon was really worried.
The recovery will be okay, right?

769
00:48:40,606 --> 00:48:43,275
There was minimal blood loss,
and the incision is small.

770
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:45,444
There's sufficient remnant liver volume,

771
00:48:46,028 --> 00:48:48,447
-so recovery won't be a problem.
-Okay.

772
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:49,823
Good job, everyone.

773
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,074
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

774
00:48:51,158 --> 00:48:52,492
Well done.

775
00:49:00,334 --> 00:49:01,627
Why didn't you come in?

776
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,004
Thanks for doing this.
You finished pretty early.

777
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,716
Yes. Thankfully, it wasn't big
as we had seen on the MRI scan,

778
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:10,427
and the location wasn't bad either.

779
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,931
The surgery went well, and there's
sufficient remnant liver volume.

780
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:15,766
So I don't think you need to worry.

781
00:49:18,268 --> 00:49:20,145
My goodness.

782
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:24,358
Were you that worried?
Then you should've just done it yourself.

783
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:27,611
No other doctor has performed
more liver resections than you have.

784
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,656
This was my brother's request,
and I said yes right away.

785
00:49:31,406 --> 00:49:32,324
What request?

786
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:35,077
He said I'd feel too pressured

787
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,870
and end up ruining the surgery.

788
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:39,373
He asked me to recommend
the best doctor I trust.

789
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,168
Don't you have appointments right away?

790
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:46,004
I'm sorry. I owe you big-time.

791
00:49:46,088 --> 00:49:47,464
I'll return the favor tenfold.

792
00:49:47,547 --> 00:49:49,466
Gosh, don't mention it.

793
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:52,594
I still have some time
until my first appointment.

794
00:49:52,678 --> 00:49:53,679
Buy me a coffee.

795
00:49:53,762 --> 00:49:56,723
Sure thing. I can even buy you
a coffee machine if you'd like.

796
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:57,724
Let's go!

797
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,434
Actually, forget it.

798
00:49:59,935 --> 00:50:01,103
Well…

799
00:50:01,979 --> 00:50:03,647
I don't want to have coffee with you.

800
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:05,565
What? Why are you so fickle?

801
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:07,693
I'll get coffee in my own time.

802
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:11,697
I don't want to start my morning
with a coffee date with you.

803
00:50:15,242 --> 00:50:17,244
You should get some rest, Chief Kwon.

804
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:19,371
You have to do a transplant later.

805
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:22,791
I want to wait for my brother.

806
00:50:22,874 --> 00:50:24,167
I'll wait until he wakes up.

807
00:50:28,547 --> 00:50:32,926
Professor Lee, don't hesitate to tell me
if there's anything I can do for you.

808
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,428
I'll help you, no matter what.

809
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:36,388
Okay, thank you.

810
00:50:37,848 --> 00:50:38,849
See you.

811
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,352
-Thanks again.
-No problem.

812
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:14,593
Good morning, Professor Chae.

813
00:51:15,177 --> 00:51:16,219
Hi, good morning.

814
00:51:16,303 --> 00:51:17,971
Have some bread.

815
00:51:18,055 --> 00:51:19,389
Thanks.

816
00:51:19,473 --> 00:51:22,267
-Don't you have a conference?
-I still have some time.

817
00:51:22,768 --> 00:51:24,770
I wanted to stop by quickly to see you.

818
00:51:25,812 --> 00:51:28,607
I'll be here all week.
Seok-min's farewell party is this week.

819
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:32,736
Gosh, I really don't understand
why he's leaving.

820
00:51:33,695 --> 00:51:34,738
Did you guys fight?

821
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:37,074
Yes, we're in a cold war at the moment.

822
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:42,537
By the way, has Ms. Yoo's mother asked you
if you'd be interested in a blind date?

823
00:51:43,747 --> 00:51:46,124
She asks me about you
every time she sees me.

824
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:48,585
"How old is she?
Does she have a boyfriend?

825
00:51:48,668 --> 00:51:51,922
What does her father do?
Which school did she go to?"

826
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,216
She didn't say much
when I was doing rounds.

827
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:57,344
She must be asking me instead
because she's intimidated by you.

828
00:51:57,427 --> 00:52:00,055
She has a son
and thinks you'd make a good couple.

829
00:52:00,138 --> 00:52:02,516
She asks me questions about you
whenever she sees me.

830
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,186
If she says she wants to set you up
with her son--

831
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:07,979
I told her I'm not interested.

832
00:52:08,563 --> 00:52:09,773
What?

833
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:12,609
She already asked me,
and I turned it down.

834
00:52:12,692 --> 00:52:14,319
I see. I'm relieved to hear that.

835
00:52:15,946 --> 00:52:18,740
Why would I go on a blind date
with my patient's brother?

836
00:52:18,824 --> 00:52:20,617
I told her I'm not comfortable with it.

837
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,953
She probably won't give up.

838
00:52:23,662 --> 00:52:26,081
Just tell her that you have a boyfriend.

839
00:52:26,164 --> 00:52:27,916
Do I have to lie?

840
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:29,292
I don't care.

841
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:30,752
But it's annoying.

842
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:33,421
Just pick one of your friends
and say he's your boyfriend.

843
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:35,298
Tell her you're getting married soon.

844
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:37,884
Otherwise, she really won't give up.

845
00:52:39,886 --> 00:52:41,054
What about him?

846
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:43,932
The owner of Yulje Medical Center.
A rich heir.

847
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:47,477
Hey, what's the song for this week?

848
00:52:48,562 --> 00:52:51,398
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

849
00:52:51,481 --> 00:52:52,899
"I Like You."

850
00:52:55,152 --> 00:52:57,112
-Who picked it?
-Ik-jun.

851
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:00,824
Is he trying to kill us or what?

852
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,579
Jeong-won doesn't own this hospital.

853
00:53:05,662 --> 00:53:07,998
This hospital doesn't have an owner.

854
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:10,125
I'll take care of it, okay?

855
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:11,877
Then what about him?

856
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:14,504
If it's him, they'll believe you.

857
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:17,507
Your best friend,

858
00:53:17,591 --> 00:53:20,218
who always makes you laugh.

859
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:23,889
-Professor Lee Ik-jun.
-Oh, right.

860
00:53:23,972 --> 00:53:26,975
If you ask him,
he'll totally do it for you.

861
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:30,687
He's busy, and so am I.

862
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:34,524
But you know what?
You're the busiest one here, Seon-bin.

863
00:53:35,525 --> 00:53:36,610
I have to go.

864
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:43,450
-Hello?
-<i>Good morning.</i>

865
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,454
Good morning, Hyeong-do.
You should be here if you're that worried.

866
00:53:47,996 --> 00:53:49,247
<i>Have you met him yet?</i>

867
00:53:49,831 --> 00:53:51,583
No, but he's my first patient today.

868
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:54,461
<i>Can you squeeze in his surgery?
I hope he can get it soon.</i>

869
00:53:55,253 --> 00:53:57,881
Yes, my surgery on Friday
has been moved to next week,

870
00:53:57,964 --> 00:54:00,884
so I should be able to do it this Friday
if everything's ready.

871
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:03,386
Seriously though, if you have some time,

872
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,971
come join us this Friday.

873
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,806
You've done so much for this patient.

874
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:08,850
It'd be nice to see him
before his surgery.

875
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:11,228
Or scrub in and help me out.

876
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:14,189
<i>I want to watch the surgery,
but why this Friday of all days?</i>

877
00:54:14,272 --> 00:54:16,483
<i>I'm doing my first transplant
in four months.</i>

878
00:54:17,484 --> 00:54:19,819
Nice. Just your hospital?

879
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,405
<i>Yes, it's just us this time.</i>

880
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:24,115
<i>It's for a longtime patient,</i>

881
00:54:24,199 --> 00:54:26,117
<i>who trusts us to perform the surgery.</i>

882
00:54:26,201 --> 00:54:27,661
I see. Congratulations.

883
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:32,165
Do you have enough staff?
How many assistants do you have?

884
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:33,959
<i>One fellow and one resident.</i>

885
00:54:34,042 --> 00:54:36,044
<i>The resident is only in his second year,</i>

886
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:38,505
<i>but the fellow will closely assist me.
He's good.</i>

887
00:54:38,588 --> 00:54:41,675
Look at you. You're a trailblazer.

888
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:43,760
I'd love to visit you.

889
00:54:44,261 --> 00:54:47,389
<i>Just make sure you save my patient.
He's a wonderful person.</i>

890
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:50,267
<i>I treated his liver cancer
for several years.</i>

891
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:53,770
<i>He used to volunteer at nursing homes
before his health started to decline,</i>

892
00:54:53,853 --> 00:54:56,523
<i>and he donates 10,000 won
to a children's home every month.</i>

893
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,651
<i>He's someone I admire
before he's my patient.</i>

894
00:54:59,734 --> 00:55:03,613
Okay, I'm meeting him soon.
I'll tell him I know you.

895
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,032
Hey, Hyeong-do.

896
00:55:07,701 --> 00:55:11,579
About your uncle…
He still owns that club, right?

897
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:14,249
<i>My uncle owns a club?</i>

898
00:55:15,709 --> 00:55:17,752
<i>He's been meditating in silence
for 98 days.</i>

899
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:18,712
Bye.

900
00:55:33,435 --> 00:55:35,520
This surgery won't be easy.

901
00:55:37,147 --> 00:55:40,984
The low GRWR does concern me a little.

902
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:44,612
However,

903
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:47,991
the donor is young

904
00:55:48,575 --> 00:55:50,368
and very healthy.

905
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:53,788
His liver is in great condition,
so with this size…

906
00:55:54,456 --> 00:55:55,999
I think we can do the surgery.

907
00:55:58,376 --> 00:55:59,753
Thank you.

908
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:02,547
-Thank you so much, Professor Lee.
-Thank you.

909
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,840
It is a borderline case.

910
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:06,634
You look quite skinny,
but you're very healthy.

911
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:09,346
Thank you, Professor.

912
00:56:09,429 --> 00:56:10,597
Let's give it a shot.

913
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:14,851
And to be honest,
we have no other option at the moment.

914
00:56:15,435 --> 00:56:16,770
Yes, I'm aware.

915
00:56:16,853 --> 00:56:19,647
A liver transplant is
your father's only option now.

916
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:22,650
And since you're the only suitable donor,

917
00:56:22,734 --> 00:56:23,818
we have to do this.

918
00:56:25,028 --> 00:56:26,654
I'll do my very best.

919
00:56:28,281 --> 00:56:31,409
It'll be an emergency surgery.
He'll be admitted right away,

920
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:33,870
and we need to run a few additional tests.

921
00:56:33,953 --> 00:56:36,790
And the surgery will be this Friday.

922
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:39,376
One of my surgeries has been rescheduled,

923
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:42,670
so we'll do it this Friday
if there are no issues.

924
00:56:43,797 --> 00:56:45,340
Thank you, Professor Lee.

925
00:56:46,049 --> 00:56:48,343
I heard many people die

926
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:54,099
because they can't find donors.

927
00:56:54,682 --> 00:56:57,268
Compared to them, I'm…

928
00:56:59,646 --> 00:57:02,816
I'm incredibly lucky.

929
00:57:05,568 --> 00:57:06,569
Doctor.

930
00:57:07,404 --> 00:57:11,408
I can handle pain,

931
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,244
but my son…

932
00:57:16,996 --> 00:57:20,875
He has to undergo surgery because of me.

933
00:57:23,461 --> 00:57:24,879
So please…

934
00:57:26,673 --> 00:57:30,009
make sure the entire process is painless
for my son.

935
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:31,302
Yes, I will.

936
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:36,808
I'll make sure his surgery is
completely painless. Don't worry.

937
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:41,896
Thank you. Thank you so much.

938
00:57:43,106 --> 00:57:45,692
It's okay. This happens fairly often.

939
00:57:45,775 --> 00:57:49,195
It's caused
by a bilateral pleural effusion.

940
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:52,407
But hopefully, the cardiac stimulant
and diuretics will be helpful.

941
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:53,575
We'll wait and see.

942
00:57:54,701 --> 00:57:55,702
Okay.

943
00:57:56,995 --> 00:58:00,331
We're monitoring his condition thoroughly,
so don't worry too much.

944
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:02,125
Okay, thank you.

945
00:58:04,794 --> 00:58:07,005
Excuse me. Hey.

946
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,676
How's the BP?
Do the hands and feet feel warm?

947
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:15,263
I'm coming now.

948
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:16,890
We'll talk soon.

949
00:58:44,292 --> 00:58:46,336
Mr. Son Chan-gyu, are you thirsty?

950
00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:48,171
Yes, I'm parched.

951
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:50,298
He's thirsty.

952
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:54,052
His CVP is low,
and his fluid balance is negative,

953
00:58:54,135 --> 00:58:56,638
so don't reduce the input.
You can actually increase it.

954
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:58,598
-Call me if anything happens.
-Yes, sir.

955
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:04,896
-Hello, Professor Kim.
-Hi.

956
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:07,232
There are two types of VAD,
internal and external.

957
00:59:07,315 --> 00:59:11,402
Only the external type can be used
on infants and young children.

958
00:59:11,486 --> 00:59:13,029
-Yes.
-The power source

959
00:59:13,112 --> 00:59:16,449
and control unit outside shut down
within 30 minutes if disconnected,

960
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:18,201
so hospitalization is required.

961
00:59:18,284 --> 00:59:20,286
But adults can get the implantable type,

962
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,081
so they can be discharged
and wait to receive a transplant.

963
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:25,458
-Good.
-Also, they operate differently.

964
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:28,378
Then what is
the most basic factor considered

965
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:30,129
for selecting a compatible donor?

966
00:59:34,425 --> 00:59:35,552
This is basic knowledge.

967
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,726
-Blood type?
-Yes, the blood types must be compatible.

968
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:46,855
I can't believe
you had to think that long about this.

969
00:59:47,397 --> 00:59:48,523
Right?

970
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:51,734
This is not good.

971
01:00:00,326 --> 01:00:02,078
Looks like you'll have to study a lot.

972
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:05,206
The difficulty level
is all over the place.

973
01:00:06,207 --> 01:00:11,754
But I hope Professor Kim knows
that I'm a fixed intern.

974
01:00:12,505 --> 01:00:14,424
I'm sure he knows.

975
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:16,801
He interviewed you himself
as the department chief.

976
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,306
Right? I'm already afraid of CS.

977
01:00:46,122 --> 01:00:47,373
What are you doing here?

978
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:50,335
Just making eye contact with Gyeong-mi.

979
01:00:50,418 --> 01:00:52,921
-Professor Cheon's patient?
-Yes.

980
01:00:54,631 --> 01:00:56,633
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

981
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:06,267
She's Professor Cheon's patient.
Our eyes met when I was walking by.

982
01:01:06,351 --> 01:01:09,270
She smiled at me with her eyes,
so I smiled back.

983
01:01:09,354 --> 01:01:13,149
She had an aortic dissection while riding
her bike, right? She had surgery.

984
01:01:13,232 --> 01:01:15,902
Yes, she's been diagnosed
with a hereditary disease.

985
01:01:17,445 --> 01:01:19,822
Her treatment had been going well,

986
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:22,659
but a dissection occurred
when she was riding her bike.

987
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,744
And the fall damaged
her C3 and C4 vertebrae.

988
01:01:25,495 --> 01:01:27,747
She might end up a quadriplegic.

989
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:29,248
The surgery was also difficult.

990
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:32,335
It's scary because you never know
when a dissection can occur.

991
01:01:32,418 --> 01:01:34,045
Her family must be very worried.

992
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:35,296
She has no family.

993
01:01:36,339 --> 01:01:37,632
She's an orphan.

994
01:01:37,715 --> 01:01:39,258
Isn't there a guardian?

995
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:42,929
There's no one. No family or relatives.

996
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,889
There's a nun who visits her sometimes,

997
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:47,600
but I've been stopping by
every single day,

998
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:49,852
and she's always alone.

999
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,399
I wish I could keep her company,

1000
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:55,942
but I don't have time.

1001
01:02:22,385 --> 01:02:27,140
Eun-ji has had a pleural effusion too.

1002
01:02:30,018 --> 01:02:32,061
I was really worried too back then.

1003
01:02:33,604 --> 01:02:35,398
But she overcame it.

1004
01:02:39,152 --> 01:02:40,653
It'll be okay.

1005
01:02:43,072 --> 01:02:45,533
You haven't eaten anything yet, right?

1006
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:50,413
I brought some apples.
Let's eat it together.

1007
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:52,832
Come on.

1008
01:03:10,308 --> 01:03:12,727
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1009
01:03:13,811 --> 01:03:14,812
What about here?

1010
01:03:14,896 --> 01:03:16,814
-None.
-None? Did you double-check?

1011
01:03:21,694 --> 01:03:22,904
Hello.

1012
01:03:22,987 --> 01:03:24,655
-Hello.
-Hello.

1013
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:38,252
My gosh, Professor Lee.

1014
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:40,797
-Hello, Professor Lee.
-Hello.

1015
01:03:41,464 --> 01:03:43,633
Your surgery is tomorrow.
How are you feeling?

1016
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,593
Good.

1017
01:03:46,511 --> 01:03:48,221
I feel great.

1018
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:50,139
What about you?

1019
01:03:50,223 --> 01:03:51,432
I feel great too.

1020
01:03:51,516 --> 01:03:54,060
I'm glad to hear that. I feel great too.

1021
01:03:54,143 --> 01:03:59,023
Professor Lee,
I was totally fine until yesterday.

1022
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:03,069
But this morning, it suddenly hit me
that the surgery is tomorrow.

1023
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:06,364
And my heart has been pounding like crazy
since then.

1024
01:04:06,447 --> 01:04:08,908
Even my hands are trembling.

1025
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:11,828
I'm more nervous and anxious
than they are.

1026
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:14,080
Don't worry too much.

1027
01:04:14,163 --> 01:04:15,706
It is a big, difficult surgery,

1028
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,625
but I'll be the one dealing with it.

1029
01:04:17,708 --> 01:04:20,795
When they wake up from their sleep,
it'll all be over already.

1030
01:04:20,878 --> 01:04:23,881
So try not to worry,
and take good care of yourself today.

1031
01:04:23,965 --> 01:04:25,383
Thank you, Professor Lee.

1032
01:04:25,466 --> 01:04:27,927
And if you…

1033
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:33,599
get a chance to talk
to Professor Baek Hyeong-do,

1034
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:40,648
please let him know
how grateful I am for all his help.

1035
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:43,985
You said the two of you
went to med school together.

1036
01:04:44,068 --> 01:04:45,820
Yes, we talk often on the phone.

1037
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:48,698
I plan to visit him after my surgery,

1038
01:04:49,824 --> 01:04:51,325
but I still want to tell him

1039
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:54,537
that I'll come see him soon,
happy and healthy.

1040
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:59,834
Please tell him not to worry too much.

1041
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:02,670
I'll definitely relay the message.

1042
01:05:02,753 --> 01:05:04,255
All right, get some rest.

1043
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:05,381
-Will do.
-Thank you.

1044
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:08,759
-Your surgery ended early.
-Yes.

1045
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:10,595
Didn't you say you had surgery too?

1046
01:05:10,678 --> 01:05:13,681
Yes, I should eat quickly and go.
I have a few minutes.

1047
01:05:26,152 --> 01:05:27,445
Did you not have breakfast?

1048
01:05:28,446 --> 01:05:29,864
Is this your first meal?

1049
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:32,950
I had breakfast.

1050
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:36,370
I just couldn't pass up this meat dish,
which I love.

1051
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:41,542
Hey, why did you have to
discourage her like that?

1052
01:05:41,626 --> 01:05:45,713
What will you do if she's too embarrassed
to finish her food now…

1053
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:54,764
-Song-hwa.
-Yes?

1054
01:05:54,847 --> 01:05:57,725
You should pay extra
if you have a conscience.

1055
01:05:58,643 --> 01:05:59,644
Okay.

1056
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:05,524
I heard Hyeong-do sent his patient to you
for surgery.

1057
01:06:06,025 --> 01:06:09,278
This is the first surgery
Daddy-Long-Legs is sponsoring.

1058
01:06:09,862 --> 01:06:11,072
This is great.

1059
01:06:11,155 --> 01:06:13,574
-I think this is a good direction for us.
-Yes.

1060
01:06:13,658 --> 01:06:15,493
How do you know about Daddy-Long-Legs?

1061
01:06:19,413 --> 01:06:20,414
I'm just kidding.

1062
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:24,835
Jeez, you freak.

1063
01:06:25,836 --> 01:06:27,588
How's Hyeong-do doing?

1064
01:06:27,672 --> 01:06:29,548
He was this prick's rival.

1065
01:06:29,632 --> 01:06:31,300
That reminds me. I have to call him.

1066
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:39,934
Hey, can you talk now?

1067
01:06:40,017 --> 01:06:41,560
<i>Yes, what's up?</i>

1068
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:43,771
Mr. Jang Jong-gil says hi.

1069
01:06:43,854 --> 01:06:46,691
He asked me to tell you
not to worry about his surgery.

1070
01:06:46,774 --> 01:06:49,318
<i>Why would I be worried
when you're doing the surgery?</i>

1071
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:53,281
<i>Tell him I'm not worried at all
and that I send him my best regards.</i>

1072
01:06:53,364 --> 01:06:55,324
Is everything okay?
You sound a little down.

1073
01:06:57,410 --> 01:06:59,620
<i>My surgery is tomorrow,
but something happened.</i>

1074
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:01,789
<i>I don't think
we can do the surgery tomorrow.</i>

1075
01:07:01,872 --> 01:07:03,082
What happened?

1076
01:07:03,165 --> 01:07:06,335
<i>The fellow had a cerebral hemorrhage
and collapsed this morning.</i>

1077
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:10,214
<i>Thankfully, he's in surgery now,
so he'll live.</i>

1078
01:07:11,173 --> 01:07:13,384
<i>But the problem is the surgery tomorrow.</i>

1079
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:16,137
<i>I asked a university hospital nearby
to send us a doctor,</i>

1080
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:18,222
<i>but they're short-staffed too.</i>

1081
01:07:19,056 --> 01:07:20,766
<i>Looks like we have to reschedule it.</i>

1082
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:24,520
<i>But I can't bring myself
to tell the patient.</i>

1083
01:07:24,603 --> 01:07:26,939
Hey, hold on.
Jeong-won, can you clean up for me?

1084
01:07:28,482 --> 01:07:29,567
Sure.

1085
01:07:30,276 --> 01:07:34,155
Sol's mother from Tongyeong signed a lease
for a room near the hospital.

1086
01:07:34,238 --> 01:07:38,284
Really? That's such good news.
It's been so hard for her.

1087
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,119
We could at least go home to shower.

1088
01:07:40,202 --> 01:07:43,748
She always washed up at the sauna
and slept uncomfortably there.

1089
01:07:44,457 --> 01:07:48,753
She told me that we can shower and sleep
at her place whenever we need to.

1090
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:50,963
She even gave me her door code.

1091
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:53,966
That's very kind of her.

1092
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:57,845
How long has Sol been hooked up
to the ECMO?

1093
01:07:57,928 --> 01:07:59,805
It's been a while.

1094
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:01,891
Not as long as Eun-ji though.

1095
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:03,142
I see.

1096
01:08:03,225 --> 01:08:06,187
My goodness. Why is the nurse calling?

1097
01:08:08,314 --> 01:08:09,607
Yes, hello.

1098
01:08:13,819 --> 01:08:14,945
Sorry?

1099
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:20,785
Really?

1100
01:08:20,868 --> 01:08:24,372
<i>Yes, Min-chan is the first one
on the list.</i>

1101
01:08:24,455 --> 01:08:27,625
<i>KONOS just called us. The first
brain death diagnosis is confirmed,</i>

1102
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:29,627
<i>and Min-chan is getting the heart.</i>

1103
01:08:34,548 --> 01:08:35,883
Thank you.

1104
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:38,636
Thank you so much.

1105
01:08:40,721 --> 01:08:43,057
This isn't a dream, right?

1106
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,893
<i>No, it's not.
You're at the hospital now, right?</i>

1107
01:08:45,976 --> 01:08:49,188
<i>Come to the PICU. Professor Kim
will fill you in on the details.</i>

1108
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:51,982
Okay, I'm coming now.

1109
01:08:56,153 --> 01:08:58,489
What should I do? My gosh…

1110
01:08:58,989 --> 01:09:01,784
What's going on?
Did they find a donor for Min-chan?

1111
01:09:01,867 --> 01:09:05,830
Yes, Min-chan is getting the heart.

1112
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:09,250
They chose Min-chan.

1113
01:09:10,543 --> 01:09:12,378
Hurry and go.

1114
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:14,380
You don't have time to cry now. Hurry.

1115
01:09:15,256 --> 01:09:17,758
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1116
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,304
This is a miracle!

1117
01:09:45,202 --> 01:09:46,745
We found a donor this morning.

1118
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,415
Considering the blood type, weight,
and so on,

1119
01:09:49,498 --> 01:09:51,208
Min-chan was at the top of our list.

1120
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:54,128
But we thought the situation could change,

1121
01:09:54,211 --> 01:09:56,213
so we waited
for the brain death declaration.

1122
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:58,132
And we just got a call from KONOS.

1123
01:09:58,215 --> 01:10:00,968
The first assessment
and the transplant have been confirmed.

1124
01:10:01,594 --> 01:10:04,138
Min-chan's getting the heart,

1125
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:06,223
and we'll go ahead with the transplant.

1126
01:10:07,725 --> 01:10:10,019
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Professor Kim.

1127
01:10:10,895 --> 01:10:13,230
The donor is 6 years old and weighs 18kg.

1128
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:15,900
Blood type A,
which is the same as Min-chan's.

1129
01:10:17,318 --> 01:10:20,946
My gosh, I can't believe
this miracle is happening to us.

1130
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,201
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1131
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:30,873
Don't thank me. Thank the donor's family
for making such a difficult decision--

1132
01:10:30,956 --> 01:10:33,542
Yes, I will live with a grateful heart

1133
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:37,630
until the day I die.

1134
01:10:41,425 --> 01:10:44,178
Yes, but they still have to do
the second assessment

1135
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:45,721
and make the final decision,

1136
01:10:46,305 --> 01:10:48,849
so the transplant surgery won't happen
until tomorrow.

1137
01:10:48,933 --> 01:10:50,726
Don't stay up all night here.

1138
01:10:50,809 --> 01:10:54,146
You should go home, get some rest,
and come back tomorrow.

1139
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:57,733
-Okay.
-Okay.

1140
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:01,111
I guess you're not going home.

1141
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:05,074
We want to stay here with Min-chan.

1142
01:11:05,157 --> 01:11:06,033
Yes.

1143
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:08,202
All right, then.

1144
01:11:10,204 --> 01:11:11,288
Thank you.

1145
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:12,873
Congratulations.

1146
01:11:13,499 --> 01:11:15,042
I'm so happy for you.

1147
01:11:15,626 --> 01:11:18,045
-It really is a miracle.
-Thank you.

1148
01:11:18,128 --> 01:11:21,173
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1149
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:23,050
I know how worried you were.

1150
01:11:23,133 --> 01:11:26,512
-Min-chan will become healthy in no time.
-Congratulations.

1151
01:11:33,602 --> 01:11:35,271
-Professor Kim.
-Yes.

1152
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,360
Eun-ji's turn will come too, right?

1153
01:11:45,364 --> 01:11:47,074
Yes, of course.

1154
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:49,285
I trust that it will.

1155
01:11:51,579 --> 01:11:52,788
Yes.

1156
01:11:58,335 --> 01:12:00,754
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1157
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:27,948
Is your class over?

1158
01:12:28,032 --> 01:12:30,034
<i>Yes, I'm home now.</i>

1159
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:32,786
You seem to be in a great mood.

1160
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:34,204
<i>You can tell?</i>

1161
01:12:34,288 --> 01:12:36,540
Yes, it's so obvious.

1162
01:12:37,249 --> 01:12:40,127
<i>I'm going on a trip with my friends
this weekend.</i>

1163
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:42,713
<i>We're going to Bournemouth,
for three days!</i>

1164
01:12:42,796 --> 01:12:46,800
Really? That's great. Have fun.
Who are you going with?

1165
01:12:46,884 --> 01:12:50,929
<i>Se-gyeong and a couple Se-gyeong knows.
Four people in total.</i>

1166
01:12:51,013 --> 01:12:52,431
<i>We're going to rent a car.</i>

1167
01:12:52,514 --> 01:12:55,351
Really? Will you be okay?
They drive on the opposite side.

1168
01:12:55,434 --> 01:12:57,436
Just take the train or bus.

1169
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:59,938
<i>I won't be driving.
Se-gyeong's friend will.</i>

1170
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:02,066
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1171
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:05,611
Okay. Call me when you're leaving
and when you arrive there.

1172
01:13:05,694 --> 01:13:08,572
<i>Will do. I'll be sure to report to you.</i>

1173
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:11,784
Gosh, I'm really worried.

1174
01:13:11,867 --> 01:13:13,952
<i>Why are you worried?</i>

1175
01:13:14,036 --> 01:13:17,206
<i>Professor Kim, I'm turning 40 soon.</i>

1176
01:13:17,289 --> 01:13:20,376
What does that have to do with driving?

1177
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:22,795
Anyway,
make sure your friend drives safely.

1178
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:24,380
<i>Will do!</i>

1179
01:13:25,047 --> 01:13:27,257
<i>I'm hungry. I need to eat something.</i>

1180
01:13:27,341 --> 01:13:29,593
-<i>Bye!</i>
-Bye.

1181
01:13:55,911 --> 01:13:56,912
Come in.

1182
01:13:59,081 --> 01:14:02,000
Do you want to step out with me
for some fresh air?

1183
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:03,127
The stars are out.

1184
01:14:06,505 --> 01:14:07,339
Sure.

1185
01:14:09,049 --> 01:14:10,759
It'd be great if you could scrub in.

1186
01:14:10,843 --> 01:14:13,804
Dr. Park's my main assistant.
You can be the second assistant.

1187
01:14:14,638 --> 01:14:17,808
Or I'll take care
of the procurement for you.

1188
01:14:20,728 --> 01:14:22,646
Really? I'd love that.

1189
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:25,983
Yes, that'd be better.
Let the kids have the opportunity.

1190
01:14:38,954 --> 01:14:40,164
What's wrong?

1191
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:43,000
Hang on a minute.

1192
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:52,676
Okay.

-Let's remove the heart now.
-Okay.

1197
01:16:26,311 --> 01:16:28,313
Professor Kim, the donor heart is here.

1198
01:16:28,397 --> 01:16:29,481
Thanks.

1199
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:32,651
Was it beating fine until it was removed?

1200
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:34,152
Yes, it seemed fine.

1201
01:16:36,071 --> 01:16:36,905
Thanks.

1202
01:16:36,989 --> 01:16:39,741
No problem. I'll go wash my hands.

1203
01:17:05,809 --> 01:17:07,102
The portal vein is blocked,

1204
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:09,521
so you'll see a lot of varices
and severe ascites.

1205
01:17:09,605 --> 01:17:12,149
Manage bleeding carefully.
Don't get flustered.

1206
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:13,984
Yes, Professor.

1207
01:17:14,067 --> 01:17:17,029
I'll call you if I can't keep
the bleeding under control.

1208
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:19,740
Sure, anytime.

1209
01:17:24,745 --> 01:17:27,289
Let's do a good job, as usual.

1210
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:41,595
The liver is quite small as expected,
but we can do this.

1211
01:17:42,346 --> 01:17:44,222
I'll go take care of the benchwork.

1212
01:17:44,306 --> 01:17:47,643
Make sure you check for bleeding
and bile leakage.

1213
01:17:47,726 --> 01:17:48,936
Close it up nicely.

1214
01:17:49,019 --> 01:17:50,354
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1215
01:18:13,835 --> 01:18:15,754
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1216
01:18:15,837 --> 01:18:18,548
Hospital discharge at this hour
is unheard of.

1217
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:21,468
The room's paid for until tomorrow.

1218
01:18:21,551 --> 01:18:24,930
They paid another 1.7 million won
just so they wouldn't have to rush.

1219
01:18:27,891 --> 01:18:28,725
What a flex.

1220
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:32,270
What does that mean? "Flaxen"?

1221
01:18:32,354 --> 01:18:34,314
I'll tell you next time.

1222
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,820
Hello, congratulations on going home.

1223
01:18:39,903 --> 01:18:41,488
Hello, Professor Chae.

1224
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:44,241
I was so anxious,
thinking you might not stop by today.

1225
01:18:44,324 --> 01:18:46,118
This is perfect timing.

1226
01:18:46,868 --> 01:18:48,787
I think you two are meant to be.

1227
01:18:49,871 --> 01:18:50,997
Hey.

1228
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,213
I think you two are meant to be.

1229
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:59,552
Hey, this is Professor Chae Song-hwa,
the doctor who performed my surgery.

1230
01:19:01,846 --> 01:19:05,683
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

1231
01:19:05,766 --> 01:19:06,934
Come join us.

1232
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:12,314
He's so shy.

1233
01:19:13,399 --> 01:19:16,485
No wonder
he's never had a real girlfriend.

1234
01:19:17,528 --> 01:19:18,362
Take a seat.

1235
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:22,241
I'll make you a cup of tea.
We have some cookies too. Have a seat.

1236
01:19:22,324 --> 01:19:24,910
It's okay, ma'am. I just had some tea.

1237
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:29,582
Seizures can occur
after brain tumor surgery,

1238
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:32,585
so make sure you take
your anticonvulsant medication.

1239
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:36,547
You may experience postoperative bleeding
as the surgical site is still healing.

1240
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:40,342
The incision could open up,
so avoid strenuous exercise.

1241
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:41,886
Okay, will do.

1242
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:44,555
Come back and see me in two weeks,

1243
01:19:44,638 --> 01:19:47,850
but rush to the ER
if you experience headaches or dizziness.

1244
01:19:48,893 --> 01:19:50,561
Then I'll see you in two weeks.

1245
01:19:50,644 --> 01:19:54,648
Wait, Professor Chae. If you don't mind,

1246
01:19:54,732 --> 01:19:57,318
we'd love to take a picture with you.

1247
01:19:57,401 --> 01:20:00,362
I'm just so glad we met like this.
Please take a picture with us.

1248
01:20:00,446 --> 01:20:02,072
Yes, take a picture with us.

1249
01:20:03,282 --> 01:20:04,992
-Well…
-Come join us, son!

1250
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:06,494
Let's take a picture together.

1251
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:12,750
Let me buy you a coffee, Professor Chae.
Is that okay, Mom?

1252
01:20:12,833 --> 01:20:15,169
Yes, of course. By all means.

1253
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:18,005
Let's go.

1254
01:20:19,256 --> 01:20:20,132
Shall we?

1255
01:20:29,934 --> 01:20:32,937
It ended an hour early.

1256
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,357
It doesn't mean there's a problem, right?

1257
01:20:37,274 --> 01:20:40,361
Yes, of course. Don't worry.
I'm sure everything went well.

1258
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:41,612
Okay.

1259
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,304
The surgery went well.

1260
01:21:10,474 --> 01:21:13,269
Thank you. Thank you, Professor Kim!

1261
01:21:13,352 --> 01:21:15,187
Thank you, Professor Kim.

1262
01:21:16,772 --> 01:21:19,233
Min-chan is okay now.

1263
01:21:19,316 --> 01:21:21,277
Our son is okay now.

1264
01:21:24,196 --> 01:21:25,781
Don't cry. It's happy news.

1265
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:27,449
The surgery went well,

1266
01:21:27,533 --> 01:21:30,160
and we received the donor heart on time.

1267
01:21:30,244 --> 01:21:33,497
The heartbeat is solid,
and there was only minimal bleeding,

1268
01:21:33,581 --> 01:21:35,874
so we could wrap up earlier than expected.

1269
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:38,210
They're closing up his chest now,

1270
01:21:38,294 --> 01:21:41,380
and he'll be moved to the ICU
in about half an hour.

1271
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:44,633
I'll see you there in a bit.

1272
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:47,136
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1273
01:21:53,726 --> 01:21:54,560
Keep it up.

1274
01:21:54,643 --> 01:21:56,020
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1275
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:03,068
My gosh, Professor Lee.

1276
01:22:03,152 --> 01:22:04,737
The surgery went well.

1277
01:22:05,362 --> 01:22:06,363
My gosh…

1278
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:08,741
Thank you.

1279
01:22:08,824 --> 01:22:12,828
It was a little difficult to remove
the blood clot from the portal vein,

1280
01:22:12,911 --> 01:22:16,415
and variceal hemorrhage,
which he'd had before, happened again.

1281
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:19,460
But thankfully, the bleeding stopped
once we connected the liver.

1282
01:22:19,543 --> 01:22:20,794
My goodness.

1283
01:22:20,878 --> 01:22:23,672
That's why it took longer
than we had expected,

1284
01:22:23,756 --> 01:22:25,299
but the surgery went well.

1285
01:22:26,133 --> 01:22:28,844
All the important parts are done.
They're wrapping up now.

1286
01:22:28,927 --> 01:22:31,764
He'll be moved to the ICU
in an hour or so.

1287
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:35,726
He'll be on a ventilator for a while,
so he won't be able to talk.

1288
01:22:35,809 --> 01:22:38,479
But I'll make sure you can still see him.

1289
01:22:38,562 --> 01:22:41,857
My gosh, Professor Lee…

1290
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:44,068
Thank you so much.

1291
01:22:44,151 --> 01:22:45,944
You can put your worries to rest now.

1292
01:22:46,028 --> 01:22:48,697
Don't worry. It's okay.

1293
01:22:48,781 --> 01:22:51,909
I'm really sorry.
It must have made you very uncomfortable.

1294
01:22:51,992 --> 01:22:54,328
I apologize on her behalf. I'm sorry.

1295
01:22:55,037 --> 01:22:58,582
It's all right. I'm not the type
to be bothered by things like that.

1296
01:22:59,124 --> 01:23:03,295
You're probably very busy.
She must have been such a nuisance.

1297
01:23:03,379 --> 01:23:04,630
I'm sorry again.

1298
01:23:05,673 --> 01:23:09,927
No, I should thank you
for saving me earlier.

1299
01:23:10,969 --> 01:23:13,764
Now, I know exactly
how to handle situations like that.

1300
01:23:13,847 --> 01:23:14,973
That was smooth, right?

1301
01:23:15,808 --> 01:23:16,809
Yes.

1302
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:23,732
Is the café still open?

1303
01:23:23,816 --> 01:23:26,110
-Yes, the part-timer sent me a DM.
-What?

1304
01:23:26,193 --> 01:23:28,112
A DM. We're friends on Instagram.

1305
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:29,738
What does all that gibberish mean?

1306
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:33,575
Min-chan's out. Hey, I have to go.

1307
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:34,660
Okay.

1308
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:38,205
Really?

1309
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:41,250
Yes, I have a girlfriend.

1310
01:23:42,459 --> 01:23:44,169
Your mother seemed to have no idea.

1311
01:23:45,129 --> 01:23:46,130
She knows.

1312
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,800
Oh, my sister doesn't know
because she was overseas for years.

1313
01:23:50,342 --> 01:23:51,635
Does she not approve of her?

1314
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:54,763
No, definitely not.

1315
01:23:56,098 --> 01:23:57,891
My girlfriend's from an average family.

1316
01:23:57,975 --> 01:24:01,019
My mother doesn't like that
and her job too.

1317
01:24:02,521 --> 01:24:04,273
She used to be so fond of her though.

1318
01:24:07,443 --> 01:24:09,528
We were friends long
before we started dating.

1319
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:13,073
My mother knows her very well too.
We became friends in college.

1320
01:24:13,157 --> 01:24:16,160
My gosh. Then how did you suddenly start
seeing each other?

1321
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:20,789
She professed her feelings for me
out of the blue one day.

1322
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:25,335
Last year. She told me that she liked me.

1323
01:24:28,922 --> 01:24:30,424
I rejected her at first.

1324
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:34,511
We were best friends,
so I didn't want things to get awkward.

1325
01:24:35,387 --> 01:24:39,266
I told her,
"I want us to stay best friends."

1326
01:24:43,479 --> 01:24:46,356
That night, I came home
and mulled over what I said to her.

1327
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:51,487
Then I realized
I hadn't really answered her question.

1328
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:56,283
She told me she liked me,

1329
01:24:57,451 --> 01:25:00,204
but I told her I didn't want
our relationship to get awkward.

1330
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,458
My answer didn't make sense.

1331
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:10,255
So I started seeing our relationship
in a different light.

1332
01:25:11,465 --> 01:25:14,760
As a man and a woman,
not just two friends.

1333
01:25:15,928 --> 01:25:17,221
Well…

1334
01:25:18,931 --> 01:25:21,767
I really like her.

1335
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:24,770
When I'm with her, I feel so…

1336
01:25:27,773 --> 01:25:28,816
happy.

1337
01:25:30,526 --> 01:25:33,278
When I'm with her, I always feel…

1338
01:25:35,572 --> 01:25:36,698
I feel great.

1339
01:25:41,453 --> 01:25:43,121
Do you have a friend like that too?

1340
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:44,957
Me?

1341
01:25:50,087 --> 01:25:51,088
Hello.

1342
01:25:53,507 --> 01:25:54,633
Oh, sorry.

1343
01:26:00,597 --> 01:26:04,101
Here, these are for the nurses.

1344
01:26:04,184 --> 01:26:06,353
Thank you. This will make their day.

1345
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:10,524
-Aren't you done for the day?
-Yes, I just want to check in on Mr. Jang.

1346
01:26:12,109 --> 01:26:14,111
Hold on. One's missing a straw.

1347
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:15,404
This one's mine.

1348
01:26:16,822 --> 01:26:18,866
-Take it easy.
-Bye.

1349
01:26:30,002 --> 01:26:32,546
It went well.
I'm headed to the ICU now to see him.

1350
01:26:33,171 --> 01:26:36,174
-<i>Hey, seriously.</i>
-What?

1351
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:39,386
<i>Hey, I can't believe you sent your chief.</i>

1352
01:26:39,469 --> 01:26:40,721
Isn't he good?

1353
01:26:40,804 --> 01:26:43,640
Was he confused because
he hasn't assisted anyone in ages?

1354
01:26:43,724 --> 01:26:47,311
<i>Jeez, seriously.</i>

1355
01:26:47,394 --> 01:26:48,812
<i>You're nuts.</i>

1356
01:26:50,856 --> 01:26:53,442
Hey, hold on.
Jeong-won, can you clean up for me?

1357
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:55,944
Sure.

1358
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:01,783
Hyeong-do, don't tell the patient yet.
I'll call you in five minutes.

1359
01:27:02,409 --> 01:27:03,410
Okay.

1360
01:27:05,913 --> 01:27:07,873
Tell me, whatever it is.

1361
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:09,583
I'll do anything for you.

1362
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:11,627
What are you doing tomorrow?

1363
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,378
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

1364
01:27:14,546 --> 01:27:17,799
I have a conference in the morning,
but I'm available after that.

1365
01:27:18,383 --> 01:27:21,720
These days, I try not to book anything
after lunch on Fridays.

1366
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,639
I'm going to retire soon,

1367
01:27:23,722 --> 01:27:26,141
so I can slack off a little.
No one says anything.

1368
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:29,895
Why? What is it?

1369
01:27:31,772 --> 01:27:33,899
Then can you go to Mokpo tomorrow?

1370
01:27:37,444 --> 01:27:40,322
I'd like to give you a chance
to help some trailblazers.

1371
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,665
<i>The surgery went well, right?</i>

1372
01:27:49,748 --> 01:27:52,668
-<i>Yes, it went very well.</i>
-Way to go.

1373
01:27:52,751 --> 01:27:56,254
<i>Ik-jun, Chief Kwon
helped us out so much today.</i>

1374
01:27:56,338 --> 01:27:58,924
<i>He helped us clear a bunch of hurdles.</i>

1375
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,678
Really? I'm going to call him in a bit.
I'll let him know.

1376
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,056
-<i>Thanks.</i>
-What? Come on.

1377
01:28:06,139 --> 01:28:09,309
Whatever. I'll let you go. Get some rest.

1378
01:28:09,393 --> 01:28:11,687
-<i>Okay, nice work today.</i>
-Bye.

1379
01:28:42,009 --> 01:28:46,847
<i>I don't know what love is yet
I do not know</i>

1380
01:28:48,181 --> 01:28:53,603
<i>But we are happy together</i>

1381
01:28:54,438 --> 01:29:00,694
<i>Your confusing confession
Makes my heart flutter</i>

1382
01:29:00,777 --> 01:29:05,032
<i>But it's too difficult to understand
So I don't like it</i>

1383
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:08,410
<i>I don't like it</i>

1384
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:16,251
<i>People have told me</i>

1385
01:29:16,877 --> 01:29:22,758
<i>That they like my cute smile</i>

1386
01:29:23,383 --> 01:29:29,097
<i>But not anymore</i>

1387
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:36,605
<i>I have a secret now</i>

1388
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:44,946
<i>But I like you
This could be love</i>

1389
01:29:45,739 --> 01:29:52,662
<i>But I like you
This could be love</i>

1390
01:29:52,746 --> 01:29:53,789
Guitar.

1391
01:30:19,523 --> 01:30:24,569
<i>I don't know what love is yet
I do not know</i>

1392
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:31,076
<i>But we are happy together</i>

1393
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:38,625
<i>Your confusing confession
Makes my heart flutter</i>

1394
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:42,587
<i>But it's too difficult to understand
So I don't like it</i>

1395
01:30:44,673 --> 01:30:45,757
<i>I don't like it</i>

1396
01:30:48,134 --> 01:30:53,807
<i>People have told me</i>

1397
01:30:54,391 --> 01:31:00,313
<i>That they like my cute smile</i>

1398
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:06,695
<i>But not anymore</i>

1399
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:13,827
<i>I have a secret now</i>

1400
01:31:16,997 --> 01:31:22,627
<i>But I like you
This could be love</i>

1401
01:31:23,336 --> 01:31:28,758
<i>But I like you
This could be love</i>

1402
01:31:29,718 --> 01:31:35,265
<i>But I like you
This could be love</i>

1403
01:31:36,141 --> 01:31:39,102
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la</i>

1404
01:31:39,686 --> 01:31:46,568
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la</i>

1405
01:32:00,248 --> 01:32:02,667
She should be there by now.

1406
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:04,836
Why isn't she picking up?

1407
01:32:50,215 --> 01:32:51,466
<i>Hello?</i>

1408
01:32:53,718 --> 01:32:55,887
Isn't this Lee Ik-sun's phone?

1409
01:32:55,971 --> 01:33:00,350
<i>Yes, it is.
Ik-sun can't come to the phone right now.</i>

1410
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:04,145
<i>You must be her boyfriend. I picked up
because I didn't want you to worry.</i>

1411
01:33:04,229 --> 01:33:05,689
<i>I'm Ik-sun's friend.</i>

1412
01:33:06,231 --> 01:33:09,025
I see. Is everything okay with her?

1413
01:33:09,109 --> 01:33:13,405
<i>Well, it's nothing too serious.
But we got into a car accident,</i>

1414
01:33:13,488 --> 01:33:15,156
<i>and she's a little hurt.</i>

1415
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:18,827
<i>She hurt her arm and head.
She's getting some tests done now.</i>

1416
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:23,206
<i>It's nothing serious though.
You really don't need to worry.</i>

1417
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:28,169
-Well…
-<i>She said not to tell you or her family…</i>

1418
01:33:28,253 --> 01:33:29,921
-Wait.
-<i>…but I didn't want you to worry.</i>

1419
01:33:30,547 --> 01:33:32,424
What kinds of tests is she getting?

1420
01:33:32,507 --> 01:33:34,759
<i>I'm not really sure.</i>

1421
01:33:35,468 --> 01:33:38,763
<i>It's probably for the brain.
She bled quite a bit from a head wound.</i>

1422
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:42,017
<i>She'll be out shortly.
I'll tell her to call you.</i>

1423
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,603
Okay, please tell her I'll stay up
and wait for her call.

1424
01:33:45,687 --> 01:33:47,022
<i>Okay, I'll let her know.</i>

1425
01:33:47,814 --> 01:33:49,774
Thank you. What's your name?

1426
01:33:49,858 --> 01:33:52,402
<i>I'm Ko Se-gyeong.</i>

1427
01:33:53,445 --> 01:33:55,280
<i>Ik-sun and I live in the same building.</i>

1428
01:33:55,363 --> 01:33:57,282
<i>I'm her closest friend here.</i>

1429

1430
01:34:56,174 --> 01:34:59,052
<i>Is something up with Jun-wan?
He's lost so much weight.</i>

1431
01:34:59,135 --> 01:35:01,930
I can't really eat.
I feel like I'm chewing sand now.

1432
01:35:02,013 --> 01:35:04,599
<i>He's stressed out.
Too many surgeries. He's overworked.</i>

1433
01:35:04,682 --> 01:35:06,810
<i>I've never seen him so stressed out.</i>

1434
01:35:06,893 --> 01:35:08,812
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week.

1435
01:35:08,895 --> 01:35:10,605
Are you taking his patients?

1436
01:35:10,688 --> 01:35:12,649
<i>I don't care. Mind your own business.</i>

1437
01:35:12,732 --> 01:35:15,235
<i>What do you mean? Ik-sun.</i>

1438
01:35:16,152 --> 01:35:17,737
Something's happened, right?

1439
01:35:17,821 --> 01:35:19,322
<i>Could he have broken up
with his girlfriend?</i>

1440
01:35:19,405 --> 01:35:22,867
A bunch of things are stressing me out.
I have a lot on my mind.

1441
01:35:22,951 --> 01:35:24,035
And? What else?

1442
01:35:24,661 --> 01:35:28,373
<i>I heard too.
Everyone at the hospital knows.</i>

1443
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:30,416
Just wait. Something will come along.

1444
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:31,918
On one condition though.

1445
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:35,004
I might go back to Sokcho tonight.
I'm weird, right?

1446
01:35:35,088 --> 01:35:37,132
<i>I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.</i>

1447
01:35:37,215 --> 01:35:40,677
How did you know? Can you read my mind?

1448
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,139
I feel so reassured when you're in Seoul.

1449
01:35:44,222 --> 01:35:46,933
Dr. Heo, we shouldn't be so quick
to open up the head.

1450
01:35:47,016 --> 01:35:48,476
<i>No way. What are the chances?</i>

1451
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:51,479
<i>-I'm sorry.
-You know this is serious, right?</i>

1452
01:35:51,563 --> 01:35:54,065
<i>I really can't figure him out.</i>
