[Hospital Playlist 2]

2
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,022
Thank you. What's your name?

3
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:11,691
I'm Ko Se-gyeong.

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,610
Ik-sun and I live in the same building.

5
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:16,654
I'm her closest friend here.

6
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,910
Hello?

7
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:25,997
Yes, Se-gyeong.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,586
I know I said this earlier,
but when Ik-sun's out…

9
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:33,171
It doesn't matter how late it is.

10
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:36,507
Can you please tell her
to call me right away?

11
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:38,176
Yes, I will.

12
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,137
But you really don't need to worry.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,805
Her injury isn't serious.

14
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:43,973
Okay, thank you.

15
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,572
This is nuts…

16
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:33,147
Why are you still up?

17
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,733
My girlfriend is supposed to call me.

18
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,613
Do you need a drinking buddy?

19
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,866
No, thanks. Just do your thing.

20
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:46,452
All right.

21
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:03,386
Hello? Are you okay?

22
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,763
Thank goodness you're not seriously hurt.

23
00:02:06,472 --> 00:02:07,682
What about the driver?

24
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:10,726
Everyone's fine. That couple's already
at the place we're staying.

25
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,103
You're not "fine."

26
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:14,397
Your brain CT scan showed
bleeding in the brain,

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,774
and you hurt your arm too.
How's that "fine"?

28
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,693
It's not like my skull is broken.

29
00:02:18,776 --> 00:02:22,113
And it's only a tiny bit of blood.
The doctor said it's negligible.

30
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:25,241
They told me I shouldn't be worried.

31
00:02:25,324 --> 00:02:28,953
I'm really okay, babe. I'm totally fine.

32
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:30,371
Can't you tell from my voice?

33
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,456
Even if the CT scan looks okay now,

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,917
you could experience
delayed injury symptoms.

35
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,253
The bleeding could get worse
in the next two days.

36
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:38,921
Rest up and monitor it carefully.

37
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:42,174
If you have a headache, vomit,
or feel dizzy, go to the ER right away.

38
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:43,509
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,472
Professor Kim, stop worrying about me
and go to bed.

40
00:02:48,556 --> 00:02:51,183
-Isn't it really late there now?
-Yes, it's 2 a.m.

41
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:53,811
They want you to stay there today, right?

42
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,439
Yes, they want
to monitor my condition tonight.

43
00:02:56,522 --> 00:02:59,734
Gosh, I feel totally fine though.

44
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:02,153
I've wasted an entire day,
so I'm going to check out

45
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:04,155
Bournemouth Pier tomorrow
and take it easy.

46
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:07,033
What are you talking about?
Rest up for the next two days

47
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:08,784
and just head back to London.

48
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,579
You should rest up tomorrow

49
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:14,040
and just head back home the next day.

50
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:16,167
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
at home?

51
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,085
I don't want to head back right away.

52
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,046
I'll step out for just a couple of hours.

53
00:03:21,088 --> 00:03:23,007
I can take care of myself.

54
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,718
You can stop worrying about me, okay?

55
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:28,471
They're looking for me.
I'll call you later.

56
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:31,307
No, I'll call you when I'm leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

57
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,725
Go to bed.

58
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:35,937
I feel so bad
that you stayed up because of me.

59
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,063
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:41,150
I love you. Feel better soon.

61
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,236
Okay, I will.

62
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,154
I hate it when I don't feel well.

63
00:03:45,863 --> 00:03:48,241
Sweet dreams, babe. I love you.

64
00:03:48,324 --> 00:03:49,242
Bye.

65
00:04:13,766 --> 00:04:16,686
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

66
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,026
Shall we go see Ba-da now?

67
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,612
-Sure.
-Hello, Professor Ahn.

68
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,739
Hello.

69
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:32,910
Professor Ahn, we were only going
to keep Seo-a on antibiotics until today.

70
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:35,413
Should we stick to the plan?

71
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:38,582
Yes, we'll take her off it as of tomorrow.

72
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:08,154
Dr. Do Jae-hak,
please do a good job with the surgery.

73
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:09,488
Don't worry, Professor.

74
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,949
You can count on me.

75
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,703
Jeez, I feel like all you've learned
is to be a smooth talker.

76
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:20,958
This will take long
if you two have it easy.

77
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,877
But if I have it easy, it'll be quick.

78
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,255
Please make sure I can have it easy today.
You can do that, right?

79
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,257
Well, I'll do my best.

80
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,258
Hey!

81
00:05:31,635 --> 00:05:34,513
Professor Ahn,
Ba-da's mother is very worried.

82
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:36,348
We told her it'll be a simple surgery,

83
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:39,185
but she's worried about
the general anesthesia and scarring.

84
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:42,313
Of course, she's worried.

85
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,774
To a mom, there's no such thing
as a simple surgery.

86
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:46,609
Professor Ahn.

87
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,486
Do you have a kid?

88
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:52,990
Me? Yes. Many, in fact.

89
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:55,326
I think of all the kids I've treated
as my own.

90
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:01,207
Hello.

91
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,917
He really is like a saint.

92
00:06:04,835 --> 00:06:06,337
I agree.

93
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,218
I read the draft for your thesis.

94
00:06:12,301 --> 00:06:14,637
I know it's a complex topic.
You did a great job.

95
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:19,058
I know you're saying that because
you don't want to hurt my feelings.

96
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,352
I want your honest opinion.
I won't be hurt.

97
00:06:23,813 --> 00:06:25,231
Well…

98
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:28,859
How about we have some coffee?

99
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:31,237
Sure, I'll go make some now.

100
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,947
Do you like it mild in the morning?

101
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,075
Yes, thanks. No, I'll do it.

102
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:37,993
Just print the draft, Seon-bin.

103
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:39,954
-Let's look at it together.
-Sure.

104
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:51,215
Professor Chae,
are you going back to Sokcho tonight?

105
00:06:51,882 --> 00:06:54,969
No, tomorrow morning.
I only have appointments in the afternoon.

106
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:59,348
-You want dark roast, right?
-Yes, thank you.

107
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,766
No problem.

108
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,104
We'll perform the surgery
early tomorrow morning.

109
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:08,524
She can eat anything she wants
until bedtime tonight,

110
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:12,570
but she shouldn't eat or drink
anything tomorrow, including water.

111
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:16,323
Is Ba-da a big eater?

112
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,534
Yes, she is. She gets so greedy with food.

113
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:19,743
Oh, no.

114
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,664
You can give her food
four hours after the surgery,

115
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:26,041
so just be careful until tomorrow morning.

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,211
Do you have any questions
about the surgery tomorrow?

117
00:07:29,795 --> 00:07:31,422
How long will it take?

118
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:34,341
The surgery itself
will take about an hour.

119
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:38,262
But including the time we need
to move her to the OR and put her under…

120
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:40,514
I'd say three hours at the most.

121
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,643
We'll be performing a procedure called
"thyroglossal duct cyst excision."

122
00:07:44,727 --> 00:07:48,355
We'll make an incision
of about 3 to 5cm on the neck

123
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,024
and remove the cyst.

124
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,652
It'll leave a noticeable scar, right?

125
00:07:53,736 --> 00:07:56,572
Well, the incision will be about this big.

126
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,991
Even if we try to make it smaller,

127
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,327
it'll be about this big.

128
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:08,542
She's been doing that
to everyone she sees.

129
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,132
Yes, pinky swear.

130
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:18,802
The surgery will go well,
and you'll recover in no time, Ba-da.

131
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:19,887
Okay!

132
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:30,981
Did anything come up with Sim Eun-yeong?

133
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:32,900
We checked her cervix.

134
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,945
It's about 1cm,
so it hasn't dilated further.

135
00:08:36,028 --> 00:08:39,198
But she is having regular contractions,

136
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:42,201
and her pulse has increased to 120.
She is having a hard time,

137
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,954
so we took her off ritodrine
and switched to atosiban.

138
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:46,372
She's also on betamethasone.

139
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,667
What about a chest X-ray?
Any signs of pulmonary edema?

140
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,878
No, we checked.
No signs of pulmonary edema.

141
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,214
But the patient is very worried.

142
00:08:55,297 --> 00:08:57,466
You'd like me
to have a look at her, right?

143
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,551
Yes.

144
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:01,136
All right.

145
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:03,973
-Min-ha.
-Yes?

146
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:05,683
Ask away.

147
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,728
How did you know?

148
00:09:11,021 --> 00:09:12,982
Can you read my mind?

149
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,238
No. Of course, I can't.
I saw what you were writing down.

150
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,448
TO ASK OR NOT TO ASK
THAT IS THE QUESTION

151
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:22,366
Are you Hamlet?

152
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:26,120
What's your question?

153
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:29,456
Can patient Kim Ye-ji be discharged?

154
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,292
That's what I wanted to ask you.

155
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,044
She's not nitrazine positive, right?

156
00:09:34,128 --> 00:09:36,964
No, she's not. And no pooling is detected.

157
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,257
That's a relief.

158
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,342
I'll let her know when I'm doing rounds.

159
00:09:41,844 --> 00:09:43,679
-Let's go. She must be waiting.
-Okay.

160
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,812
Your liver somatic index looks good.

161
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,565
The immunosuppressant levels
look good too.

162
00:09:54,648 --> 00:09:58,652
And your kidneys are working fine too.
Everything looks good.

163
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,863
Any other concerns?

164
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,490
It's nothing serious,

165
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:06,660
I can't digest food as well as I used to.

166
00:10:06,744 --> 00:10:08,746
My stomach gets upset often.

167
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,122
As I've explained before,

168
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:12,833
the gallbladder is removed
during a liver transplant,

169
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,378
which can cause
digestive problems temporarily.

170
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,422
Try to stay away from greasy foods

171
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:20,924
and make sure you exercise regularly.

172
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:24,470
Yes, I took your advice
and have been exercising regularly.

173
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:28,140
Don't you worry, Doctor.
I'll make sure she never becomes lax.

174
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,600
She's finally healthy.

175
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,562
Don't worry about
her exercise routine and diet.

176
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:36,982
My gosh, okay. Keep up the good work.

177
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:39,485
Then I'll see you in a month.

178
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:40,944
-Okay.
-Oh, right.

179
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:44,323
-You live in Jinhae, don't you?
-Yes.

180
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:47,034
It must be tiring
to come all the way here.

181
00:10:47,117 --> 00:10:48,369
What time did you leave?

182
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:52,039
-We got here last night.
-My gosh.

183
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,457
We got here in the wee hours

184
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,293
and slept on the bench in the lobby.

185
00:10:56,377 --> 00:10:59,463
We used to get a motel room in the past,

186
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:01,382
but it's hard to get a room these days.

187
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:04,218
And we'd have to check out
early in the morning anyway,

188
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,136
so we didn't want to waste money.

189
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,765
Still, it's important
that you get enough sleep.

190
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:13,018
Don't you also have an appointment
with our neurologist?

191
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:15,104
You were treated
for a cerebral infarction.

192
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:19,400
That's right! You're so smart.

193
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:20,692
My gosh.

194
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:25,030
So I've been told.

195
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,284
When is that appointment?
You'll have to come back for it.

196
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:31,286
Can you find out?

197
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,579
Just a moment, please.

198
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,792
It's on March 25.

199
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:39,294
Yes, March 25.
It's with Professor Yoon Mi-hye, right?

200
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:40,879
Yes, that's right.

201
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,425
Hold on. Does that mean

202
00:11:44,508 --> 00:11:47,302
I have an appointment with Professor Lee
in a month,

203
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,972
and I have to come back
about a week after that?

204
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:53,225
Sure, we'll come back.
It'll be nice to spend more time in Seoul.

205
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:56,228
What are you talking about?
This is exhausting for me.

206
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,605
I'll work around your schedule.

207
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:01,608
I'll see you when you're here
for your neurologist appointment.

208
00:12:01,692 --> 00:12:03,861
I take outpatient appointments
for Wednesdays.

209
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,905
Are you sure? Is that really okay?

210
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,241
Yes. You're recovering quickly,

211
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:12,202
and all the numbers look good,
so we can push it back by a week.

212
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:14,037
I'll prescribe you enough meds.

213
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,331
You live far away, so this is no problem.

214
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,710
-Thank you so much, Doctor.
-Thank you, Doctor.

215
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:22,087
No problem at all. Have a safe trip home.

216
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:24,006
-Thank you.
-See you in a month.

217
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,632
-Yes, I'll see you then.
-Let's go.

218
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:27,509
Thank you.

219
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:28,886
Okay, take it easy.

220
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,305
Kim Jun-wan speaking.

221
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:34,725
Okay, I finished my surgery.
I can come now.

222
00:12:34,808 --> 00:12:36,226
Okay.

223
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,528
You can come in now.

224
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,114
Let's check if everyone's here
and go in together.

225
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,492
Kang Dong-hyeon's guardian?

226
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:53,202
-Here.
-Great.

227
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:54,953
Is Choi Han-na's guardian here?

228
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:56,413
-Yes.
-Okay.

229
00:12:56,497 --> 00:12:58,499
-Is Lee Won-u's guardian here?
-Yes.

230
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,376
Great. Bae Min-jin's guardian?

231
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,837
-Here.
-Okay. Lee Hye-ri's guardian?

232
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:07,007
So I should take out the results
concerning other variables, right?

233
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,927
Yes, you included the results

234
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,930
that aren't statistically significant,

235
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:14,640
-and I find it distracting.
-Okay.

236
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:16,475
And lastly…

237
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:19,686
In the conclusion,

238
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,274
you wrote that
the meningioma volume threshold is 14cc.

239
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:27,611
So I think the discussion
should be focused on the mechanism

240
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:31,073
of how growing meningiomas
cause cerebral edema.

241
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:34,701
I wrote down some key points for you.

242
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:37,496
But why don't you rewrite this part
and send it to me?

243
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:40,666
Then I'll email you what I wrote
so you can refer to it.

244
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,210
Okay, will do. Thank you.

245
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:45,796
I'll work on it and send it over quickly.

246
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,880
Sounds good.

247
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,427
This is good coffee.

248
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,013
You made the coffee.

249
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:59,226
I was talking to myself.

250
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:07,526
You like studying and enjoy it, don't you?

251
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,361
Me?

252
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:14,157
Well, no. I don't find it fun.

253
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,244
How can studying be fun?

254
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:19,329
Professor.

255
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:22,624
Yes.

256
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,878
I do enjoy it.

257
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,172
Isn't it fun to learn new things?

258
00:14:31,884 --> 00:14:34,511
I chose to study the brain
because the more you learn…

259
00:14:34,595 --> 00:14:35,929
-It's hard.
-…it's fun.

260
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:40,434
Don't you know how interesting
the human brain is?

261
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:42,978
There are still things
we don't know about the brain.

262
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,273
I do enjoy treating patients,

263
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:49,151
but I wish I could read and study
all my life.

264
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:54,948
I'm weird, right?

265
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,292
I changed the ventilator setting.

266
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,294
Run an ABG analysis again
in 30 minutes.

267
00:15:07,377 --> 00:15:08,378
Got it.

268
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:09,963
Hello.

269
00:15:12,257 --> 00:15:14,718
You said hello earlier.
Why are you doing it again?

270
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,887
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,265
-Jang Hong-do.
-Yes, sir.

272
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:23,727
Where should the heart-lung machine
be connected to during heart surgery?

273
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,022
The aorta and…

274
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,359
Well…

275
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,821
The aorta and…

276
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:37,491
And…

277
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:39,326
The aorta and…

278
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,829
You need to study harder so you can
answer these questions right away.

279
00:15:42,913 --> 00:15:45,123
I may ask you the same question again,

280
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:46,708
or I may not.

281
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,418
Take it easy.

282
00:16:20,742 --> 00:16:24,913
STAFF ONLY

283
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:13,378
-Is Ru-bin out of the OR?
-Yes, we're in the PICU now.

284
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:14,463
Okay, I'm coming now.

285
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:17,841
The surgery went well.

286
00:17:18,383 --> 00:17:20,844
As we had expected
based on the test results,

287
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:23,346
there was a big hole
between the two ventricles.

288
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,808
We fixed it using the pericardium,
which is a thin sac

289
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,143
that surrounds the heart.

290
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:31,229
We also found a small hole
between the two atria,

291
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,814
and we fixed that too.

292
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,526
The surgery went smoothly
without any issues,

293
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,030
so I don't think we need to be worried
about the recovery.

294
00:17:41,406 --> 00:17:44,451
Don't worry.
We'll keep monitoring Ru-bin carefully.

295
00:17:44,534 --> 00:17:46,286
-Thank you, Professor Kim.
-Thank you.

296
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:49,623
Ru-bin got through the surgery.

297
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:50,707
I know.

298
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:54,252
Min-chan's parents are here, right?

299
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,505
They're outside.
Should I tell them to come in?

300
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,131
No, I'll go talk to them.

301
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,138
-Where are you going?
-I'm following you.

302
00:18:05,222 --> 00:18:08,350
-Why?
-Because you're off to deliver good news.

303
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,768
I need a cheerer-upper.

304
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:11,603
When will you cheer me up?

305
00:18:11,686 --> 00:18:14,981
You always cheer me up.

306
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,818
I already feel so much better.

307
00:18:18,318 --> 00:18:22,572
Jeez, you always have something to say.
My goodness.

308
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:29,037
The ultrasound looks good,
and the heartbeat is solid.

309
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:32,165
Min-chan's body is working hard
to get used to the new heart.

310
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:34,835
We should be able to move him
to a regular ward tomorrow.

311
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,672
I can't believe this day is finally here.

312
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,010
There are a few things
you need to keep in mind.

313
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,595
I'll go over them with you later.

314
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:49,850
It's lunchtime. You should have lunch.

315
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,103
Yes, you too. Enjoy your lunch.

316
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:58,650
We want to treat you to dinner
at the most expensive restaurant,

317
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,071
but we can't do that, right?

318
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:04,781
That's right. I'll get fired.

319
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:08,451
Thank you for the offer though.

320
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:10,412
It's the thought that counts. Talk soon.

321
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:18,503
-You'll have lunch with me, right?
-Gosh, whatever.

322
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,630
Leave me alone, will you?

323
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,891
About Yoo Gyeong-jin, the violinist.

324
00:19:30,974 --> 00:19:33,059
Did you hear how much she paid us?

325
00:19:33,143 --> 00:19:34,936
I don't care. Mind your own business.

326
00:19:36,646 --> 00:19:37,772
Hey.

327
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,442
Oh, hello!

328
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:42,485
Yes, hello.

329
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:45,113
Here for lunch, right? It's on me.

330
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:47,824
Really? But I have company.

331
00:19:47,908 --> 00:19:49,743
I'll pay for them too. How many?

332
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:52,412
-Hello.
-Hello.

333
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:59,085
Thanks. Lunch is on Jun-wan.

334
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,630
-Nice.
-Thank you.

335
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,928
This is the best lunch menu
I've seen here.

336
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:09,804
This is why I can't eat elsewhere.

337
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,182
Hey, put that down.
Is that the Olympic torch?

338
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:14,517
It looks too perfect,
like a plastic food model.

339
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,729
It is real.

340
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:20,565
Professor Kim, can I get more of this?

341
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,401
Sure, go for it. Eat as much as you want.

342
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:29,616
Do you not have much of an appetite?

343
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:35,497
-No.
-I've never seen you eat so little.

344
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,998
You always devour your food.

345
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:40,043
I can't really eat.
I feel like I'm chewing sand now.

346
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,629
Oh, no. Then give me your drumstick.

347
00:20:43,213 --> 00:20:45,507
No, I'm going to eat this.

348
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,384
You just said you can't really eat.

349
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,885
It feels like chewing sand.

350
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:50,470
Just the rice, not the chicken.

351
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,390
I was saving it for last.

352
00:20:53,974 --> 00:20:56,268
-Mind your own business.
-That, again?

353
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,571
-Ik-sun loves drumsticks too.
-"Ik-sun"?

354
00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:10,407
-Ik-jun.
-"Ik-sun."

355
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,825
-Ik-jun.
-You said "Ik-sun."

356
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:13,743
No, Ik-jun! I said Ik-jun!

357
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,581
Let's eat.

358
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,417
Okay.

359
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:31,344
But there must be someone named "Ik-sun"

360
00:21:32,053 --> 00:21:34,014
somewhere in the world, right?

361
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:38,059
Yes, probably.

362
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,770
Maybe on the other side of the planet.

363
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:48,528
Hey, Song-hwa. Speak.

364
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,989
Hey, they're serving drumsticks today.
Hurry!

365
00:21:51,072 --> 00:21:53,867
Really? Darn it. What a bummer.

366
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,286
I have a lunch meeting today.

367
00:21:56,369 --> 00:21:58,621
What's it for? Do you have a conference?

368
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:01,791
It's an important tteokbokki meeting,
which was scheduled last week.

369
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,168
They're all waiting for me.

370
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,463
I thought you had a conference
or something. Okay.

371
00:22:06,546 --> 00:22:09,424
I'll stop by your office for coffee.
Are you staying late today?

372
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,968
Yes, you should hurry. Enjoy your meal.

373
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:13,219
Thanks, enjoy your lunch.

374
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:19,309
All right, let's eat.

375
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,311
This looks delicious.

376
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,606
Try these potatoes too.

377
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,192
Here's a spoon for you.

378
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:34,741
This one's for me.

379
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:41,790
Honey, eat before it gets cold.

380
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:42,957
Okay.

381
00:23:09,067 --> 00:23:10,068
Nice!

382
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,782
Don't tell me you got one for each person.

383
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:17,408
We don't do that here.

384
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:19,911
My gosh, what is all this?

385
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,123
Hello.

386
00:23:23,206 --> 00:23:24,541
Is the tteokbokki here already?

387
00:23:24,624 --> 00:23:27,460
Gyeo-ul,
Does Chuchu always order this much?

388
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:31,005
-Why?
-Min-ha ordered three full servings!.

389
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:33,007
I can finish one by myself.

390
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:35,260
I see.

391
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,679
This is half and half.
The original flavor.

392
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,975
That one is quite spicy.

393
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:43,643
I love spicy food.

394
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:47,272
Oh, no. Jeong-won can't handle spicy food…

395
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,363
She knows.

396
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:01,703
Dr. Chu knows. I told her.

397
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:03,955
She's the only one at Yulje
who knows about it.

398
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:07,792
I congratulated her for beating God.

399
00:24:07,876 --> 00:24:10,879
That's right! Gyeo-ul beat God.

400
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,260
-What did you get for us?
-The mild flavor.

401
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:20,096
By the way, didn't you say
you invited one more person?

402
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,931
Yes, I did.

403
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:24,767
I got it right this time.

404
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:28,646
Where's this prick?

405
00:24:32,942 --> 00:24:35,778
Hey! Don't you dare barge in here!

406
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:43,536
Hello.

407
00:24:44,537 --> 00:24:45,705
Hi.

408
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,709
I thought this was the GS Medical Office.

409
00:24:50,418 --> 00:24:53,588
-What are you guys doing here?
-We're eating tteokbokki, obviously.

410
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:56,883
Have some tteokbokki.
The steamed eggs too.

411
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:59,510
The steamed eggs are mine.
I'm going to eat all of it.

412
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,889
Well, okay.

413
00:25:02,972 --> 00:25:05,683
It's fine.
That petty jerk can have it all.

414
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,021
-Is this one spicy?
-It's the mild flavor.

415
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,650
-Can you not eat spicy food?
-I can. I like spicy food.

416
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,617
This one's good too.

417
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:24,827
Dig in.

418
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,586
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

419
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,046
You should have some too.

420
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:36,506
-Sure.
-Here.

421
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:40,093
Have some rice balls too.

422
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:43,346
-You too. Eat up.
-Okay.

423
00:25:51,938 --> 00:25:53,648
-Gyeo-ul.
-Yes?

424
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,326
-Hello.
-You made it.

425
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,787
Hello. Hey, you.

426
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,747
Andrea, what took you so long?

427
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:11,749
You do all the pediatric surgeries here?

428
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,293
Yes, I actually do.

429
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,544
Right, you do.

430
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:16,796
It was an exclamation, not a question.

431
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,926
This is pretty spicy.

432
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,553
It's probably too spicy for you.

433
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,517
Gosh, seriously.

434
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,145
How could you do this to me?

435
00:26:32,228 --> 00:26:35,398
Is this how you treat your Cupid?

436
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:39,777
Hey, where are you?

437
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:42,238
I'm fine with anything.

438
00:26:43,573 --> 00:26:44,866
Okay, I'll see you there.

439
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:47,368
Bye! I will starve myself.

440
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,911
Professor Lee.

441
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:52,332
Was that Song-hwa? Do you want
to take this unopened box of rice balls?

442
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:55,710
It's okay. I had enough food.
Enjoy your lunch. Bye.

443
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:04,427
-Professor Kim.
-Thanks.

444
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:12,101
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week.

445
00:27:12,185 --> 00:27:14,645
-Are you taking his patients?
-Yes, just three.

446
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,440
Including Lee Gyeong-mi?

447
00:27:17,523 --> 00:27:21,527
Yes, but I don't even know
if I can say I'm taking her on

448
00:27:21,611 --> 00:27:23,613
because there isn't much
we can do for her.

449
00:27:26,407 --> 00:27:27,450
That's true.

450
00:27:29,827 --> 00:27:32,372
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week,

451
00:27:32,455 --> 00:27:35,208
so Professor Kim Jun-wan will fill in
and look after you.

452
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:40,338
He's great. You don't need to worry.

453
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,009
He can be curt,
but he cares a lot about his patients.

454
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:46,969
And he checks in on his patients often.

455
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,809
Oh, you already know that, right?

456
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,148
Aren't you lonely?

457
00:28:06,948 --> 00:28:08,366
Oh, dear.

458
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,871
We'll check in on you often.

459
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,561
Still, she always sends way too much.

460
00:28:36,644 --> 00:28:38,730
I can never finish it.

461
00:28:40,273 --> 00:28:43,067
-I'd hate to throw it out.
-I know.

462
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,778
I tell her to only send a little
but always get a huge box.

463
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:48,406
It's so heavy
that I can never carry it on my own.

464
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:51,576
Now, she sends stuff to Sokcho.

465
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,287
Gosh, she sends me way too much food.

466
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,291
My mom's the same way.
I moved to Seoul over 20 years ago,

467
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:00,418
and we fought a lot about it
at the beginning.

468
00:29:00,501 --> 00:29:04,797
"Mom, please! Don't send me
too much food this time, please!"

469
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,341
But that didn't work. She never listens.

470
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:11,471
She sends me 50 million perilla leaves
when she's feeling energetic.

471
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:18,853
What did she send you this time?

472
00:29:19,562 --> 00:29:20,813
Pickled vegetables.

473
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,107
Sounds delicious.

474
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,194
Garlic, chili, and water celery.
One container each.

475
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:31,157
Gosh, it'll take me forever to finish it.

476
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,201
I might go back to Sokcho tonight.

477
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,077
To eat my pickled vegetables.

478
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:36,204
Give me some.

479
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,541
Great idea. Take some.
There's no way I can finish it on my own.

480
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,961
Yes, your mom probably sent you extra
so you can share them with friends.

481
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,214
Give me some. Jun-wan and Jeong-won too.

482
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:48,841
Jeong-won's a good cook,
so it'll make him happy.

483
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,511
Yes, I should do that.

484
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:52,637
Yes.

485
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:55,890
On one condition though.

486
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,311
Take my perilla leaves.

487
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:05,233
I have about 20 million of them at home.
Just take 10 percent.

488
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:09,070
Okay, I like perilla leaves.

489
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,455
That looks nice.

490
00:30:21,457 --> 00:30:23,960
What do you think of this table lamp?
Isn't it nice?

491
00:30:24,043 --> 00:30:25,837
#MY HUBBY'S THE BEST
#THANK YOU, JAE-HAK

492
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,463
Yes, it's nice.

493
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:29,841
Why are you looking at a stranger's post?

494
00:30:31,092 --> 00:30:32,009
She's my wife.

495
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:35,930
My wife posted this.

496
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:38,182
She bought this lamp today.

497
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:40,810
Why didn't you tell me it was your wife?

498
00:30:41,644 --> 00:30:45,481
Look at these hashtags.
"My hubby's the best.

499
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:47,608
Thank you, Jae-hak." See?

500
00:30:52,822 --> 00:30:55,616
Your cup is empty. What are you drinking?

501
00:30:57,702 --> 00:31:00,913
Everyone goes on social media
to look at other people's photos.

502
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:04,584
I know you're on social media too,
but your account is private.

503
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:07,712
That's right. I have an account too.

504
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:10,089
I'm on social media too.

505
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,886
Why are you on it
if you're not even posting anything?

506
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:18,472
There's nothing. Nothing at all.

507
00:31:18,556 --> 00:31:19,599
I rarely go on.

508
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:23,311
My girlfriend created the account for me
before she left for the UK.

509
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:25,730
I only use it
to look at my girlfriend's posts.

510
00:31:25,813 --> 00:31:28,774
Don't just look.
You should post some photos too.

511
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,943
That way, your girlfriend can also see

512
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:34,947
what you're up to and how you're doing.

513
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:35,865
We talk every day.

514
00:31:36,866 --> 00:31:38,743
Talking on the phone isn't the same

515
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:41,746
as sharing your day-to-day life with her.

516
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,416
My day-to-day life? I have no life.

517
00:31:45,499 --> 00:31:47,043
I work and go home, on repeat.

518
00:31:47,627 --> 00:31:50,421
Well, it'd be nice to share that.

519
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:55,593
You should post some photos
so your girlfriend can see them.

520
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:58,387
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?

521
00:31:58,471 --> 00:32:01,682
Oh, please. What's there to teach?
I can just take a photo and post it.

522
00:32:02,642 --> 00:32:04,810
Give me your phone for a moment.

523
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:09,023
Why?

524
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:11,692
Let's see.

525
00:32:13,569 --> 00:32:14,528
Don't move.

526
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:17,073
-Hey.
-Nice!

527
00:32:17,657 --> 00:32:20,159
Oh, my! This is a great photo.

528
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,828
You could even use this
as your passport photo.

529
00:32:24,038 --> 00:32:24,997
Delete it.

530
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,542
-What should the caption be?
-"Kim Jun-wan"?

531
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:31,963
Everyone knows that you're Kim Jun-wan.

532
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:33,673
Then…

533
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:37,051
"Kim Jun-wan, the Professor
of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Yulje"?

534
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:39,011
Why would you write your position?

535
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:41,722
Let's just say…

536
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,559
"This is for my girlfriend."

537
00:32:45,643 --> 00:32:49,021
Forget it. My girlfriend will freak out.

538
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,690
What about the hashtag?

539
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:52,566
Well…

540
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,402
What's that for?

541
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:58,864
You want many people to see it, right?

542
00:32:58,948 --> 00:33:01,617
If you post with various hashtags,

543
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:04,036
your photo can be discovered
by more people.

544
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,956
I don't want other people to see it.

545
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:09,542
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

546
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:12,378
Then I won't use any hashtags.

547
00:33:12,461 --> 00:33:15,798
Okay, don't use any.
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

548
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:19,927
Done.

549
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,933
Let me know if you want to learn more
about social media.

550
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:27,727
That won't happen.

551
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,397
Just in case though.
If you ever want to learn more,

552
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,232
just come to me and say this.

553
00:33:34,608 --> 00:33:37,737
"Jae-hak, do you have a minute?"

554
00:33:38,237 --> 00:33:40,865
I told you that won't happen.
I'm going to get some rest.

555
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:28,579
FIRST SELFIE IN A LONG TIME

556
00:34:28,662 --> 00:34:29,997
#THE BEST LATTE EVER

557
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,214
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU GUYS
#SE-GYEONG #DA-SOM #PERFECT IELTS SCORE

558
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:50,976
SET UP A BLIND DATE FOR SE-GYEONG
AND GOT THIS AS A GIFT #THANKS SEGYEONG

559
00:35:12,873 --> 00:35:15,793
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

560
00:35:18,045 --> 00:35:21,173
Hello, did you have a good weekend?

561
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,758
Something's wrong with Eun-ji.

562
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,802
She woke up but can't move her left arm.

563
00:35:24,885 --> 00:35:25,845
What?

564
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,227
You've been doing a lot of surgeries.

565
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:36,438
Yes, I'm all booked up this week.
You're early.

566
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:39,150
Yes, I want to have some coffee
before I go in.

567
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:42,486
Professor Kim, a call for you.
It's Dr. Do Jae-hak.

568
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:47,116
-What's up?
-We have a bit of an emergency.

569
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,994
-What is it?
-Eun-ji's left-side motor control is poor.

570
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:53,497
I'd say her arm is at about Grade 2.
Her leg, Grade 3.

571
00:35:53,581 --> 00:35:55,791
-What's her PT?
-Her INR is 2.8.

572
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:58,669
We can't do an MRI because of the VAD.
Let's do a CT scan.

573
00:35:58,752 --> 00:36:00,796
Call Neurology
and ask them to have a look.

574
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,090
Talk to Eun-ji's mother

575
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:05,676
and keep me updated.
I'll be there after my surgery.

576
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:10,764
Thank you.

577
00:36:14,852 --> 00:36:17,646
Do you handle all the VIP surgeries?

578
00:36:18,147 --> 00:36:20,316
Can't the other professors
take care of some?

579
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:22,776
You can't commute from Sokcho every time.

580
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,905
It's not for every surgery.
It's only once every two weeks.

581
00:36:26,447 --> 00:36:27,740
Thanks for the coffee.

582
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:31,535
-Are you bribing me?
-No, it's a gift.

583
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:35,956
I feel so reassured when you're in Seoul.

584
00:36:37,875 --> 00:36:39,126
How's Seok-min?

585
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,173
Haven't you guys made up yet?

586
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:45,925
No.

587
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,302
Was it a big fight?

588
00:36:48,385 --> 00:36:51,931
I told him I chose Neurosurgery
because I wanted to study the brain

589
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:54,683
and that I don't understand
how he could give up so easily.

590
00:36:55,434 --> 00:36:59,980
And Seok-min said, "This is why people say
those who have had it easy in life

591
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:02,483
are inconsiderate."

592
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,450
So it was a big fight.

593
00:37:11,533 --> 00:37:12,534
Yes.

594
00:37:14,203 --> 00:37:16,288
Just call him first.

595
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:18,874
I did, but we ended up
having another argument.

596
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,085
I haven't seen him for two weeks.

597
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,963
I'm afraid we'd break up at this rate.

598
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:29,510
Just wait.

599
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:31,929
Something will come along.

600
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:36,600
My ex-boyfriend and I fought a lot too.

601
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:40,646
Every time we fought,
I wanted to patch things up quickly,

602
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:43,357
so I took time out of my busy schedule
to call and see him,

603
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,150
and have long discussions.

604
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:49,947
It was exhausting.

605
00:37:50,948 --> 00:37:55,619
But there's something
I learned naturally with age.

606
00:37:57,788 --> 00:38:00,374
As long as you both want to make it work

607
00:38:00,457 --> 00:38:02,960
and aren't too far apart,

608
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:04,420
just wait and see.

609
00:38:04,503 --> 00:38:06,046
Then something will come along.

610
00:38:07,881 --> 00:38:11,343
So many things can happen
even in the span of a day, you know.

611
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:14,805
Things happen,
whether they're good or bad.

612
00:38:14,888 --> 00:38:18,892
And sometimes, you have to call and
meet up because of something that happens.

613
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:26,317
He's probably very busy at the moment,

614
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,695
learning new things
and meeting people at his new job.

615
00:38:29,778 --> 00:38:31,322
And you're busy too.

616
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:36,118
The best thing to do now would be
just keeping busy.

617
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,995
Just focus on your life,

618
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:39,788
and naturally,

619
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,374
something will come along,

620
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,127
and you'd have to call and see each other.

621
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:50,758
You're right. Maybe I'll get in trouble
and end up calling him.

622
00:38:50,841 --> 00:38:53,010
It could be the other way around too.

623
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:58,891
So relationship-wise,
just let nature take its course.

624
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:02,269
Let's get some work done.
I think I'll be late for my surgery.

625
00:39:02,353 --> 00:39:04,813
I'm sorry, Professor Chae. And thank you.

626
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,819
Looks like we have
all the paperwork we need.

627
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:13,405
The loan will be issued
as early as this week.

628
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,866
-Thank you.
-Professor Ahn.

629
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:18,869
We want to give you a small gift
when you find a house you like.

630
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:23,082
The branch manager wants to help out
because it's for a good cause.

631
00:39:23,165 --> 00:39:24,666
My gosh, really?

632
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:28,128
A gift, on top of taking care
of my loan application so quickly?

633
00:39:28,212 --> 00:39:30,005
I won't decline.

634
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:36,220
By the way, do you not give that doll
to your loan clients?

635
00:39:36,303 --> 00:39:38,222
I even have two savings accounts with you.

636
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:40,432
Oh, sure. I'll give you one.

637
00:39:40,516 --> 00:39:43,852
Do you have a kid?
I thought you were single.

638
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,354
No, I'm not married yet.

639
00:39:46,063 --> 00:39:48,023
Just give me one.

640
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:51,276
I'll give you two.
You can give one to your girlfriend.

641
00:39:52,611 --> 00:39:53,862
Thank you.

642
00:39:56,448 --> 00:39:57,449
Kisses.

643
00:39:59,493 --> 00:40:00,911
Hello.

644
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,129
-Hello.
-Hi.

645
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,551
Dolls? What are they for?

646
00:40:15,634 --> 00:40:18,303
How adorable!

647
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:19,763
What are those little ones?

648
00:40:19,847 --> 00:40:21,598
They're so cute.

649
00:40:21,682 --> 00:40:23,725
My kid would love it.

650
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,312
And I see that you have two.

651
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,899
My kid's birthday is coming up

652
00:40:30,983 --> 00:40:33,527
and my kid loves dolls like that.

653
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,696
I'm just saying. It's very soon.

654
00:40:35,779 --> 00:40:37,322
-Can you…
-Hello?

655
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:40,117
I'm coming now.

656
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:45,038
There's an emergency. I have to go.

657
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,123
Okay.

658
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:55,424
Hey, I'm coming now.

659
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:58,010
Thankfully, no hemorrhage was detected.

660
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:01,680
I showed it to the radiologist.

661
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:05,434
There's no hemorrhage, but we're not sure
whether or not an embolism has occurred.

662
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,937
And Eun-ji has almost fully regained
her motor function.

663
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:12,149
Thank goodness, seriously.

664
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,109
How much warfarin did she get?

665
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:15,903
She got 1ml yesterday.

666
00:41:15,986 --> 00:41:18,071
Give her 1.5ml today,
but it'll take a while,

667
00:41:18,155 --> 00:41:19,448
so give her enoxaparin too.

668
00:41:19,531 --> 00:41:22,159
Eun-ji's mother is very worried.

669
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:26,830
I did explain to her
that Eun-ji is okay now,

670
00:41:27,372 --> 00:41:31,251
but I think you should talk to her.

671
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:33,003
It'll help her calm down.

672
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,464
Yes, I was going to talk to her anyway.

673
00:41:35,547 --> 00:41:37,132
Thanks. I'm here now.

674
00:41:40,177 --> 00:41:43,639
Blood clots can occur
even if we use blood thinners.

675
00:41:44,264 --> 00:41:46,642
This condition is called a microembolism.

676
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:51,396
I think a tiny blood clot had traveled
to the brain and caused blockage.

677
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,107
Thankfully, the blockage has been cleared.

678
00:41:54,191 --> 00:41:57,444
Then what if we give her
more blood thinners?

679
00:41:58,028 --> 00:42:00,781
I've explained this before,
and we've also experienced it.

680
00:42:00,864 --> 00:42:04,660
Too much blood thinners
can lead to bleeding.

681
00:42:04,743 --> 00:42:07,746
If it happens inside her brain,
it'll be very serious.

682
00:42:09,373 --> 00:42:14,127
We kept checking Eun-ji's blood work
and were careful with the blood thinners,

683
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:17,256
but this still happened,
which means it can happen again.

684
00:42:21,552 --> 00:42:24,513
In a way, it's like having a time bomb
in your chest.

685
00:42:25,347 --> 00:42:27,391
I feel like time's running out.

686
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:31,603
She should get the surgery
as soon as we find a donor.

687
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:36,775
Professor Kim.

688
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:42,698
Every day feels like torture.

689
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,829
My daughter, Eun-ji…

690
00:42:57,629 --> 00:42:58,630
I'm…

691
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:03,677
beyond exhausted,
and I struggle to get through the day.

692
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:06,138
When I wake up in the morning,

693
00:43:06,972 --> 00:43:09,016
I anxiously wonder what's going to happen.

694
00:43:10,684 --> 00:43:12,477
My heart races like crazy.

695
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:16,773
I really can't live like this.

696
00:43:21,445 --> 00:43:25,282
I wonder if we should just give up.

697
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:32,205
Honey.

698
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:34,916
You've been doing so well.

699
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:37,169
You've been staying so strong.

700
00:43:38,086 --> 00:43:39,254
Don't be like this.

701
00:43:50,641 --> 00:43:53,143
I'm sorry, Professor Kim. I apologize.

702
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,561
It's okay.

703
00:43:58,649 --> 00:43:59,691
Ma'am.

704
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:04,154
You've been doing so well.

705
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:07,157
Eun-ji is staying strong too.

706
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:11,995
As long as you don't give up,

707
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:14,748
we won't be the ones to give up first.

708
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,839
We will find a heart donor for Eun-ji…

709
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:26,385
and she'll get a transplant.

710
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:29,554
Please cheer up

711
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:33,141
and do not give up, okay?

712
00:44:38,021 --> 00:44:39,272
Okay.

713
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,611
Thank you.

714
00:45:38,832 --> 00:45:40,292
Well…

715
00:45:40,876 --> 00:45:43,837
-So we'll sign the lease next week,
-Yes.

716
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,341
and the hospital will take care
of the monthly maintenance costs.

717
00:45:49,468 --> 00:45:51,511
Can we sign the lease next week for sure?

718
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,180
Yes, the loan was approved today.

719
00:45:53,263 --> 00:45:55,265
We'll get the money as early as this week.

720
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:58,643
Then, let's make a list of the things
we need to buy.

721
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:03,482
-Did you guys have dinner?
-Yes, we did.

722
00:46:04,608 --> 00:46:05,901
Me too.

723
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:10,780
A fridge, TV, couch, washer…

724
00:46:10,864 --> 00:46:12,491
We won't need a bed, right?

725
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,994
A bed? Wouldn't it be good
to just get one?

726
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:17,204
Single beds, right?

727
00:46:20,081 --> 00:46:22,000
Are you guys moving in together?

728
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:24,878
Yes, we are indeed.

729
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:29,466
What's going on?
What are you two up to this time?

730
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:36,515
Jeong-won wants to set up
a patient guardian shelter,

731
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:39,017
for patients who live far away

732
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,853
and those who visit us
for anticancer therapy or hemodialysis.

733
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:45,023
He's buying a house near the hospital.

734
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:47,192
-No, it's a long-term lease.
-That's right.

735
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:49,027
We'll start with a lease.

736
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:53,657
Can you run Daddy-Long-Legs
and the shelter with the revenue

737
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,200
from the VIP Ward?

738
00:46:55,283 --> 00:46:57,410
It'll cost quite a bit to manage it.

739
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:01,289
I cut a deal with Director Ju.

740
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:05,710
I asked him for his support
on my personal project

741
00:47:05,794 --> 00:47:08,547
in return for me staying here.

742
00:47:09,548 --> 00:47:12,425
He doesn't know about Daddy-Long-Legs,

743
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:16,388
so I asked him to help me launch my dream.

744
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:19,808
And this guardian shelter
is the first project?

745
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:20,725
Yes.

746
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:25,397
I figured that this is what
the patients need the most.

747
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:29,276
For the other stuff,
we'd have to change our policy,

748
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:31,528
and it'll take us a while
to tackle the issues.

749
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:34,739
That's why I want to start
with the patient guardian shelter.

750
00:47:35,574 --> 00:47:37,534
What is your ultimate dream?

751
00:47:40,912 --> 00:47:41,997
A children's hospital.

752
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,123
What?

753
00:47:44,374 --> 00:47:47,544
My ultimate dream is to build
a children's hospital.

754
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,549
I want to build a children's hospital

755
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:54,509
that offers comprehensive pediatric care.

756
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:56,928
That will cost a fortune.

757
00:47:57,762 --> 00:48:00,890
It'll cost about 400 billion won.

758
00:48:00,974 --> 00:48:02,225
What?

759
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:03,435
WOW

760
00:48:05,145 --> 00:48:08,315
You've been fiddling with that
because you thought it was funny?

761
00:48:08,898 --> 00:48:09,733
What did you do?

762
00:48:09,816 --> 00:48:10,984
WOW

763
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:17,782
-You like his lame jokes.
-It's so funny!

764
00:48:17,866 --> 00:48:20,619
Ahn Jeong-won, you really are something.
One more time!

765
00:48:20,702 --> 00:48:21,703
WOW

766
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:23,246
Let's do it together.

767
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,456
WOW

768
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:26,541
-Gosh.
-Hey, your phone.

769
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:28,460
Oh, it's Gyeo-ul.

770
00:48:31,254 --> 00:48:33,965
-Hey, Gyeo-ul.
-Choi Han-na's lab results looked good,

771
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:36,968
so we were going to move her
to the regular ward tomorrow.

772
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:40,430
But she's not eating
and hasn't had any bowel movements.

773
00:48:40,513 --> 00:48:43,391
-Can we do an enema?
-Wait for me. I'm coming now.

774
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:44,893
You only did a chest PA, right?

775
00:48:45,393 --> 00:48:47,937
Take an abdominal X-ray too. All right.

776
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:51,232
I have to go. Have a fun meeting.

777
00:48:51,316 --> 00:48:54,486
I'll buy you a housewarming gift
when you sign a lease.

778
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:56,780
What would be good? A coffee machine?

779
00:48:56,863 --> 00:48:59,949
The bank branch manager
is getting that for us.

780
00:49:00,033 --> 00:49:02,494
Really? Then let me think about it.
I'm off.

781
00:49:02,577 --> 00:49:03,870
Hey, one more time.

782
00:49:04,496 --> 00:49:06,373
Get going already!

783
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:08,041
OKAY

784
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:11,961
My goodness.

785
00:49:13,713 --> 00:49:15,757
Don't we need a microwave?

786
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,676
-It'd be good to have one.
-Yes.

787
00:49:18,385 --> 00:49:20,053
She's very alert,

788
00:49:20,136 --> 00:49:23,223
so she's been holding it in intentionally
because she's not used to

789
00:49:23,306 --> 00:49:25,141
having someone help her relieve herself.

790
00:49:25,225 --> 00:49:26,351
I see.

791
00:49:27,102 --> 00:49:29,062
Don't just monitor the physical condition.

792
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:31,856
Try to observe how the patient
might be feeling too, okay?

793
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,068
Okay, got it. I'm sorry, Professor.

794
00:49:35,151 --> 00:49:37,529
Don't be sorry. Keep up the good work.

795
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:47,455
Hey, do you want to have coffee with me?

796
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:49,833
Have you eaten?

797
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:53,086
I'm not sure.

798
00:50:00,051 --> 00:50:04,723
Hey, you've been practically living
in the OR, the ICU, and the PICU.

799
00:50:04,806 --> 00:50:07,392
Try to cut down on surgery
or take in less patients.

800
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,353
Talk to your chief.

801
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,939
I'm the chief.

802
00:50:17,777 --> 00:50:20,780
I always perform surgery,
so I'm used to it.

803
00:50:21,448 --> 00:50:24,242
But a bunch of things are stressing me out
these days.

804
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:25,535
I have a lot on my mind.

805
00:50:25,618 --> 00:50:27,620
Was the surgery today a difficult one?

806
00:50:27,704 --> 00:50:29,914
No, it went well.

807
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,917
But the patient's heartbeat
was very unstable

808
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:35,378
after the surgery,

809
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:37,881
so we had to use the ECMO.

810
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,884
I'm sure the patient will recover soon.

811
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:43,928
And Eun-ji--

812
00:50:44,012 --> 00:50:46,139
Yes, you told me about her a few times.

813
00:50:46,222 --> 00:50:48,808
The kid who's been hooked up to a VAD
the longest.

814
00:50:48,892 --> 00:50:52,061
That's right. She's been depending
on the VAD for almost five months,

815
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:55,315
waiting for a heart transplant,
but we can't find a donor for her.

816
00:50:56,649 --> 00:50:58,109
We were careful with the meds,

817
00:50:58,193 --> 00:51:00,528
but she's experienced blood clots
and even bleeding.

818
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:03,323
We keep running into problems.

819
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:09,162
I'm worried. She needs a transplant
as soon as possible.

820
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:10,622
You'll find a donor soon.

821
00:51:17,128 --> 00:51:18,463
And? What else?

822
00:51:24,302 --> 00:51:26,596
It's my father's birthday today.

823
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,517
-Right!
-I only remembered it earlier.

824
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,352
-Call him.
-I already did.

825
00:51:32,435 --> 00:51:34,062
He was asleep though.

826
00:51:34,145 --> 00:51:35,605
Oh, boy.

827
00:51:36,981 --> 00:51:39,609
I didn't even get to wish him
a happy birthday.

828
00:51:40,193 --> 00:51:42,570
Just go home and get some sleep.

829
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:45,490
I think you're sleep-deprived.

830
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:46,866
I'm on duty tonight.

831
00:51:48,743 --> 00:51:50,662
-Me too.
-At least I won't be lonely.

832
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,791
I'll stop by later.

833
00:51:54,874 --> 00:51:57,335
Hey, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

834
00:51:57,418 --> 00:51:59,587
I'm not worried.
I just want to eat your snacks.

835
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,257
I saw that you have a lot of new ones.

836
00:52:07,387 --> 00:52:10,515
Let's go. Gosh, it's cold in here.

837
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:15,228
Yes, let's go.
I feel cold, physically and mentally.

838
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:25,989
Close it up and take care of the rest.

839
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:28,199
Check for bleeding even in the ICU.

840
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:30,201
-Yes, sir.
-Keep it up.

841
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:32,412
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

842
00:52:41,212 --> 00:52:43,798
Cut the Gelfoam for this size
and pass it over.

843
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:44,924
Yes, sir.

844
00:52:50,138 --> 00:52:52,724
You've been having headaches
and a fever too?

845
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:54,225
You need to see a doctor.

846
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:55,977
I did, last week.

847
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,063
I also got a blood test
and a chest X-ray while I was there.

848
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,065
I bet it's that accident.

849
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,817
I took some meds, so I'm okay now.

850
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,486
Are the test results out yet?

851
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,114
No, of course not.
This isn't Korea, you know.

852
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:10,909
They won't get the results back
until next week.

853
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:13,494
-Okay.
-You sound a little down today.

854
00:53:13,578 --> 00:53:15,955
Did something happen?
Is your patient not doing well?

855
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,750
No, I'm fine. The patients are fine too.

856
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,085
I'm on duty,
so I was reading a book in my office.

857
00:53:21,169 --> 00:53:24,047
-By the way, that test.
-Yes.

858
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,965
I got the highest score.

859
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:29,427
Really? Congratulations, seriously.

860
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:31,262
You said you bombed the test.

861
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:33,556
I lied. Everyone in my family does that.

862
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,017
My goodness. Congratulations.

863
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,895
The highest score in your class
or in the entire school?

864
00:53:40,104 --> 00:53:43,441
What? Then you deserve
some serious congratulations.

865
00:53:43,524 --> 00:53:45,318
Well done, seriously.

866
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:47,570
Yes, sure.

867
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:51,407
Oh, hello.

868
00:53:51,491 --> 00:53:54,410
I've heard so much about you.

869
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,372
No, right.

870
00:53:58,039 --> 00:53:59,332
Of course.

871
00:54:02,585 --> 00:54:03,711
I see.

872
00:54:05,588 --> 00:54:08,424
No, I'm not busy at the moment.

873
00:54:08,508 --> 00:54:09,509
Right.

874
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:12,470
I see.

875
00:54:40,123 --> 00:54:42,834
Sir, I need to talk to you
about something.

876
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:44,544
Okay, what is it?

877
00:54:45,336 --> 00:54:48,464
We performed a navigation-guided biopsy
on Won Jin-hwan earlier

878
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,842
because we were suspecting
a diffuse astrocytoma.

879
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:55,263
We just did a CT scan
and detected ICH around the biopsy site.

880
00:54:56,723 --> 00:55:00,143
Professor Min told me
to discuss it with you first.

881
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,520
Considering where the tumor is,

882
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:05,356
I'm concerned that the biopsy needle

883
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,859
might have touched the MCA distal branch.

884
00:55:09,027 --> 00:55:13,239
I'm not too sure,
but it looked like the needle

885
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:16,492
had gone in a bit too deep
on the screen in the OR.

886
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:20,079
Why don't we do a TFCA
and find out the exact location?

887
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:22,582
It's unlikely that you guys poked it
with the needle.

888
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,419
No way. What are the chances?

889
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:28,212
Right.

890
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:32,633
A tumor biopsy can cause bleeding,
so just monitor the patient for now.

891
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,554
We'll wait a bit

892
00:55:36,637 --> 00:55:39,599
before we take another angiogram
and check, okay?

893
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,270
His right pupil is dilated
to about 0.4 now.

894
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:45,813
That's okay.

895
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:47,815
Oh, I see.

896
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:52,695
I'm going to get some sleep
in the on-call room.

897
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:53,988
Take it easy.

898
00:55:54,072 --> 00:55:55,073
Thank you.

899
00:56:07,376 --> 00:56:09,712
Hey, good timing.

900
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,299
Jae-hak, do you have a minute?

901
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,013
Let's go.

902
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:29,524
So you want to post a photo?

903
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:31,651
No, just a caption.

904
00:56:32,902 --> 00:56:34,153
You can't do that.

905
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:39,617
You can't post a caption on its own.

906
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,453
Just post whatever photo you have
and write the caption here.

907
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:43,579
What about a hashtag?

908
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:46,916
You want to use a hashtag?
I like that attitude.

909
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,711
Here, press the pound sign
and list the related words.

910
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:53,840
Does that mean my photo will come up
if people look up those words?

911
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:58,094
Yes! The more hashtags you use,
the more people it'll reach.

912
00:56:58,177 --> 00:57:00,763
But first,
you need to make your profile public.

913
00:57:04,851 --> 00:57:06,978
All right, let me give this a shot.

914
00:57:33,546 --> 00:57:36,507
Mr. Won, can you try lifting
your right arm?

915
00:57:41,095 --> 00:57:42,346
Now, your left arm.

916
00:57:54,901 --> 00:57:58,154
CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE

917
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:01,157
You should have called me.

918
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,867
I did, just now.

919
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,076
Really?

920
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,537
Why? What's up?

921
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:11,667
I think patient Won Jin-hwan has a bleed
in the MCA distal branch.

922
00:58:11,751 --> 00:58:14,837
His motor function is lower
on the left side, at Grade 3.

923
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:16,756
Can't we do a CT scan?

924
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:18,966
We did one not long ago.

925
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:21,969
How do you know
if the bleeding is caused by a tear

926
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:24,972
in the MCA distal branch
or something else?

927
00:58:25,056 --> 00:58:27,808
If an artery in the distal branch
is ruptured,

928
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:30,102
the bleeding will continue.

929
00:58:30,186 --> 00:58:33,523
Then can we do a CT angiogram
along with the CT scan later?

930
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:36,108
He can obey commands, right?

931
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:37,693
Right?

932
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,655
He can raise his hands and blink.

933
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:42,615
Yes.

934
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:46,827
Let's wait and see.
Continue to monitor him carefully.

935
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,165
We'll do a CT angiogram
if he seems to get worse.

936
00:58:51,832 --> 00:58:54,835
We'll do it
and check how bad the bleeding is,

937
00:58:54,919 --> 00:58:56,796
then call Professor Min, okay?

938
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:00,675
And Dr. Heo,

939
00:59:02,009 --> 00:59:04,262
we shouldn't be so quick
to open up the head.

940
00:59:07,932 --> 00:59:10,851
The biopsy probably caused minor bleeding.

941
00:59:12,228 --> 00:59:14,021
It'll stop soon.

942
00:59:15,356 --> 00:59:18,067
Let's give him mannitol
and see how it goes.

943
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,778
Okay? Do you understand?

944
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:22,405
Yes, sir.

945
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:24,240
Good.

946
00:59:36,085 --> 00:59:39,088
Hi, sister! How's it going?

947
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:42,049
Hey, you. How's everything? How's U-ju?

948
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:43,551
U-ju's doing great.

949
00:59:44,552 --> 00:59:45,845
You don't look so well.

950
00:59:45,928 --> 00:59:47,722
I'm just tired from all the studying.

951
00:59:48,806 --> 00:59:51,267
Looks like you're still at work.
Are you on duty too?

952
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,645
I sure am. Wait, you know someone else
who's on duty tonight?

953
00:59:55,271 --> 00:59:57,106
Oh, my friend.

954
00:59:57,189 --> 01:00:00,067
My roommate also has a night shift today.

955
01:00:00,818 --> 01:00:03,237
How's everyone? How's Song-hwa doing?

956
01:00:03,321 --> 01:00:04,739
Song-hwa is doing great.

957
01:00:05,364 --> 01:00:07,450
Are Jeong-won and Seok-hyeong
doing well too?

958
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:10,995
Everyone's well. Since when
did you care so much about my friends?

959
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:13,789
They're all doing great.
Just take care of yourself.

960
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:15,499
Is everything well with you?

961
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:17,043
Yes, I'm happy and healthy.

962
01:00:17,918 --> 01:00:22,298
Right, how's Jun-wan?
Professor Kim is doing well too, right?

963
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:25,551
No, not really.

964
01:00:27,136 --> 01:00:30,139
He's stressed out.
Too many surgeries. He's overworked.

965
01:00:30,973 --> 01:00:33,392
I've never seen him so stressed out.

966
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:34,977
Did something happen to him?

967
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:38,981
No, but it seems like
a bunch of things are stressing him out.

968
01:00:39,774 --> 01:00:42,818
And I think his girlfriend is adding
to his stress.

969
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:45,780
Looks like his girlfriend
is quite selfish.

970
01:00:46,364 --> 01:00:50,826
I see, his girlfriend…
Why do you think that?

971
01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:52,703
I don't really know much,

972
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:55,581
but I think she's very inconsiderate.

973
01:00:56,248 --> 01:00:59,627
She's self-centered. Jun-wan is
under a lot of stress these days,

974
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,881
but he's so busy walking on eggshells
around her that he can't even vent.

975
01:01:03,964 --> 01:01:06,592
Sounds like she's always busy
talking about herself.

976
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:08,886
Hey, I'm running late
for my study session.

977
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:12,973
All right. Watch out for cars
and don't skip breakfast.

978
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:15,434
Call me right away
if you run out of money, okay?

979
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:18,938
All right. You take care of yourself too.

980
01:01:19,021 --> 01:01:21,148
-Bye.
-Bye.

981
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:04,316
-You checked in on him five minutes ago.
-Has it already been five minutes?

982
01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:18,664
Mr. Won Jin-hwan.

983
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:19,957
Mr. Won!

984
01:02:27,548 --> 01:02:30,634
Patient Won Jin-hwan's right pupil
has dilated further. It's 0.6 now.

985
01:02:30,718 --> 01:02:33,095
Mental status, stupor.
And the left-side motor is worse.

986
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:34,597
I'm calling Professor Min now.

987
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,474
Hey, hang on. I'm coming now.

988
01:02:36,557 --> 01:02:38,142
We don't have time!

989
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:41,771
If something bad happens to the patient,
will you take responsibility for it?

990
01:02:42,938 --> 01:02:46,233
I'll order a CT scan right away
and call Professor Min.

991
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:50,112
-Please get ready for intubation.
-Okay.

992
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:54,033
Is the BP okay?

993
01:02:54,116 --> 01:02:56,494
Yes, it's 140 over 80.

994
01:02:56,577 --> 01:02:58,120
We need to open him up now. Focus.

995
01:02:58,204 --> 01:02:59,663
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

996
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,332
Have you been monitoring him carefully?

997
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:03,667
Yes, we checked in on him
every ten minutes.

998
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,711
As soon as we confirmed his mental status,

999
01:03:05,795 --> 01:03:09,215
we checked the bleeding
with a CT scan and called you.

1000
01:03:13,636 --> 01:03:15,513
If anything bad happens to this patient,

1001
01:03:16,347 --> 01:03:17,640
it's all on you guys.

1002
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,308
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1003
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:28,067
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1004
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:43,207
Dr. Heo.

1005
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:47,211
Get some sleep.
That bed over there is available now.

1006
01:03:47,294 --> 01:03:49,213
Take a nap. I'll wake you up.

1007
01:03:49,296 --> 01:03:51,799
It's okay. I can just doze off here.

1008
01:03:51,882 --> 01:03:53,801
I'm good at sleeping while seated.

1009
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:59,265
-It's not morning yet, is it?
-The sun is about to rise.

1010
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:04,687
The fellow must have given you an earful.

1011
01:04:05,312 --> 01:04:07,231
I haven't seen him since the surgery.

1012
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:11,151
If he does, I'll listen.
I was too rude to him.

1013
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:15,823
Just let it go in one ear
and out the other.

1014
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:20,369
We were able to operate
on the patient right away

1015
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:22,454
because you kept monitoring his condition.

1016
01:04:22,538 --> 01:04:24,248
And the surgery went well.

1017
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:26,959
I'm on your side.

1018
01:04:27,835 --> 01:04:30,963
Thank you. I'll take you out for a drink
when we can move Mr. Won

1019
01:04:31,046 --> 01:04:33,340
to a regular ward once he's stabilized.

1020
01:04:34,049 --> 01:04:36,385
-Sure, I'll be looking forward to it.
-All right.

1021
01:05:16,967 --> 01:05:18,135
I heard too.

1022
01:05:18,928 --> 01:05:21,555
Everyone at the hospital knows.

1023
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,432
I'm sorry.

1024
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:26,560
How's the patient?

1025
01:05:26,644 --> 01:05:28,729
I checked in on him again just now.

1026
01:05:28,812 --> 01:05:30,731
His pupil size is normal now.

1027
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:34,652
His left-side motor function is still low,
but he's better overall,

1028
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:36,987
so I think
he'll regain consciousness soon.

1029
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:40,199
When you were informing the fellow,

1030
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:43,410
what was the patient's
neurological assessment like?

1031
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:45,579
Was he exhibiting
any neurological symptoms?

1032
01:05:45,663 --> 01:05:48,832
He was able to obey commands
when we moved him to the ICU.

1033
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,419
But his right pupil was slightly dilated,

1034
01:05:52,503 --> 01:05:55,631
and his left-side motor function
was significantly reduced

1035
01:05:55,714 --> 01:05:58,801
compared to the right side's
even considering the anesthesia.

1036
01:05:58,884 --> 01:06:01,011
Then within an hour or so,

1037
01:06:01,512 --> 01:06:04,556
his mental status dropped to stupor,
and his pupils opened up.

1038
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,934
It's good that you questioned
the fellow's opinion.

1039
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:09,228
But…

1040
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:14,149
other than that, you are at fault.

1041
01:06:14,233 --> 01:06:15,693
It was your fault.

1042
01:06:17,027 --> 01:06:20,030
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have been so rude to him.

1043
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:23,534
I will politely apologize to the fellow.

1044
01:06:24,618 --> 01:06:26,161
I didn't mean to argue with him.

1045
01:06:26,829 --> 01:06:28,998
I raised my voice
without even realizing it.

1046
01:06:29,081 --> 01:06:30,082
I'm sorry.

1047
01:06:30,916 --> 01:06:31,834
No.

1048
01:06:35,587 --> 01:06:37,923
You should have fought him earlier.

1049
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:41,885
You should have pushed ahead with
your decision if you believed so.

1050
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:45,097
You've been closely monitoring
the patient.

1051
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,725
That means you know best
when it comes to that patient.

1052
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,395
So you should have trusted your judgment
and fought for it.

1053
01:06:54,732 --> 01:06:56,859
Had anything bad happened to him,

1054
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:58,736
it would have been all on you.

1055
01:06:59,903 --> 01:07:02,448
His condition worsened
because you wasted time

1056
01:07:02,531 --> 01:07:04,450
being hesitant and indecisive.

1057
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:10,164
You've been working hard
to study the case and monitor him,

1058
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:11,874
so fight hard.

1059
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:17,129
That is the only way…

1060
01:07:18,464 --> 01:07:19,757
you can save your patients.

1061
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:35,189
The nurses will go over how to take care
of the wound to minimize scarring.

1062
01:07:35,272 --> 01:07:38,233
I'll see you again in a month.

1063
01:07:38,317 --> 01:07:39,485
Keep it up.

1064
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:41,236
Will do. Thank you, Doctor.

1065
01:07:45,282 --> 01:07:47,367
-Was that my last appointment?
-Yes, well done.

1066
01:07:47,451 --> 01:07:48,869
Thank you.

1067
01:07:55,459 --> 01:07:58,712
Hey, isn't it still early there?
Did you stay up all night?

1068
01:07:58,796 --> 01:08:00,380
Can you talk now?

1069
01:08:01,173 --> 01:08:04,051
Yes, I just finished my last appointment.
What's up?

1070
01:08:05,302 --> 01:08:07,596
When you're in your office…

1071
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,558
Go to your office and call me.
I'll wait for your call.

1072
01:08:14,311 --> 01:08:16,897
Sure, okay. I'll call you right back.

1073
01:08:30,828 --> 01:08:33,205
Hey, I'm in my office now.
What's going on?

1074
01:08:34,748 --> 01:08:35,624
Well…

1075
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:43,006
Ik-sun. Something's happened, right?

1076
01:08:45,092 --> 01:08:47,469
I've fallen for someone else.

1077
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:54,059
I'm sorry.

1078
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:04,236
What do you mean?

1079
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:06,947
I'm sorry.

1080
01:09:13,245 --> 01:09:14,496
Is it Se-gyeong?

1081
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:40,272
I'm sorry, Jun-wan. I have to go.

1082
01:10:02,669 --> 01:10:04,713
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1083
01:10:04,796 --> 01:10:05,881
Where's Jun-wan?

1084
01:10:06,715 --> 01:10:08,050
He doesn't feel like eating.

1085
01:10:09,176 --> 01:10:11,803
Is something up with Jun-wan?

1086
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:13,472
He's lost so much weight.

1087
01:10:13,555 --> 01:10:15,557
Could he have broken up
with his girlfriend?

1088
01:10:16,558 --> 01:10:20,854
I don't know everything about Jun-wan.
Do you guys know what's going on?

1089
01:10:20,938 --> 01:10:23,607
You should know
because you two live together.

1090
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,442
Still, I don't know everything.

1091
01:10:26,026 --> 01:10:29,696
Jeong-won, it's about time
you got your own place.

1092
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,991
I mean, Yulje pays you.
Can't you afford to rent an apartment?

1093
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:36,203
Of course,
I can definitely afford to do that.

1094
01:10:36,286 --> 01:10:39,539
Guys, I've told Jun-wan multiple times
that I want to move out.

1095
01:10:39,623 --> 01:10:41,708
-And?
-But the thing is…

1096
01:10:43,168 --> 01:10:46,213
he looks so sad every time I say that.

1097
01:10:46,797 --> 01:10:49,049
Jun-wan gets lonely very easily.

1098
01:10:49,132 --> 01:10:50,300
Totally.

1099
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:52,177
-Really?
-Yes.

1100
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:55,472
I told him I'd move out
even when we were moving two years ago.

1101
01:10:55,555 --> 01:10:56,890
Did his eyes well with tears?

1102
01:10:56,974 --> 01:10:59,935
I had never seen anyone
with such sad eyes.

1103
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:04,731
He gets lonely so easily.

1104
01:11:05,691 --> 01:11:09,945
I'm not mooching off him.
He's just not letting me go.

1105
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:12,572
We know that.
Jun-wan can never live alone.

1106
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:16,910
He may look tough on the outside
but is soft on the inside.

1107
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,581
-You mean, he's a paper tiger?
-Bingo.

1108
01:11:34,219 --> 01:11:36,054
AHN JEONG-WON

1109
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:55,615
Hurry. The sun will set soon.

1110
01:11:59,578 --> 01:12:01,371
-Are you a scarecrow?
-Does it look bad?

1111
01:12:01,455 --> 01:12:04,124
-Are you wearing it to look nice?
-No, to block UV rays.

1112
01:12:04,207 --> 01:12:05,959
-Okay.
-Should I keep it on or not?

1113
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:09,046
-It looks ugly.
-You little…

1114
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:11,173
Who cares?
I'm wearing it to protect my face.

1115
01:12:11,256 --> 01:12:12,507
Does it have to look nice?

1116
01:12:12,591 --> 01:12:14,176
No, as long as it blocks the sun.

1117
01:12:14,259 --> 01:12:15,302
Then I'll keep it on.

1118
01:12:19,389 --> 01:12:21,767
I look like a scarecrow, don't I?
Is this ugly?

1119
01:12:22,726 --> 01:12:25,145
No, it's pretty. You look pretty.

1120
01:12:28,148 --> 01:12:30,108
The prettiest scarecrow I've ever seen.

1121
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:31,610
Hey!

1122
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:34,613
Come on, let's go. The sun will set soon.

1123
01:12:34,696 --> 01:12:36,490
-Yes, we should hurry.
-Okay.

1124
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:46,750
Mugwort is already out
all along the hiking trail.

1125
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,502
Yes, they sprouted a while ago.

1126
01:12:48,585 --> 01:12:50,587
Do you want mugwort soup? Shall I make it?

1127
01:12:51,129 --> 01:12:52,255
-Mugwort soup?
-Yes.

1128
01:12:52,339 --> 01:12:55,175
Mugwort soup

1129
01:12:55,258 --> 01:12:59,596
-Mugwort soup
-Mugwort soup

1130
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:02,349
-Mugwort soup
-Nice!

1131
01:13:03,892 --> 01:13:06,395
-Mugwort soup
-Oh, dear.

1132
01:13:06,478 --> 01:13:08,688
Mugwort soup sounds great.

1133
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:12,317
This is my favorite time of day.

1134
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:13,777
When the sun is about to set.

1135
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:15,862
It'd be even better if it was raining now.

1136
01:13:15,946 --> 01:13:19,408
Totally.
Hey, does U-ju like rainy days too?

1137
01:13:19,491 --> 01:13:20,617
No.

1138
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:23,912
There's only one thing in the world
that he likes.

1139
01:13:23,995 --> 01:13:26,039
-His dad?
-No, his girlfriend.

1140
01:13:27,707 --> 01:13:30,544
He's head over heels for his girlfriend.
They're so in love.

1141
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:32,129
My gosh, U-ju has a girlfriend?

1142
01:13:32,712 --> 01:13:35,590
Yes, they've been going out for a while.
Her name is Mo-ne.

1143
01:13:35,674 --> 01:13:38,176
"Mo-ne"? That's a pretty name.

1144
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,512
She is Hong-do and Yun-bok's cousin.

1145
01:13:41,471 --> 01:13:42,931
Yun-bok and Hong-do at Yulje?

1146
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:45,642
That's right. Our Hong-do and Yun-bok.

1147
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:47,936
-You didn't know?
-Of course, I had no idea.

1148
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:49,521
What a coincidence.

1149
01:13:50,814 --> 01:13:55,193
By the way, don't Hong-do and Yun-bok
remind you of us in the old days?

1150
01:13:58,447 --> 01:14:01,741
I think I was smarter than Hong-do.

1151
01:14:02,576 --> 01:14:04,661
Right, maybe.

1152
01:14:04,744 --> 01:14:06,955
But you were such a loser.

1153
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:09,958
-Hey, what are you talking about?
-What?

1154
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:12,294
Come on. I was a fashionista,

1155
01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:14,713
-the most stylish guy in Changwon.
-Sure, sure.

1156
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:22,888
You're probably better now than before

1157
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:26,057
-What is this song?
-You have fulfilled

1158
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:31,771
This void in my heart

1159
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:38,987
I used to feel so lonely
In this beautiful world

1160
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:40,780
No way. Is this "Couple"?

1161
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:44,367
And wander around
Looking for my other half

1162
01:14:48,455 --> 01:14:51,458
What took you so long to find me

1163
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:59,090
Drowning in my loneliness?

1164
01:15:04,054 --> 01:15:06,681
I love you

1165
01:15:07,891 --> 01:15:13,772
Now, you can spend every moment with me

1166
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,357
Finished. Well done.

1167
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:40,799
-Are you done?
-Yes.

1168
01:15:40,882 --> 01:15:42,008
-You're done now?
-Yes.

1169
01:15:42,092 --> 01:15:44,219
-Then shall we?
-Let's go.

1170
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:46,680
Well done.

1171
01:15:50,809 --> 01:15:51,810
This is nice.

1172
01:15:52,435 --> 01:15:54,854
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1173
01:16:17,085 --> 01:16:20,088
-Yes, hello?
-Professor Kim, we have a donor.

1174
01:16:20,171 --> 01:16:22,340
-We've found a suitable donor for Eun-ji.
-What?

1175
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:24,634
KONOS just called,
asking if we need the heart.

1176
01:16:25,552 --> 01:16:27,721
But Jae-an Medical Center
had priority over us.

1177
01:16:27,804 --> 01:16:29,556
They don't need it.

1178
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:32,309
They declined
because the patient has an infection.

1179
01:16:32,392 --> 01:16:34,060
How much does the donor weigh?

1180
01:16:34,144 --> 01:16:36,229
Well, he weighs 40kg.

1181
01:16:36,313 --> 01:16:39,399
A 11-year-old boy. His weight is 40kg.

1182
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,735
Should we accept the heart?

1183
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:43,570
Yes. We'll get it, no matter what.

1184
01:16:43,653 --> 01:16:45,530
This could be Eun-ji's only chance.

1185
01:16:45,614 --> 01:16:47,949
-Okay, we'll get ready.
-Okay.

1186
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,252
-Hello, sir!
-We've found a donor for Eun-ji.

1187
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:00,879
-Where are you?
-Seriously?

1188
01:17:00,962 --> 01:17:03,423
Finally! Eun-ji can live!
We can save Eun-ji!

1189
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:05,967
-I'm in the on-call room now.
-Where is her mother?

1190
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:09,554
Probably in the hallway
in front of the PICU. She's always there.

1191
01:17:09,638 --> 01:17:12,682
Okay. Get Eun-ji off warfarin immediately
and get ready for surgery.

1192
01:17:12,766 --> 01:17:13,683
Got it!

1193
01:17:31,326 --> 01:17:32,327
Ma'am.

1194
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:34,454
Professor Kim.

1195
01:17:35,622 --> 01:17:36,956
You're still here?

1196
01:17:37,624 --> 01:17:39,167
I don't think I can go home tonight.

1197
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:41,961
-Why not? Are you on duty again?
-No.

1198
01:17:43,713 --> 01:17:45,840
I have to perform
Eun-ji's heart transplant.

1199
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:50,095
There's a donor.

1200
01:17:51,221 --> 01:17:52,347
We're getting the heart.

1201
01:17:57,352 --> 01:18:00,814
We're waiting for the second brain death
assessment. The first one is done.

1202
01:18:00,897 --> 01:18:04,067
Eun-ji will get the heart
if there are no major issues.

1203
01:18:09,155 --> 01:18:10,657
You've waited so long for this.

1204
01:18:11,408 --> 01:18:13,910
Many things happened
in the past five months

1205
01:18:14,619 --> 01:18:16,371
since she got the VAD,

1206
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:19,833
but thanks to your resilience
and patience,

1207
01:18:20,458 --> 01:18:22,043
this day has finally come.

1208
01:18:23,086 --> 01:18:24,087
Professor Kim.

1209
01:18:25,338 --> 01:18:27,632
This really isn't a dream, right?

1210
01:18:28,466 --> 01:18:30,677
Is Eun-ji really getting the heart?

1211
01:18:31,428 --> 01:18:34,723
Yes, Eun-ji is getting it.

1212
01:18:52,365 --> 01:18:55,285
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1213
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:10,717
What are these flowers for?

1214
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,223
I found them at home.

1215
01:19:18,933 --> 01:19:19,934
I see.

1216
01:19:23,146 --> 01:19:24,230
Are you all right?

1217
01:19:26,941 --> 01:19:28,151
Yes, I'm fine.

1218
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:32,739
You did the right thing.
You did nothing wrong.

1219
01:19:33,281 --> 01:19:35,700
What's wrong with yelling
at a senior colleague?

1220
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:37,869
Well done. Don't be discouraged.

1221
01:19:39,829 --> 01:19:42,373
Did you come all the way here this late
to say that?

1222
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,128
No.

1223
01:19:50,173 --> 01:19:51,674
I'm sorry.

1224
01:19:53,092 --> 01:19:54,010
I was out of line.

1225
01:19:57,138 --> 01:19:58,848
I know you said it because you care.

1226
01:20:03,937 --> 01:20:05,480
I guess I'm just insecure.

1227
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:07,649
I'm sorry.

1228
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:20,203
Do you know what that flower symbolizes?

1229
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:23,164
No, what?

1230
01:20:26,417 --> 01:20:27,919
Forgiveness and reconciliation.

1231
01:20:32,173 --> 01:20:33,466
How do you know that?

1232
01:20:35,093 --> 01:20:37,011
Your parents must really own
a flower shop.

1233
01:20:38,471 --> 01:20:41,808
We have tulips in every color.

1234
01:20:41,891 --> 01:20:44,811
Just tell me what you like.
I can bring any flower you want.

1235
01:20:48,773 --> 01:20:49,691
Aren't you hungry?

1236
01:20:49,774 --> 01:20:53,444
The gimbap place is still open…
Right, you're on duty.

1237
01:20:54,654 --> 01:20:56,406
I'll go pick some up. Just stay here.

1238
01:21:24,642 --> 01:21:27,770
Because she's been hooked up
to the VAD for a while,

1239
01:21:27,854 --> 01:21:29,856
the adhesion will be pretty severe,

1240
01:21:29,939 --> 01:21:32,483
so it'll take us a while
to dissect the adhesion.

1241
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:35,111
The heart might be a bit too big,

1242
01:21:35,194 --> 01:21:37,822
so she may leave the OR
with the chest open.

1243
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:41,200
But you know…

1244
01:21:42,785 --> 01:21:43,953
no matter what happens,

1245
01:21:45,163 --> 01:21:46,873
I want to save Eun-ji today.

1246
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:54,631
The two of you and Eun-ji endured so much
for today.

1247
01:21:55,548 --> 01:21:58,843
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

1248
01:22:00,678 --> 01:22:02,555
I don't want to be the one to ruin it.

1249
01:22:08,269 --> 01:22:09,604
I will do my best.

1250
01:22:11,272 --> 01:22:12,440
I will save Eun-ji.

1252
01:23:24,971 --> 01:23:25,972
I'm…

1253
01:23:27,557 --> 01:23:29,058
so happy for you.

1254
01:23:31,561 --> 01:23:33,604
Congratulations,
from the bottom of my heart.

1255
01:23:35,606 --> 01:23:36,691
Thank you.

1256
01:23:38,234 --> 01:23:40,069
The surgery will go well,

1257
01:23:40,987 --> 01:23:42,864
so don't worry about a thing.

1258
01:23:46,117 --> 01:23:47,452
Thank you.

1259
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:51,414
My goodness.

1260
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:54,792
Oh, dear.

YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

1262
01:24:29,077 --> 01:24:32,413
Are you not feeling well?
You look like you've lost a lot of weight.

1263
01:24:32,497 --> 01:24:34,707
No, I'm totally fine.

1264
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:40,171
-Hello.
-Hello.

1265
01:24:40,254 --> 01:24:42,632
Hey! It's been a while, Professor Kim.

1266
01:24:43,508 --> 01:24:45,551
Can you spare me a moment?

1267
01:24:45,635 --> 01:24:46,928
Sure.

1268
01:24:50,765 --> 01:24:52,600
SISTER

1269
01:24:53,726 --> 01:24:56,604
Hey, what's up? You rarely call me first.

1270
01:24:57,146 --> 01:24:58,439
Ik-jun.

1271
01:25:00,316 --> 01:25:01,317
Are you okay?

1272
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:03,569
I wasn't feeling well last week,

1273
01:25:04,278 --> 01:25:07,156
so I went to see a doctor
and got some tests done.

1274
01:25:08,157 --> 01:25:10,493
I just found out
my liver somatic index is over 300.

1275
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:16,415
The doctor said it's over 300,
and my bile ducts look a bit swollen.

1276
01:25:17,416 --> 01:25:18,626
What should I do?

1277
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:20,294
Come home at once.

1278
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:24,799
You know this is serious, right?

1279
01:25:30,346 --> 01:25:33,683
My gosh. Don't cry, Ik-sun. It's okay.

1280
01:25:33,766 --> 01:25:36,519
I'm going to fix it,
so don't worry about a thing.

1281
01:25:36,602 --> 01:25:37,895
Come home immediately.

1282
01:25:38,563 --> 01:25:40,898
I'll send you money for your flight…
Actually, no.

1283
01:25:41,649 --> 01:25:45,611
I'll book your flight for you,
so come home tomorrow, okay?

1284
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:49,657
All right, but…

1285
01:25:50,533 --> 01:25:52,785
make sure you keep this to yourself.

1286
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:54,620
I don't want anyone to find out.

1287
01:25:54,704 --> 01:25:58,541
Is that important now?
You may need a transplant.

1288
01:25:58,624 --> 01:26:00,960
Just don't tell anyone.

1289
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:06,340
All right.
For now, let's focus on treating you.

1290
01:26:06,424 --> 01:26:09,051
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.

1291
01:26:09,135 --> 01:26:10,803
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

1292
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:12,889
-Okay, I won't.
-And…

1293
01:26:14,432 --> 01:26:15,892
Jun-wan too.

1294
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:26,152
Don't tell Jun-wan, no matter what.

1295
01:26:27,028 --> 01:26:28,029
Okay?

1296
01:27:16,327 --> 01:27:19,747
Let's now forget

1297
01:27:21,165 --> 01:27:24,669
We must forget

1298
01:27:26,045 --> 01:27:32,218
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

1299
01:27:32,927 --> 01:27:34,553
Let's forget it now

1300
01:27:36,305 --> 01:27:39,433
Let's now forget

1301
01:27:40,935 --> 01:27:44,522
We must forget

1302
01:27:45,898 --> 01:27:51,946
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

1303
01:27:52,446 --> 01:27:54,490
Let's forget it now

1304
01:27:55,574 --> 01:28:02,373
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

1305
01:28:02,456 --> 01:28:04,583
Let's forget it now

1306
01:28:05,418 --> 01:28:12,383
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

1307
01:28:12,466 --> 01:28:15,469
Let's forget it now

1308
01:28:15,553 --> 01:28:22,310
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

1309
01:28:22,393 --> 01:28:24,478
Let's forget it now

1310
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:32,153
Walking together on the snowy day
It felt like a romantic movie scene

1311
01:28:32,236 --> 01:28:35,364
We must forget it now

1312
01:28:55,176 --> 01:28:58,804
-Hello. I'm your hallucination.
-Let's now forget

1313
01:29:00,097 --> 01:29:03,726
We must forget

1314
01:29:05,061 --> 01:29:10,775
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gift to you

1315
01:29:14,862 --> 01:29:18,366
Let's now forget

1316
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:23,496
We must forget

1317
01:29:24,789 --> 01:29:31,003
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

1318
01:29:35,007 --> 01:29:38,219
Let's now forget

1319
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:43,265
Let's now forget

1320
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,640
Patient Lee Gyeong-mi has a visitor today.

1321
01:30:24,723 --> 01:30:28,769
She's been getting visitors twice a day,
one at a time since yesterday.

1322
01:30:31,772 --> 01:30:32,690
You didn't know?

1323
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,861
The social media post looking
for volunteers to keep her company.

1324
01:30:36,944 --> 01:30:38,195
Who posted it?

1325
01:30:42,575 --> 01:30:44,201
Here, look.

1326
01:30:49,707 --> 01:30:52,918
THIS IS PROFESSOR KIM JUN-WAN
OF YULJE MEDICAL CENTER…

1327
01:30:56,714 --> 01:30:59,508
Professor Kim posted it
using his social media account.

1328
01:30:59,592 --> 01:31:02,720
Of course, we talked to Ms. Lee about it
in advance.

1329
01:31:03,512 --> 01:31:07,016
She's so happy.
She said she doesn't feel lonely anymore.

1330
01:31:08,225 --> 01:31:10,853
Gosh, why hadn't I thought of that?

1331
01:31:11,437 --> 01:31:13,230
So many people have applied.

1332
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:16,901
The social services team is going through
the list to arrange everything.

1333
01:31:18,194 --> 01:31:20,863
Professor Kim is really…

1334
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:21,947
I really…

1335
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:24,909
can't figure him out.

1336
01:31:53,479 --> 01:31:56,815
Let's now forget

1337
01:31:58,234 --> 01:32:02,655
We must forget

1338
01:32:10,746 --> 01:32:11,747
Next song.

1339
01:33:13,642 --> 01:33:14,768
Tell us, Song-hwa.

1340
01:33:14,852 --> 01:33:17,062
Why did you call us here
in the middle of the day?

1341
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,898
I'm going to take a break.

1342
01:33:19,982 --> 01:33:21,358
I need to recharge myself.

1343
01:33:21,442 --> 01:33:22,818
Aren't you coming to Seoul anymore?

1344
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:24,778
Forget that I exist, okay?

1345
01:33:24,862 --> 01:33:26,488
Professor. I have a question.

1346
01:33:26,572 --> 01:33:28,324
Why am I like this?

1347
01:33:28,407 --> 01:33:31,618
I think of running away the moment
I'm faced with hardship.

1348
01:33:31,702 --> 01:33:33,203
Why bring your son into this?

1349
01:33:33,287 --> 01:33:36,373
Don't meddle in his life again
and make things harder for him.

1350
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:38,959
I have no regrets left in life.

1351
01:33:39,043 --> 01:33:41,337
You've only just turned 70,
how could you say that?

1352
01:33:42,504 --> 01:33:44,965
We can see the ocean and go for a drive.

1353
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:47,468
-We'll spend a few days like that.
-Do you think we'll ever get to?

1354
01:33:47,551 --> 01:33:48,927
Why? Are you going somewhere?

1355
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:50,220
You should promise me, too.

1356
01:33:50,304 --> 01:33:51,347
What is this?

1357
01:33:51,430 --> 01:33:54,558
-Why aren't you asleep?
-I'm going to.

1358
01:33:55,225 --> 01:33:56,268
I can't seem to sleep.

1359
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,687
-I can still have dinner with you.
-What about Gyeo-ul?

1360
01:34:00,022 --> 01:34:03,400
Is there something
you should be telling me?

1361
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:07,029
I can't promise you I won't do it again.

1362
01:34:07,112 --> 01:34:08,322
Can't you trust us?

1363
01:34:08,405 --> 01:34:09,782
I was just asking.

1364
01:34:09,865 --> 01:34:13,702
Tell me if anything
ever happens to Gyeo-ul.
