[Hospital Playlist 2]

00:00:07.145 --> 00:00:09.022
Thank you. What's your name?

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:11.691
I'm Ko Se-gyeong.

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.610
Ik-sun and I live in the same building.

00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:16.654
I'm her closest friend here.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:22.910
Hello?

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:25.997
Yes, Se-gyeong.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.586
I know I said this earlier,
but when Ik-sun's out…

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.171
It doesn't matter how late it is.

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:36.507
Can you please tell her
to call me right away?

00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:38.176
Yes, I will.

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.137
But you really don't need to worry.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.805
Her injury isn't serious.

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:43.973
Okay, thank you.

00:00:58.112 --> 00:00:59.572
This is nuts…

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:33.147
Why are you still up?

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:35.733
My girlfriend is supposed to call me.

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.613
Do you need a drinking buddy?

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.866
No, thanks. Just do your thing.

00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:46.452
All right.

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.386
Hello? Are you okay?

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.763
Thank goodness you're not seriously hurt.

00:02:06.472 --> 00:02:07.682
What about the driver?

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:10.726
Everyone's fine. That couple's already
at the place we're staying.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.103
You're not "fine."

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:14.397
Your brain CT scan showed
bleeding in the brain,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.774
and you hurt your arm too.
How's that "fine"?

00:02:16.858 --> 00:02:18.693
It's not like my skull is broken.

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:22.113
And it's only a tiny bit of blood.
The doctor said it's negligible.

00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:25.241
They told me I shouldn't be worried.

00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:28.953
I'm really okay, babe. I'm totally fine.

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:30.371
Can't you tell from my voice?

00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:32.456
Even if the CT scan looks okay now,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.917
you could experience
delayed injury symptoms.

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.253
The bleeding could get worse
in the next two days.

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.921
Rest up and monitor it carefully.

00:02:39.005 --> 00:02:42.174
If you have a headache, vomit,
or feel dizzy, go to the ER right away.

00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:43.509
Yes, sir.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.472
Professor Kim, stop worrying about me
and go to bed.

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:51.183
-Isn't it really late there now?
-Yes, it's 2 a.m.

00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:53.811
They want you to stay there today, right?

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:56.439
Yes, they want
to monitor my condition tonight.

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:59.734
Gosh, I feel totally fine though.

00:02:59.817 --> 00:03:02.153
I've wasted an entire day,
so I'm going to check out

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:04.155
Bournemouth Pier tomorrow
and take it easy.

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:07.033
What are you talking about?
Rest up for the next two days

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:08.784
and just head back to London.

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:11.579
You should rest up tomorrow

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:14.040
and just head back home the next day.

00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:16.167
Wouldn't you feel more comfortable
at home?

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.085
I don't want to head back right away.

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.046
I'll step out for just a couple of hours.

00:03:21.088 --> 00:03:23.007
I can take care of myself.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.718
You can stop worrying about me, okay?

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:28.471
They're looking for me.
I'll call you later.

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:31.307
No, I'll call you when I'm leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.725
Go to bed.

00:03:32.808 --> 00:03:35.937
I feel so bad
that you stayed up because of me.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.063
I'm sorry.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:41.150
I love you. Feel better soon.

00:03:41.234 --> 00:03:43.236
Okay, I will.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.154
I hate it when I don't feel well.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:48.241
Sweet dreams, babe. I love you.

00:03:48.324 --> 00:03:49.242
Bye.

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.686
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.026
Shall we go see Ba-da now?

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.612
-Sure.
-Hello, Professor Ahn.

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:28.739
Hello.

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:32.910
Professor Ahn, we were only going
to keep Seo-a on antibiotics until today.

00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:35.413
Should we stick to the plan?

00:04:35.496 --> 00:04:38.582
Yes, we'll take her off it as of tomorrow.

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:08.154
Dr. Do Jae-hak,
please do a good job with the surgery.

00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:09.488
Don't worry, Professor.

00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:11.949
You can count on me.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:15.703
Jeez, I feel like all you've learned
is to be a smooth talker.

00:05:18.914 --> 00:05:20.958
This will take long
if you two have it easy.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.877
But if I have it easy, it'll be quick.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.255
Please make sure I can have it easy today.
You can do that, right?

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.257
Well, I'll do my best.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.258
Hey!

00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:34.513
Professor Ahn,
Ba-da's mother is very worried.

00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:36.348
We told her it'll be a simple surgery,

00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:39.185
but she's worried about
the general anesthesia and scarring.

00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:42.313
Of course, she's worried.

00:05:42.396 --> 00:05:44.774
To a mom, there's no such thing
as a simple surgery.

00:05:45.483 --> 00:05:46.609
Professor Ahn.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.486
Do you have a kid?

00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:52.990
Me? Yes. Many, in fact.

00:05:53.074 --> 00:05:55.326
I think of all the kids I've treated
as my own.

00:05:59.413 --> 00:06:01.207
Hello.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.917
He really is like a saint.

00:06:04.835 --> 00:06:06.337
I agree.

00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.218
I read the draft for your thesis.

00:06:12.301 --> 00:06:14.637
I know it's a complex topic.
You did a great job.

00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:19.058
I know you're saying that because
you don't want to hurt my feelings.

00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:21.352
I want your honest opinion.
I won't be hurt.

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:25.231
Well…

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:28.859
How about we have some coffee?

00:06:28.943 --> 00:06:31.237
Sure, I'll go make some now.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.947
Do you like it mild in the morning?

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.075
Yes, thanks. No, I'll do it.

00:06:36.158 --> 00:06:37.993
Just print the draft, Seon-bin.

00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:39.954
-Let's look at it together.
-Sure.

00:06:48.337 --> 00:06:51.215
Professor Chae,
are you going back to Sokcho tonight?

00:06:51.882 --> 00:06:54.969
No, tomorrow morning.
I only have appointments in the afternoon.

00:06:56.178 --> 00:06:59.348
-You want dark roast, right?
-Yes, thank you.

00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:00.766
No problem.

00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:05.104
We'll perform the surgery
early tomorrow morning.

00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:08.524
She can eat anything she wants
until bedtime tonight,

00:07:08.607 --> 00:07:12.570
but she shouldn't eat or drink
anything tomorrow, including water.

00:07:13.362 --> 00:07:16.323
Is Ba-da a big eater?

00:07:16.407 --> 00:07:18.534
Yes, she is. She gets so greedy with food.

00:07:18.617 --> 00:07:19.743
Oh, no.

00:07:20.286 --> 00:07:23.664
You can give her food
four hours after the surgery,

00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:26.041
so just be careful until tomorrow morning.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:29.211
Do you have any questions
about the surgery tomorrow?

00:07:29.795 --> 00:07:31.422
How long will it take?

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:34.341
The surgery itself
will take about an hour.

00:07:34.425 --> 00:07:38.262
But including the time we need
to move her to the OR and put her under…

00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:40.514
I'd say three hours at the most.

00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:44.643
We'll be performing a procedure called
"thyroglossal duct cyst excision."

00:07:44.727 --> 00:07:48.355
We'll make an incision
of about 3 to 5cm on the neck

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.024
and remove the cyst.

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:53.652
It'll leave a noticeable scar, right?

00:07:53.736 --> 00:07:56.572
Well, the incision will be about this big.

00:07:57.156 --> 00:07:58.991
Even if we try to make it smaller,

00:07:59.074 --> 00:08:01.327
it'll be about this big.

00:08:05.831 --> 00:08:08.542
She's been doing that
to everyone she sees.

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:15.132
Yes, pinky swear.

00:08:15.674 --> 00:08:18.802
The surgery will go well,
and you'll recover in no time, Ba-da.

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:19.887
Okay!

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:30.981
Did anything come up with Sim Eun-yeong?

00:08:31.732 --> 00:08:32.900
We checked her cervix.

00:08:32.983 --> 00:08:35.945
It's about 1cm,
so it hasn't dilated further.

00:08:36.028 --> 00:08:39.198
But she is having regular contractions,

00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:42.201
and her pulse has increased to 120.
She is having a hard time,

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:44.954
so we took her off ritodrine
and switched to atosiban.

00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:46.372
She's also on betamethasone.

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:49.667
What about a chest X-ray?
Any signs of pulmonary edema?

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.878
No, we checked.
No signs of pulmonary edema.

00:08:52.962 --> 00:08:55.214
But the patient is very worried.

00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:57.466
You'd like me
to have a look at her, right?

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.551
Yes.

00:09:00.302 --> 00:09:01.136
All right.

00:09:02.638 --> 00:09:03.973
-Min-ha.
-Yes?

00:09:04.473 --> 00:09:05.683
Ask away.

00:09:07.726 --> 00:09:09.728
How did you know?

00:09:11.021 --> 00:09:12.982
Can you read my mind?

00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:19.238
No. Of course, I can't.
I saw what you were writing down.

00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:21.448
TO ASK OR NOT TO ASK
THAT IS THE QUESTION

00:09:21.532 --> 00:09:22.366
Are you Hamlet?

00:09:24.785 --> 00:09:26.120
What's your question?

00:09:26.203 --> 00:09:29.456
Can patient Kim Ye-ji be discharged?

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.292
That's what I wanted to ask you.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:34.044
She's not nitrazine positive, right?

00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:36.964
No, she's not. And no pooling is detected.

00:09:37.047 --> 00:09:38.257
That's a relief.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.342
I'll let her know when I'm doing rounds.

00:09:41.844 --> 00:09:43.679
-Let's go. She must be waiting.
-Okay.

00:09:48.892 --> 00:09:51.812
Your liver somatic index looks good.

00:09:51.895 --> 00:09:54.565
The immunosuppressant levels
look good too.

00:09:54.648 --> 00:09:58.652
And your kidneys are working fine too.
Everything looks good.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.863
Any other concerns?

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:03.490
It's nothing serious,

00:10:03.574 --> 00:10:06.660
I can't digest food as well as I used to.

00:10:06.744 --> 00:10:08.746
My stomach gets upset often.

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:10.122
As I've explained before,

00:10:10.205 --> 00:10:12.833
the gallbladder is removed
during a liver transplant,

00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:16.378
which can cause
digestive problems temporarily.

00:10:16.462 --> 00:10:18.422
Try to stay away from greasy foods

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:20.924
and make sure you exercise regularly.

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:24.470
Yes, I took your advice
and have been exercising regularly.

00:10:24.553 --> 00:10:28.140
Don't you worry, Doctor.
I'll make sure she never becomes lax.

00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:29.600
She's finally healthy.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.562
Don't worry about
her exercise routine and diet.

00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:36.982
My gosh, okay. Keep up the good work.

00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:39.485
Then I'll see you in a month.

00:10:39.568 --> 00:10:40.944
-Okay.
-Oh, right.

00:10:42.237 --> 00:10:44.323
-You live in Jinhae, don't you?
-Yes.

00:10:45.032 --> 00:10:47.034
It must be tiring
to come all the way here.

00:10:47.117 --> 00:10:48.369
What time did you leave?

00:10:49.161 --> 00:10:52.039
-We got here last night.
-My gosh.

00:10:52.122 --> 00:10:53.457
We got here in the wee hours

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.293
and slept on the bench in the lobby.

00:10:56.377 --> 00:10:59.463
We used to get a motel room in the past,

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:01.382
but it's hard to get a room these days.

00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:04.218
And we'd have to check out
early in the morning anyway,

00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:06.136
so we didn't want to waste money.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.765
Still, it's important
that you get enough sleep.

00:11:10.516 --> 00:11:13.018
Don't you also have an appointment
with our neurologist?

00:11:13.102 --> 00:11:15.104
You were treated
for a cerebral infarction.

00:11:15.187 --> 00:11:19.400
That's right! You're so smart.

00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:20.692
My gosh.

00:11:21.652 --> 00:11:25.030
So I've been told.

00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:29.284
When is that appointment?
You'll have to come back for it.

00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:31.286
Can you find out?

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.579
Just a moment, please.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.792
It's on March 25.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:39.294
Yes, March 25.
It's with Professor Yoon Mi-hye, right?

00:11:39.795 --> 00:11:40.879
Yes, that's right.

00:11:40.963 --> 00:11:44.425
Hold on. Does that mean

00:11:44.508 --> 00:11:47.302
I have an appointment with Professor Lee
in a month,

00:11:47.386 --> 00:11:49.972
and I have to come back
about a week after that?

00:11:50.055 --> 00:11:53.225
Sure, we'll come back.
It'll be nice to spend more time in Seoul.

00:11:53.308 --> 00:11:56.228
What are you talking about?
This is exhausting for me.

00:11:56.311 --> 00:11:58.605
I'll work around your schedule.

00:11:58.689 --> 00:12:01.608
I'll see you when you're here
for your neurologist appointment.

00:12:01.692 --> 00:12:03.861
I take outpatient appointments
for Wednesdays.

00:12:03.944 --> 00:12:06.905
Are you sure? Is that really okay?

00:12:06.989 --> 00:12:09.241
Yes. You're recovering quickly,

00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:12.202
and all the numbers look good,
so we can push it back by a week.

00:12:12.286 --> 00:12:14.037
I'll prescribe you enough meds.

00:12:14.121 --> 00:12:16.331
You live far away, so this is no problem.

00:12:16.415 --> 00:12:19.710
-Thank you so much, Doctor.
-Thank you, Doctor.

00:12:19.793 --> 00:12:22.087
No problem at all. Have a safe trip home.

00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.006
-Thank you.
-See you in a month.

00:12:24.089 --> 00:12:25.632
-Yes, I'll see you then.
-Let's go.

00:12:26.675 --> 00:12:27.509
Thank you.

00:12:27.593 --> 00:12:28.886
Okay, take it easy.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.305
Kim Jun-wan speaking.

00:12:32.473 --> 00:12:34.725
Okay, I finished my surgery.
I can come now.

00:12:34.808 --> 00:12:36.226
Okay.

00:12:45.068 --> 00:12:46.528
You can come in now.

00:12:46.612 --> 00:12:49.114
Let's check if everyone's here
and go in together.

00:12:49.615 --> 00:12:51.492
Kang Dong-hyeon's guardian?

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:53.202
-Here.
-Great.

00:12:53.285 --> 00:12:54.953
Is Choi Han-na's guardian here?

00:12:55.037 --> 00:12:56.413
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:12:56.497 --> 00:12:58.499
-Is Lee Won-u's guardian here?
-Yes.

00:12:58.582 --> 00:13:01.376
Great. Bae Min-jin's guardian?

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.837
-Here.
-Okay. Lee Hye-ri's guardian?

00:13:03.921 --> 00:13:07.007
So I should take out the results
concerning other variables, right?

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.927
Yes, you included the results

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.930
that aren't statistically significant,

00:13:13.013 --> 00:13:14.640
-and I find it distracting.
-Okay.

00:13:14.723 --> 00:13:16.475
And lastly…

00:13:18.018 --> 00:13:19.686
In the conclusion,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.274
you wrote that
the meningioma volume threshold is 14cc.

00:13:24.358 --> 00:13:27.611
So I think the discussion
should be focused on the mechanism

00:13:27.694 --> 00:13:31.073
of how growing meningiomas
cause cerebral edema.

00:13:31.156 --> 00:13:34.701
I wrote down some key points for you.

00:13:34.785 --> 00:13:37.496
But why don't you rewrite this part
and send it to me?

00:13:37.579 --> 00:13:40.666
Then I'll email you what I wrote
so you can refer to it.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.210
Okay, will do. Thank you.

00:13:43.293 --> 00:13:45.796
I'll work on it and send it over quickly.

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:46.880
Sounds good.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.427
This is good coffee.

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:55.013
You made the coffee.

00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:59.226
I was talking to myself.

00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:07.526
You like studying and enjoy it, don't you?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.361
Me?

00:14:10.654 --> 00:14:14.157
Well, no. I don't find it fun.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.244
How can studying be fun?

00:14:18.245 --> 00:14:19.329
Professor.

00:14:21.456 --> 00:14:22.624
Yes.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.878
I do enjoy it.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.172
Isn't it fun to learn new things?

00:14:31.884 --> 00:14:34.511
I chose to study the brain
because the more you learn…

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:35.929
-It's hard.
-…it's fun.

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:40.434
Don't you know how interesting
the human brain is?

00:14:40.517 --> 00:14:42.978
There are still things
we don't know about the brain.

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:46.273
I do enjoy treating patients,

00:14:47.107 --> 00:14:49.151
but I wish I could read and study
all my life.

00:14:53.822 --> 00:14:54.948
I'm weird, right?

00:15:03.707 --> 00:15:05.292
I changed the ventilator setting.

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:07.294
Run an ABG analysis again
in 30 minutes.

00:15:07.377 --> 00:15:08.378
Got it.

00:15:08.962 --> 00:15:09.963
Hello.

00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:14.718
You said hello earlier.
Why are you doing it again?

00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:16.887
I'm sorry.

00:15:18.805 --> 00:15:20.265
-Jang Hong-do.
-Yes, sir.

00:15:20.349 --> 00:15:23.727
Where should the heart-lung machine
be connected to during heart surgery?

00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:27.022
The aorta and…

00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:30.359
Well…

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:34.821
The aorta and…

00:15:36.073 --> 00:15:37.491
And…

00:15:37.574 --> 00:15:39.326
The aorta and…

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:42.829
You need to study harder so you can
answer these questions right away.

00:15:42.913 --> 00:15:45.123
I may ask you the same question again,

00:15:45.207 --> 00:15:46.708
or I may not.

00:15:47.334 --> 00:15:48.418
Take it easy.

00:16:20.742 --> 00:16:24.913
STAFF ONLY

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:13.378
-Is Ru-bin out of the OR?
-Yes, we're in the PICU now.

00:17:13.462 --> 00:17:14.463
Okay, I'm coming now.

00:17:16.298 --> 00:17:17.841
The surgery went well.

00:17:18.383 --> 00:17:20.844
As we had expected
based on the test results,

00:17:20.927 --> 00:17:23.346
there was a big hole
between the two ventricles.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.808
We fixed it using the pericardium,
which is a thin sac

00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:28.143
that surrounds the heart.

00:17:28.226 --> 00:17:31.229
We also found a small hole
between the two atria,

00:17:31.313 --> 00:17:32.814
and we fixed that too.

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:36.526
The surgery went smoothly
without any issues,

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.030
so I don't think we need to be worried
about the recovery.

00:17:41.406 --> 00:17:44.451
Don't worry.
We'll keep monitoring Ru-bin carefully.

00:17:44.534 --> 00:17:46.286
-Thank you, Professor Kim.
-Thank you.

00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:49.623
Ru-bin got through the surgery.

00:17:49.706 --> 00:17:50.707
I know.

00:17:51.625 --> 00:17:54.252
Min-chan's parents are here, right?

00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:56.505
They're outside.
Should I tell them to come in?

00:17:56.588 --> 00:17:58.131
No, I'll go talk to them.

00:18:03.261 --> 00:18:05.138
-Where are you going?
-I'm following you.

00:18:05.222 --> 00:18:08.350
-Why?
-Because you're off to deliver good news.

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:09.768
I need a cheerer-upper.

00:18:10.352 --> 00:18:11.603
When will you cheer me up?

00:18:11.686 --> 00:18:14.981
You always cheer me up.

00:18:15.941 --> 00:18:17.818
I already feel so much better.

00:18:18.318 --> 00:18:22.572
Jeez, you always have something to say.
My goodness.

00:18:26.243 --> 00:18:29.037
The ultrasound looks good,
and the heartbeat is solid.

00:18:29.121 --> 00:18:32.165
Min-chan's body is working hard
to get used to the new heart.

00:18:32.249 --> 00:18:34.835
We should be able to move him
to a regular ward tomorrow.

00:18:36.753 --> 00:18:38.672
I can't believe this day is finally here.

00:18:41.216 --> 00:18:44.010
There are a few things
you need to keep in mind.

00:18:44.094 --> 00:18:45.595
I'll go over them with you later.

00:18:47.681 --> 00:18:49.850
It's lunchtime. You should have lunch.

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:53.103
Yes, you too. Enjoy your lunch.

00:18:54.187 --> 00:18:58.650
We want to treat you to dinner
at the most expensive restaurant,

00:19:00.735 --> 00:19:03.071
but we can't do that, right?

00:19:03.155 --> 00:19:04.781
That's right. I'll get fired.

00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:08.451
Thank you for the offer though.

00:19:08.535 --> 00:19:10.412
It's the thought that counts. Talk soon.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:18.503
-You'll have lunch with me, right?
-Gosh, whatever.

00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:20.630
Leave me alone, will you?

00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:30.891
About Yoo Gyeong-jin, the violinist.

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:33.059
Did you hear how much she paid us?

00:19:33.143 --> 00:19:34.936
I don't care. Mind your own business.

00:19:36.646 --> 00:19:37.772
Hey.

00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:40.442
Oh, hello!

00:19:40.525 --> 00:19:42.485
Yes, hello.

00:19:43.528 --> 00:19:45.113
Here for lunch, right? It's on me.

00:19:45.697 --> 00:19:47.824
Really? But I have company.

00:19:47.908 --> 00:19:49.743
I'll pay for them too. How many?

00:19:49.826 --> 00:19:52.412
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:19:56.082 --> 00:19:59.085
Thanks. Lunch is on Jun-wan.

00:19:59.169 --> 00:20:01.630
-Nice.
-Thank you.

00:20:05.926 --> 00:20:07.928
This is the best lunch menu
I've seen here.

00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:09.804
This is why I can't eat elsewhere.

00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:12.182
Hey, put that down.
Is that the Olympic torch?

00:20:12.265 --> 00:20:14.517
It looks too perfect,
like a plastic food model.

00:20:16.311 --> 00:20:17.729
It is real.

00:20:18.563 --> 00:20:20.565
Professor Kim, can I get more of this?

00:20:20.649 --> 00:20:23.401
Sure, go for it. Eat as much as you want.

00:20:27.906 --> 00:20:29.616
Do you not have much of an appetite?

00:20:31.534 --> 00:20:35.497
-No.
-I've never seen you eat so little.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.998
You always devour your food.

00:20:37.082 --> 00:20:40.043
I can't really eat.
I feel like I'm chewing sand now.

00:20:40.126 --> 00:20:42.629
Oh, no. Then give me your drumstick.

00:20:43.213 --> 00:20:45.507
No, I'm going to eat this.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.384
You just said you can't really eat.

00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:48.885
It feels like chewing sand.

00:20:48.969 --> 00:20:50.470
Just the rice, not the chicken.

00:20:51.429 --> 00:20:53.390
I was saving it for last.

00:20:53.974 --> 00:20:56.268
-Mind your own business.
-That, again?

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.571
-Ik-sun loves drumsticks too.
-"Ik-sun"?

00:21:09.239 --> 00:21:10.407
-Ik-jun.
-"Ik-sun."

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.825
-Ik-jun.
-You said "Ik-sun."

00:21:11.908 --> 00:21:13.743
No, Ik-jun! I said Ik-jun!

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.581
Let's eat.

00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:20.417
Okay.

00:21:28.383 --> 00:21:31.344
But there must be someone named "Ik-sun"

00:21:32.053 --> 00:21:34.014
somewhere in the world, right?

00:21:37.058 --> 00:21:38.059
Yes, probably.

00:21:38.893 --> 00:21:40.770
Maybe on the other side of the planet.

00:21:47.235 --> 00:21:48.528
Hey, Song-hwa. Speak.

00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.989
Hey, they're serving drumsticks today.
Hurry!

00:21:51.072 --> 00:21:53.867
Really? Darn it. What a bummer.

00:21:54.367 --> 00:21:56.286
I have a lunch meeting today.

00:21:56.369 --> 00:21:58.621
What's it for? Do you have a conference?

00:21:58.705 --> 00:22:01.791
It's an important tteokbokki meeting,
which was scheduled last week.

00:22:01.875 --> 00:22:03.168
They're all waiting for me.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.463
I thought you had a conference
or something. Okay.

00:22:06.546 --> 00:22:09.424
I'll stop by your office for coffee.
Are you staying late today?

00:22:09.507 --> 00:22:11.968
Yes, you should hurry. Enjoy your meal.

00:22:12.052 --> 00:22:13.219
Thanks, enjoy your lunch.

00:22:16.639 --> 00:22:19.309
All right, let's eat.

00:22:19.976 --> 00:22:21.311
This looks delicious.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.606
Try these potatoes too.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.192
Here's a spoon for you.

00:22:32.447 --> 00:22:34.741
This one's for me.

00:22:39.329 --> 00:22:41.790
Honey, eat before it gets cold.

00:22:41.873 --> 00:22:42.957
Okay.

00:23:09.067 --> 00:23:10.068
Nice!

00:23:13.947 --> 00:23:15.782
Don't tell me you got one for each person.

00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:17.408
We don't do that here.

00:23:18.493 --> 00:23:19.911
My gosh, what is all this?

00:23:21.287 --> 00:23:23.123
Hello.

00:23:23.206 --> 00:23:24.541
Is the tteokbokki here already?

00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:27.460
Gyeo-ul,
Does Chuchu always order this much?

00:23:27.544 --> 00:23:31.005
-Why?
-Min-ha ordered three full servings!.

00:23:31.673 --> 00:23:33.007
I can finish one by myself.

00:23:34.217 --> 00:23:35.260
I see.

00:23:35.343 --> 00:23:37.679
This is half and half.
The original flavor.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:41.975
That one is quite spicy.

00:23:42.058 --> 00:23:43.643
I love spicy food.

00:23:44.853 --> 00:23:47.272
Oh, no. Jeong-won can't handle spicy food…

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.363
She knows.

00:23:59.075 --> 00:24:01.703
Dr. Chu knows. I told her.

00:24:01.786 --> 00:24:03.955
She's the only one at Yulje
who knows about it.

00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:07.792
I congratulated her for beating God.

00:24:07.876 --> 00:24:10.879
That's right! Gyeo-ul beat God.

00:24:14.799 --> 00:24:17.260
-What did you get for us?
-The mild flavor.

00:24:17.343 --> 00:24:20.096
By the way, didn't you say
you invited one more person?

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.931
Yes, I did.

00:24:22.015 --> 00:24:24.767
I got it right this time.

00:24:27.437 --> 00:24:28.646
Where's this prick?

00:24:32.942 --> 00:24:35.778
Hey! Don't you dare barge in here!

00:24:42.368 --> 00:24:43.536
Hello.

00:24:44.537 --> 00:24:45.705
Hi.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.709
I thought this was the GS Medical Office.

00:24:50.418 --> 00:24:53.588
-What are you guys doing here?
-We're eating tteokbokki, obviously.

00:24:53.671 --> 00:24:56.883
Have some tteokbokki.
The steamed eggs too.

00:24:56.966 --> 00:24:59.510
The steamed eggs are mine.
I'm going to eat all of it.

00:25:00.845 --> 00:25:02.889
Well, okay.

00:25:02.972 --> 00:25:05.683
It's fine.
That petty jerk can have it all.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.021
-Is this one spicy?
-It's the mild flavor.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.650
-Can you not eat spicy food?
-I can. I like spicy food.

00:25:21.366 --> 00:25:22.617
This one's good too.

00:25:23.701 --> 00:25:24.827
Dig in.

00:25:30.625 --> 00:25:33.586
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:35.046
You should have some too.

00:25:35.129 --> 00:25:36.506
-Sure.
-Here.

00:25:37.924 --> 00:25:40.093
Have some rice balls too.

00:25:41.135 --> 00:25:43.346
-You too. Eat up.
-Okay.

00:25:51.938 --> 00:25:53.648
-Gyeo-ul.
-Yes?

00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:09.526
-Hello.
-You made it.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.987
Hello. Hey, you.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.947
Andrea, what took you so long?

00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:15.949
You do all the pediatric surgeries here?

00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:17.493
Yes, I actually do.

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:18.744
Right, you do.

00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:20.996
It was an exclamation, not a question.

00:26:24.541 --> 00:26:26.126
This is pretty spicy.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.753
It's probably too spicy for you.

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:33.717
Gosh, seriously.

00:26:34.635 --> 00:26:36.345
How could you do this to me?

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.598
Is this how you treat your Cupid?

00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:43.977
Hey, where are you?

00:26:45.312 --> 00:26:46.438
I'm fine with anything.

00:26:47.773 --> 00:26:49.066
Okay, I'll see you there.

00:26:50.192 --> 00:26:51.568
Bye! I will starve myself.

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.111
Professor Lee.

00:26:53.195 --> 00:26:56.532
Was that Song-hwa? Do you want
to take this unopened box of rice balls?

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:59.910
It's okay. I had enough food.
Enjoy your lunch. Bye.

00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:08.627
-Professor Kim.
-Thanks.

00:27:12.881 --> 00:27:16.301
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week.

00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:18.845
-Are you taking his patients?
-Yes, just three.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.640
Including Lee Gyeong-mi?

00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:25.727
Yes, but I don't even know
if I can say I'm taking her on

00:27:25.811 --> 00:27:27.813
because there isn't much
we can do for her.

00:27:30.607 --> 00:27:31.650
That's true.

00:27:34.027 --> 00:27:36.572
Professor Cheon has a conference
next week,

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:39.408
so Professor Kim Jun-wan will fill in
and look after you.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.538
He's great. You don't need to worry.

00:27:46.039 --> 00:27:49.209
He can be curt,
but he cares a lot about his patients.

00:27:49.293 --> 00:27:51.169
And he checks in on his patients often.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.009
Oh, you already know that, right?

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.348
Aren't you lonely?

00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:12.566
Oh, dear.

00:28:15.569 --> 00:28:18.071
We'll check in on you often.

00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:40.761
Still, she always sends way too much.

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:42.930
I can never finish it.

00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:47.267
-I'd hate to throw it out.
-I know.

00:28:47.351 --> 00:28:49.978
I tell her to only send a little
but always get a huge box.

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:52.606
It's so heavy
that I can never carry it on my own.

00:28:53.857 --> 00:28:55.776
Now, she sends stuff to Sokcho.

00:28:55.859 --> 00:28:58.487
Gosh, she sends me way too much food.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:02.491
My mom's the same way.
I moved to Seoul over 20 years ago,

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.618
and we fought a lot about it
at the beginning.

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:08.997
"Mom, please! Don't send me
too much food this time, please!"

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.541
But that didn't work. She never listens.

00:29:11.625 --> 00:29:15.671
She sends me 50 million perilla leaves
when she's feeling energetic.

00:29:21.551 --> 00:29:23.053
What did she send you this time?

00:29:23.762 --> 00:29:25.013
Pickled vegetables.

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:27.307
Sounds delicious.

00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:30.394
Garlic, chili, and water celery.
One container each.

00:29:31.812 --> 00:29:35.357
Gosh, it'll take me forever to finish it.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.401
I might go back to Sokcho tonight.

00:29:37.484 --> 00:29:39.277
To eat my pickled vegetables.

00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.404
Give me some.

00:29:41.238 --> 00:29:44.741
Great idea. Take some.
There's no way I can finish it on my own.

00:29:44.825 --> 00:29:48.161
Yes, your mom probably sent you extra
so you can share them with friends.

00:29:48.245 --> 00:29:50.414
Give me some. Jun-wan and Jeong-won too.

00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:53.041
Jeong-won's a good cook,
so it'll make him happy.

00:29:54.084 --> 00:29:55.711
Yes, I should do that.

00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:56.837
Yes.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:00.090
On one condition though.

00:30:03.135 --> 00:30:04.511
Take my perilla leaves.

00:30:06.263 --> 00:30:09.433
I have about 20 million of them at home.
Just take 10 percent.

00:30:11.268 --> 00:30:13.270
Okay, I like perilla leaves.

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.655
That looks nice.

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:28.160
What do you think of this table lamp?
Isn't it nice?

00:30:28.243 --> 00:30:30.037
#MY HUBBY'S THE BEST
#THANK YOU, JAE-HAK

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.663
Yes, it's nice.

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:34.041
Why are you looking at a stranger's post?

00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:36.209
She's my wife.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:40.130
My wife posted this.

00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:42.382
She bought this lamp today.

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:45.010
Why didn't you tell me it was your wife?

00:30:45.844 --> 00:30:49.681
Look at these hashtags.
"My hubby's the best.

00:30:49.765 --> 00:30:51.808
Thank you, Jae-hak." See?

00:30:57.022 --> 00:30:59.816
Your cup is empty. What are you drinking?

00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:05.113
Everyone goes on social media
to look at other people's photos.

00:31:05.906 --> 00:31:08.784
I know you're on social media too,
but your account is private.

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.912
That's right. I have an account too.

00:31:13.038 --> 00:31:14.289
I'm on social media too.

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:19.086
Why are you on it
if you're not even posting anything?

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:22.672
There's nothing. Nothing at all.

00:31:22.756 --> 00:31:23.799
I rarely go on.

00:31:24.466 --> 00:31:27.511
My girlfriend created the account for me
before she left for the UK.

00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:29.930
I only use it
to look at my girlfriend's posts.

00:31:30.013 --> 00:31:32.974
Don't just look.
You should post some photos too.

00:31:33.058 --> 00:31:35.143
That way, your girlfriend can also see

00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:39.147
what you're up to and how you're doing.

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:40.065
We talk every day.

00:31:41.066 --> 00:31:42.943
Talking on the phone isn't the same

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:45.946
as sharing your day-to-day life with her.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:49.616
My day-to-day life? I have no life.

00:31:49.699 --> 00:31:51.243
I work and go home, on repeat.

00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:54.621
Well, it'd be nice to share that.

00:31:55.288 --> 00:31:59.793
You should post some photos
so your girlfriend can see them.

00:32:00.377 --> 00:32:02.587
Do you want me to teach you how to do it?

00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:05.882
Oh, please. What's there to teach?
I can just take a photo and post it.

00:32:06.842 --> 00:32:09.010
Give me your phone for a moment.

00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:13.223
Why?

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:15.892
Let's see.

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:18.728
Don't move.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:21.273
-Hey.
-Nice!

00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:24.359
Oh, my! This is a great photo.

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:27.028
You could even use this
as your passport photo.

00:32:28.238 --> 00:32:29.197
Delete it.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.742
-What should the caption be?
-"Kim Jun-wan"?

00:32:34.161 --> 00:32:36.163
Everyone knows that you're Kim Jun-wan.

00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:37.873
Then…

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:41.251
"Kim Jun-wan, the Professor
of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Yulje"?

00:32:41.334 --> 00:32:43.211
Why would you write your position?

00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:45.922
Let's just say…

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.759
"This is for my girlfriend."

00:32:49.843 --> 00:32:53.221
Forget it. My girlfriend will freak out.

00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.890
What about the hashtag?

00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:56.766
Well…

00:32:57.309 --> 00:32:58.602
What's that for?

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.064
You want many people to see it, right?

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:05.817
If you post with various hashtags,

00:33:05.901 --> 00:33:08.236
your photo can be discovered
by more people.

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:11.156
I don't want other people to see it.

00:33:11.907 --> 00:33:13.742
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.578
Then I won't use any hashtags.

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.998
Okay, don't use any.
I just want my girlfriend to see it.

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.127
Done.

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:30.133
Let me know if you want to learn more
about social media.

00:33:30.717 --> 00:33:31.927
That won't happen.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.597
Just in case though.
If you ever want to learn more,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.432
just come to me and say this.

00:33:38.808 --> 00:33:41.937
"Jae-hak, do you have a minute?"

00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:45.065
I told you that won't happen.
I'm going to get some rest.

00:34:30.819 --> 00:34:32.779
FIRST SELFIE IN A LONG TIME

00:34:32.862 --> 00:34:34.197
#THE BEST LATTE EVER

00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:42.414
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU GUYS
#SE-GYEONG #DA-SOM #PERFECT IELTS SCORE

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:55.176
SET UP A BLIND DATE FOR SE-GYEONG
AND GOT THIS AS A GIFT #THANKS SEGYEONG

00:35:17.073 --> 00:35:19.993
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

00:35:22.245 --> 00:35:25.373
Hello, did you have a good weekend?

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:26.958
Something's wrong with Eun-ji.

00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:29.002
She woke up but can't move her left arm.

00:35:29.085 --> 00:35:30.045
What?

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.427
You've been doing a lot of surgeries.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.638
Yes, I'm all booked up this week.
You're early.

00:35:40.722 --> 00:35:43.350
Yes, I want to have some coffee
before I go in.

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:46.686
Professor Kim, a call for you.
It's Dr. Do Jae-hak.

00:35:48.688 --> 00:35:51.316
-What's up?
-We have a bit of an emergency.

00:35:51.399 --> 00:35:54.194
-What is it?
-Eun-ji's left-side motor control is poor.

00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:57.697
I'd say her arm is at about Grade 2.
Her leg, Grade 3.

00:35:57.781 --> 00:35:59.991
-What's her PT?
-Her INR is 2.8.

00:36:00.075 --> 00:36:02.869
We can't do an MRI because of the VAD.
Let's do a CT scan.

00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:04.996
Call Neurology
and ask them to have a look.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.290
Talk to Eun-ji's mother

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:09.876
and keep me updated.
I'll be there after my surgery.

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:14.964
Thank you.

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:21.846
Do you handle all the VIP surgeries?

00:36:22.347 --> 00:36:24.516
Can't the other professors
take care of some?

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.976
You can't commute from Sokcho every time.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:30.105
It's not for every surgery.
It's only once every two weeks.

00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:31.940
Thanks for the coffee.

00:36:32.816 --> 00:36:35.735
-Are you bribing me?
-No, it's a gift.

00:36:36.361 --> 00:36:40.156
I feel so reassured when you're in Seoul.

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:43.326
How's Seok-min?

00:36:46.371 --> 00:36:48.373
Haven't you guys made up yet?

00:36:49.124 --> 00:36:50.125
No.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.502
Was it a big fight?

00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:56.131
I told him I chose Neurosurgery
because I wanted to study the brain

00:36:56.214 --> 00:36:58.883
and that I don't understand
how he could give up so easily.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:04.180
And Seok-min said, "This is why people say
those who have had it easy in life

00:37:04.264 --> 00:37:06.683
are inconsiderate."

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.650
So it was a big fight.

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:16.734
Yes.

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:20.488
Just call him first.

00:37:20.572 --> 00:37:23.074
I did, but we ended up
having another argument.

00:37:23.783 --> 00:37:25.285
I haven't seen him for two weeks.

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:28.163
I'm afraid we'd break up at this rate.

00:37:32.709 --> 00:37:33.710
Just wait.

00:37:34.669 --> 00:37:36.129
Something will come along.

00:37:38.339 --> 00:37:40.800
My ex-boyfriend and I fought a lot too.

00:37:41.634 --> 00:37:44.846
Every time we fought,
I wanted to patch things up quickly,

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.557
so I took time out of my busy schedule
to call and see him,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.350
and have long discussions.

00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:54.147
It was exhausting.

00:37:55.148 --> 00:37:59.819
But there's something
I learned naturally with age.

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:04.574
As long as you both want to make it work

00:38:04.657 --> 00:38:07.160
and aren't too far apart,

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:08.620
just wait and see.

00:38:08.703 --> 00:38:10.246
Then something will come along.

00:38:12.081 --> 00:38:15.543
So many things can happen
even in the span of a day, you know.

00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:19.005
Things happen,
whether they're good or bad.

00:38:19.088 --> 00:38:23.092
And sometimes, you have to call and
meet up because of something that happens.

00:38:27.305 --> 00:38:30.517
He's probably very busy at the moment,

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.895
learning new things
and meeting people at his new job.

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:35.522
And you're busy too.

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:40.318
The best thing to do now would be
just keeping busy.

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:42.195
Just focus on your life,

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:43.988
and naturally,

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:46.574
something will come along,

00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:49.327
and you'd have to call and see each other.

00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:54.958
You're right. Maybe I'll get in trouble
and end up calling him.

00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.210
It could be the other way around too.

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:03.091
So relationship-wise,
just let nature take its course.

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.469
Let's get some work done.
I think I'll be late for my surgery.

00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:09.013
I'm sorry, Professor Chae. And thank you.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.019
Looks like we have
all the paperwork we need.

00:39:15.103 --> 00:39:17.605
The loan will be issued
as early as this week.

00:39:18.439 --> 00:39:20.066
-Thank you.
-Professor Ahn.

00:39:20.149 --> 00:39:23.069
We want to give you a small gift
when you find a house you like.

00:39:23.152 --> 00:39:27.282
The branch manager wants to help out
because it's for a good cause.

00:39:27.365 --> 00:39:28.866
My gosh, really?

00:39:29.367 --> 00:39:32.328
A gift, on top of taking care
of my loan application so quickly?

00:39:32.412 --> 00:39:34.205
I won't decline.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:40.420
By the way, do you not give that doll
to your loan clients?

00:39:40.503 --> 00:39:42.422
I even have two savings accounts with you.

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:44.632
Oh, sure. I'll give you one.

00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:48.052
Do you have a kid?
I thought you were single.

00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:49.554
No, I'm not married yet.

00:39:50.263 --> 00:39:52.223
Just give me one.

00:39:52.307 --> 00:39:55.476
I'll give you two.
You can give one to your girlfriend.

00:39:56.811 --> 00:39:58.062
Thank you.

00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:01.649
Kisses.

00:40:03.693 --> 00:40:05.111
Hello.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.329
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:40:16.581 --> 00:40:19.751
Dolls? What are they for?

00:40:19.834 --> 00:40:22.503
How adorable!

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:23.963
What are those little ones?

00:40:24.047 --> 00:40:25.798
They're so cute.

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:27.925
My kid would love it.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.512
And I see that you have two.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.099
My kid's birthday is coming up

00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:37.727
and my kid loves dolls like that.

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:39.896
I'm just saying. It's very soon.

00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:41.522
-Can you…
-Hello?

00:40:43.066 --> 00:40:44.317
I'm coming now.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:49.238
There's an emergency. I have to go.

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:50.323
Okay.

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:59.624
Hey, I'm coming now.

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:02.210
Thankfully, no hemorrhage was detected.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.880
I showed it to the radiologist.

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:09.634
There's no hemorrhage, but we're not sure
whether or not an embolism has occurred.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.137
And Eun-ji has almost fully regained
her motor function.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.349
Thank goodness, seriously.

00:41:16.933 --> 00:41:18.309
How much warfarin did she get?

00:41:18.393 --> 00:41:20.103
She got 1ml yesterday.

00:41:20.186 --> 00:41:22.271
Give her 1.5ml today,
but it'll take a while,

00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:23.648
so give her enoxaparin too.

00:41:23.731 --> 00:41:26.359
Eun-ji's mother is very worried.

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:31.030
I did explain to her
that Eun-ji is okay now,

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:35.451
but I think you should talk to her.

00:41:35.535 --> 00:41:37.203
It'll help her calm down.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:39.664
Yes, I was going to talk to her anyway.

00:41:39.747 --> 00:41:41.332
Thanks. I'm here now.

00:41:44.377 --> 00:41:47.839
Blood clots can occur
even if we use blood thinners.

00:41:48.464 --> 00:41:50.842
This condition is called a microembolism.

00:41:50.925 --> 00:41:55.596
I think a tiny blood clot had traveled
to the brain and caused blockage.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.307
Thankfully, the blockage has been cleared.

00:41:58.391 --> 00:42:01.644
Then what if we give her
more blood thinners?

00:42:02.228 --> 00:42:04.981
I've explained this before,
and we've also experienced it.

00:42:05.064 --> 00:42:08.860
Too much blood thinners
can lead to bleeding.

00:42:08.943 --> 00:42:11.946
If it happens inside her brain,
it'll be very serious.

00:42:13.573 --> 00:42:18.327
We kept checking Eun-ji's blood work
and were careful with the blood thinners,

00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:21.456
but this still happened,
which means it can happen again.

00:42:25.752 --> 00:42:28.713
In a way, it's like having a time bomb
in your chest.

00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:31.591
I feel like time's running out.

00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:35.803
She should get the surgery
as soon as we find a donor.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:40.975
Professor Kim.

00:42:44.979 --> 00:42:46.898
Every day feels like torture.

00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:53.029
My daughter, Eun-ji…

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:02.830
I'm…

00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:07.877
beyond exhausted,
and I struggle to get through the day.

00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:10.338
When I wake up in the morning,

00:43:11.172 --> 00:43:13.216
I anxiously wonder what's going to happen.

00:43:14.884 --> 00:43:16.677
My heart races like crazy.

00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:20.973
I really can't live like this.

00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:29.482
I wonder if we should just give up.

00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.405
Honey.

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:39.116
You've been doing so well.

00:43:39.742 --> 00:43:41.369
You've been staying so strong.

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.454
Don't be like this.

00:43:54.841 --> 00:43:57.343
I'm sorry, Professor Kim. I apologize.

00:43:57.927 --> 00:43:58.761
It's okay.

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:03.891
Ma'am.

00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:08.354
You've been doing so well.

00:44:09.522 --> 00:44:11.357
Eun-ji is staying strong too.

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.195
As long as you don't give up,

00:44:16.904 --> 00:44:18.948
we won't be the ones to give up first.

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:27.039
We will find a heart donor for Eun-ji…

00:44:29.292 --> 00:44:30.585
and she'll get a transplant.

00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:33.754
Please cheer up

00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.341
and do not give up, okay?

00:44:42.221 --> 00:44:43.472
Okay.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.811
Thank you.

00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:44.492
Well…

00:45:45.076 --> 00:45:48.037
-So we'll sign the lease next week,
-Yes.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.541
and the hospital will take care
of the monthly maintenance costs.

00:45:53.668 --> 00:45:55.711
Can we sign the lease next week for sure?

00:45:55.795 --> 00:45:57.380
Yes, the loan was approved today.

00:45:57.463 --> 00:45:59.465
We'll get the money as early as this week.

00:46:00.341 --> 00:46:02.843
Then, let's make a list of the things
we need to buy.

00:46:05.137 --> 00:46:07.682
-Did you guys have dinner?
-Yes, we did.

00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:10.101
Me too.

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:14.980
A fridge, TV, couch, washer…

00:46:15.064 --> 00:46:16.691
We won't need a bed, right?

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.194
A bed? Wouldn't it be good
to just get one?

00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:21.404
Single beds, right?

00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:26.200
Are you guys moving in together?

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:29.078
Yes, we are indeed.

00:46:30.079 --> 00:46:33.666
What's going on?
What are you two up to this time?

00:46:37.336 --> 00:46:40.715
Jeong-won wants to set up
a patient guardian shelter,

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:43.217
for patients who live far away

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.053
and those who visit us
for anticancer therapy or hemodialysis.

00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:49.223
He's buying a house near the hospital.

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.392
-No, it's a long-term lease.
-That's right.

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.227
We'll start with a lease.

00:46:54.687 --> 00:46:57.857
Can you run Daddy-Long-Legs
and the shelter with the revenue

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.400
from the VIP Ward?

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.610
It'll cost quite a bit to manage it.

00:47:03.028 --> 00:47:05.489
I cut a deal with Director Ju.

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:09.910
I asked him for his support
on my personal project

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:12.747
in return for me staying here.

00:47:13.748 --> 00:47:16.625
He doesn't know about Daddy-Long-Legs,

00:47:16.709 --> 00:47:20.588
so I asked him to help me launch my dream.

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:24.008
And this guardian shelter
is the first project?

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:24.925
Yes.

00:47:25.885 --> 00:47:29.597
I figured that this is what
the patients need the most.

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:33.476
For the other stuff,
we'd have to change our policy,

00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:35.728
and it'll take us a while
to tackle the issues.

00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:38.939
That's why I want to start
with the patient guardian shelter.

00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:41.734
What is your ultimate dream?

00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:46.197
A children's hospital.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.323
What?

00:47:48.574 --> 00:47:51.744
My ultimate dream is to build
a children's hospital.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.749
I want to build a children's hospital

00:47:56.832 --> 00:47:58.709
that offers comprehensive pediatric care.

00:47:58.793 --> 00:48:01.128
That will cost a fortune.

00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:05.090
It'll cost about 400 billion won.

00:48:05.174 --> 00:48:06.425
What?

00:48:06.509 --> 00:48:07.635
WOW

00:48:09.345 --> 00:48:12.515
You've been fiddling with that
because you thought it was funny?

00:48:13.098 --> 00:48:13.933
What did you do?

00:48:14.016 --> 00:48:15.184
WOW

00:48:18.479 --> 00:48:21.982
-You like his lame jokes.
-It's so funny!

00:48:22.066 --> 00:48:24.819
Ahn Jeong-won, you really are something.
One more time!

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:25.903
WOW

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:27.446
Let's do it together.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.656
WOW

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:30.741
-Gosh.
-Hey, your phone.

00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:32.660
Oh, it's Gyeo-ul.

00:48:35.454 --> 00:48:38.165
-Hey, Gyeo-ul.
-Choi Han-na's lab results looked good,

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:41.168
so we were going to move her
to the regular ward tomorrow.

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:44.630
But she's not eating
and hasn't had any bowel movements.

00:48:44.713 --> 00:48:47.591
-Can we do an enema?
-Wait for me. I'm coming now.

00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:49.093
You only did a chest PA, right?

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.137
Take an abdominal X-ray too. All right.

00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:55.432
I have to go. Have a fun meeting.

00:48:55.516 --> 00:48:58.686
I'll buy you a housewarming gift
when you sign a lease.

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:00.980
What would be good? A coffee machine?

00:49:01.063 --> 00:49:04.149
The bank branch manager
is getting that for us.

00:49:04.233 --> 00:49:06.694
Really? Then let me think about it.
I'm off.

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.070
Hey, one more time.

00:49:08.696 --> 00:49:10.573
Get going already!

00:49:10.656 --> 00:49:12.241
OKAY

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:16.161
My goodness.

00:49:17.913 --> 00:49:19.957
Don't we need a microwave?

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.876
-It'd be good to have one.
-Yes.

00:49:22.585 --> 00:49:24.253
She's very alert,

00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:27.423
so she's been holding it in intentionally
because she's not used to

00:49:27.506 --> 00:49:29.341
having someone help her relieve herself.

00:49:29.425 --> 00:49:30.551
I see.

00:49:31.302 --> 00:49:33.262
Don't just monitor the physical condition.

00:49:33.345 --> 00:49:36.056
Try to observe how the patient
might be feeling too, okay?

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:39.268
Okay, got it. I'm sorry, Professor.

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:41.729
Don't be sorry. Keep up the good work.

00:49:49.153 --> 00:49:51.655
Hey, do you want to have coffee with me?

00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.033
Have you eaten?

00:49:56.035 --> 00:49:57.286
I'm not sure.

00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:08.923
Hey, you've been practically living
in the OR, the ICU, and the PICU.

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.592
Try to cut down on surgery
or take in less patients.

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.553
Talk to your chief.

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:17.139
I'm the chief.

00:50:21.977 --> 00:50:24.980
I always perform surgery,
so I'm used to it.

00:50:25.648 --> 00:50:28.442
But a bunch of things are stressing me out
these days.

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:29.735
I have a lot on my mind.

00:50:29.818 --> 00:50:31.820
Was the surgery today a difficult one?

00:50:31.904 --> 00:50:34.114
No, it went well.

00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:37.117
But the patient's heartbeat
was very unstable

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.578
after the surgery,

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.081
so we had to use the ECMO.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.084
I'm sure the patient will recover soon.

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:48.128
And Eun-ji--

00:50:48.212 --> 00:50:50.339
Yes, you told me about her a few times.

00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:53.008
The kid who's been hooked up to a VAD
the longest.

00:50:53.092 --> 00:50:56.261
That's right. She's been depending
on the VAD for almost five months,

00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.515
waiting for a heart transplant,
but we can't find a donor for her.

00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.309
We were careful with the meds,

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.728
but she's experienced blood clots
and even bleeding.

00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:07.523
We keep running into problems.

00:51:10.776 --> 00:51:13.362
I'm worried. She needs a transplant
as soon as possible.

00:51:13.445 --> 00:51:14.822
You'll find a donor soon.

00:51:21.328 --> 00:51:22.663
And? What else?

00:51:28.502 --> 00:51:30.796
It's my father's birthday today.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.717
-Right!
-I only remembered it earlier.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.552
-Call him.
-I already did.

00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:38.262
He was asleep though.

00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:39.805
Oh, boy.

00:51:41.181 --> 00:51:43.809
I didn't even get to wish him
a happy birthday.

00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:46.770
Just go home and get some sleep.

00:51:46.854 --> 00:51:49.690
I think you're sleep-deprived.

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.066
I'm on duty tonight.

00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:54.862
-Me too.
-At least I won't be lonely.

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.991
I'll stop by later.

00:51:59.074 --> 00:52:01.535
Hey, don't worry. I'm totally fine.

00:52:01.618 --> 00:52:03.787
I'm not worried.
I just want to eat your snacks.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.457
I saw that you have a lot of new ones.

00:52:11.587 --> 00:52:14.715
Let's go. Gosh, it's cold in here.

00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:19.428
Yes, let's go.
I feel cold, physically and mentally.

00:52:28.062 --> 00:52:30.189
Close it up and take care of the rest.

00:52:30.272 --> 00:52:32.399
Check for bleeding even in the ICU.

00:52:32.483 --> 00:52:34.401
-Yes, sir.
-Keep it up.

00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:36.612
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:52:45.412 --> 00:52:47.998
Cut the Gelfoam for this size
and pass it over.

00:52:48.082 --> 00:52:49.124
Yes, sir.

00:52:54.338 --> 00:52:56.924
You've been having headaches
and a fever too?

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.425
You need to see a doctor.

00:52:58.509 --> 00:53:00.177
I did, last week.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.263
I also got a blood test
and a chest X-ray while I was there.

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.265
I bet it's that accident.

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:07.017
I took some meds, so I'm okay now.

00:53:08.018 --> 00:53:09.686
Are the test results out yet?

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:12.314
No, of course not.
This isn't Korea, you know.

00:53:12.397 --> 00:53:15.109
They won't get the results back
until next week.

00:53:15.192 --> 00:53:17.694
-Okay.
-You sound a little down today.

00:53:17.778 --> 00:53:20.155
Did something happen?
Is your patient not doing well?

00:53:20.239 --> 00:53:22.950
No, I'm fine. The patients are fine too.

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.285
I'm on duty,
so I was reading a book in my office.

00:53:25.369 --> 00:53:28.247
-By the way, that test.
-Yes.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.165
I got the highest score.

00:53:30.249 --> 00:53:33.627
Really? Congratulations, seriously.

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.462
You said you bombed the test.

00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:37.756
I lied. Everyone in my family does that.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.217
My goodness. Congratulations.

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.095
The highest score in your class
or in the entire school?

00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:47.641
What? Then you deserve
some serious congratulations.

00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.518
Well done, seriously.

00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:51.770
Yes, sure.

00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:55.607
Oh, hello.

00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:58.610
I've heard so much about you.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.572
No, right.

00:54:02.239 --> 00:54:03.532
Of course.

00:54:06.785 --> 00:54:07.911
I see.

00:54:09.788 --> 00:54:12.624
No, I'm not busy at the moment.

00:54:12.708 --> 00:54:13.709
Right.

00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:16.670
I see.

00:54:44.323 --> 00:54:47.034
Sir, I need to talk to you
about something.

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:48.744
Okay, what is it?

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:52.664
We performed a navigation-guided biopsy
on Won Jin-hwan earlier

00:54:52.748 --> 00:54:55.042
because we were suspecting
a diffuse astrocytoma.

00:54:55.876 --> 00:54:59.463
We just did a CT scan
and detected ICH around the biopsy site.

00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:04.343
Professor Min told me
to discuss it with you first.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.720
Considering where the tumor is,

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:09.556
I'm concerned that the biopsy needle

00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.059
might have touched the MCA distal branch.

00:55:13.227 --> 00:55:17.439
I'm not too sure,
but it looked like the needle

00:55:17.522 --> 00:55:20.692
had gone in a bit too deep
on the screen in the OR.

00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:24.279
Why don't we do a TFCA
and find out the exact location?

00:55:24.363 --> 00:55:26.782
It's unlikely that you guys poked it
with the needle.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.619
No way. What are the chances?

00:55:31.453 --> 00:55:32.412
Right.

00:55:32.496 --> 00:55:36.833
A tumor biopsy can cause bleeding,
so just monitor the patient for now.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.754
We'll wait a bit

00:55:40.837 --> 00:55:43.799
before we take another angiogram
and check, okay?

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.470
His right pupil is dilated
to about 0.4 now.

00:55:48.553 --> 00:55:50.013
That's okay.

00:55:50.097 --> 00:55:52.015
Oh, I see.

00:55:54.351 --> 00:55:56.895
I'm going to get some sleep
in the on-call room.

00:55:56.979 --> 00:55:58.188
Take it easy.

00:55:58.272 --> 00:55:59.273
Thank you.

00:56:11.576 --> 00:56:13.912
Hey, good timing.

00:56:22.339 --> 00:56:23.799
Jae-hak, do you have a minute?

00:56:28.679 --> 00:56:29.513
Let's go.

00:56:38.522 --> 00:56:40.024
So you want to post a photo?

00:56:40.858 --> 00:56:42.151
No, just a caption.

00:56:43.402 --> 00:56:44.653
You can't do that.

00:56:48.407 --> 00:56:50.117
You can't post a caption on its own.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.953
Just post whatever photo you have
and write the caption here.

00:56:53.037 --> 00:56:54.079
What about a hashtag?

00:56:54.163 --> 00:56:57.416
You want to use a hashtag?
I like that attitude.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.211
Here, press the pound sign
and list the related words.

00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:04.340
Does that mean my photo will come up
if people look up those words?

00:57:04.423 --> 00:57:08.594
Yes! The more hashtags you use,
the more people it'll reach.

00:57:08.677 --> 00:57:11.263
But first,
you need to make your profile public.

00:57:15.351 --> 00:57:17.478
All right, let me give this a shot.

00:57:44.046 --> 00:57:47.007
Mr. Won, can you try lifting
your right arm?

00:57:51.595 --> 00:57:52.846
Now, your left arm.

00:58:05.401 --> 00:58:08.654
CLINICAL INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.657
You should have called me.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.367
I did, just now.

00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:14.576
Really?

00:58:15.285 --> 00:58:17.037
Why? What's up?

00:58:17.121 --> 00:58:22.167
I think patient Won Jin-hwan has a bleed
in the MCA distal branch.

00:58:22.251 --> 00:58:25.337
His motor function is lower
on the left side, at Grade 3.

00:58:25.921 --> 00:58:27.256
Can't we do a CT scan?

00:58:27.339 --> 00:58:29.466
We did one not long ago.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:32.469
How do you know
if the bleeding is caused by a tear

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:35.472
in the MCA distal branch
or something else?

00:58:35.556 --> 00:58:38.308
If an artery in the distal branch
is ruptured,

00:58:38.392 --> 00:58:40.602
the bleeding will continue.

00:58:40.686 --> 00:58:44.023
Then can we do a CT angiogram
along with the CT scan later?

00:58:44.982 --> 00:58:46.608
He can obey commands, right?

00:58:47.192 --> 00:58:48.193
Right?

00:58:48.819 --> 00:58:51.155
He can raise his hands and blink.

00:58:51.947 --> 00:58:53.115
Yes.

00:58:54.033 --> 00:58:57.327
Let's wait and see.
Continue to monitor him carefully.

00:58:58.579 --> 00:59:01.665
We'll do a CT angiogram
if he seems to get worse.

00:59:02.332 --> 00:59:05.335
We'll do it
and check how bad the bleeding is,

00:59:05.419 --> 00:59:07.296
then call Professor Min, okay?

00:59:09.757 --> 00:59:11.175
And Dr. Heo,

00:59:12.509 --> 00:59:14.762
we shouldn't be so quick
to open up the head.

00:59:18.432 --> 00:59:21.351
The biopsy probably caused minor bleeding.

00:59:22.728 --> 00:59:24.521
It'll stop soon.

00:59:25.856 --> 00:59:28.567
Let's give him mannitol
and see how it goes.

00:59:29.234 --> 00:59:31.278
Okay? Do you understand?

00:59:31.862 --> 00:59:32.905
Yes, sir.

00:59:33.906 --> 00:59:34.740
Good.

00:59:46.585 --> 00:59:49.588
Hi, sister! How's it going?

00:59:49.671 --> 00:59:52.549
Hey, you. How's everything? How's U-ju?

00:59:52.633 --> 00:59:54.051
U-ju's doing great.

00:59:55.052 --> 00:59:56.345
You don't look so well.

00:59:56.428 --> 00:59:58.222
I'm just tired from all the studying.

00:59:59.306 --> 01:00:01.767
Looks like you're still at work.
Are you on duty too?

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:05.145
I sure am. Wait, you know someone else
who's on duty tonight?

01:00:05.771 --> 01:00:07.606
Oh, my friend.

01:00:07.689 --> 01:00:10.567
My roommate also has a night shift today.

01:00:11.318 --> 01:00:13.737
How's everyone? How's Song-hwa doing?

01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:15.239
Song-hwa is doing great.

01:00:15.864 --> 01:00:17.950
Are Jeong-won and Seok-hyeong
doing well too?

01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:21.495
Everyone's well. Since when
did you care so much about my friends?

01:00:21.578 --> 01:00:24.289
They're all doing great.
Just take care of yourself.

01:00:24.373 --> 01:00:25.999
Is everything well with you?

01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:27.543
Yes, I'm happy and healthy.

01:00:28.418 --> 01:00:32.798
Right, how's Jun-wan?
Professor Kim is doing well too, right?

01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:36.051
No, not really.

01:00:37.636 --> 01:00:40.639
He's stressed out.
Too many surgeries. He's overworked.

01:00:41.473 --> 01:00:43.892
I've never seen him so stressed out.

01:00:43.976 --> 01:00:45.477
Did something happen to him?

01:00:45.561 --> 01:00:49.481
No, but it seems like
a bunch of things are stressing him out.

01:00:50.274 --> 01:00:53.318
And I think his girlfriend is adding
to his stress.

01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:56.280
Looks like his girlfriend
is quite selfish.

01:00:56.864 --> 01:01:01.326
I see, his girlfriend…
Why do you think that?

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.203
I don't really know much,

01:01:04.037 --> 01:01:06.081
but I think she's very inconsiderate.

01:01:06.748 --> 01:01:10.127
She's self-centered. Jun-wan is
under a lot of stress these days,

01:01:10.961 --> 01:01:14.381
but he's so busy walking on eggshells
around her that he can't even vent.

01:01:14.464 --> 01:01:17.092
Sounds like she's always busy
talking about herself.

01:01:17.176 --> 01:01:19.386
Hey, I'm running late
for my study session.

01:01:19.469 --> 01:01:23.473
All right. Watch out for cars
and don't skip breakfast.

01:01:23.557 --> 01:01:25.934
Call me right away
if you run out of money, okay?

01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:29.438
All right. You take care of yourself too.

01:01:29.521 --> 01:01:31.648
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:14.816
-You checked in on him five minutes ago.
-Has it already been five minutes?

01:02:28.038 --> 01:02:29.164
Mr. Won Jin-hwan.

01:02:29.248 --> 01:02:30.457
Mr. Won!

01:02:38.048 --> 01:02:41.134
Patient Won Jin-hwan's right pupil
has dilated further. It's 0.6 now.

01:02:41.218 --> 01:02:43.595
Mental status, stupor.
And the left-side motor is worse.

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:45.097
I'm calling Professor Min now.

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.974
Hey, hang on. I'm coming now.

01:02:47.057 --> 01:02:48.642
We don't have time!

01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:52.271
If something bad happens to the patient,
will you take responsibility for it?

01:02:53.438 --> 01:02:56.733
I'll order a CT scan right away
and call Professor Min.

01:02:58.235 --> 01:03:00.612
-Please get ready for intubation.
-Okay.

01:03:03.198 --> 01:03:04.533
Is the BP okay?

01:03:04.616 --> 01:03:06.994
Yes, it's 140 over 80.

01:03:07.077 --> 01:03:08.620
We need to open him up now. Focus.

01:03:08.704 --> 01:03:10.163
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:10.247 --> 01:03:11.832
Have you been monitoring him carefully?

01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:14.167
Yes, we checked in on him
every ten minutes.

01:03:14.251 --> 01:03:16.211
As soon as we confirmed his mental status,

01:03:16.295 --> 01:03:19.715
we checked the bleeding
with a CT scan and called you.

01:03:24.136 --> 01:03:26.013
If anything bad happens to this patient,

01:03:26.847 --> 01:03:28.140
it's all on you guys.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.808
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

01:03:35.647 --> 01:03:38.567
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:03:52.581 --> 01:03:53.707
Dr. Heo.

01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:57.711
Get some sleep.
That bed over there is available now.

01:03:57.794 --> 01:03:59.713
Take a nap. I'll wake you up.

01:03:59.796 --> 01:04:02.299
It's okay. I can just doze off here.

01:04:02.382 --> 01:04:04.301
I'm good at sleeping while seated.

01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:09.765
-It's not morning yet, is it?
-The sun is about to rise.

01:04:11.767 --> 01:04:15.187
The fellow must have given you an earful.

01:04:15.812 --> 01:04:17.731
I haven't seen him since the surgery.

01:04:18.899 --> 01:04:21.651
If he does, I'll listen.
I was too rude to him.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.323
Just let it go in one ear
and out the other.

01:04:27.532 --> 01:04:30.869
We were able to operate
on the patient right away

01:04:30.952 --> 01:04:32.954
because you kept monitoring his condition.

01:04:33.038 --> 01:04:34.748
And the surgery went well.

01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:37.459
I'm on your side.

01:04:38.335 --> 01:04:41.463
Thank you. I'll take you out for a drink
when we can move Mr. Won

01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:43.840
to a regular ward once he's stabilized.

01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:46.885
-Sure, I'll be looking forward to it.
-All right.

01:05:27.467 --> 01:05:28.635
I heard too.

01:05:29.428 --> 01:05:32.055
Everyone at the hospital knows.

01:05:32.681 --> 01:05:33.932
I'm sorry.

01:05:35.892 --> 01:05:37.060
How's the patient?

01:05:37.144 --> 01:05:39.229
I checked in on him again just now.

01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:41.231
His pupil size is normal now.

01:05:41.314 --> 01:05:45.152
His left-side motor function is still low,
but he's better overall,

01:05:45.235 --> 01:05:47.487
so I think
he'll regain consciousness soon.

01:05:49.072 --> 01:05:50.699
When you were informing the fellow,

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.910
what was the patient's
neurological assessment like?

01:05:53.994 --> 01:05:56.079
Was he exhibiting
any neurological symptoms?

01:05:56.163 --> 01:05:59.332
He was able to obey commands
when we moved him to the ICU.

01:05:59.958 --> 01:06:02.919
But his right pupil was slightly dilated,

01:06:03.003 --> 01:06:06.131
and his left-side motor function
was significantly reduced

01:06:06.214 --> 01:06:09.301
compared to the right side's
even considering the anesthesia.

01:06:09.384 --> 01:06:11.511
Then within an hour or so,

01:06:12.012 --> 01:06:15.056
his mental status dropped to stupor,
and his pupils opened up.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:17.434
It's good that you questioned
the fellow's opinion.

01:06:18.852 --> 01:06:19.728
But…

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.649
other than that, you are at fault.

01:06:24.733 --> 01:06:26.193
It was your fault.

01:06:27.527 --> 01:06:30.530
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have been so rude to him.

01:06:31.281 --> 01:06:34.034
I will politely apologize to the fellow.

01:06:35.118 --> 01:06:36.661
I didn't mean to argue with him.

01:06:37.329 --> 01:06:39.498
I raised my voice
without even realizing it.

01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:40.582
I'm sorry.

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:42.334
No.

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:48.423
You should have fought him earlier.

01:06:48.507 --> 01:06:52.385
You should have pushed ahead with
your decision if you believed so.

01:06:53.595 --> 01:06:55.597
You've been closely monitoring
the patient.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:58.225
That means you know best
when it comes to that patient.

01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.895
So you should have trusted your judgment
and fought for it.

01:07:05.232 --> 01:07:07.359
Had anything bad happened to him,

01:07:07.442 --> 01:07:09.236
it would have been all on you.

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.948
His condition worsened
because you wasted time

01:07:13.031 --> 01:07:14.950
being hesitant and indecisive.

01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:20.664
You've been working hard
to study the case and monitor him,

01:07:21.248 --> 01:07:22.374
so fight hard.

01:07:26.503 --> 01:07:27.629
That is the only way…

01:07:28.964 --> 01:07:30.257
you can save your patients.

01:07:41.851 --> 01:07:45.689
The nurses will go over how to take care
of the wound to minimize scarring.

01:07:45.772 --> 01:07:48.733
I'll see you again in a month.

01:07:48.817 --> 01:07:49.985
Keep it up.

01:07:50.068 --> 01:07:51.736
Will do. Thank you, Doctor.

01:07:55.782 --> 01:07:57.867
-Was that my last appointment?
-Yes, well done.

01:07:57.951 --> 01:07:59.369
Thank you.

01:08:05.959 --> 01:08:09.212
Hey, isn't it still early there?
Did you stay up all night?

01:08:09.296 --> 01:08:10.880
Can you talk now?

01:08:11.673 --> 01:08:14.551
Yes, I just finished my last appointment.
What's up?

01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:18.096
When you're in your office…

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:22.058
Go to your office and call me.
I'll wait for your call.

01:08:24.811 --> 01:08:27.397
Sure, okay. I'll call you right back.

01:08:41.328 --> 01:08:43.705
Hey, I'm in my office now.
What's going on?

01:08:45.248 --> 01:08:46.124
Well…

01:08:49.628 --> 01:08:53.506
Ik-sun. Something's happened, right?

01:08:55.592 --> 01:08:57.969
I've fallen for someone else.

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:04.559
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.652 --> 01:09:14.736
What do you mean?

01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:17.447
I'm sorry.

01:09:23.745 --> 01:09:24.996
Is it Se-gyeong?

01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:50.772
I'm sorry, Jun-wan. I have to go.

01:10:13.169 --> 01:10:15.213
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:10:15.296 --> 01:10:16.381
Where's Jun-wan?

01:10:17.215 --> 01:10:18.550
He doesn't feel like eating.

01:10:19.676 --> 01:10:22.303
Is something up with Jun-wan?

01:10:22.387 --> 01:10:23.972
He's lost so much weight.

01:10:24.055 --> 01:10:26.057
Could he have broken up
with his girlfriend?

01:10:27.058 --> 01:10:31.354
I don't know everything about Jun-wan.
Do you guys know what's going on?

01:10:31.438 --> 01:10:34.107
You should know
because you two live together.

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:35.942
Still, I don't know everything.

01:10:36.526 --> 01:10:40.196
Jeong-won, it's about time
you got your own place.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.491
I mean, Yulje pays you.
Can't you afford to rent an apartment?

01:10:43.575 --> 01:10:46.703
Of course,
I can definitely afford to do that.

01:10:46.786 --> 01:10:50.039
Guys, I've told Jun-wan multiple times
that I want to move out.

01:10:50.123 --> 01:10:52.208
-And?
-But the thing is…

01:10:53.668 --> 01:10:56.713
he looks so sad every time I say that.

01:10:57.297 --> 01:10:59.549
Jun-wan gets lonely very easily.

01:10:59.632 --> 01:11:00.800
Totally.

01:11:00.884 --> 01:11:02.677
-Really?
-Yes.

01:11:02.761 --> 01:11:05.972
I told him I'd move out
even when we were moving two years ago.

01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:07.390
Did his eyes well with tears?

01:11:07.474 --> 01:11:10.435
I had never seen anyone
with such sad eyes.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:15.231
He gets lonely so easily.

01:11:16.191 --> 01:11:20.445
I'm not mooching off him.
He's just not letting me go.

01:11:20.528 --> 01:11:23.072
We know that.
Jun-wan can never live alone.

01:11:23.615 --> 01:11:27.410
He may look tough on the outside
but is soft on the inside.

01:11:29.621 --> 01:11:32.081
-You mean, he's a paper tiger?
-Bingo.

01:11:44.719 --> 01:11:46.554
AHN JEONG-WON

01:12:03.655 --> 01:12:06.115
Hurry. The sun will set soon.

01:12:10.078 --> 01:12:11.871
-Are you a scarecrow?
-Does it look bad?

01:12:11.955 --> 01:12:14.624
-Are you wearing it to look nice?
-No, to block UV rays.

01:12:14.707 --> 01:12:16.459
-Okay.
-Should I keep it on or not?

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:19.546
-It looks ugly.
-You little…

01:12:19.629 --> 01:12:21.673
Who cares?
I'm wearing it to protect my face.

01:12:21.756 --> 01:12:23.007
Does it have to look nice?

01:12:23.091 --> 01:12:24.676
No, as long as it blocks the sun.

01:12:24.759 --> 01:12:25.802
Then I'll keep it on.

01:12:29.889 --> 01:12:32.267
I look like a scarecrow, don't I?
Is this ugly?

01:12:33.226 --> 01:12:35.645
No, it's pretty. You look pretty.

01:12:38.648 --> 01:12:40.608
The prettiest scarecrow I've ever seen.

01:12:41.192 --> 01:12:42.110
Hey!

01:12:42.694 --> 01:12:45.113
Come on, let's go. The sun will set soon.

01:12:45.196 --> 01:12:46.990
-Yes, we should hurry.
-Okay.

01:12:53.121 --> 01:12:57.250
Mugwort is already out
all along the hiking trail.

01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:59.002
Yes, they sprouted a while ago.

01:12:59.085 --> 01:13:01.087
Do you want mugwort soup? Shall I make it?

01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:02.755
-Mugwort soup?
-Yes.

01:13:02.839 --> 01:13:05.675
Mugwort soup

01:13:05.758 --> 01:13:10.096
-Mugwort soup
-Mugwort soup

01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:12.849
-Mugwort soup
-Nice!

01:13:14.392 --> 01:13:16.895
-Mugwort soup
-Oh, dear.

01:13:16.978 --> 01:13:19.188
Mugwort soup sounds great.

01:13:20.523 --> 01:13:22.817
This is my favorite time of day.

01:13:22.901 --> 01:13:24.277
When the sun is about to set.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.362
It'd be even better if it was raining now.

01:13:26.446 --> 01:13:29.908
Totally.
Hey, does U-ju like rainy days too?

01:13:29.991 --> 01:13:31.117
No.

01:13:32.118 --> 01:13:34.412
There's only one thing in the world
that he likes.

01:13:34.495 --> 01:13:36.539
-His dad?
-No, his girlfriend.

01:13:38.207 --> 01:13:41.044
He's head over heels for his girlfriend.
They're so in love.

01:13:41.127 --> 01:13:42.629
My gosh, U-ju has a girlfriend?

01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:46.090
Yes, they've been going out for a while.
Her name is Mo-ne.

01:13:46.174 --> 01:13:48.676
"Mo-ne"? That's a pretty name.

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.012
She is Hong-do and Yun-bok's cousin.

01:13:51.971 --> 01:13:53.431
Yun-bok and Hong-do at Yulje?

01:13:54.223 --> 01:13:56.142
That's right. Our Hong-do and Yun-bok.

01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:58.436
-You didn't know?
-Of course, I had no idea.

01:13:58.519 --> 01:14:00.021
What a coincidence.

01:14:01.314 --> 01:14:05.693
By the way, don't Hong-do and Yun-bok
remind you of us in the old days?

01:14:08.947 --> 01:14:12.241
I think I was smarter than Hong-do.

01:14:13.076 --> 01:14:15.161
Right, maybe.

01:14:15.244 --> 01:14:17.455
But you were such a loser.

01:14:17.538 --> 01:14:20.458
-Hey, what are you talking about?
-What?

01:14:20.541 --> 01:14:22.794
Come on. I was a fashionista,

01:14:22.877 --> 01:14:25.213
-the most stylish guy in Changwon.
-Sure, sure.

01:14:26.923 --> 01:14:33.388
You're probably better now than before

01:14:34.263 --> 01:14:36.557
-What is this song?
-You have fulfilled

01:14:36.641 --> 01:14:42.271
This void in my heart

01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:49.487
I used to feel so lonely
In this beautiful world

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.280
No way. Is this "Couple"?

01:14:51.364 --> 01:14:54.867
And wander around
Looking for my other half

01:14:58.955 --> 01:15:01.958
What took you so long to find me

01:15:02.959 --> 01:15:09.590
Drowning in my loneliness?

01:15:14.554 --> 01:15:17.181
I love you

01:15:18.391 --> 01:15:24.272
Now, you can spend every moment with me

01:15:24.355 --> 01:15:25.857
Finished. Well done.

01:15:49.922 --> 01:15:51.299
-Are you done?
-Yes.

01:15:51.382 --> 01:15:52.508
-You're done now?
-Yes.

01:15:52.592 --> 01:15:54.719
-Then shall we?
-Let's go.

01:15:55.303 --> 01:15:57.180
Well done.

01:16:01.309 --> 01:16:02.310
This is nice.

01:16:02.935 --> 01:16:05.354
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:16:32.985 --> 01:16:35.988
-Yes, hello?
-Professor Kim, we have a donor.

01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:38.240
-We've found a suitable donor for Eun-ji.
-What?

01:16:38.324 --> 01:16:40.534
KONOS just called,
asking if we need the heart.

01:16:41.452 --> 01:16:43.621
But Jae-an Medical Center
had priority over us.

01:16:43.704 --> 01:16:45.456
They don't need it.

01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:48.209
They declined
because the patient has an infection.

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:49.960
How much does the donor weigh?

01:16:50.044 --> 01:16:52.129
Well, he weighs 40kg.

01:16:52.213 --> 01:16:55.299
A 11-year-old boy. His weight is 40kg.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.635
Should we accept the heart?

01:16:57.718 --> 01:16:59.470
Yes. We'll get it, no matter what.

01:16:59.553 --> 01:17:01.430
This could be Eun-ji's only chance.

01:17:01.514 --> 01:17:03.849
-Okay, we'll get ready.
-Okay.

01:17:13.025 --> 01:17:15.152
-Hello, sir!
-We've found a donor for Eun-ji.

01:17:15.236 --> 01:17:16.779
-Where are you?
-Seriously?

01:17:16.862 --> 01:17:19.323
Finally! Eun-ji can live!
We can save Eun-ji!

01:17:19.406 --> 01:17:21.867
-I'm in the on-call room now.
-Where is her mother?

01:17:21.951 --> 01:17:25.454
Probably in the hallway
in front of the PICU. She's always there.

01:17:25.538 --> 01:17:28.582
Okay. Get Eun-ji off warfarin immediately
and get ready for surgery.

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:29.583
Got it!

01:17:47.226 --> 01:17:48.227
Ma'am.

01:17:49.019 --> 01:17:50.354
Professor Kim.

01:17:51.522 --> 01:17:52.856
You're still here?

01:17:53.524 --> 01:17:55.067
I don't think I can go home tonight.

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.861
-Why not? Are you on duty again?
-No.

01:17:59.613 --> 01:18:01.740
I have to perform
Eun-ji's heart transplant.

01:18:04.201 --> 01:18:05.995
There's a donor.

01:18:07.121 --> 01:18:08.247
We're getting the heart.

01:18:13.252 --> 01:18:16.714
We're waiting for the second brain death
assessment. The first one is done.

01:18:16.797 --> 01:18:19.967
Eun-ji will get the heart
if there are no major issues.

01:18:25.055 --> 01:18:26.557
You've waited so long for this.

01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:29.810
Many things happened
in the past five months

01:18:30.519 --> 01:18:32.271
since she got the VAD,

01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:35.733
but thanks to your resilience
and patience,

01:18:36.358 --> 01:18:37.943
this day has finally come.

01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:39.987
Professor Kim.

01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:43.532
This really isn't a dream, right?

01:18:44.366 --> 01:18:46.577
Is Eun-ji really getting the heart?

01:18:47.328 --> 01:18:50.623
Yes, Eun-ji is getting it.

01:19:08.265 --> 01:19:11.185
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:19:25.074 --> 01:19:26.617
What are these flowers for?

01:19:31.664 --> 01:19:33.123
I found them at home.

01:19:34.833 --> 01:19:35.834
I see.

01:19:39.046 --> 01:19:40.130
Are you all right?

01:19:42.841 --> 01:19:44.051
Yes, I'm fine.

01:19:45.469 --> 01:19:48.639
You did the right thing.
You did nothing wrong.

01:19:49.181 --> 01:19:51.600
What's wrong with yelling
at a senior colleague?

01:19:51.684 --> 01:19:53.769
Well done. Don't be discouraged.

01:19:55.729 --> 01:19:58.273
Did you come all the way here this late
to say that?

01:20:01.819 --> 01:20:03.028
No.

01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:07.574
I'm sorry.

01:20:08.992 --> 01:20:09.910
I was out of line.

01:20:13.038 --> 01:20:14.748
I know you said it because you care.

01:20:19.837 --> 01:20:21.380
I guess I'm just insecure.

01:20:22.673 --> 01:20:23.549
I'm sorry.

01:20:34.059 --> 01:20:36.103
Do you know what that flower symbolizes?

01:20:38.021 --> 01:20:39.064
No, what?

01:20:42.317 --> 01:20:43.819
Forgiveness and reconciliation.

01:20:48.073 --> 01:20:49.366
How do you know that?

01:20:50.993 --> 01:20:52.911
Your parents must really own
a flower shop.

01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:57.708
We have tulips in every color.

01:20:57.791 --> 01:21:00.711
Just tell me what you like.
I can bring any flower you want.

01:21:04.673 --> 01:21:05.591
Aren't you hungry?

01:21:05.674 --> 01:21:09.344
The gimbap place is still open…
Right, you're on duty.

01:21:10.554 --> 01:21:12.306
I'll go pick some up. Just stay here.

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:43.670
Because she's been hooked up
to the VAD for a while,

01:21:43.754 --> 01:21:45.756
the adhesion will be pretty severe,

01:21:45.839 --> 01:21:48.383
so it'll take us a while
to dissect the adhesion.

01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:51.011
The heart might be a bit too big,

01:21:51.094 --> 01:21:53.722
so she may leave the OR
with the chest open.

01:21:56.141 --> 01:21:57.100
But you know…

01:21:58.685 --> 01:21:59.853
no matter what happens,

01:22:01.063 --> 01:22:02.773
I want to save Eun-ji today.

01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:10.531
The two of you and Eun-ji endured so much
for today.

01:22:11.448 --> 01:22:14.743
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:22:16.578 --> 01:22:18.455
I don't want to be the one to ruin it.

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:25.504
I will do my best.

01:22:27.172 --> 01:22:28.340
I will save Eun-ji.

01:22:48.485 --> 01:22:50.320
SURGERY PATIENT FAMILY
WAITING ROOM

01:23:40.871 --> 01:23:41.872
I'm…

01:23:43.457 --> 01:23:44.958
so happy for you.

01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:49.504
Congratulations,
from the bottom of my heart.

01:23:51.506 --> 01:23:52.591
Thank you.

01:23:54.134 --> 01:23:55.969
The surgery will go well,

01:23:56.887 --> 01:23:58.764
so don't worry about a thing.

01:24:02.017 --> 01:24:03.352
Thank you.

01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:07.314
My goodness.

01:24:08.941 --> 01:24:10.692
Oh, dear.

01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:29.461
YULJE MEDICAL CENTER

01:24:44.977 --> 01:24:48.313
Are you not feeling well?
You look like you've lost a lot of weight.

01:24:48.397 --> 01:24:50.607
No, I'm totally fine.

01:24:54.027 --> 01:24:56.071
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:24:56.154 --> 01:24:58.532
Hey! It's been a while, Professor Kim.

01:24:59.408 --> 01:25:01.451
Can you spare me a moment?

01:25:01.535 --> 01:25:02.828
Sure.

01:25:06.665 --> 01:25:08.500
SISTER

01:25:09.626 --> 01:25:12.504
Hey, what's up? You rarely call me first.

01:25:13.046 --> 01:25:14.339
Ik-jun.

01:25:16.216 --> 01:25:17.217
Are you okay?

01:25:17.759 --> 01:25:19.469
I wasn't feeling well last week,

01:25:20.178 --> 01:25:23.056
so I went to see a doctor
and got some tests done.

01:25:24.057 --> 01:25:26.393
I just found out
my liver somatic index is over 300.

01:25:28.353 --> 01:25:32.315
The doctor said it's over 300,
and my bile ducts look a bit swollen.

01:25:33.316 --> 01:25:34.526
What should I do?

01:25:35.068 --> 01:25:36.194
Come home at once.

01:25:38.947 --> 01:25:40.699
You know this is serious, right?

01:25:46.246 --> 01:25:49.583
My gosh. Don't cry, Ik-sun. It's okay.

01:25:49.666 --> 01:25:52.419
I'm going to fix it,
so don't worry about a thing.

01:25:52.502 --> 01:25:53.795
Come home immediately.

01:25:54.463 --> 01:25:56.798
I'll send you money for your flight…
Actually, no.

01:25:57.549 --> 01:26:01.511
I'll book your flight for you,
so come home tomorrow, okay?

01:26:02.471 --> 01:26:05.557
All right, but…

01:26:06.433 --> 01:26:08.685
make sure you keep this to yourself.

01:26:08.769 --> 01:26:10.520
I don't want anyone to find out.

01:26:10.604 --> 01:26:14.441
Is that important now?
You may need a transplant.

01:26:14.524 --> 01:26:16.860
Just don't tell anyone.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.240
All right.
For now, let's focus on treating you.

01:26:22.324 --> 01:26:24.951
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep it to myself.

01:26:25.035 --> 01:26:26.703
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

01:26:26.787 --> 01:26:28.789
-Okay, I won't.
-And…

01:26:30.332 --> 01:26:31.792
Jun-wan too.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:42.052
Don't tell Jun-wan, no matter what.

01:26:42.928 --> 01:26:43.929
Okay?

01:27:32.227 --> 01:27:35.647
Let's now forget

01:27:37.065 --> 01:27:40.569
We must forget

01:27:41.945 --> 01:27:48.118
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

01:27:48.827 --> 01:27:50.453
Let's forget it now

01:27:52.205 --> 01:27:55.333
Let's now forget

01:27:56.835 --> 01:28:00.422
We must forget

01:28:01.798 --> 01:28:07.846
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

01:28:08.346 --> 01:28:10.390
Let's forget it now

01:28:11.474 --> 01:28:18.273
The day we prayed on our knees
In the empty cathedral

01:28:18.356 --> 01:28:20.483
Let's forget it now

01:28:21.318 --> 01:28:28.283
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gifts to you

01:28:28.366 --> 01:28:31.369
Let's forget it now

01:28:31.453 --> 01:28:38.210
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

01:28:38.293 --> 01:28:40.378
Let's forget it now

01:28:41.379 --> 01:28:48.053
Walking together on the snowy day
It felt like a romantic movie scene

01:28:48.136 --> 01:28:51.264
We must forget it now

01:29:11.076 --> 01:29:14.704
-Hello. I'm your hallucination.
-Let's now forget

01:29:15.997 --> 01:29:19.626
We must forget

01:29:20.961 --> 01:29:26.675
Forget all the meanings
Behind my birthday gift to you

01:29:30.762 --> 01:29:34.266
Let's now forget

01:29:35.558 --> 01:29:39.396
We must forget

01:29:40.689 --> 01:29:46.903
The night I got drunk
And confessed my feelings for you

01:29:50.907 --> 01:29:54.119
Let's now forget

01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:59.165
Let's now forget

01:30:38.580 --> 01:30:40.540
Patient Lee Gyeong-mi has a visitor today.

01:30:40.623 --> 01:30:44.669
She's been getting visitors twice a day,
one at a time since yesterday.

01:30:47.672 --> 01:30:48.590
You didn't know?

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:52.761
The social media post looking
for volunteers to keep her company.

01:30:52.844 --> 01:30:54.095
Who posted it?

01:30:58.475 --> 01:31:00.101
Here, look.

01:31:05.607 --> 01:31:08.818
THIS IS PROFESSOR KIM JUN-WAN
OF YULJE MEDICAL CENTER…

01:31:12.614 --> 01:31:15.408
Professor Kim posted it
using his social media account.

01:31:15.492 --> 01:31:18.620
Of course, we talked to Ms. Lee about it
in advance.

01:31:19.412 --> 01:31:22.916
She's so happy.
She said she doesn't feel lonely anymore.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:26.753
Gosh, why hadn't I thought of that?

01:31:27.337 --> 01:31:29.130
So many people have applied.

01:31:29.214 --> 01:31:32.801
The social services team is going through
the list to arrange everything.

01:31:34.094 --> 01:31:36.763
Professor Kim is really…

01:31:36.846 --> 01:31:37.847
I really…

01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:40.809
can't figure him out.

01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:12.715
Let's now forget

01:32:14.134 --> 01:32:18.555
We must forget

01:32:26.646 --> 01:32:27.647
Next song.

01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:30.668
Tell us, Song-hwa.

01:33:30.752 --> 01:33:32.962
Why did you call us here
in the middle of the day?

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.798
I'm going to take a break.

01:33:35.882 --> 01:33:37.258
I need to recharge myself.

01:33:37.342 --> 01:33:38.718
Aren't you coming to Seoul anymore?

01:33:38.801 --> 01:33:40.678
Forget that I exist, okay?

01:33:40.762 --> 01:33:42.388
Professor. I have a question.

01:33:42.472 --> 01:33:44.224
Why am I like this?

01:33:44.307 --> 01:33:47.518
I think of running away the moment
I'm faced with hardship.

01:33:47.602 --> 01:33:49.103
Why bring your son into this?

01:33:49.187 --> 01:33:52.273
Don't meddle in his life again
and make things harder for him.

01:33:52.357 --> 01:33:54.859
I have no regrets left in life.

01:33:54.943 --> 01:33:57.237
You've only just turned 70,
how could you say that?

01:33:58.404 --> 01:34:00.865
We can see the ocean and go for a drive.

01:34:00.949 --> 01:34:03.368
-We'll spend a few days like that.
-Do you think we'll ever get to?

01:34:03.451 --> 01:34:04.827
Why? Are you going somewhere?

01:34:04.911 --> 01:34:06.120
You should promise me, too.

01:34:06.204 --> 01:34:07.247
What is this?

01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:10.458
-Why aren't you asleep?
-I'm going to.

01:34:11.125 --> 01:34:12.168
I can't seem to sleep.

01:34:12.252 --> 01:34:14.587
-I can still have dinner with you.
-What about Gyeo-ul?

01:34:15.922 --> 01:34:19.300
Is there something
you should be telling me?

01:34:19.384 --> 01:34:22.929
I can't promise you I won't do it again.

01:34:23.012 --> 01:34:24.222
Can't you trust us?

01:34:24.305 --> 01:34:25.682
I was just asking.

01:34:25.765 --> 01:34:29.602
Tell me if anything
ever happens to Gyeo-ul.
