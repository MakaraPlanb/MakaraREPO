1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,560
You came to see Sarawat again.

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,980
Why are you two always together lately?

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,420
So the rumor saying Sarawat likes Tine is true?

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,380
True.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,720
You can compete for anything with anyone

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,140
but you can’t beat Sarawat when it comes to love

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,820
You agreed to flirt because you wanted some experience to write a song?

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,840
I am telling you. Flirting with me is quite special

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,240
1 or 2?

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,020
1.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,100
2. means I’m hitting on you

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,280
1. means you will be hit on…by me.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,980
Both 1 and 2 mean I like you

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,500
If you listen to Scrubb’s songs when you are happy, you will be even happier

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,720
If you listen when you are in love, you will be more deeply in love

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,500
If you listen to their songs when you are sad, you will feel better

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,820
It’s like someone is comforting you

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,260
Do you remember that I like Scrubb?

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,180
One of my favorite songs is called Everything.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,240
And why are you telling me this?

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,620
Can you play Everything for me tomorrow?

22
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,160
Music Club is having a music show called Altermajeeb this Saturday.

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,120
Please come and join us.

24
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,280
Why does Mr.Chic have to do anything like this?

25
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,120
It’s exhausting and hot

26
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,740
I am freaking thirsty.

27
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,900
Stop messing things and stop complaining.

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
Tine.

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,760
I need to go to guitar practice

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,200
Take care of the rest.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Do it yourself.

32
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,420
You are ungrateful.

33
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,400
I just helped flirt with you in front of Green the other day.

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,920
Can’t you help me with this?

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
Oh please!

36
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,600
Your fandom set the price for my head all over social media

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,480
Your friends told them it was a joke and saved my ass

38
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,400
You don’t have to go so big next time

39
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,980
You talk too much

40
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,880
If I made you blush too much, just say it.

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,680
Sarawat!

42
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,440
Saraleo!

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,200
Thank you, Tine.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,399
Pear, you remember my name.

45
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,919
Of course I do. You taught me a chord.

46
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,320
You are in the Faculty of Laws, aren’t you?

47
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,060
That’s right.

48
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,820
I have a friend in that Faculty too.

49
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,760
Seriously?

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,580
What is your friend’s name? I might know her.

51
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,640
Her name is Baifern.

52
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,040
Baifern?

53
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,800
So how is your guitar lesson going?

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,300
Not so bad.

55
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,120
It’s okay. I guess.

56
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,680
I will teach you, okay?

57
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,520
Sure. Thank you so much.

58
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,200
Why do you have so many flyers left?

59
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,660
Sarawat left me with these.

60
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,160
Why such a good mood?

61
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,920
Not your business.

62
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,800
I guess your practice is over since you have time to bug me here

63
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,740
Yes.

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,580
I asked to leave early.

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,500
I need to refurnish my room

66
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,960
That’s good.

67
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,040
Your room is like a haunted house

68
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,300
Help me!

69
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,640
In your dreams

70
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,800
I have a motto ‘Say No to Work. Say Yes to Boobs.’

71
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,780
When you have big boobs, give me a call.

72
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,700
If you help me clean up my room, I will let you grab my boobs

73
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,940
No.

74
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,540
I have to meet Pear this afternoon

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,660
I will take her to buy Scrubb’s CDs.

76
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,820
I am a good Scrubb’s missioner

77
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,600
She is one of Scrubb’s apostles now

78
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,140
How about evening?

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,380
This evening?

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,120
I have a cheerleading practice

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
If you need help, ask your fans

82
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,780
You have an army.

83
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,840
Bye.

84
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Damn you!

85
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
My boobs are not big enough, are they?

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
Ready!

87
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,980
Ready! 3 4.

88
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,480
Keep them up.

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,160
Don’t be so flabby.

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,420
We won’t win the competition with this performance

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,260
Have I not told you…

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,400
that you need to turn your phones off in practice?

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,860
Tine’s phone

94
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,140
Sarawat is calling

95
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,180
Tine!

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,280
I am so sorry.

97
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,560
Pick up your phone quickly.

98
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,000
Don’t keep Sarawat waiting.

99
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,000
Hello

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,480
Are you done practicing?

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,160
Eyes on me, everyone.

102
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,460
Come help me with my room.

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,520
Can you stop dreaming?

104
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,620
I am still in practice

105
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,960
And I am so freaking starving.

106
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,060
What do you want to eat?

107
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,860
What?

108
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,020
Are you buying me snacks?

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,820
Did I say I would?

110
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,600
I freaking hate you!

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,820
Let’s do this.

112
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,260
If you bring me snacks, I will let you grab my boobs.

113
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,100
Hello!

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,100
What…

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,700
Break for 15 minutes.

116
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,260
Take a break, guys.

117
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,440
Sarawat, you brought us snacks?

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
I told him to.

119
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,820
I saw that everyone was so tired, so I told him to buy us snacks

120
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Don’t fight over them, guys.

121
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,300
You can be kind too.

122
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,820
Sorry I call you asshole sometimes.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,960
Can I grab your boobs now?

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,420
Boobs what?

125
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,060
Now you’re being an asshole again.

126
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,560
I was just joking.

127
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,380
But I am being serious

128
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,980
Stop.

129
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,700
Stop.

130
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,020
STOP IT!

131
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,080
Damn you!

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,560
Hey! Seniors want to know if you have a girlfriend.

133
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,980
They see that you’re on Instagram, but you don’t fol anyone

134
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,540
What did you say?

135
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,680
Fol?

136
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,380
Yes. Fol.

137
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,420
What is fol?

138
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,500
My bad.

139
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,160
I forgot that you just exposed to the social media world

140
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,679
Fol as in follow

141
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,240
It’s when you follow someone on IG.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,860
You follow people whom you are interested in

143
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
You basically snoop around their Instagram.

144
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,860
Are you listening to me?

145
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,720
Is this how you follow?

146
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,380
Did you even hear my question?

147
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,560
Do you have eyes for someone right now?

148
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,720
I told you I would hit on you. How can I have eyes for someone else?

149
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,940
Fake flirting doesn’t count. Give me the real answer.

150
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,500
Do you like anyone right now?

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,380
Hey!

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Why are you following me?

153
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,380
I am telling you…

154
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
the one I’m following is the one I like

155
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,640
When will you stop messing with me?

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,600
Guys, let’s get back to work!

157
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,500
I have to go back to practice

158
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,340
Thank you so much for the snacks.

159
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,880
Don’t forget to follow other people.

160
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Bye.

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,120
Get some rest.

162
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,060
Who are you looking for?

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,840
Sarawat went home already

164
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
But…

165
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,880
He left this for you, Tine

166
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,600
A spare key to my room

167
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
Meet me at 7 and help me clean up

168
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,840
Do not bail!

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,760
Wat!

170
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,040
Wat!

171
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,480
Wat!

172
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,180
Wat!

173
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,700
Wake up!

174
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,260
Why did you tell me to come so early if you want to sleep in?

175
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,720
Wat!

176
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,040
Wat! Wake up!

177
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
You…

178
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,780
HOLY SHIT!

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,520
You’re here?

180
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,300
You are not…

181
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,220
You are not wearing…

182
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,380
What?

183
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,720
Look!

184
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,380
Why did you sleep naked?

185
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,520
You should have worn an underwear at least

186
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,740
I didn’t wear anything?

187
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,220
That means…

188
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,620
You saw everything in Sarawat Expo?

189
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,080
Stop it.

190
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,640
Aren’t you ashamed at all?

191
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,440
Why do you seem so proud?

192
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,460
I am not talking to you

193
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,020
What do you want me to do?

194
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,320
Look at my room.

195
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,340
Help me clean up.

196
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,940
Clean up what?

197
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,060
Everything.

198
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
Start with the shoes.

199
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,900
It’s not even messy.

200
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,280
Do you call it clean then?

201
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,840
Can I just let you grab my boobs and then I go?

202
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,760
Seriously?

203
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,320
I was kidding

204
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,640
I was just playing

205
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
I will do it now.

206
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Where do you want them?

207
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,580
On your head?

208
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,140
Sorry!

209
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,180
You have many pairs of shoes.

210
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,200
They all new…

211
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,040
except…

212
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,040
this pair.

213
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
Why?

214
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,040
They are comfortable.

215
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Comfortable?

216
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,300
This worn out?

217
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,080
If your fans know about this, they will buy you new pairs for sure

218
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,040
I won’t wear anything that other people buy for me

219
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,620
But if you do, I might.

220
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,420
Me?

221
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,420
And why would I do that?

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,380
Where do you want it?

223
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,420
Here.

224
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,640
Help me change the bed sheet.

225
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,880
I’m tired of black.

226
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,740
The Altermajeeb event tomorrow,

227
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:51,460
what songs are you guys playing?

228
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,100
Why?

229
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,820
Do you remember that I like Scrubb?

230
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,160
One of my favorite songs is called Everything.

231
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,900
And why are you telling me this?

232
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,800
Can you play Everything for me tomorrow?

233
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,720
Sorry.

234
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
The seniors have their songs listed

235
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,520
Can you ask them to change?

236
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,300
Convince them.

237
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,260
Please.

238
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,680
They made up their minds, Tine.

239
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,300
Just help me!

240
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,680
I want to hear it live.

241
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,260
Try to talk to them please

242
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,540
Put the sheet on.

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
I won’t do it then.

244
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,880
Alright. I will talk to them

245
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,060
Make the bed first.

246
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
It looks good

247
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,680
Test it.

248
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,680
It is so soft.

249
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,720
- I think it is soft too.
- Hey!

250
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,800
What are you doing?

251
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,080
This bed is so nice

252
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,520
I am checking the sheet

253
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,880
I should have changed it ages ago

254
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,460
Why did I put up with black?

255
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,360
Don’t have to check it right here.

256
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,180
I need to check here because I sleep right here.

257
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,940
Wat, I bought you…

258
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,240
Is this Sarawat’s brother?

259
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,580
You look hot like your brother.

260
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,260
Can you please get lost for an hour or two?

261
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,080
If you take my brother with you, I’ll ask the seniors to play a Scrubb’s song.
