00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,205

00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:09,265

00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:10,495

00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,395

00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:16,435
 

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
 

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Here?

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,680
Let me sleep in your room tonight.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,620
Fine.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,100
 

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
 

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,740
Shit!

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,800
 

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,460
They are lying everywhere. Where should I sleep?

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,660
I’m cold.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,300
Cold

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,280
Are you sleepy?

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,660
Let’s go sit outside.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,540
It’s breezy.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,140
Why did you bring a guitar?

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,620
Let’s practice for the video.

23
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,120
You want me to play now?

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,700
I’m still numb because of Fong’s kick

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,740
 

26
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:07,175
 

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560

And you said you are a Scrubb fan.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,440
That was off-key?

44
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,320
How about we sing again? You’ll see.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,160
That was fine.

46
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,520
Do you remember when I said I had something to tell you?

47
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,020
Was it when you said you wanted to touch my boobs?

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,620
No.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,100

Is it true when you mom said you’d never had a girlfriend?

57

What kind of person do you like?

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,120
Pretty one?

59
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,720
Smart one?

60
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Cute one?

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,740
No.

62
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,180
What kind of person then? That was almost every kind.

63
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,960
 

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,780
Do you like the weird one then?

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,720
I must really like a weird person.

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,520
And it is so weird that…

67
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,200
the one I like is…

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,140
 

69
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,860
I need to pee

70
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,900
Fong, it’s a balcony.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,140
A bathroom.

72
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,520
A bathroom is right there.

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,040
It’s inside.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,560
You again?

75
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,760
You want a problem?

76
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,400
It’s me, Tine!

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,660
Its’ Tine!

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,860
The sun has risen.

79
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,220
Tine, wake up.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,820
5 more minutes.

81
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,320
Tine!

82
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,560
Tine.

83
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,720
My leg is numb.

84
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Shit!

85
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,520
You slept on my lap all night and now you swear at me?

86
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,380
What?

87
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,600
Why are you still here?

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,400
What?

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
I asked, why are you still here?

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,380
I want to have breakfast with you.

91
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
What are you looking at?

92
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,060
Can I…

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,560
grab your boobs?

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,660
You out of your mind?

95
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,500
Damn it!

96
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,340
Go take a shower. I am super hungry.

97
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Stop it.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,420
Can I borrow this?

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,100
Damn it!

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,800
I’m naked.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,060
I know. I saw it.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
You saw it?

103
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,880
Tine, I have good news for you.

104
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,980
What?

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,180
There will be a Scrubb’s live show in our University in 2 weeks

106
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,320
For real?

107
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,060
And my band will be the opening act for them.

108
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,440
Really?

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,000
So you get to see P’Ball and P’Muei (Scrubb) backstage, right?

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,860
Can you get their autographs for me?

111
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Sure.

112
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,680
What’s wrong?

113
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,780
Are you not excited? You get to be on the same stage with Scrubb

114
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,280
I am.

115
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,340
But I have a tight rehearsal schedule.

116
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,860
I won’t have much time to see you at Music Club

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,440
So we won’t see each other for a while then.

118
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,680
How sad!

119
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,040
I wanna cry.

120
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,740
Quit doing that bullshit face

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,480
Do you really think you will have a chance to hit on Pear?

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,800
No.

123
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Who would think that?

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,260
NUISANCE!

125
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,920
Promise me that you will not cheat on me or talk to anyone when I’m not around.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
Cheat on?

127
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,740
We are not dating.

128
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,820
Fine.

129
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,920
I promise

130
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Okay.

131
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,620
Don’t ever talk to Pear behind my back

132
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,860
If I hear that you hit on her once,

133
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,420
I’ll grab your boobs once.

134
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Don’t ever do it.

135
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,780
Are you crazy?

136
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,440
No.

137
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,980
You’re so obsessed with my boobs.

138
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,780
Eat. Why are you looking at me?

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Excuse me.

140
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Can I sit here?

141
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,500
Man,

142
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,539
is your dorm around here too?

143
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:44,119
Do we know each other?

144
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,460
I am Aom.

145
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,240
We met last night at the bar. Don’t you remember?

146
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,360
Just to be sure, did I take you to do something heavenly last night?

147
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,500
No.

148
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,780
But I am about to ask you.

149
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,880
Do you want to do something heavenly with me?

150
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,860
We all have the hidden power.

151
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,720
Where are you going?

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,700
Bathroom

153
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,660
I need to discharge my hidden power

154
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,300
If I disappear too long, don’t wait for me.

155
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,000
You are free to go.

156
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,220
Excuse me.

157
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
Is this seat taken?

158
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,100
No. Please.

159
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,160
Aren’t you going to the bathroom?

160
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,380
No.

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,300
Discharging the power right here is more heavenly.

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,300
 

163
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,840
Pear

164
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,140
Don’t ever talk to Pear behind my back.

165
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,660
If I hear that you hit on her once,

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,140
I’ll grab your boobs once

167
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Tine.

168
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,580
Can I bother you with something?

169
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,800
Sure

170
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,240
Listen.

171
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,160
It sounds wrong whenever I strum it.

172
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
Am I doing the chord right?

173
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,180
This guitar has very stiff strings

174
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,780
Sarawat told me that they need to be changed

175
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,480
Is there any shop around?

176
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,840
Around here?

177
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,580
Sarawat told me that the shops around here don’t have light guitar strings

178
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,580
No.

179
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,740
I mean I’m buying a new guitar.

180
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,180
Buying a new one?

181
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,200
You got some time?

182
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,220
Can you help me choose?

183
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:04,760
I have a spiritual poem for those who are feeling discouraged

184
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,340
‘With a strong mind, dispirited feeing will be gone.’

185
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,040
‘You still have tomorrow to live on.’

186
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,200
‘Your failure will be your teacher.’

187
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,900
‘In your hand, that’s your future.’

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,660
Strikes right through my heart.

189
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,900
Thank you

190
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
 

191
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,160
Are you okay, Tine?

192
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
I am.

193
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,180
I’m just looking around

194
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,660
What criteria do you use when buying a new guitar?

195
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,220
The feeling.

196
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,920
The feeling?

197
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Yes.

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,100
If you feel that this one is right for you, then it is.

199
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,240
It’s like love.

200
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,800
You don’t need a reason.

201
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,540
What is right is right.

202
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,340
This guitar must be the right one for me then

203
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,640
 

204
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,800
You go around with a makeup remover in your bag?

205
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,880
It is for you.

206
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,820
But I don’t know who he is or where he lives

207
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,480
I don’t even know his name.

208
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,640
I think he left

209
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,620
Left?
