1
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,155
 

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,205
 

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,485
 

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:07,925
 

5
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,640
He is looking for someone

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,380
I will send him out now

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,700
No need.

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,000
He is my brother.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,280
Make yourself at home then.

11
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,920
Let me know if you need anything.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
Since when am I your brother?

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
I just don’t like noises. They get on my nerves

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,240
Now that you’re here, make yourself useful.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,500
Give me a massage.

16
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,060
Sure.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,160
Are you here for the Open House?

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,740
What Faculty are you interested in?

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,200
I don’t know yet.

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,940
Yeah?

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,460
P’Mil

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,360
it’s time for your band to stand by backstage.

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,320
I’m gonna go now.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,320
Here.

26
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,540
Why are you giving it to me?

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,540
Just eat.

28
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,880
I know you’re hungry

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,360
Have you seen Sarawat?

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,820
What’s wrong?

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
Nervous?

32
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,340
No.

33
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,700
Don’t you fool me.

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,660
Your loved one is here to watch?

35
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,780
I get it.

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,560
I was super nervous when my special one came to see me perform

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,540
Hi guys.

38
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,600
I will be your MC for today’s event.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
 

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Go kill it, bro.

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,660
People at the back seem ready

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,340
Make some noise to confirm that you are all ready

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,360
Okay.

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,440
Please welcome Sssss..! from Music Club on stage.

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,720
Sarawat’s band is about to perform.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,180
Let’s move closer to the stage.

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,940
They might even play a Scrubb song

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,200
Really?

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,640
I’ve always wanted to hear it live.

50
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,480
Hi guys. We are Sssss..!

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,120
Excuse me for a second. My mom is calling.

52
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,900
[Faculty Building]

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,020
I don’t know if you scream your lungs out for the good voice or just Sarawat

54
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:41,160
Let me tell you. The next band is as hot as the previous one.

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,920
Give a round of applause for The Rhythm

56
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,660
Are you guys ready?

57
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,940
Make some noise!

58
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,060
You have changed a lot

59
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
So?

60
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,720
It kinda makes me scare

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,300
If I really like someone, will I change too?

62
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,960
 

63
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,520
It is not that scary.

64
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,940
You will get it when you find the right one.

65
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,880
Thank you so much guys.

66
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,880
Ladies and gentlemen, The Rhythm

67
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,860
That was just amazing.

68
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:16,040
We are going to break just a little before we move on to the next show

69
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,080
I am going to interview some of the young lads who are here for the Open House.

70
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,200
Don’t go anywhere guys.

71
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,180
This one.

72
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,840
I want to take him to meet my mom already

73
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,840
What is your name?

74
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,820
My name is Phukong* (Captain in police force).

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
Arrest me, please

76
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,840
What Faculty are you looking forward to enroll?

77
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,560
Let me guess.

78
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,940
Tick tock. Tick tock.

79
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,140
I know it

80
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,640
Engineering?

81
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Nope.

82
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,900
Medicine?

83
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,000
Interesting but still no.

84
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,240
Hot guy!!

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,360
Let’s continue

86
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,280
If not Medicine, then I don’t know

87
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,800
What Faculty will you enroll?

88
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,900
Faculty of Crispy Pork maybe. It’s just so delicious

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,140
He is not only hot but also funny.

90
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,980
You are just my type.

91
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:27,100
Do you need someone to take care of your tuition fee?

92
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,500
I am still okay.

93
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Thank you for your time.

94
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,940
You are so hot.

95
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,260
Good luck.

96
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,620
Let’s go.

97
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,820
Why are you giving it to me?

98
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,640
Just eat.

99
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,700
I know you’re hungry

100
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,780
You seem so happy when you get to tease me

101
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,080
What was wrong with you though? Why did you agree to take a picture with me?

102
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,000
This picture is special.

103
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,980
