1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,805
 

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,655
 

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,140
 

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,560
That was a foul there

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,360
The referee is giving him a yellow card

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,720
Wait!

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,420
It’s okay.

10
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,420
I can play

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
 

12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
Are you okay?

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,120
Architecture lads are hot-headed today.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,320
I don’t think he can play on

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,620
I can!

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
You can’t, Boss.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,600
I am okay.

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,960
I am okay.

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,860
Ouch!!

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Slow down!

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Sarawat!

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,260
The game has resumed.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,420
Sarawat just goals!

24
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,500
Tine.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,620
Are you alright?

26
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,780
You look a bit pale

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,640
Right after he hits the field, Political Science leads Architecture one-nil.

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,580
I woke up quite late this morning.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,420
And I forgot to have breakfast.

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,820
Let me find something for you to eat.

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,060
I have a sandwich.

32
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,960
Okay.

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,400
Let’s rest for a bit then

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,460
- Guys! Tine is fainting!
- Sarawat just got tackled there!

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,520
Help!

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,920
Bring me first aid and water!

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,120
An Architecture player is given a red card.

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
Looks like we have a situation here on the side.

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,040
Let him get some air!

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,280
Take this.

41
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
Are you OK?

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,800
You stay away!

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
Go!

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
What a dickhead!

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,960
You two go fight somewhere else

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Stop it!

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,360
Tine!

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,380
I am OK.

49
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,420
I will find you a fan or something.

50
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,260
Hey!

51
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,460
Your leg!

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,920
Wat, your leg!

53
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,060
I am fine.

54
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,120
Don’t worry about me.

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,440
Worry about yourself.

56
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,900
I am OK, really

57
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,680
Tine!

58
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,320
Some help here, please.

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,580
Come on.

60
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,540
You passed out.

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,180
The seniors brought you here

62
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,160
What about Wat?

63
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,300
He barely slept

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,180
All he did was looking after you.

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,780
Man and I had to drag him out to see a doc for the wound

66
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,220
He didn’t want to leave you

67
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,500
How is his knee?

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,380
Quite terrible.

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,800
A splint is going to be with him for a month.

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,440
The red mark there is either because of the tackle

71
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,340
or the infection when he ran to save you.

72
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
 

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,140
Don’t worry about him.

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,300
Think about yourself first.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,060
 

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,300
By the way, the Political Science won 1-0.

77
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,740
I guess you need to post a love confession as promised

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,000
It was just a joke, wasn’t it?

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
 

80
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,860
I am hungry.

81
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,520
Let’s find something to eat.

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Do you want to wake him?

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
 

84
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,520
No.

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
 

86
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,500
 

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,760
Since when do you like Americano?

88
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,680
It’s for Sarawat.

89
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,460
I see.

90
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,720
Actually, Sarawat seems like a nice guy.

91
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,620
He really cares about you.

92
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
What are you implying?

93
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,560
At first,

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,600
I thought you were just shaken by him because you hadn’t dated girls for a long time

95
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Now I am not sure.

96
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,540
Not sure about what?

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,600
You know I hate him.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,100
If I ever get together with him, you guys will tease me until the end of my day.

99
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
Sarawat, can we take photos of you?

100
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,660
What’s wrong?

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,480
You should get used it that by now

102
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,320
I haven’t said anything

103
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,980
Shit!

104
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,580
It’s okay.

105
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,820
We can buy a new one.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,080
I had just one sip of it.

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
What a waste.

108
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,920
If you really wanted it, why didn’t you hold on to it firmly

109
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,640
It’s up to you.

110
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,980
If you don’t want to regret it later, try to keep what you want.

111
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,880
Try while you still can.

112
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,860
You can pick it up after you drop it.

113
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,000
But it’s not going to be the same.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,220
I think you should rest and come back next week

115
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,140
I can’t rest.

116
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,920
I have to show and promote a music contest next week

117
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
What about the rehearsal if I rest?

118
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,240
What is happening here?

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,880
We’re discussing the show Sarawat has to perform

120
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,140
I can perform. Just let me.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,080
I asked your doctor.

122
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,920
Besides the injured knee, you have an injured wrist too

123
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,520
I can’t let you perform in this condition.

124
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
My wrist is OK now.

125
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,440
My knee won’t be a problem.

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,760
Let me perform

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,020
No.

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,120
We don’t want any substitution

129
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,320
Without you, it’s not Control S.

130
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,420
Please.

131
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,060
Let me perform

132
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,280
P’Dim.

133
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,560
Will my show be good enough to substitute Control S?

134
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,680
Talk to him. He only listens to you

135
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,040
Try to change his mind

136
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,660
What’s wrong with him playing for the club?

137
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,960
Ever since you gave me this guitar, I haven’t named it yet.
