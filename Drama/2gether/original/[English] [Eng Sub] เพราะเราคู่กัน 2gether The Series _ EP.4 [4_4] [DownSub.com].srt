00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,155
 

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,665
 

3
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,380
 

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,500
 

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
What’s wrong?

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,340
Pear almost got a chance to hear you play Scrubb song

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,740
But her mom called and she needed to go home

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,280
I saw her off just now.

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,300
I am so pissed.

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,740
Pear?

12
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,760
I had to ask the seniors to play that song because you wanted to take a girl to see?

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
That’s right.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,440
She has never been to a concert before

15
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,720
I was about to be the first one to take her to a concert

16
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,060
The first!

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,400
What about me?

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
Am I the first one that you used just to hit on a girl?

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,480
Why are you mad?

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,640
What’s wrong with me seeing her off?

21
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,680
I’m hitting on you here!

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,380
Why are you hitting on someone else?

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,420
But we are just faking it.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,940
Why are you pissed off?

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,960
What is with you?

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,800
Stop being mad.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
 

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Let’s make a deal.

29
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,860
I’ll treat you pork ball sticks and you have to stop being angry

30
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,220
Can I have a lot of these please?

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,160
I give you for free in exchange of a selfie with Sarawat

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
I’m going to a toilet

33
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,280
Sorry about that.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
He has been having diarrhea lately

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,340
That’s why he seems so hot-headed

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,780
You can take selfies with me instead.

37
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,740
That’s okay.

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,100
We’re good.

39
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,280
Just one

40
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Seriously. We’re good.

41
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Wat!

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,100
 

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,020
I am sorry for asking you to play Scrubb song just to hit on Pear

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,800
Please forgive me.

45
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,760
I will do anything

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,880
Anything, you said?

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,080
Damn it!

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,420
Mr.Chic’s reputation is ruined.

49
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,920
I don’t know how to do this.

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Sarawat. Don’t you want to be in a picture too?

51
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,700
Don’t ask him.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,800
He doesn’t like to be in pictures

53
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,880
Ready?

54
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,000
3 2 1.

55
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,520
Here.

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,600
What are you laughing at?

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,160
It’s my turn now.

58
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,740
P’Dim!

59
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,120
Damn it!

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,060
This fu*king club forced me to do the photo.

61
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,200
I said no a million times.

62
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,380
I need to perform now.

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,600
Next time, guys.

64
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,120
Don’t tell anyone about this.

65
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,480
What songs are we playing?

66
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,420
You seem so happy when you get to tease me.

67
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,500
I did what you said so you have to forgive me

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,300
What was wrong with you though? Why did you agree to take a picture with me?

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,140
This picture is special

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,580
How?

71
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,780
I rarely see when you don’t try to strike a pose.

72
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,420
It’s cute.

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,020
You’re not picking at me, are you?

74
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,540
Where is my little brother?

75
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,800
Your brother?

76
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,300
He...

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,640
Phukong.

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
 

79
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
You took a taxi back home?

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,160
That’s what I was about to tell you.

81
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,700
He took a taxi home.

82
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,980
I took a good care of him all day.

83
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,440
Don’t you worry.

84
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,840
Hi guys. We will be the last band to perform

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,080
We are Sunshine, Daisies, Butter Mellow.

86
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
P’Dim’s band is performing.

87
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,340
Do you want to go?

88
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,440
We are the best in Music Club.

89
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,400
We have lots of fans. You can see our signs here.

90
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,640
See?

91
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
The next song will be the last song for this event

92
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,220
Sing with us if you can.

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,460
 

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,960
I’m so mad I didn’t get to hear Everything from Scrubb

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Because you weren’t here to listen when I played.

96
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,680
I know.

97
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,760
I feel so damn guilty here.

98
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,720
What are you doing?

99
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,080
Listening to Everything.

100
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,120

101
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,360

110

If you listen to Scrubb’s songs when you are happy, you will be even happier.

111
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,000
If you listen when you are in love, you will be more deeply in love

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,440
I get it now.

113
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,480
Get what?

114
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
Get what?

115
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,240
You don’t need to know.

116
00:08:42,085 --> 00:08:43,085

123
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,100
Can I grab your boobs?

124
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,080
Are you insane?

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,260
Go take a shower.

126
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,260
You recorded individually last time.

127
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,100
This time you will pair up.

128
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,680
Have you paired up with anyone?

129
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,440
No.

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,700
Pair with me?

131
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,660
Can I sit here?

132
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,580
Sure.

133
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,940
I get you.

134
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,580
I know how it feels to see someone you like.

135
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,240
I will be seriously hitting on Pear from now on

136
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,840
That means I’m just your secret lover?

137
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,360
What is wrong with you?

138
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,320
I just want to have a girlfriend.

139
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,780
