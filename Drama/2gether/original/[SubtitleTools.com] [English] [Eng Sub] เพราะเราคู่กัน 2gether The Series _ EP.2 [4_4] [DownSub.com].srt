1
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,620
You told him you would stop bothering him if you failed?

2
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,760
Yes.

3
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,880
I didn’t have time to think

4
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,860
Who would think he’d challenge me back like that?

5
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,680
Can I call him and cancel the deal?

6
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,840
It’s too late now.

7
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,400
The test is tomorrow.

8
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,660
You don’t have a guitar, don’t you?

9
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,660
I don’t.

10
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,840
Are you buying me a guitar?

11
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,880
I am.

12
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,220
A guitar practicing app.

13
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,120
I just downloaded it for you

14
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,100
You are so stingy when it comes to friends.

15
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,340
You can buy this but can’t buy me a guitar

16
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Come on.

17
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,720
We don’t have a guitar for you but we promise to stay with you all night

18
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,740
We won’t yawn

19
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,840
Won’t lie down.

20
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Won’t sleep.

21
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,000
You guys can go back to your rooms actually

22
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,440
You all are distracting me

23
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,340
I’m cold.

24
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I’m cold.

25
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,560
That’s enough.

26
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,160
Get out.

27
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,960
Next.

28
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,340
The bottom

29
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,039
Down there.

30
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,900
You need some help?

31
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,100
Shit!

32
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,560
30 years since this club was founded,

33
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,360
you’re the only one who dares to do this

34
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,400
I…

35
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Get out!

36
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,040
Next!

37
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,060
Wait!

38
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,160
I am sorry

39
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,260
I really want to be in this club

40
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,660
Can I have one more chance? Let me play again.

41
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,980
Please.

42
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,240
P’Dim…

43
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,620
Tine practiced very hard.

44
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,840
He kept playing with that old guitar with hard strings

45
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,380
That’s right.

46
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,780
I think we should give him one more shot

47
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,320
Wat, bring out your guitar for him to play.

48
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,000
He did it within a week.

49
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,880
Do you know anything else apart from the basic chords?

50
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,660
I don’t.

51
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,280
Do you like acoustic, classical, or electric guitar?

52
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,040
How are they different?

53
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,480
Do you know any other musical instruments?

54
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,540
I don’t

55
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,840
Do you anything at all?

56
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,160
It’s fine.

57
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,700
If we fail, we will go find some other club together.

58
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,860
I am so excited.

59
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,260
When will the result come out?

60
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,600
The result is out, guys

61
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,740
It’s here!

62
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,400
We don’t pass!

63
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,780
Move!

64
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,880
I pass the test.

65
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,460
Don’t forget your word

66
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,060
They let you pass because they felt pity for you.

67
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,940
Are you breaking the promise?

68
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,200
By the way, these snacks are from your fans.

69
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,740
Hey! I got one too.

70
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
From Prim?

71
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,500
Who is Prim?

72
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,460
Is she that cute little girl?

73
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,880
You have a lot there. Why are you taking mine?

74
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
What?

75
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,260
What are you doing?

76
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,920
Okay.

77
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,980
Okay what?

78
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,060
OKAY!

79
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
What the heck are you saying ok to?

80
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,940
Okay. I will be your fake boyfriend.

81
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
He is taken

82
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,360
Hey! So you will help me?

83
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
Do you know any other musical instruments?

84
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,960
I don’t

85
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
Damn!

86
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,020
Do you know anything at all?

87
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,200
I know Sarawat

88
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
He is the reason I want to play guitar.

89
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,180
Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

90
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,980
You came to see Sarawat again.

91
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,600
Why are guys always together these days?

92
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,020
I heard the rumor saying Sarawat likes Tine. Is it true?

93
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,940
True.

94
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,640
You can compete for anything with anyone

95
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,680
but you can’t beat Sarawat when it comes to love

96
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,080
You agreed to help me because you wanted some experience to write a song?

97
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,680
I have a guitar with very soft strings in my room

98
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,160
Can I borrow yours to record a video?

99
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,520
You can with on condition.

100
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,340
Go get it at my place.
