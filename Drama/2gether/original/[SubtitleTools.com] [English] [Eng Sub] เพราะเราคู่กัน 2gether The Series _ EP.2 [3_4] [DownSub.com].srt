1
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,960
The test will be on Friday. Don’t forget to practice

2
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,600
Tine, you’re still here.

3
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,760
Yeah. I don’t have a guitar of my own.

4
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,200
So I think I will play on a bit more.

5
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,860
You guys can go.

6
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,520
I like your determination.

7
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,500
But what you play is still wrong

8
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,440
Thank you for your advice

9
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,140
Enjoy your snacks. From Team Sarawat’s Wives.

10
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,840
I am not stealing.

11
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,580
I am just protecting your snacks from anyone who wants to steal them

12
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Wrong!

13
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,880
Wrong!

14
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,800
Can your fingers work properly?

15
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,420
Press harder

16
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,760
Wrong!

17
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I can’t press any harder

18
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,240
Here.

19
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,340
What?

20
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,620
My guitar.

21
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,020
Its strings are better

22
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,040
Try it.

23
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,000
It’s okay.

24
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,900
Just take it.

25
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,420
Now play it.

26
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,480
It’s right this time.

27
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,380
Does it hurt your fingers?

28
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,960
No.

29
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,340
That’s good.

30
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,240
Keep practicing.

31
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,280
Now try chord E.

32
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,180
How do you do chord E?

33
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,480
Move over.

34
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Your middle finger on the second fret, fifth string

35
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,400
Your ring finger on the second fret, fourth string.

36
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,600
Your point finger on the first fret, third string.

37
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,400
Now play it.

38
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,860
Memorize it so I don’t have to teach you again.

39
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Play on.

40
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
What are you looking at?

41
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,100
I'm just wondering why you aren't in the Faculty of Music since you're so good.

42
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,640
I play because I enjoy it

43
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,900
I’m afraid that if I actually learn it,

44
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,020
it won’t give me pleasure anymore.

45
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,660
I do what I like by heart, not by duty

46
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
What are you still looking at?

47
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,500
I’m begging you.

48
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,780
Please help me.

49
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,920
Just pretend that you like me.

50
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,300
So you’re in this club because of this?

51
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,680
It’s not like that.

52
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,700
It’s…

53
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,640
It’s…

54
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,460
Yes! I admit it.

55
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,540
Now that you know it, please help to be my fake boyfriend

56
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,840
Are you saying yes or no?

57
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,120
[Faculty Building]

58
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,920
Sarawat is here.

59
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,640
Record a video.

60
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,020
Let’s take a selfie.

61
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,320
Sarawat…

62
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,380
Have you seen a guy who comes to practice here every day?

63
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,740
I haven’t seen him

64
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,580
He might be finding himself a new club.

65
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,740
I don’t think he will pass the test.

66
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,580
P’Dim wants to see you in the storage room but I have no idea why.

67
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,660
Is that you, nuisance?!?

68
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,880
Do you think I will give up that easily?

69
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
If you want to get out, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

70
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,860
Deal with your own problem.

71
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,040
Let me out.

72
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,140
Up to you then.

73
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,260
Sleep tight in there tonight.

74
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,620
Are you threatening me?

75
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,500
Do you want to get hurt?

76
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,780
Do you think I’m afraid?

77
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,680
Tine!!

78
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,940
Are you in here? I think I just saw you.

79
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:28,260
You won’t get out of Music Club because you’re afraid of your seniors. Am I right?

80
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,120
Don’t be. I have friends from Bodybuilder Club just to help you.

81
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,700
Let me deal with the seniors for you

82
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,840
Open, please

83
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,080
Tine.

84
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,320
You don’t want to be in that club.

85
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Just resign and join Cooking Club with me.

86
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,460
I know that someone is in there

87
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,160
If you don’t open the door, I will.

88
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,180
What are you doing here so loud?

89
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,040
I was sleeping in there?

90
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,220
Who are you here for?

91
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
In there?

92
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,080
Yeah, why?

93
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,920
I’m looking for Tine. Have you seen him?

94
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Tine?

95
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,580
No.

96
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,980
Really?

97
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,380
I’m going to continue my sleep.

98
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,660
Anything else?

99
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,040
Nope.

100
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,500
Sleeping in a cupboard?

101
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,420
Sorry for bothering.

102
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,580
Bye bye.

103
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,820
Tine!

104
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,300
Tine!

105
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,580
Come out, nuisance

106
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,580
That was close.

107
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,240
Thank you so much.

108
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,760
I didn’t want to help you.

109
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,780
I just didn’t want to get involved in your business.

110
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,740
It’s a good idea to change the club.

111
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,600
You won’t pass a test for Music Club.

112
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,660
What if I pass?

113
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,800
If I pass, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

114
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,200
Deal?

115
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,640
If you do, I’ll help you.

116
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,160
But if you fail, you have to leave me alone

117
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,640
Deal.

118
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,960
The result is out.

119
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,160
We don’t pass.
