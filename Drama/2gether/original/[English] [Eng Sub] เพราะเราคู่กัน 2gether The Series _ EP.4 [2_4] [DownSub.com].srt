1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,205
 

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:09,275
 

4
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,495
 

5
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:12,395
 

6
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:15,855
 

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,240
 

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,680
Why didn't any of you tell me that you would come?

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,640
Then it wouldn’t be a surprise.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,380
I thought I would find your girlfriend here

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,480
But it turned out to be your new friend.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,000
Weird.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,140
You don’t usually bring anyone here.

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,240
My room was a mess.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,160
I asked him to help me clean up and refurnish

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,380
What on earth can convince you to refurnish?

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,340
Someone said it was messy.

18
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,880
So I just decided to change the atmosphere

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,620
Your girlfriend?

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,000
A friend.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,640
Friend again?

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,700
When will you have a girlfriend?

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,880
You are super insensitive

24
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,860
Mom.

25
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,720
Tine, do you know that Wat has never had a girlfriend before?

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,720
Really?

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,840
Yes.

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,180
All he does is play guitar

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,440
He doesn’t have time to find me a daughter-in-law

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,420
You seem like you’ve had a lot of girlfriends

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,740
Share Sarawat some tricks. I want to see him date.

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,400
That’s enough, mom.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,080
When are you going to tell me why you are here?

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,260
Phukong will spend the night here.

35
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Your University will have an Open House tomorrow

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,040
Take your brother with you so that he can observe the Faculty he likes.

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,920
But tomorrow…

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,960
I have to go. Your dad is waiting.

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,420
Take care of your brother.

40
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,320
Mom.

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,200
Sawasdee Krub

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
Sawasdee Krub.

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,100
Why didn’t you call?

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,940
If I’d called, I wouldn’t have seen what I saw.

45
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,760
 

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,840
I am going to get a coffee

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Tine.

48
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,840
You have to take my brother to the University tomorrow

49
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,460
Why me?

50
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,020
Because I have a show to perform.

51
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,560
My mom will kill me if I let him go by himself

52
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
I have to meet my friend

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,940
We will go together.

54
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,720
Then take my brother with you and your friend

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,480
If you agree to take care of my brother,

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,980
I will ask the seniors to play a Scrubb song for you.

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,020
Really?

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
Damn it!

59
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,980
You’re luring me with a Scrubb song

60
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,960
Okay?

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,960
Fine.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,420
They call me for practice.

63
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,960
I need to get changed

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,440
Pay for the food.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,420
You need to pay too

66
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,740
Ask my brother to pay.

67
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,700
Bye.

68
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,720
Shit!

69
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,180
You don’t even finish your food!

70
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,700
Let me eat then.

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,560
 

72
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:31,455
 

73
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,795
 

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
 

75
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,100
How did you become my brother’s boyfriend?

76
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

77
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,420
Boyfriend my ass.

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,740
My brother was an introvert but now he seems so in love

79
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,220
He even has an IG account.

80
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,860
He never cared about things like this before

81
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,480
Maybe he wants to change.

82
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,440
I saw him writing a love song.

83
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,280
I saw that too.

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,820
Maybe he is in love with some girl.

85
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,920
I hope he falls for a good person

86
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,460
My brother isn’t good at things like this.

87
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,940
Don’t worry.

88
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,780
I don’t know him that long but I know he isn’t a bad guy

89
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,660
A good person will find a way to a good person eventually

90
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,180
You’re a good guy like my brother said

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,300
What?

92
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,520
He talked about me?

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,460
That’s right.

94
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,100
He also said that you are loony and you suck so bad

95
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,020
What?

96
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,900
Suck?

97
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,720
Did he say I suck?

98
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,700
Yep!

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,500
Here you go again, Sarawat!

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,240
Calm down.

101
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,680
You pay for your brother.

102
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,680
He ate and did a runner.

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,540
But he said it was your treat

104
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,400
I don’t have money.

105
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,460
You’re rich. You pay.

106
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,900
Are you that hungry? You’re eating my brother’s leftover too

107
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,800
No food waste.

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,100
You can go ahead. I will look after your brother

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,240
Don’t forget to play Everything.

110
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,660
You told me so many times already.

111
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,940
I’m gonna go now.

112
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,440
See you.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,280
Should we go now?

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,140
Wait for my friend for a sec.

115
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,720
It’s not just us?

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,780
How many of your friends are coming?

118
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,900
Only one.

119
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,960
If you don’t like too many people,

120
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,200
you can go alone so you don’t feel uncomfortable

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,140
I don’t like too many people either.

122
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,920
I want just the two of us.

123
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,580
Did you wait for long, Tine?

124
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,580
Is this Sarawat’s brother?

125
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,240
You are hot like your brother

126
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Hello beautiful senior!

127
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,580
What a sweet kid.

128
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,620
Which Faculty are you looking at?

129
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,360
How about Medicine? I can take you.

130
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,800
I was deadly sick when I was a kid.

131
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,100
Luckily, I was cured by an excellent doctor.

132
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,400
I want to be a good doctor just like him

133
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,180
What about you, P’Tine?

134
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,540
Why are you asking?

135
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,720
Welcome to Photo Club.

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Do you guys want to get pictures? It’s free

137
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,240
Pear, do you want one?

138
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
The two of us can take a photo together

139
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,980
What about me?

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,780
You said you were going to a workshop

141
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,980
But I’m still here

142
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,020
Stop arguing.

143
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,380
We will all have a photo together

144
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,880
Help me choose the photo prop.

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
 

146
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,740
This one?

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,440
You wear that

148
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,920
You should try this, Pear.

149
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,260
How do I look?

150
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,720
Ready?

151
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,860
3 2 1.

152
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,080
3 2 1 Smile!

153
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
 

154
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,840
3 2 1.

155
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,200
I like this photo. Can I keep it?

156
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,800
Should we each keep one?

157
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,980
That’s okay.

158
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,700
I don’t know why I should keep your try-to-be-so-cool photo

159
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,120
Are you envious because I’m hotter?

160
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,540
Tine, I need to use a bathroom

161
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,740
Sure.

162
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,580
Can you please get lost for an hour or two?

163
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,080
I am begging.

164
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,600
Do I really need to pay?

165
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,120
I’ll give you 500.

166
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,380
Go.

167
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,980
Do you really think I’m a little kid who can be bought?

168
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,700
1,000.

169
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,460
Have fun.

170
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,420
P’Pear…

171
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,620
Stop right there.

172
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,600
I’m just returning the prop.

173
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
Bye now.

174
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,360
Go far away.

175
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,700
Sawasdee Krub.

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,680
Sawasdee Ka.

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,900
So cute

178
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,360
Who did you come with?

179
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,880
I came with my brother

180
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,900
Who is your brother? We might know him

181
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,920
His name is Sarawat.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,320
Sarawat!

183
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,340
He looks yummy just like his brother.

184
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,520
We will give you these pork ball sticks for free

185
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,340
But can we have a photo with you?

186
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,280
You don’t have to…

187
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,780
1 2 3

188
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,020
1 2 3.

189
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,680
Can you do this pose?

190
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,820
1 2 3.

191
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,600
Oops! Are you whipped for high school boys now?

192
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,880
Let me join you!

193
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,960
He is not just a school boy

194
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,540
He is Sarawat’s little brother

195
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,020
Really?

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,360
Let’s take a selfie.

197
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
1 2 3.

198
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,940
1 2 3.

199
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,740
1 2 3.

200
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,520
Hold on a second, guys

201
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,140
P’Sarawat, do you want to take a picture with us?

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
Boy, this is a restricted area

203
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,760
I am looking for my brother.

204
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,460
He is playing guitar here.

205
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,820
You need to wait outside

206
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,840
This zone is for band members only

207
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
It will take just a minute.

208
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,600
My brother will be here soon.

209
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,920
I said no.

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,380
Go wait outside.

211
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Please. It won’t take long.

212
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,820
What if their belongings are stolen?

213
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,920
They won’t be stolen. I am not a thief.

214
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,380
What are you arguing about?

215
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,780
He is looking for someone

216
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,220
I will send him out now.

217
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,320
No need

218
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,020
He is my brother.

219
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,880
Now that you’re here, make yourself useful

220
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,180
Give me a massage.

221
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,780
Nervous?

222
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,740
Your loved one is here to watch?

223
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,700
You’ve changed a lot.

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,420
So?

225
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,120
It makes me scare
