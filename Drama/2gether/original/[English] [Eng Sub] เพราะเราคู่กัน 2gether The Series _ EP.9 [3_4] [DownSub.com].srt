1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,185
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,360
P’Dim.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,280
Will my show be good enough to substitute Control S?

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,100
What’s got into your head?

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,420
I am not as good as Sarawat

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,080
But I can perform by myself.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,740
Great!

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,120
I will perform a guitar solo after Tine’s show

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,720
Me too.

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,680
Us too.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,520
It doesn’t sound so bad.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,140
We give this stage to newbies.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,000
It might motivate more people to step up and join the contest

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
Do you all know that...

19
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,340
when you are on stage,

20
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,560
you carry the club reputation with you?

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I do

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,960
This club accepted me and taught me guitar lessons

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,680
It’s time for me to repay it.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,340
P’Dim is crazy enough to let Tine perform

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Fong.

26
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,220
Talk to him. He only listens to you.

27
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,520
Try to change his mind.

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,800
What’s wrong with him playing for the club?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,120
He is a newbie.

30
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
He doesn’t have enough time to practice

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,140
First time on stage is tough.

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,580
I don’t want him to fail.

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,740
Do you know why Tine hasn’t said yes to your confession?

34
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,860
How does that have to do with anything here?

35
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,900
Tine was always the one taking care of his ex.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,500
But now he is the one being taken care of.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,400
I guess he is not used to it.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,040
He might want to prove that he is good enough to be with you

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,100
Don’t be happy just yet.

40
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,840
If he fails this time, he might get too discouraged.

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,360
He might withdraw himself from a relationship with you forever.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,380
Thanks.

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,000
Your food is right here

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I’m gonna go practice now.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,100
Hey!

46
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,320
I hurt my knee, not my eyes

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
You can practice here.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
I can be your mentor

49
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,760
Fine.

50
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,560
I will get you a chair

51
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,340
 

52
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,240
What are you looking at?

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,020
I’m just thinking…

54
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,000
ever since you gave me this guitar,

55
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,560
I haven’t named it yet

56
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,260
What?

57
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,280
Is it the right time to name a guitar?

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,580
I am serious here.

59
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,440
If you were a guitar, you would want to play for the owner who gave you a nice name

60
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,940
Up to you then.

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,400
What kind of name do you like then?

62
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,420
Something that describes me

63
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,900
Ringworm.

64
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,680
Just call yourself that.

65
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,560
Scrubb?

66
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,400
Scrubb?

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,340
Yes.

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,140
Don’t you feel pity for them at all?

69
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,000
Don’t ruin their band by naming your guitar that

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,900
What name do you want then?

71
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,300
Just pick one already, nuisance.

72
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,820
Stop being picky and practice.

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,920
Nuisance!

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,300
That’s right.

75
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,360
Nuisance!

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,260
Freaking right for my guitar.

77
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,060
You are awesome!

78
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,320
You are clever.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,640
Let me see your music chords.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,860
Are you playing a Scrubb song?

81
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,440
Yes. Why?

82
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,880
The first time having a girlfriend,

83
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,300
the first heartbreak,

84
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,860
the first music video recording

85
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,480
Scrubb songs took parts in all of them.

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,900
This will be my first time on stage.

87
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,860
How can I play a song from other bands?

88
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,780
You’re right.

89
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,080
I am jealous of Scrubb

90
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,680
They are your first of many things.

91
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,740
I want to be Scrubb

92
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Why?

93
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,240
So that I can be with you both when you’re happy and sad

94
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,160
I want to be Scrubb.

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,720
Cheesy!

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,860
Let me practice already.

97
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,260
Otherwise, the true sadness will come if I can't play

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,500
Wrong.

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,640
Press harder.

100
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
Wrong.

101
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,000
Wrong.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
Press more firmly.

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,740
Isn’t this firm enough?

104
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,420
If it’s firmly enough, it won’t sound wrong.

105
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,540
Wrong. Press harder.

106
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
Here.

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,300
Press harder.

108
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,520
Now play.

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,940
This is called right.

110
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,800
Memorize it.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,500
Give me the pick.

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,580
Nobody holds a pick as you do.

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,880
Look.

114
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,860
Use your point finger like this.

115
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,760
Spare the edge.

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,440
Grab it together with your thumb.

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,060
And you strum it.

118
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,220
Give me your hand.

119
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,860
Put a pick on your point finger.

120
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,540
Leave the edge

121
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,800
Press it with your thumb.

122
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Tine.

123
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,560
Will you marry me?

124
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,880
What the hell?

125
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,780
You’re teaching me to hold a pick, not putting on a wedding ring.

126
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay. Keep going!

127
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
 

128
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,980
Why are you smiling?

129
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,300
Who is?

130
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
 

131
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,620
Does it hurt your fingers?

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,500
 

133
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,040
Stop.

134
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,520
Let me see

135
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,940
 

136
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,040
 

137
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
All of them hurt?

138
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,880
Yes.

139
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,460
Just take a break.

140
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,820
If you practice too hard and hurt your fingers, you can’t perform anyway

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,960
Let me have a look.

142
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,160
See? Your fingers are about to bleed.

143
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,100
You have to be able to play when the day comes.

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,440
I’m trying to be gentle, but this is hard.

145
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,620
Sorry.

146
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
You know what.

147
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,700
No one has ever plastered me before in my life.

148
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,480
And do you think I have done this for anyone?

149
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,700
Marry me?

150
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,660
 

151
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,240
Again? Stop it!

152
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,640
It’s done.

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Thank you.

154
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,620
Take a break for a while until your fingers heal.

155
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,840
Listen to the song in the meantime.

156
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,300
I said no practice.

157
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,960
Put it down.

158
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
 

159
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
 

160
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:17,395
 

161
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,205
 

162
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,225
 

163
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:40,785
 

164
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
 

165
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,100
[To help you see the chords more clearly.]

166
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 

167
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:19,215
 

168
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,015
 

169
00:11:26,535 --> 00:11:27,535
 

170
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:46,135
 

171
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,645
 

172
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:51,445
 

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,900
 

174
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,500
Good timing.

175
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,920
We are teaming up.

176
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,240
This game, I will play for your opponent

177
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,480
What?

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
Be my guest. Play for the team you want.

179
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,040
What the heck is your problem?

180
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,440
That was one hell of a tackle.

181
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,280
 

182
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,420
 

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Ouch!

184
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Shit!

185
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
 

186
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,480
What are you playing?

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,200
I’m doing what you did to my brother.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,340
Yes!

189
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,120
I am Sarawat’s brother!

190
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,260
F*ck you!

191
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
 

192
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 

193
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,520
You have an appointment for the x-ray tomorrow.

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,140
I am not available tomorrow morning

195
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,660
Can we postpone it for later?

196
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,880
Your doctor is free only tomorrow morning.

197
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,280
After that, he is fully booked.

198
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,140
We can’t postpone it.

199
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
Wat.

200
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Wat.

201
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,040
Wat.

202
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,960
What is on your mind?

203
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,200
Nothing.

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,320
The nurse told me you have to come for an x-ray tomorrow

205
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,120
Just come.

206
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,440
I will be fine.

207
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,560
But you are performing.

208
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,060
Do you think I went through all the practice just to bother you at the end?

209
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,620
Can you take me somewhere today?

210
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Where?

211
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,240
Welcome everyone to our Music Club shows.

212
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,200
My name is…

213
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,360
You OK?

214
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,420
Keep fighting!
