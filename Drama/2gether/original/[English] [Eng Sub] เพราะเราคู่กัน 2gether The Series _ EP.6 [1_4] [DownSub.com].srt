1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
 

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,960
 

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,235
 

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,320
Can I grab your boobs?

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
Are you insane?

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Go take a shower.

9
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,380
Can I borrow this?

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,100
Last time, you recorded a video individually

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,360
This time you will pair up

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,040
Have you paired up with anyone?

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,760
No.

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,660
Pair with me then?

15
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,120
No need to ask. I have been waiting for you here

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,220
You go around with a makeup remover in your bag?

17
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,360
It is for you.

18
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,780
What kind of person do you like? That was almost every kind

19
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,340
Do you like the weird one?

20
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,180
Is there anything going on between you and Sarawat?

21
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,640
Promise me that you will not cheat on me or talk to anyone when I’m not around

22
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,780
Cheat on?

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,400
We are not dating

24
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,440
I will seriously be hitting on Pear.

25
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,060
Did you hear what I said?

26
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,300
I said I will seriously hit on Pear

27
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,860
You will hit on her

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,580
So I’m just your secret lover?

29
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,540
Wait!

30
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,460
Should I act heartbroken?

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,600
Should I cry?

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,440
Hey!

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,460
What is wrong with you?

34
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,740
I just want to have a girlfriend. Why are you…

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,735
 

36
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,500
 

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
You are reserved.

38
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,700
Don’t ever hit on anyone

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,200
 

40
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,345
 

41
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,360
 

42
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,860
Hey!

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,420
Wat!

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,480
Wat!

45
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,620
Sarawat!

46
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,140
Saraleo!! What did you just do?

47
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,120
Get up and talk to me.

48
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,120
Let go of my hand.

49
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,885
 

50
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:03,355
 

51
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:07,105
 

52
00:02:07,105 --> 00:02:08,105
 

53
00:02:09,035 --> 00:02:11,785
 

54
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:15,425
 

55
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:18,825
 

56
00:02:18,825 --> 00:02:21,705
 

57
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,795
 

58
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:25,915
 

59
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:29,095
 

60
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,505
 

61
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,820
 

62
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,060
 

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,660
 

64
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:45,645
 

65
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,965
 

66
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:50,635
 

67
00:02:51,085 --> 00:02:54,265
 

68
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,515
 

69
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,265
 

70
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,165
 

71
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,115
 

72
00:03:02,945 --> 00:03:04,185
 

73
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,365
 

74
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:10,315
 

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,300
 

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,120
Tine!

77
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,700
Tine! Are you dead in there?

78
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,960
Tine!

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Tine

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,340
What are you up to?

81
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,120
Why haven’t you taken a shower yet?

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Come on. I am hungry.

83
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,580
Hey!

84
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,520
A new wallet?

85
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
I haven’t seen you used this one

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
That’s my brother’s!

87
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,740
He didn’t just forget his wallet.

88
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,220
He forgot his phone too

89
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,900
That also belongs to my brother

90
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,580
Hold on.

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,500
He uses your picture as his lock screen wallpaper

92
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,840
Of course

93
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,660
It’s normal. We are brothers

94
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,980
It’s not normal because it’s a picture of you and Sarawat.

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,800
It’s…

96
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,520
Enough already

97
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,040
I know Sarawat slept here last night

98
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,360
‘I didn’t want to wake you.’

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,919
‘I am off for music practice.’

100
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,999
He left a note for you.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,840
So you guys moved in together already?

102
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,060
Are you crazy?

103
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,240
He came to record a video for Music Club.

104
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,940
By the time we’re done recording, it was really late.

105
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,760
So, I let him crash here.

106
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,140
But he was gone when I woke up.

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,500
And have you asked him how he feels for you yet?

108
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,700
You are reserved.

109
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,180
Don’t ever hit on anyone

110
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,880
Uh…

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,940
I have.

112
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,440
He said he was just messing with Green’s head.

113
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,200
He was playing.

114
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,440
It’s nothing, guys.

115
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,080
It’s late. Let me go take a shower.

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,480
Quickly.

117
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,880
I am hungry.

118
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,260
Tine, what’s wrong?

119
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,380
You seem really distracted today

120
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,240
I am sorry.

121
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,680
We can leave it here for today

122
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,440
Don’t forget to practice at home.

123
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
 

124
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
These are yours.

125
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,180
You forgot them

126
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Thanks.

127
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
You’re welcome

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,500
I’m gonna go now.

129
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,180
Tine.

130
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,420
Tine!

131
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,560
Why are you mad?

132
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Don’t you think I should be mad at what you did to me?

133
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,360
I am sorry.

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
I was in a rush this morning.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,320
I didn’t wait until you woke up

136
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,080
I am not talking about this morning

137
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,540
I am talking about last night.

138
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,880
Last night?

139
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,140
Don’t you remember what you did to me at all?

140
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,620
I did something to you?

141
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
What?

142
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,080
I was drunk last night.

143
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,200
We recorded a video in your room

144
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,820
And then…

145
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,360
Then you…

146
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,660
Forget it.

147
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,960
I’m gonna go now

148
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Wait!

149
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,680
I’m not done talking to you

150
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,600
I have a football match this Saturday

151
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,760
Come and cheer for me.

152
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
I don’t think so

153
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,820
University cheerleaders are not assigned for this match

154
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
Screw U-cheerleaders.

155
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,020
I just want you to cheer for me

156
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Fine.

157
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,460
I’ll think about it

158
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,840
I actually have to help Phuak with his food review page

159
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,400
I will be off now.

160
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,060
Any of you who wants to attend an intensive course for Faculty of Architecture

161
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,200
register right here with me, P’Chat, your handsome tutor.

162
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,840
Can I ask you something?

163
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,500
P’Mil, a senior who played guitar at the Open House, will he be a tutor too?

164
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,200
And does he have a girlfriend?

165
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
Am I his type?

166
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,440
They are all here because of you.

167
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,540
Why don’t you tutor them?

168
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,180
I am sure our Faculty welcomes the biggest number of freshmen this year

169
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,200
Really?

170
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,220
Yes.

171
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,820
I am sorry, guys.

172
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,560
I dedicate my time for music practice

173
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,920
I am afraid I won’t have enough time to take care of you guys.

174
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
I don’t think I can tutor you

175
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,820
How about just one student?

176
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,240
Are you here for the Open House?

177
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,500
What Faculty are you enrolling in?

178
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,120
I don’t know yet

179
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah?

180
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,600
Let me give you advice.

181
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,660
Enroll for any Faculty but Architecture

182
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,720
The workload is crazy.

183
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,380
I told you Architecture is not easy

184
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,800
That’s why I need a great tutor…

185
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
…like you.

186
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,720
But I don’t need a troll student like you

187
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,680
See you.

188
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,760
Wait!

189
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,260
Register first.

190
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,680
Mil will be back.

191
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,980
Hand it to your friends too.

192
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,040
Hi guys. I am admin Phuak from page ‘Gross But Cheap So We Gotta Eat.’

193
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,200
I am taking you to a hot pot restaurant near University

194
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,180
It’s cheap but the taste is horrible.

195
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
Fits for our concept

196
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,300
Damn it! Phuak!

197
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,900
Did you have to say ‘horrible’ so loud?

198
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,960
They will kick us out.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,040
[Sarawat: The game is about to start. Where are you?]

200
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,580
Tine, taste it and review

201
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,780
What kind of soup is this? It burns my throat.

202
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,380
Of course it does.

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,800
They put Thai herbal liquor in it. It’s a special recipe.

204
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,520
Prepare to get drunk.

205
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,800
Guys can’t take girlfriends here then.

206
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Why not?

207
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,500
People always speak the truth when drunk

208
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,980
If you’re hiding secrets from your girlfriend

209
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,660
you will spill it all out after having this soup

210
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,620
Come on. Drink up.

211
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,140
It’s really great.

212
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,740
Cheers!

213
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,500
Cheers!

214
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,180
Drink it all.

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,280
Drink up.

216
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,200
 

217
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,460
Is it true…

218
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,460
that when people are drunk, they speak the truth?

219
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,940
Of course not.

220
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,620
Ohm was just saying

221
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,020
There is something I’ve always wanted to tell you though

222
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,800
What?

223
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,540
Do you remember your phone with a cracked screen?

224
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,740
You didn’t sit on it. Ohm dropped it and blamed it on you.

225
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,460
Shut the front door, Phuak!!

226
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,960
Don’t listen to him. He’s drunk.

227
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,400
I am not. I remember all of it.

228
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,940
As for Fong,

229
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,820
he used your Facebook account to register a porn website.

230
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,280
It’s OK guys.

231
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,460
Let’s have more soup.

232
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,240
Cheers!

233
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,680
Come on.

234
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,880
Cheers!

235
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 

236
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,240
Cheers!

237
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,600
 

238
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:17,345
 

239
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,500
 

240
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,120
Is this the end of the world?

241
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,760
My husband shows up here and helps out

242
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,220
I have to.

243
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,760
My car broke down.

244
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,320
I need some money to fix it

245
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,340
Be a tutor and make some money then

246
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,080
I heard that many girls wanted to be your students

247
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,140
Little girls have nothing on a real deal like you, Jae Tun.

248
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,940
What a sweet talker!

249
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,720
I can’t raise the wage for you though

250
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,280
If you want more money, do the OT in my room

251
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,640
Here.

252
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,660
What is this?

253
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,480
P’Chat told me to draw Kon (person), Rod (car, watering) and Ton Mai (tree)

254
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,580
I’ve finished it and I want to hear your opinion.

255
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,720
If I give you a comment, will you leave me alone?

256
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,660
You’ll never know.

257
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,260
Once you see my drawing, you might want to be my tutor.

258
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,500
Here it is.

259
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,880
A person watering a tree.

260
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,100
Can you just go and be a troll somewhere else?

261
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,960
I am your customer.

262
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,640
You can’t shoo me away.

263
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,600
I’ll report this to Jae Tun

264
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
Jae…

265
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,140
What do you want? Just order

266
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,980
Quickly.

267
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,980
Honey toast

268
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,400
100 honey toasts

269
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,240
You order for the whole freaking universe?

270
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,220
I’m not doing it.

271
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
Jae Tun…

272
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,860
What do you want?

273
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,900
If you agree to be my tutor, I will be a good boy

274
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,640
I will stop bugging you.

275
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,300
 

276
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Fine.

277
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,260
Draw a person, a car, and a tree and hand them in to me tomorrow morning.

278
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,600
I’ll be your tutor then.

279
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,900
You don’t need to wait till tomorrow

280
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,520
I can finish it right now.

281
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,760
100 drawings altogether

282
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,060
If you can’t do it, get out of my sight completely

283
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,000
Go now.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
You’re running out of time.

285
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,540
 

286
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,060
Let’s go to the next restaurant

287
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,400
I’m not going

288
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,140
What is happening?

289
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,080
[Man: RIP Sarawat’s knee.]

290
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,560
Bandage me, please.

291
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,080
Why are you shaking so much?

292
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,560
Don’t tell me you still haven’t seen it on your IG
