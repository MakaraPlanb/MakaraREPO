1
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,920
Is Tine here?

2
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,140
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,540
Can I…

4
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,020
Can I have my guitar back?

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,320
Sorry.

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,740
I didn’t mean to keep it.

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,540
I was going to return it to you.

8
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:10,795
That’s OK.

9
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,555
I’m just borrowing it for the contest.

10
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,545
You will get it back.

11
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,660
Come and support me.

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,460
I…

13
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,800
I will wait for you.

14
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,525
Well well.

15
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:43,135
It doesn’t seem like an end for you two.

16
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,480
The food is here.

17
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,580
Finally.

18
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,800
I’m so hungry I could eat a horse.

19
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
It has your name on it.

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,440
I didn’t order crispy pork with Chinese broccoli.

21
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,620
I just don’t want to owe you anything.

22
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,360
Did I ever say you owe me anything?

23
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,220
Did you challenge my brother that

24
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:53,955
if you win, you will take P’Tine out?

25
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,625
Yeah.

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
What if you lose?

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,800
If I lose,

28
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,520
what do you want me to do?

29
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:11,775
Tine, I think

30
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,640
you should give Sarawat one more chance.

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,140
He must be really remorseful.

32
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:21,095
But I don’t think you should go.

33
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:25,415
Once a glass is broken, it’ll never be the same.

34
00:03:25,885 --> 00:03:29,085
Nothing in this whole world can stay the same.

35
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,040
Even if you leave the glass untouched, it can get old.

36
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,840
Stop arguing.

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,160
He has decided not to go.

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,000
We better go.

39
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,140
Is this a music contest or a beauty contest?

40
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,340
Do you have to look like an idol?

41
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,620
Well, I want to be a net idol too.

42
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,675
In case my band wins,

43
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,860
I must look hot when we receive the winner cup.

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,640
Good idea.

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,260
Can I borrow your beauty item?

46
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,820
I want to look good too.

47
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,500
The door is here.

48
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
Sawasdee Krub.

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,780
Wat, how are you?

50
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,540
We are the last to perform.

51
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,100
Wait for me.

52
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,780
Don’t worry.

53
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,020
Go kill it, man.

54
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,760
I brought my boyfriend to see too.

55
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,700
And Tine?

56
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,640
Is he coming?

57
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,860
Should I call him?

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,920
No.

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,460
He will come.

60
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,340
Don’t you know where he is?

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,820
You’re the one in relationship with him.

62
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,980
Just listen to it and you will know.

63
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,040
I don’t know if you are listening.

64
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,200
I want you to know this.
