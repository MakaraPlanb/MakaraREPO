1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,185
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,140
I think we should split up here.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,360
I’m going to the bathroom and then head back

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,760
See you.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,960
Bye.

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,080
 

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
 

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,600
Hey!

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,220
Wat!

14
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,760
What happened to you?

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Damn!

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,340
Can you get up?

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,320
 

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,860
It hurts.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,080
Just hang in there.

20
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,339
Who did this to you?

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,240
The same group.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,960
Just because their girlfriends liked my IG posts.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,720
What a stupid reason!

24
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,720
Hey!

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
You got beaten up before?

26
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,560
Why haven’t you told me?

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,220
Screw it.

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,520
I didn’t want you to worry

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,180
Who is worried about you?

30
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,400
I’m just afraid you will die young. That’s all.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,700
From now on, you have to tell me when you have a problem

32
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,220
Do you get it?

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,540
Got it.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,540
Face up.

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,400
You can stop.

36
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,880
 

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,080
It’s not that bad

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,480
It’s way better like this

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,000
The pain is gone

40
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,780
What’s with you?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hey!

42
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,420
What did you just do?

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,860
You just healed me.

44
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,680
You are such a pervert.

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
 

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
 

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,100
Now I don’t mind getting beaten up more often.

48
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,560
What if I get ambushed on the way back?

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,820
Can you sleepover at my place tonight?

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,420
Take me home

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,300
How old are you, three?

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,880
You get scared too easily.

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,340
I don’t have anything with me.

54
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,840
How can I crash at your place?

55
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,660
I’ve prepared everything you need

56
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,360
You can even use my toothbrush. I don’t mind.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,700
But I do.

58
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,640
I will be off now

59
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,680
What?

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,880
Go with me.

61
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,700
I said I didn’t have my stuff with me.

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,580
I said use mine. I don’t care.

63
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,280
But I do!

64
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,200
Don't forget to use a cold pack

65
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Yes.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,020
Let’s go.

67
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,700
Go to my room.

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,160
I go back to my room. You go back to your room

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,660
I go back to my room. You go back to my room

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,880
You go back to your room. I go back to my room.

71
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,480
Come on

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Hey!

73
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,860
Do you still have my football jersey?

75
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,500
Yes.

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,860
I will give it back before the game starts

77
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,700
I don’t want you to return it to me.

78
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,340
I have another one

79
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,620
But can you wear my jersey

80
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,480
And come cheer for me when I play?

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,500
If you come wearing that jersey and football shorts

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,400
It will give me the ultimate power to beat Engineering.

83
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,260
Why do I need to wear your jersey?

84
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,940
Should we go back now?

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,100
Let’s go.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,500
Would you have mercy for an injured guy here?

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,740
And you forgot your tissue.

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,920
Man!

89
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,520
You pretended to be me to chat with someone?

90
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,620
Yes.

91
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,840
He talked and agreed to meet up.

92
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,880
All these because of your beauty.

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,700
Thanks but you need to delete my photo now!

94
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,900
Come on

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,300
I’m confessing my crime here because I need your help

96
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,200
Can you go meet him for me?

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,080
No way.

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,660
You dream about it.

99
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,400
No.

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,480
Please.

101
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,280
No.

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,720
Just once.

103
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,900
No.

104
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,080
Take my picture out.

105
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,980
Please.

106
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,960
No.

107
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,380
Up to you then.

108
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,160
I thought I would give you Ed Sheeran concert ticket if you said yes.

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
I know you love him

110
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,960
The tickets are already sold out now.

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,240
What ticket again?

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,680
Ed Sheeran

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,260
Are you Earn?

114
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Yes.

115
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,840
Please have a seat P’Tan.

116
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,700
I am Type

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Sorry

118
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,600
My tongue twisted.

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,100
Please have a seat P’Type.

120
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Thank you so much for helping with my report

121
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,720
No problem.

122
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,180
Which subject is this report for again?

123
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,620
 

124
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,220
Introduction to Economics.

125
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,280
That’s why I need some thoughts from someone who attends so many business seminars

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,940
Before we start, let me record this interview.

127
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,240
Sure.

128
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,820
Economics.

129
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,400
Why do you need this note?

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
It’s…

131
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,740
What are you playing?

132
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,060
I knew it.

133
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,160
I knew it was weird

134
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,220
We greeted and you suddenly asked to meet.

135
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,540
What do you really want from me?

136
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,840
It’s not what you think.

137
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,400
You’re misunderstanding

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,580
It’s…

139
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,500
What?

140
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,860
It’s…

141
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,340
What?

142
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,060
It’s…

143
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,420
Never mind.

144
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
I don’t want to know.

145
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,860
But don’t ever do this to me again.

146
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,340
Otherwise, I will call the police.

147
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,300
Got it?

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
Got it.

149
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,460
 

150
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,180
What do you think I should do?

151
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,260
Should I give up?

152
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,640
 

153
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,100
What a shame! Man

154
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
You’ve come this far.

155
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,740
Why didn’t you return it yourself?

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,760
Excuse me.

157
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,720
Is this your pen?

158
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,140
You must have dropped it.

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,960
It’s easier said than done

160
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,980
If he knew the truth, he might hate me.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,500
It might be better to not knowing each other and let things carry on like this

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Man.

163
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Don’t forget my concert ticket

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,580
Can you wear my jersey…

165
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,380
and come cheer for me when I play?

166
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,240
If you come wearing that jersey and football shorts,

167
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,340
It will give me the ultimate power to beat Engineering

168
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,300
Something just comes up with family.

169
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,100
I don’t think I can study with you guys

170
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,620
You all can still use my place to study with Wan.

171
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,360
I will leave the key at the lobby.

172
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,200
You can’t!

173
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,520
We chose your place just for you to spend special time with Wan

174
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,580
We are all at the football field.

175
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,980
What?

176
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,020
We don’t want to bother you.

177
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,700
Go get your prey, Tiger.

178
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,020
Have fun

179
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,640
When is the next game?

180
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,200
Why are you asking?

181
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
You can’t come cheering anyway

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,780
Hey!

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,140
Was it you who just messed with my friend?
