1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,825
 

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,655
 

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,160
 

6
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,960
The one you were talking to is my brother.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,000
My friend was just teasing and messing around.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,600
Really.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,840
I am sorry about that.

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,880
Bye.

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,360
Who is your friend?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,420
Come on

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,360
My brother is vicious

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,360
I will tell him when he is in a good mood

15
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,960
But right now…

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,200
just say sorry to him first

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,420
Otherwise, it won’t end well.

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,660
Please

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,500
[I am sorry.]

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,660
Here.

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Have a look.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,540
Are you happy now, my friend Tine?

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,000
Don’t be sulky

24
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,160
He can’t know we’re together

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
I am just a friend when your brother is around.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,780
How about in reality? What am I?

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,200
My boyfriend.

28
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,120
If I am your boyfriend,

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,340
Tonight, can I…?

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,360
Damn it!

31
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,660
Say yes to that or I continue pouting.

32
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,660
Yes or no?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,160
No?

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,180
Hey!

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,820
 

36
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:42,415
 

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
 

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,620
Can I help you?

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,880
Who are you?

40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,700
I am Tine’s brother

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,800
Where is he?

42
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,940
P’Type, why didn’t you tell you would come?

43
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
Thanks.

44
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,240
This is Sarawat.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,340
The one I was telling you about.

46
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,600
Sarawat.

47
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,520
Sawasdee Krub.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,200
The one bugging me on IG.

49
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,420
Sorry about that.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,620
I know all of Tine’s friends.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,240
But your name never came up before

52
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,440
What are you to him?

53
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,540
Why did Tine move in with you?

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,280
Tine told me to say we are friends.

55
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,540
Tine told you to say you are friends?

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,140
And if he didn’t tell you to, what would you say?

57
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
We are…

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,160
…friends.

59
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,020
Do you have something to do around here?

60
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,280
No.

61
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,560
I thought I would stay with you for a week.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,960
What?

63
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,019
Why so surprised?

64
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,399
Stay here?

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,059
Yes.

66
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,320
I have an internship program nearby for weeks

67
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,060
Not just that,

68
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,980
I am here to keep an eye on you and see if you are unruly

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Of course not.

70
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,000
I can take good care of myself

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,100
What’s this?

72
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,880
There was a booth giving out condoms for free in the University.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,300
They gave out a bouquet?

74
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,360
Right.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,120
A bouquet.

76
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,940
What are you doing?

77
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,840
I don’t like to get close to people

78
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,900
Move!

79
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,440
Tell your friend to stay only on that side

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,980
He can’t cross!

81
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,260
Let’s go find something to eat.

82
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,900
You stay here.

83
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,740
Got it?

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
Hey!

85
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,700
Sarawat.

86
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,340
 

87
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Aren’t you coming?

88
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Tine!

89
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,600
Stay here.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can take a detour

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,240
Use a roundabout way.

92
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,200
 

93
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,040
There are so many places to have an event.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,940
Why the shop I’m working?

95
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,140
I didn’t choose this place

96
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,500
The girls requested because they wanted to see you.

97
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,780
By the way…

98
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,760
is your boy, Phukong, coming tonight?

99
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
No.

100
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,140
He’s not coming?

101
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,480
No, he is not my boy

102
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,500
I don’t want to hear this name again.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,220
There you are.

104
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,200
We were just talking about how to get revenge on Sarawat.

105
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,580
How about tomorrow?

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,660
If you see him, just send out the message.

107
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,960
Didn’t you get enough already?

108
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,720
Why?

109
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,620
You hate him just like we do.

110
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,800
I don’t like him, but I never outnumbered anyone like a bunch of thugs.

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,420
- One on one on the football field is your way then?
- What is your problem?

112
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,520
I told you I didn’t mean for it to happen.

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,300
Do you want to see when I mean to do things?

114
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I know you didn’t mean to.

115
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,420
Just chill, man.

116
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,080
We were just joking.

117
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,480
We are not doing anything to him. Okay?

118
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,140
 

119
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:00,555
 

120
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,300
 

121
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,480
This is for you, brother.

122
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
Thanks.

123
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,220
But this is green curry, Sarawat’s favorite

124
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,060
I can have this plain soup instead.

125
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Tine.

126
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,700
Since when do you like to wear a bracelet?

127
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,680
It’s fashion

128
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,400
It’s trending in our University

129
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,440
And do you need to wear couple bracelets?

130
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,360
The Music Club had them made for members

131
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,020
Everybody in the club wears it.

132
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
This is so good.

133
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,100
Delicious.

134
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,320
Where are you sleeping? I have only one bed here

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,000
I will sleep on the bed with you

136
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,020
With me?

137
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,660
 

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,300
I guess your friend can sleep on the couch

139
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,840
I can

140
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
 

141
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
Can you sleep?

142
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
 

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,720
I can’t sleep…

144
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,080
without you next to me.

145
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Come here.

146
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,620
You are going to wake my brother.

147
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,900
He’s in deep sleep.

148
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,480
An earthquake won’t wake him

149
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,840
Tine.

150
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,120
Sleep with me on the couch.

151
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,760
Please.

152
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,100
You can go back in the morning

153
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
What if he wakes up?

154
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,280
He won’t.

155
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,860
Look at him. He won’t wake even though there’s a fire

156
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,920
Sleep here with me.

157
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
How am I going to sleep here?

158
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
 

159
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,700
I will make myself as small as possible.

160
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,220
You have space here.

161
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,960
It’s all yours

162
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,440
Don’t afraid you will fall because I’m going to hug you like this all night.

163
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,780
Here. Let me share the pillow

164
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,760
Goodnight.

165
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,600
Goodnight.

166
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,520
Yeah! That’s 1-0.

167
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
Here. Let me get you a drink.

168
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
What’s the matter, Tine?

169
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,700
Why are you following me?

170
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,940
What have I done wrong?
