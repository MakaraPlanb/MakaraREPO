1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,855
 

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,375
 

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,520
 

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,020
Why do you want to come here?

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,880
I can’t come to see you tomorrow

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,200
Just take it as a big rehearsal.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,580
- Play?
- Yes.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,800
Go up on stage.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
I’ll be your audience.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,280
Come on.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,880
If you can’t perform for one audience, you can’t perform in front of a bunch of people tomorrow.

14
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,320
Why are you fidgeting?

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,020
I don’t know

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,300
Being up here makes me nervous.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,380
What are you doing?

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,580
Filming you.

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,880
Imagine yourself as a protagonist in a movie

20
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,880
You are a well-trained guitar player.

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,320
It’s a scene where you’re about to perform in front of many people.

22
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,000
They are screaming and cheering for you.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,320
You are so great.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,700
It’s the ending scene of the movie

25
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,180
A happy ending, you know?

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,160
The ending scene?

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,480
Yes. A happy ending.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,040
That makes me even more nervous.

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Well. It’s not a big movie

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,860
It’s just a short film.

31
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,880
Only a small project for your class.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
A short film for class?

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,960
It still makes me nervous.

34
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,640
I can’t.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,259
Let’s say it’s just a video clip, not a film.

36
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,360
A video clip that only I can see.

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,520
Only you?

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,160
Yes.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,000
You sure?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,860
Yes

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,720
Fine then.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,160
3 2 1.

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,180
Action!

44
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,520
What?

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,140
Action?

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,720
I mean…

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,980
You can play now

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,260
You can start now.

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,280
Now?

50
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,140
Yes.

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,320
Should I play now?

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Action!

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,100
- Now?
- Yes.

54
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,240
Action!

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Tine!

56
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,460
Are you okay?

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,320
 

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,240
What are you guys doing here?

59
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,820
We’re bringing snacks for Sarawat.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,080
He is not here.

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Is he still in recovery?

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Yes.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,880
But…

64
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,420
If you leave them here, I promise Sarawat will get them

65
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,060
Each one of them.

66
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,640
Leave them here.

67
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,860
Are you ready, Tine?

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,580
The event will commence soon.

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,220
I am

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,980
Just leave for now.

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,000
Come back again when I’m done greeting.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,020
Okay?

73
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,760
Yes.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,820
Tine, keep fighting.

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,700
We are rooting for you here

76
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,100
Come back later.

77
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,480
Welcome everyone to our Music Club shows

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,700
Our club members will perform acoustic songs for you

79
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,020
If you’re ready, let’s welcome the first show on stage

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,340
Go kill.

81
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,640
Hi guys.

82
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,960
My name is Tine…

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,120
Tine, Mr.Chic!

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,040
Let’s cheer for him!

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,960
Hi guys!

86
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,060
I am Tine, Mr.Chic.

87
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,160
The one and only

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,320
I’m going to play you a song.

89
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,380
Some of you might not know this song.

90
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,920
But I have practiced very hard for this

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,580

Tine, just say yes and be his boyfriend.

120
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,720
My friend here is too chicken to ask you himself

121
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,300
That’s why I’m doing it for him.

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,380
Just ask him already.

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,620
If you don’t, I will freaking hit on him myself.

124
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
Tine.

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
I am so done flirting.

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,920
Will you be my boyfriend?

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,100
Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,200
Sarawat asking you to be his boyfriend in the middle of the show,

129
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,240
was it real or just another show?

130
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,520
This room is way better than my dorm.

131
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,960
Whose room is this anyway?

132
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,000
I think it can be our room.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
Move in with me?

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,059
No Man!

135
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:34,219
You are a gentleman.

136
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,920
Is your boy, Phukong, coming tonight?

137
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,840
We haven’t talked about you making me jealous yet.

138
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,799
If you’re mad, you can punish me all night right here.

139
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,060
Come on.

140
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,755
