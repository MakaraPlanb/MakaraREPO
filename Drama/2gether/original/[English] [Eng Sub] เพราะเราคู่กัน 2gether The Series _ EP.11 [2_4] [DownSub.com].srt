1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,825
 

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,655
 

5
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,135
 

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,085
 

7
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,440
 

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,200
You aren’t wearing the bracelet?

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,340
What?

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,280
It was here a second ago.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,720
Did you just bury it with the tree?

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,740
 

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,640
Are you sure you wore it here?

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,480
Where is it?

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,760
 

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,520
Just leave it.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,260
I can make you a new one.

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,300
But I want the old one

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,840
I am sorry.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,080
 

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,020
Don’t worry.

23
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,820
It’s just a bracelet.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,180
Give me your hands.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,300
 

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,540
Is it too much if I say bad things have been happening to us lately?

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,660
It’s nothing.

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,420
It’s going to be OK.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Ok?

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,580
We can look again

31
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,180
It might be near.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you sure you didn’t forget it in a bathroom?

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,480
I am

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,720
P’Dim, have you seen a bracelet around here?

35
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,600
What does it look like?

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,060
No. Where did you last see it?

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,000
Don’t know.

38
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,320
Have you guys seen a bracelet like this?

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,440
No.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,580
May I sit here and read with you?

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,740
You read Sunset at Chaophraya. Really?

42
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,160
Why so surprised?

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
I am in love

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,500
I want someone in my life.

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,120
Are you interested?

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Can I have some?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
Where are you going?

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,540
I am turning in my report

49
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,240
But the Wi-Fi inside is weak.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,600
I am stepping outside.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,960
I am not going anywhere.

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,400
I am charging my phone right here

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,060
Watch it.

54
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,000
I’ll wait for you here.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,000
What are you doing?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,440
I’m getting my phone back.

57
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,980
I left it with the guy sitting right here

58
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,680
That is my friend’s phone

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,440
I am sorry.

60
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,880
I am going to get back at you, P’Type.

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,740
With the help from you all and the volunteers from different clubs

62
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,420
our tree planting activity is now beautifully completed

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,180
Give yourself a big hand!

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,180
Wait!

65
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,480
We still have lots of fun activities for you to join.

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,780
And now we are going to test your bravery.

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,720
You will go into the woods in pairs,

68
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,620
light your candles and pray to the pine tree spirit.

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,340
I’m telling you. The pine tree spirit is a holy and very haunted figure

70
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,700
Super haunted.

71
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,440
A senior from our U went to pray with his lover

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,760
Their candles couldn’t catch the fire.

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
The two of them broke up in the woods immediately.

74
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,780
What? You guys don’t believe me?

75
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
No?

76
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,320
Let me tell you. That senior is me.

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,540
And who did you go with?

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,200
That was a long time ago.

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,620
It wasn’t me.

80
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,040
Green, drop it!

81
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,920
The story isn’t over.

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,920
Can you guess what happened after I came back?

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,200
The pine tree spirit was angry that I didn’t light the candle and pray

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,940
He haunted me in my dreams saying I needed to come back here and complete the ritual

85
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,720
I couldn’t take it anymore.

86
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 

87
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:08,295
 

88
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
 

89
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
I couldn’t sleep.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I had to have the pine tree tattooed on my back to make amend

91
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,740
After that, he left me alone.

92
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,640
If you don’t want to have the same fate as me,

93
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,780
try your best to light your candles

94
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,240
To be fair,

95
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,340
you guys will draw numbers.

96
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,180
Any two of you who get the same number will go together

97
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,880
Sarawat, you first

98
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,780
Same number only.

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
Tine, come on out.

100
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,260
I’ll open it for you.

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,100
What number?

102
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,360
 

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,840
Here. It’s yours

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 

105
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
You got number 9.

106
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,260
Nine?

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,260
 

108
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,180
Mine is 9 too.

109
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,120
Hey!

110
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,140
How is it possible?

111
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,740
There are many people here.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,320
Well, I don’t know.

113
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,520
Maybe the spirit wants us together.

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,960
I know you’re plotting a mischievous plan against us tonight.

115
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,300
What do you want?

116
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Tine has been stressed out lately.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,320
Just help me.

118
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,600
It might help if we get to pray to the spirit together.

119
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
 

120
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,900
I got number 9 as well.

121
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,380
A hot coffee for you.

122
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,500
Are you still working?

123
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,160
Can I sit here and read with you?

124
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,800
Do whatever you want.

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,500
Just don’t bother me.

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,120
Loving you is kind of bothering?

127
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Man!

128
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,760
Peekaboo!

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,160
- Are you looking for me?
- What are you doing?

130
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,220
You said not to bother. Isn’t it good?

131
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,420
It will be better if you disappear

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,840
No way.

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,900
I will haunt you every day

134
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,440
I will stick with you no matter what

135
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,500
I can follow you for the rest of my life.

136
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,580
Did you ask me if I want to be followed?

137
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,620
We will see about that

138
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,940
You gotta miss me if I don’t show up one day.

139
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,580
Just back off.

140
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,560
I’m leaving.

141
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,920
Do not follow me.

142
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,140
Give me some time to miss you

143
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,000
Fine. I won’t follow you.

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,220
See you tomorrow

145
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
 

146
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,060
Flat tire?

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,780
You’ve got a flat tire.

148
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,980
Do you have the equipment? I can fix it for you.

149
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,360
No need.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,960
I just found a garage nearby

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,360
That’s pretty bad.

152
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,160
What is with him?

153
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,620
Super flat.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,880
 

155
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,040
 

156
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,940
Where is the equipment?

157
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,380
The door is not locked.

158
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
Here you go.

159
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
 

160
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,320
Hey!

161
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,140
How did you do it?

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,500
You didn’t lock your doors.

163
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,200
You got full equipment inside.

164
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,260
 

165
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I think…

166
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,560
nothing needs to be done here.

167
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,460
Thank you for coming.

168
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Hey!

169
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
Here.

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,200
For me?

171
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Do you see anyone else?

172
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,540
Totally worth it.

173
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
 

174
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,060
Thank you.

175
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
 

176
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,580
Almost done.

177
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,600
Done!

178
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
You’ve got the thing.

179
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,360
 

180
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
This side.

181
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,740
Are you finished?

182
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,340
Just one second.

183
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,160
Why so hurry?

184
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,480
I have my way to decide.

185
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,560
Give me that box.

186
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,580
All of us will draw again

187
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,820
You first.

188
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,900
He was here.

189
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,960
Tine!

190
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,060
Shit! It’s raining.

191
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,400
You go back to the camp…

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,540
Tine!

193
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,860
Tine!
