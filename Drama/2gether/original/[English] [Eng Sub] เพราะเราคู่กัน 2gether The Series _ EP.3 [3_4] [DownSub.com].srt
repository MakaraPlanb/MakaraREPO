1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,195
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,760
You haven’t seen me for days.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,520
Have you missed me?

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,660
You don’t like Cooking Club anymore?

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,900
I like everything that gets me close to you, Tine.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,620
I heard that someone has been bothering you lately

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,380
So I am here to protect and take care of you

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,680
Thanks.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,240
But I can take care of myself.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,400
So you two already know each other?

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,940
That’s great.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,260
Teach Green basic chords.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,420
Can’t it be someone else?

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
Why?

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,040
You guys are friends. Green can pick up quicker.

20
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,000
Teach him 8 basic chords, okay?

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,620
I’m ready. Let’s do it.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,520
Tine, don’t you have a cheerleading rehearsal?

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,420
Seniors said you’re good to go.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,700
Cheerleading rehearsal?

25
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,940
That’s right.

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,540
Thank you for reminding me.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,460
For C chord, your point finger is on the second string.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,800
Thank you.

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,040
My name is Tine.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
I am from the Faculty of Laws

31
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,120
Hurry!

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,220
I have football practice!

33
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,300
I don’t want to be late.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,880
Why did you drag me here so early?

35
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
They are not even here yet.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,980
Or you want to give Green a guitar lesson?

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,980
Fine. I’d rather stay here.

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,800
Can you play a love song from Scrubb?

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,240
I will listen to it and think of Pear.

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,220
I don’t listen to love songs.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,120
No wonder why you are so terrible at flirting

42
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,020
You don’t know anything about love

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Do you think…

44
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,900
a person who has never been in love can write a love song?

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,540
I don’t think so.

46
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,000
Even if he could, it would sound meaningless

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,760
Are you writing a love song?

48
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,340
Something like that.

49
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,180
I get it now.

50
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,540
You agreed to flirt because you wanted some experience to write a song

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,880
Do you think so?

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Am I right?

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,460
I am telling you.

54
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,840
Flirting with me is quite special

55
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,540
Because I am extraordinary!

56
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,880
Right! I said yes because you are special.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,020
Someone has been practicing the flirt

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
 

59
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
 

60
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,260
 

61
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:19,964
 

62
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
 

63
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,640
Do you like it?

64
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,500
I don’t know. I don’t understand it

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,480
You don’t need to understand music.

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,700
You just need to feel it

67
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,260
Feel what?

68
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,260
Feel love.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,820
I just played you a love song

70
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,560
I’m gonna go now

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Take it.

72
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,980
Where are you going?

73
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,120
Football practice.

74
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,480
Hi Tine.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,180
It has been…

76
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,580
…LONG since we last met

77
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,440
I know you missed me

78
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,620
Why are you here?

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,400
It’s Faculty of Laws cheerleading practice

80
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,900
I know seniors in your Faculty so I asked to come and take care of you

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,260
If you want someone to wipe away your sweats or anything at all, just tell me.

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,960
Are you tired?

83
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,100
I know you are.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,360
Let me take care of you. Don’t you worry!

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
Shit!

86
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,500
Please help me.

87
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,920
Green has been following me around like a shadow.

88
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,060
And how can I help you with that?

89
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,700
I’m still in practice

90
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,200
But I don’t want to go back to the cheerleading thing

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,940
Look. He wiped my face every second he nearly peeled my skin off

92
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,300
Please help.

93
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,380
Wait for me near the field

94
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,140
I will take you home after practice.

95
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,160
For real?

96
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,340
You will help me?

97
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,160
Thank you so much.

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
I will give you anything you want in return

99
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,960
Let’s go.

100
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,460
See? They are together again.

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,660
Tine!

102
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,100
You’re here.

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,420
You came to see Sarawat again

104
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,500
Why are you two always together lately?

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,720
Exactly!

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,040
What’s going on between you two?

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,700
Tine was in your room the other day

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:04,340
So the rumor saying Sarawat likes tine is true?

109
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,840
Just say yes first and deal with them later.

110
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,880
Is there anything going on between you guys?

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,140
Green is listening.

112
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,960
Can you ignore your fans for a second?

113
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,280
 

114
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,000
 

115
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,900
Someone ordered that for you. It’s not on our menu

116
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,500
Who ordered a cake for my beloved Tine?

117
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,880
What’s wrong with you?

118
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,120
Do you have to ask?
