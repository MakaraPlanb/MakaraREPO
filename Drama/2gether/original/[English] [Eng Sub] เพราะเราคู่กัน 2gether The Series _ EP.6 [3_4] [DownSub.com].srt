1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,545
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:05,985
 

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:07,925
 

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,340
You don’t believe me?

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,580
Do you want us to kiss and prove?

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,360
That’s enough.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,680
That’s enough

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,240
Fine. I believe you.

11
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,720
I believe that Sarawat really likes Tine

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,700
That was close

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,360
How did you know he was coming?

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
He’s been following you since you’re in the University

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,980
I knew something was happening

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,300
If green didn’t stop you, would you really kiss me?

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,920
Do you really think I would kiss you?

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,160
I said it because I knew Green couldn’t take it.

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,840
Who would kiss you?

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,180
 

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Drink up.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,420
This meal, my treat.

23
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,240
What’s got into you?

24
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,640
I am just bored.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,140
And I haven’t sat down and eaten with all of you for quite some time

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,380
Come on. Drink while they’re still cold.

27
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,800
Since we are all here…

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,700
I have…

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,340
You have something to ask

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,700
How did you know?

32
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,660
Whenever you said it’s your treat, you always need help

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,760
What is your problem this time?

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,120
The thing is…

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,380
I have a friend from Music Club

36
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,860
He is worried and wondering if his friend…

37
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,320
Let’s do this.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,340
Let’s call that guy ‘A.’

39
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,060
He is wondering if A likes me…

40
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,620
No!!

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,700
He is wondering if A likes him. I meant my friend.

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,140
So…

43
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,660
Who is this guy A anyway?

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,660
I can hack into his Facebook account.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,440
Let’s not go to that.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,600
How about this?

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,140
Get him drunk

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,160
I am sure he will confess everything

49
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,600
That method works only for you.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,680
I must be out of my mind asking you guys

51
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,900
I know a way.

52
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,880
Make him jealous.

53
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,100
Why?

54
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,640
No matter how good people are at keeping it inside

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,500
jealousy always shows when they see someone else approaching the ones they like

56
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,360
If your friend wants to know if A likes him, try to make A jealous

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,880
I’m here because I want to get better at time management

58
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,440
Sawasdee Krub.

59
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
I don’t think you need to know my name

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,880
I am here just to look for someone.

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,820
But it doesn’t seem like…

62
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,280
he is here.

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,800
So I’m just gonna go.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,160
Thank you very much.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,480
Don’t give up just yet

66
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,760
There are plenty of seminars for you to look

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,260
He must be at one of them.

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,220
Do you want to hear the event list that I went to?

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,480
I went to all academic seminars,

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,580
both direct and indirect sales meetings, online marketing classes

71
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,840
and leadership camps.

72
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,920
Only Dharma camp that I haven’t been to

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,019
That is old people community

74
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,519
Your darling won’t be there

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,060
Dang it! He’s here.

76
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,700
I gotta go

77
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,660
Sir, may I see your pass, please?

78
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,100
It is with my friend. The one that just went in there

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,440
I’ll go get it for you.

80
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,580
Can you call him to bring it out instead?

81
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,360
Look!

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,800
Sir, you can’t get in.

83
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,920
Please wait outside.

84
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,900
He was just right there.

85
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,420
Wait outside, please.

86
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
 

87
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,640
Wat!

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,320
Are you done practicing?

89
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,660
Do you want to grab something to eat?

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,480
What’s wrong?

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,340
You got plan already?

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,680
No.

93
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,260
You just asked me to eat with you. It’s weird.

94
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,700
Don’t think too much.

95
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,480
Sarawat, my dear friend.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,460
Go out and have a drink with me tonight

97
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,080
Please.

98
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,200
OK.

99
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,880
My band is playing at L Co Hol tonight

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,340
It’s like a big rehearsal for the opening act for Scrubb this Saturday

101
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,900
Meet me there.

102
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,180
We are playing Scrubb songs. You will love it

103
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,600
OK

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,700
See you at L Co Hol

105
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,180
L Co Hol! See you there.

106
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,080
What’s wrong with him?

107
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,320
And why am I taking a detour?

108
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
 

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,640
It’s really you

110
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,240
Do you remember me?

111
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,140
You found my friend’s pen at the seminar last week.

112
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,080
That’s right.

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,220
He is here too. He sat beside me.

114
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,440
He even invited me to an event but I’m not sure I can make it

115
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
What kind of event? Can I join?

116
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,840
Here. He left me a brochure

117
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,740
Meditation retreat for 2 nights?

118
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Exactly! It’s perfect for someone like you

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,140
Perfect for someone like me?

120
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,540
A meditation retreat?

121
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Thank you.

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,720
So when a guy named Sarawat walks in, I need to act like your girlfriend and make him jealous?

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,860
That’s correct.

124
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,260
If you did great, I’ll reward you with extra tips, Nancy

125
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,100
Let’s practice then

126
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,580
Practice?

127
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,360
Babe, where should we go after this?

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,680
Hey!!

129
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,940
This is too much.

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,760
- Too much?
- Make it less obvious.

131
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,180
Do it naturally.

132
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,840
How about this?

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,540
Hi baby. Do you want some snack?

134
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,500
Sarawat is here.

135
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,420
Aww!! He is so hot!

136
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,960
Nuisance, have you been waiting for long?

137
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,160
Not long but I’m leaving.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,260
I have something else to do

139
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,320
Sit!

140
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,720
Sit right here.

141
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,500
I will pay.

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
Watch me play first.

143
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,060
Wait here.

144
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
Nan…

145
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,860
Thanks for absolutely nothing

146
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 

147
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,699
Hi guys.

148
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,980
We’ve prepared a special song for you tonight.

149
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,020
One of our members requested it actually.

150
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,640
He even wants to sing it himself.

151
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,620
Give our guitarist a big hand, guys!

152
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,380
This song…

153
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,820
is for someone so silly who didn’t get to hear it when I played the first time

154
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,280
This song is called Everything.

155
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,140
♪ I will do everything ♫

156
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,900
♪ I will try every possible way ♫

157
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:38,080
♪ I know how it is going to be ♫

158
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,600
♪ It doesn’t matter who you like ♫

159
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,880
♪ Just look at me ♫

160
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,160
♪ That’s it ♫

161
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,960
♪ That’s all it takes to make me happy ♫

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,480
♪ I don’t care who you like ♫

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,020
♪ It doesn’t matter what the reality is ♫

164
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,540
♪ All I know is that you are the one in my heart ♫

165
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,120
Tine, I want to take a picture with Sarawat.

166
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,440
Can you ask him for me?

167
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Please.

168
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,380
Ask him yourself.

169
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,720
Why are you upset?

170
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,800
Are you his boyfriend or something?

171
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,660
No matter how good people are at keeping it inside

172
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,880
jealousy always shows when they see someone else approaching the ones they like.

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,940
I am sorry.

174
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
It’s OK, Tine

175
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,960
You know my name?

176
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,140
A University cheerleader. Of course, I do

177
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,560
Ah! That’s right.

178
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,900
Sorry again about that.

179
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,020
Wait up.

180
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,060
I won’t get mad for bumping me if I get just one selfie with you

181
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
 

182
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,300
 

183
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,180
Thanks.

184
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,300
What the heck is wrong with you?

185
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,280
Why did you take a photo with him?

186
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,660
It’s none of your business.

187
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,200
I didn’t say anything when those girls handed you drinks and hugged you

188
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,240
I didn’t touch their drinks and hug anyone.

189
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,220
Think twice of what you saw.

190
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,500
Yeah?

191
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,760
Tine! What is your problem exactly?

192
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,660
Let go of me

193
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
I won’t!

194
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,820
Unless you tell me.

195
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,080
I am jealous, all right.

196
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,460
You happy now?

197
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,960
I drank a little too much last night.

198
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,840
I watched you play and…

199
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,160
We’ve come to the end of the show.

200
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,940
This song is for everyone here
