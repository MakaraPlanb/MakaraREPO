1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,845
 

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,380
 

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,040
Yes.

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,180
Pam is my first love.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,100
It started out from being friends

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,260
I didn’t tell her anything though.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,480
Why not?

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,760
Maybe…

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,980
I didn’t feel the same way about Pam as I felt about you when I met you at the concert

12
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,020
Maybe you didn’t want to lose the friendship

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,980
and I am just her shadow

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,380
What?

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,260
Who puts this crazy idea into your head?

16
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,980
 

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,380
She and I have many things in common.

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,440
You and her?

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,580
You guys are not alike

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,560
I saw it on her IG.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,940
She likes Blue Hawaii.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,460
She likes coffee and coffee was sold out then. That’s why she ordered a Blue Hawaii

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,440
She likes to play guitar.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,780
She does like guitar.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,060
But you played it because you wanted to get close to me from the beginning.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,820
She likes Scrubb.

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,760
She likes every band.

28
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,380
She went to that concert because Man dragged her there.

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,060
And you are the only one who likes just one band.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,780
More importantly, Pam seems normal.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,600
But you are being paranoid here. Your mind is thinking too much, little buffalo

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,600
Fine.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,820
I am sorry.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,020
I was being silly

35
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,440
Do you know how you and Pam are really different?

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,780
One day, Pam will belong to someone else.

37
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,240
But you…

38
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,900
You belong to me and me only.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
 

40
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,360
You kept me up all night.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Give me back the tears I cried for this.

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,920
You cried?

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,600
 

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,260
How about I make you cry even more right now?

45
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,200
Damn you!

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,840
Always with a dirty mind!

47
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,120
What about your rehearsal?

48
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,760
I sorted it out with Temp and friends

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,960
I want to be with you more.

50
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,760
I am fine.

51
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,840
You can go back to practice. I’ll go with you.

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Are you sure?

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Yes.

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
Good idea.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,500
No. I will carry them.

56
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,840
You have a stomachache. You shouldn’t carry anything heavy.

57
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,900
Are these the chords of the song you wrote?

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,100
It’s Temp’s.

59
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,080
Must have been here by mistake

60
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,800
Let’s go. We don’t want to be late.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Pam, what are you doing here?

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,740
I have a guitar lesson with you, don’t I?

63
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,500
We have lesson tomorrow.

64
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,260
I have to practice all day today

65
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,440
I already came here

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,380
Can I discuss with you a little bit about the song for the test?

67
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,160
You can talk to her first.

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,079
You have half an hour before practice.

69
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,579
I will bring all these to the rehearsal room.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 

71
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,340
Thanks.

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,320
I am so excited

73
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,960
I want to hear the song you wrote for me.

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,640
 

75
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,740
 

76
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:45,825
 

77
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:58,805
 

78
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,020
Is it so hard to write, anyway?

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,600
The lyrics is not completed yet.

81
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,820
I know.

82
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,680
Writing a song is not very easy.

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,420
May I guide you how I want the concept to be in case it helps?

84
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,560
I…

85
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,860
I want a love song that describes two close friends

86
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,760
They are so close

87
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,500
that they take their relationship for granted.

88
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,240
One day, the other friend has a new best friend.

89
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,200
They don’t do what they used to do together anymore.

90
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,180
And it’s when she realizes how much she loves her friend.

91
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,520
She is willing to do anything…

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,200
to get her friend back.

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,700
You are not talking about the song.

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,440
You are talking about us, aren’t you?

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,860
You’re right.

96
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,940
Do you think someone who has never been in love can write a love song?

97
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,440
Are you writing a love song?

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,140
Something like that.

99
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,120
I get it.

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,160
You agreed to help me because you want to have some experience to write a song?

101
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,100
Do you think so?

102
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Am I right?

103
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
 

104
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,340
I am so excited.

105
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,180
I want to hear the song you wrote for me

106
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
 

107
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,145
 

108
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,880
 

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,460
Can we still go back to the way we were?

110
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,760
I love you.

111
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,240
And I know you feel the same way.

112
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,780
Why?!

113
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,500
Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

114
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,820
 

115
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,260
Between Pam and me, it’s not what you think.

116
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,560
Just stop already.

117
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,620
I don’t want to hear whatever you have to say.

118
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,560
You promised to come and see me every day.

119
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,280
I came into my life and now you want to disappear on me?

120
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,600
Why are you here?

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,900
I came to take my guitar back.

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,040
I might be an ass, but I’ve never been mean to the one I love.

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,460
I just want to see you again.

124
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,560
Tine.

125
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,140
I don’t know if you are listening

126
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,960
I want you to know this

127
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,760
 

128
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:23,235
