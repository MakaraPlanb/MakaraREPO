1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,200
 

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,020
 

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,700
- You want to try?
- I…

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,360
Try to get to know each other.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,700
You don’t have to like me very much

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,620
Just keep your heart open for me.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,905
 

11
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:32,900
 

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Good job.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,280
You memorized it?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,260
Great job!

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,060
 

16
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:49,655
 

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
 

18
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,440
P’Chat, my sketch is done

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,760
Let me see.

20
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,600
Very pretty.

21
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,120
P’Chat, mine is done too.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 

23
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,260
Hold it up.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,300
I sent it to Mil

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,720
He replied with a laughing buffalo sticker

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
Find out what it means yourself

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,440
Seriously.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,460
When will P’Mil stop tutoring me online?

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,240
I want to see him in person.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,020
I have no idea.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,680
I am his friend but I barely see him in class

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,960
Where does he usually go then?

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,140
I don’t know.

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,640
He might be courting some girl.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
He usually talks about Nong

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,860
What’s the name?

37
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,020
But I think…

38
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,060
he is playing football.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,220
Sometimes I walk past a football field at midnight

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,560
I still see him playing and gambling with his Engineering friends

41
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,920
If you say so

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,460
I think we need to bet a little

43
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,060
I bet 100 baht. He’s courting a girl.

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,300
I bet 100 baht.

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,360
He is playing football.

46
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,660
 

47
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,865
 

48
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:38,095
 

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
 

50
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
I was taking a shower

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,520
Why did you leave without telling me?

53
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,380
I got something urgent to do.

54
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Tine.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,340
Just tell me what is wrong

56
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,540
I just learned that…

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,920
P’Dim and Green are boyfriends.

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,000
They fought but got back together

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
So…

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
the fake flirting can end here.

61
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,000
From now on, you can stop wasting your energy to hit on me

62
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
You can stop calling me

63
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,980
You can stop seeing me.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,760
And stop talking to me

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,520
You can have your freedom back

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
just like before we knew each other

67
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,120
Is that what you really want?

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,080
Yes.

69
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,280
Spend your time looking for someone perfect for you

70
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,140
I get it

71
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,220
Wait.

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,760
Your guitar,

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,100
take it back.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,060
I will buy a new one

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,920
You keep it.

76
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,980
It’s been yours since day one.

77
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Hello, professor.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,660
P’Mil!

79
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
You.

80
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,960
Yeah! Woohoo!

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
Stop the time.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,440
This kid interrupted the game.

83
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,740
Start over.

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,960
If you lose, you lose, man

85
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,860
What the heck are you doing here?

86
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,200
You said you would be my tutor

87
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,160
You never showed your face.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Mil.

89
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you gonna play or not?

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,280
If you aren’t, we will go celebrate.

91
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,000
Sure I am.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,880
I am going to empty your pockets.

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,960
Wait!

94
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,980
What about the tutoring?

95
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,700
You want me to tutor you that bad?

96
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,940
You sketch this football court and turn it in.

97
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,420
We done here?

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,360
Let’s continue.

99
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,480
Pass it to me.

100
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
Are you OK, man?

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,180
Do you have a substitute?

102
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,360
Phukong, over here

103
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,740
 

104
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,320
Thanks.

105
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,800
Laters, guys!

106
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,420
Let’s do it again some time

107
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,000
You are a super-sub.

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
Want some water?

109
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,400
Here!

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,140
I was just kidding

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,760
Cheers!

112
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,100
To my freedom.

113
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,700
Now that Green is out of the picture, you can flirt with girls all you want

114
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,380
Where should we start?

115
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,580
Did you forget something?

116
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,740
Tine has Music Club today.

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,300
So what?

118
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,180
Green stops bothering me. I don’t have to go to the club to meet Sarawat anymore

119
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,820
Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to do, just tell us

120
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,680
We will be at your service

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,740
 

122
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,300
I hadn’t felt freedom like this for a long time

123
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,980
What should we do first?

124
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,720
I have no idea

125
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,760
If you can’t think of one, we have a solution for you.

126
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,800
Clear the table.

127
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,960
What are you doing?

128
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,340
Ohm, go get cardboard.

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,480
Get rid of the plates.

130
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,559
Selfie with the girls nearest to you!

131
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,780
Excuse me.

132
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,440
Can we take selfies with you two, please?

133
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,280
It’s part of the game.

134
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,980
 

135
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,595
 

136
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,660
 

137
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,640
Can we get closer?

138
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:00,665
 

139
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
 

140
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,680
Wait for me.

141
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,220
Get down, please. I can’t see you guys.

142
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,200
 

143
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,000
Go check out hot Faculty cheerleaders!

144
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,140
 

145
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:49,745
 

146
00:09:52,205 --> 00:09:53,205
 

147
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:56,675
 

148
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:57,905
 

149
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,225
 

150
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,300
 

151
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,940
Party with girls all night long!

152
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,160
 

153
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,660
 

154
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,680
Cheers!

155
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,040
 

156
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,785
 

157
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
 

158
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,120
Wat!

159
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,400
Look again.

160
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,200
Cheers!

161
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,800
 

162
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,740
She is so cute.

163
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,060
 

164
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,340
 

165
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,180
Bottoms up!

166
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,120
Drink up

167
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,420
 

168
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
 

169
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720

Don’t ever hit on anyone.

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,540
 

176
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:49,905

178
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,140
Sorry to bother.

179
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,760
My air-con doesn’t work.

180
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,420
Sure.

181
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,540
Make yourself at home.

182
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
What’s wrong with the air-con anyway?

183
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,000
I don’t know.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,540
It wasn’t cooling.

185
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,020
When was the last time you had someone cleaned it?

186
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,100
I don’t know

187
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,760
I’m sleepy. I’m gonna go to bed.

188
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,860
Hey! Sarawat posted a picture of you holding on to his shoulder at Scrubb concert

189
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,480
I don’t care what picture he posts.

190
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,720
You don’t have to tell me

191
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,900
Hey!

192
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,660
He posted another one.

193
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,220
This one…you have to see it.

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,860
I don’t give a sh*t!

195
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,580
His posts don’t concern me anymore

196
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,920
But it’s a picture of Scrubb concert last year at the University.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,940
What?

198
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,800
Why didn’t he tell me he was there too?

199
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,820
 

200
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,520
Have you seen Sarawat?

201
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,360
Sarawat?

202
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,600
Why are you still here so late?

203
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,820
I am about to leave

204
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,640
Wait.

205
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,920
Can I take you home?

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,960
I can take him home

207
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,600
Stay away
