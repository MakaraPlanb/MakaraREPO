18
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:05,680
What is wrong, Tine?

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,260
I am jealous, all right.

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,760
You happy now?

21
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,900
If we want to know if someone likes us, we need to make that person jealous?

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,080
That’s right.

23
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,560
But love is not easy to prove like in dramas

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
It’s a lot more complicated than that.

25
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:27,000
Sometimes you need to take it slow and let time tell you

26
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,835
 

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
 

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,220
Sarawat.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,940
Let’s go. Everyone is ready.

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,740
 

35
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,660
Can I still get their autographs?

36
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,140
Too damn late.

37
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,960
My show was over like 10 years ago.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
I drank a little too much last night.

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,260
I can’t remember anything

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,320
Oh! I remember one thing

41
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,640
I was watching you played live and then woke up in my room

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,060
Forget it.

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,360
You can still make it to the concert though.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,600
Do you want to go?

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,920
Don’t ask.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,180
We have come to the end of the show

47
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,020
This last song is for everyone here.

48
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,920
Deep.

49
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,280

This song…

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:28,420

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,760
So you get to see P’Ball and P’Muei (Scrubb) backstage, right?

I’m super stiff.

121
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,660

122
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,140
Who would scream for you?

123
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,840
They do it for Scrubb.

124
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,680

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,340
Of course I know

130
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,820
I was here watching their concert last year

131
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,820
I got the same feeling.

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,680

I’ll call and discuss the music video tonight.

147
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,380
Why are you asking?

148
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,540

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,840
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

150
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,740
Why did you leave without telling me?
