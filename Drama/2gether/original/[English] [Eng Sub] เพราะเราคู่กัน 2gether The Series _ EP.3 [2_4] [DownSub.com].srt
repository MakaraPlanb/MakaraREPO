1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,220
 

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,560
On one condition.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,720
What is it?

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,260
Go to my place.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,240
Go get the guitar at my place.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Okay.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,760
Come in.

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Come in

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,780
Are you sure this is not a haunted house?

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,880
It is a ghost right there.

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,260
Shit! Don’t say that!

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,860
I was just kidding.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,440
You have me here. It’s nothing to be afraid of

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,340
Right! You’re the one who likes to tease me the most

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,500
Is that the guitar?

17
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,500
I’ll grab it and go.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,420
Give it here.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,240
What?

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,620
It needs to be tuned first.

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,760
It does?

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,240
Or do you want to do it yourself?

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,960
Of course, you can’t.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,640
What song will you record and send to P’Dim?

25
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,580
Don’t know yet.

26
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,500
How about Close by Scrubb?

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,140
I love this song.

28
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,940
You listen to Scrubb’s songs?

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,180
Yeah. Why?

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,980
Scrubb is my favorite band.

31
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,300
My brother put their music on all the time when I was a kid.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,660
You only listen to Scrubb or what?

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,020
No.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,360
I listen to other bands too but they just aren’t like Scrubb

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
How?

36
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,400
If you listen to Scrubb’s songs when you are happy, you will be even happier.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,420
If you listen when you are in love, you will be more deeply in love.

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,540
What if I feel sad? Will I be more miserable listening to their songs?

39
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,820
No.

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,600
If you listen to their songs when you are sad, you will feel better.

41
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,260
It’s like someone is comforting you.

42
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,100
What about you?

43
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,920
What bands do you like?

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,060
Me?

45
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,900
I bet you don’t know them.

46
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,740
Don’t underestimate me.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,720
I know every band in Thailand

48
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,220
Just say the name

49
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,620
Desktop Error.

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,780
Are you talking about a band or a computer?

51
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,140
Harmonica Sunrise.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,920
The Connect.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,400
Moving and Cut.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,740
Name Thai bands.

55
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,740
These are all Thai bands

56
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,220
You should listen to other bands too.

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,240
Sorry.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
I will

59
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,420
But for now, play Close for me.

60
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,640
What are these?

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
The chords of the song you want me to play

62
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,180
Does it look easy?

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Are you done tuning?

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,420
Tuning? All I did was talking to you.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,680
I haven’t even started.

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,880
Can I borrow that one to record then?

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Thanks.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,460
Will it be done by tonight?

69
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,720
Hold on.

70
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,580
Can it see my face?

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,220
Your face, not mine.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Yeah?

73
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,320
I will start now

74
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,160
Don’t tell me. Tell the camera.

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,980
Hi guys. I am Tine, Mr.Chic

76
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,800
I am just the cutest thing!

77
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:10,060
I am going to play basic chords. Let’s start with C

78
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Wrong.

79
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Don’t interrupt me. I am recording here.

80
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
But it was wrong

81
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,460
P’Dim won’t let you pass

82
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,360
It didn’t sound wrong to me.

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,380
I’m playing C chord. See?

84
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,260
Here.

85
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,700
Your ring finger has to be here

86
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,540
What you just did was F major 7.

87
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,740
Now play it.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,560
This is C chord.

89
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,880
Remember it.

90
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
Thanks.

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,740
So this is C chord, guys.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,500
I am recording here.

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,460
Why are you tuning now?

94
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,580
Why didn’t you do it earlier?

95
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,340
Do you want it or not?

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,940
Wait until I finish.

97
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,880
Be quiet.

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,640
Thank you

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,480
 

100
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,220
Tune it now.

101
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,740
Where is my drink?

102
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Hold on. I only have two hands.

103
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
Wait!

104
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
How did you know I like this drink?

105
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,460
Of course I know.

106
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,900
I am a member of #TeamSarawatsWives…

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
You joined that group too?

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,940
Do you want to be my wife?

109
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,700
I joined in just to get your info

110
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,620
You done tuning?

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
Done.

112
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Wait.

113
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,200
I will use this one to record.

114
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,440
Sit down.

115
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,980
I’ve waited for hours.

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,540
A bit more waiting won’t kill me.

117
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
Hey!

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,840
You said you didn’t want to play this song

119
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,980
♪ It was too close to say anything. ♫

120
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,700
♪ It was too close to see anyone else. ♫

121
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:41,780
♪ It was so close that I almost lost my breath. ♫

122
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:51,820
♪ And we are here today because of that closeness. ♫

123
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,880
♪ Maybe you just met me by chance. ♫

124
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,200
♪ Maybe we were in the same place by chance. ♫

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,700
♪ Because you had never experienced that feeling. ♫

126
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,520
♪ And I had never experienced it either. ♫

127
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:14,740
♪ If we had not started our first conversation that day, ♫

128
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,660
♪ we wouldn’t have known the feeling today. ♫

129
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,340
♪ Because neither of us knew what it was like. ♫

130
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,120
♪ So we had no reason to stop. ♫

131
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,020
Why are you smiling?

132
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,080
That was…nice.

133
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,020
I am done recording

134
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,120
You can go.

135
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Thanks for the snacks.

136
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,960
Once I got new strings, I’ll return your guitar

137
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,840
Wait.

138
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,220
Let’s suppose that I’m flirting with you.

139
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,340
What should I say when I take you home like this?

140
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,700
Goodnight, I think.

141
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,380
Why do you ask?

142
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,600
Nothing.

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,680
Just asking.

144
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,500
Don’t worry.

145
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,420
You will never have to take me home in front of Green

146
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,220
Bye now.

147
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,700
See you later

148
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,220
Get home safe.

149
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,340
Goodnight, Tine

150
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,500
Sarawat, you took Tine home?

151
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,820
What did you say?

152
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,920
Tine, come here.

153
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,820
What did I do wrong now?

154
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,660
So wrong. Look.

155
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,660
After your club president posted this video, everyone went crazy.

156
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,200
People were wondering why you were with Sarawat in his room

157
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,480
He doesn’t even allow his own friends inside

158
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,600
#TeamSarawatsWives must have set the price for my head by now

159
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,740
Calm down.

160
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,520
Look on the bright side, at least Green stops bothering you

161
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,260
Did he come to see you this morning?

162
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,480
You are right.

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,040
Sarawat is very helpful.

164
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,640
We have a reason to celebrate. How about this evening?

165
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,140
This evening?

166
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
I am not available.

167
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,340
It’s the first day of cheerleading rehearsal

168
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,240
I don’t really want to go.

169
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,040
Don’t lie to us

170
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,200
We know you want to hit on cute cheerleaders, right?

171
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Nah!

172
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,340
I only do this for our Faculty. You guys know that

173
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,940
Ready!

174
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,960
Ready!

175
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,400
3 4!

176
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,860
I should have gone with them

177
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,300
Don’t lower your arms.

178
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,580
Keep them up.

179
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,700
[#TeamSarawatsWives]

180
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,400
Faculty cheerleaders are Faculty representatives

181
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,080
If you are not up for it, you can go home.

182
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,200
Break for 15 minutes.

183
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,920
Sarawat, what brings you to the Faculty of Laws?

184
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,480
I came to see Tine

185
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,000
We practice too hard.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,540
I needed an excuse to slack off.

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
What practice?

188
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,520
Football.

189
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,540
Football?

190
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,580
You are a football player?

191
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
Someone like you can be a cheerleader.

192
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,940
Tine, can I talk to you for a second?

193
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,880
We are borrowing him just for a while, Sarawat.

194
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
Tine.

195
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,500
You know Sarawat?

196
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,500
Kind of.

197
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,320
We are in the same club.

198
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,260
Can you ask him a few questions for us?

199
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,660
A group of seniors wants to know something about you.

200
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,600
What?

201
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,660
What do you like between Rock and Jazz music?

202
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,800
Jazz.

203
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,040
Movie or drama?

204
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,020
Drama.

205
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,720
Especially soap operas

206
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,520
Music or painting?

207
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,460
Painting.

208
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,680
That’s it!

209
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,000
You lie.

210
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,840
I know you will choose music for sure

211
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,480
I answered what I hate.

212
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,060
I asked what you ‘like.’

213
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,860
They want to know you so they can serve you right

214
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,400
You’re such a jerk.

215
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,920
Can you choose between me and soap operas then?

216
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,940
I choose you.

217
00:14:59,060 --> 00:14:59,960
What?

218
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,500
You hate me more than soap opera?

219
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,760
For that question, I answered what I like

220
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Bye now.

221
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,640
Football practice is waiting.

222
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,180
Tine, did you get the answer?

223
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,200
What’s wrong?

224
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,160
Didn’t you get enough sleep?

225
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,380
This case is super heavy.

226
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,540
And just a moment ago, a house lizard cried when I walked by

227
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,400
A bad thing must be happening to me.

228
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,760
You’re overthinking it.

229
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,700
Green gets off your back already, doesn’t he?

230
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,560
That’s right but I still feel weird.

231
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,640
I am sure a bad thing is going to happen.

232
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,860
People in guitar class, I have good news for you

233
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,440
Many people in our club moved out so we recruited new members.

234
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,420
That’s it.

235
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,080
Do you think it’s Green?

236
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Not Green.

237
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,240
Hi guys. My name is Earn. I’m from the Faculty of Architecture

238
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,080
I have performed in a band a few times

239
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,640
Hi guys. I am Pear from the Faculty of Medicine.

240
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:48,860
I am a beginner. It would be so kind if you guys could teach me

241
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
Maybe it wasn’t a house lizard this morning.

242
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,640
It was cupid.

243
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,599
Nonsense.

244
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,159
But we have three more members.

245
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,800
Where is your friend?

246
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,920
I am here

247
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 

248
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,560
So the rumor saying Sarawat likes Tine is true?

249
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,280
Help me.

250
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,660
Green has been following me for hours.
