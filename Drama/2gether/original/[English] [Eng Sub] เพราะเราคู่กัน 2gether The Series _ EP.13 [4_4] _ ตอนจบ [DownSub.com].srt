1
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:28,955
Actually…

2
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,420
It should be your song as promised, Pam

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,560
But I can’t write one for you anyway.

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,280
I tried.

5
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,340
No matter how hard I tried,

6
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,800
the lyrics wouldn’t come out.

7
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,900
I don’t know why.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,900
All I know is that...

9
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,900
the only one I want to write a song for is Tine.

10
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,840
Though he doesn’t want to hear it anymore.

11
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,305
Thanks, guys.

12
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,240
Here comes the last song from us.

13
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,360
I’m gonna let someone perfect for the song

14
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,760
take over my job.

15
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Tine.

16
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,060
I don’t know if you are listening.

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,960
I want you to know this.

18
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,200
Ever since I knew you,

19
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,600
this song has been stuck in my head.

20
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,300
Sometimes it sounds nice.

21
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,915
Sometimes it sounds weird.

22
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,440
But the song really makes me happy.

23
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,000
You know?

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,860
I never confessed to Pam,

25
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,540
because I just knew what love is when I met you.

26
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,160
This song is called ‘Tine.’

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,380
Give him support, guys!

Please.

42
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Tine, get up.

43
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,900
I’ll take you home.

44
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,280
Face up.

45
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,660
Turn this way.

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,520
Hold on to me so you won’t fall.

47
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,700
What are you doing?

48
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,180
I’m afraid you would fall.

49
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,300
What the heck are you doing?

50
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I said I would flirt with you.

51
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
I will flirt

52
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:12,145
until you agree to be my boyfriend.

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will do it now.

54
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,820
Sorry.

55
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,560
Just a bit more.

56
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,900
No one has ever plastered me before in my life.

57
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,320
And do you think I have done this for anyone?

58
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,380
Don’t afraid you will fall

59
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,620
because I’m going to hug you like this all night.

60
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,820
Okay?

61
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,800
Here. Let me share the pillow.

62
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,080
I will find you a fan or something.

63
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,120
Ouch!

64
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,420
Hey!

65
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,520
Your leg!

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,180
I am fine.

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,160
Don’t worry about me.

68
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,960
Worry about yourself.

69
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
I am OK.

70
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,940
Are you alright?

71
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,900
Come on.

72
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,820
Get up.

73
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,860
I am not so sure

74
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,320
you can take care of my little brother.

75
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,260
I won’t ask you to believe me, but I will show you.

76
00:07:24,605 --> 00:07:27,935
Who said I hit on him just to get rid of you?

77
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:29,825
I did it because I genuinely like Tine.

78
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,740
Just so you know.

79
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,720
The only one I’ve always had feelings for…

80
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,680
…is you, Tine.

81
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,580
I like you.

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,880
I’ve liked you since the second I saw you.

83
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,060
Do you really think we will last 10 years?

84
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,180
I want to be with you more than that.

85
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
For me…

86
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,680
Tine is a living thing…

87
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,860
that I want to call ‘nuisance’ for the rest of my life.

88
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,400
I just want to be with you.

89
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,040
If it is our movie, you can choose…

90
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,340
whether...

91
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:16,025
you want it to end

92
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,820
with tragedy

93
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,080
Or end with happiness.

94
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
What do you say?

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,600
What will you choose?

96
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,900
Will you trust me again?

97
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,780
I wouldn’t be here if I don’t trust you, would I?

98
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,320
Don’t ever take it off again.

99
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,560
Save your voices for later, guys.

100
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,360
That just made my heart bloom.

101
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,060
Oh yeah!

102
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,780
How are you feeling, Air?

103
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,220
I am so happy right now.

104
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,720
You guys too, right?

105
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,240
It’s time everyone here has waited for.

106
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,480
I have the contest result in my hand.

107
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,880
Which band do you think will win this?

108
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,000
Scream the band you are rooting for, guys.

109
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,380
Come on.

110
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,300
And the winner of 2020 Music Contest goes to…

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,300
To…

112
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,880
The winner is…

Congratulations!

116
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,860
The joy hasn’t ended yet.

117
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,440
We have a big surprise for you.

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,300
We have a special live show

119
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,020
from a special band for everyone in here.

120
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,920
Please welcome Scrubb!

121
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,780
We see each other every year.

122
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,820

Right. Ctrl S.

00:11:04,835 --> 00:11:08,195
This song is for those

126
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,840
who are meant to be together.

♪ I always feel the same ♫

130
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,960
Have you ever wondered

131
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,460
why we are in pairs?

132
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,680
If you love someone, don’t be quiet about it.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,420
Tell that person right away.

134
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,500
Be quiet.

135
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,540
Don’t be quiet about it.

136
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,600
But read it quietly.

137
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,280
The book you gave me is telling me not to.

138
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,600
I told you to be quiet.

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,140
Before I will be quiet,

140
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,280
can I tell you something?

141
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,220
I freaking like you.

142
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,160
I FREAKING LIKE YOU!

143
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,780
That’s enough. I know.

144
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,580
Maybe...

145
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,945
being together kills the loneliness.

146
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,560
and…

147
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,980
…makes us happy.

148
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,800
You lost. Don’t forget to keep the promise.

149
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
You will keep your heart open for me.

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,080
Anyone wants me to sign,

152
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,820
just move to the line right here.

153
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,880
Come one. Don’t be shy.

154
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,120
Come on.

155
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Just come.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,280
Fine.

157
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,300
Hey!

158
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You two!

159
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,800
P’Mil, will you sign this for me, please?

160
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,680
My signature is crap.

161
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:12,315
Can I not sign it?

162
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,720
You can’t?

163
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,680
It is really crappy.

164
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
How about you sign it just for me?

165
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,000
I didn’t fail like the first exam.

166
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,720
For some couple,

167
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,960
being together gives them

168
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,620
challenges and liveliness.

169
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,780

[One Year Later]

174
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,420
our club has many more members

175
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,740
than we’re allowed to.

176
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:05,035
So we are going to have a little test.

177
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,705
If you are beginners, don’t worry.

178
00:14:08,705 --> 00:14:12,160
We had a beginner who practiced for the test

179
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
and passed last year.

180
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,820
Do you want to know how he did it?

181
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,580
Please welcome P’Tine upfront

182
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,380
to share his experience.

183
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,340
Sawasdee Krub.

184
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,460
I couldn’t play any musical instrument.

185
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,540
I even practiced on a guitar app for that test

186
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,320
because I didn’t have a guitar of my own.

187
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,160
I cheated at first,

188
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
but I got caught.

189
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,160
So I had to play it with a little ability I got.

190
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,920
When I was done,

191
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,740
the club president asked me about music.

192
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,920
I couldn’t answer any of them.

193
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,320
What?

194
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,900
How did you pass?

195
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,720
For the last question,

196
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,160
he asked me if I knew anything about music at all.

197
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Back then, I had a friend in this club.

198
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,500
So I said I didn’t know anything about music.

199
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,100
But I knew a friend named Sarawat.

200
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,820
He was the reason I wanted to play guitar.

201
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,000
Do you want to know who Sarawat is?

202
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,920
Please welcome P’Sarawat here

203
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,040
to teach you guys guitar.

204
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,320
Where are you going?

205
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
Come help me.

206
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,780
What do you want me to do?

207
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,980
Be my student.

208
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,820
Pick up the guitar!

209
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Stand here.

210
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,300
Start with the basic chords.

211
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,920
C chord.

212
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Wrong!

213
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,820
The way to place your fingers is wrong.

214
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,660
Wrong!

215
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
Press harder and play.

216
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Wrong!

217
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,420
A year has passed and your fingers are still weak.

218
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,600
Have you been practicing?

219
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Wrong!

220
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,720
Aren’t you embarrassed?

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,900
A member can’t play a basic chord.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,960
Who would trust our club?

223
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,220
Stop teasing him!

224
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,280
Tine is about to cry.

225
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
Guys, don’t be frightened.

226
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,880
P’Sarawat always teases his boyfriend like this.

227
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,580
Oh! You were teasing me?

228
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,060
I pretended to yell

229
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,100
but you really played it wrong.

230
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,800
That’s it.

231
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
Good job.

232
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,639
As for our couple,

233
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,800
I am not so sure what the reason is.

234
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,660
What I know is that when we are together,

235
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,560
we are the couple people are jealous of the most.

236
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:27,665
That’s how we teach.

237
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,100
If you can’t take it, you can withdraw.

238
00:17:35,705 --> 00:17:36,705
It’s still hot.

239
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,440
You don’t have to do it.

240
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Eat more.

241
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
Just stay put.

242
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,020
Let’s go see a movie.

243
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,880
How about we have dinner after the movie?

244
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,160
What is your stomach made of?

245
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,820
Your shirt is so cool.

246
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,440
Man!

247
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Yes!

248
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,600
[Your P’Mil]

249
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,760
Damn it!

250
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,600
Fine.

251
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,200
I surrender.

252
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,540
Don’t!

253
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,280
Look at you.

254
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,700
You’re playing it right. What’s left to teach?

255
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,880
We are done with basic chords.

256
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,300
Let me teach you the harder ones.

257
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,040
Point finger on the fifth string.

258
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,460
This on the second string.

259
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,160
This on the fourth and this on the third.

260
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,120
Ten years from now or even more,

261
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,320
Our couple

262
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,240
will be just you and me.

263
00:19:24,265 --> 00:19:25,855
The Nuisance

264
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,400
and the Handsome Prince.

265
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,000
Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

266
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,780
I am sorry.

267
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,680
Win stepped on it and broke them into pieces.

268
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,220
Did it break when you picked it up?

269
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,320
Definitely into pieces. Win did it!

270
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,020
OK. Let’s start over.

271
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,160
My friend is a gentleman.

272
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,020
Damn you!

273
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,080
I just can’t.

274
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,240
All over my face.

275
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,595
I am sorry.

276
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,215
It’s almost done.

277
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,115
I am so sorry.

278
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,580
Start from the beginning.

279
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,900
‘Your brother is drunk’

280
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,220
Ready?

281
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,400
My friend might be foul-mouthed,

282
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,020
but he is a gentleman.

283
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,020
Action!

284
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,260
Sarawat, take the photo from him

285
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,800
No pocket.

286
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,760
Why did you agree to take a photo with Kao*? (*A cute way to say ‘me/people’)

287
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
What?

288
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,400
Kao my ass!

289
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,180
You’re giving me goosebumps.

290
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,475
What’s the right script?

291
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,260
I meant taking photos with other people.

292
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Come on.

293
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,080
Cover his mouth.

294
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,640
♪ Someone who can make us smile ♫

295
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,760

300
00:21:53,005 --> 00:21:54,705
 

301
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,765
 

302
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,065
 

303
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,585
 

304

309
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:15,585

00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:17,465

315
00:22:28,455 --> 00:22:31,885
 

316
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:33,835
 

317
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,285
 

318
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:50,115
