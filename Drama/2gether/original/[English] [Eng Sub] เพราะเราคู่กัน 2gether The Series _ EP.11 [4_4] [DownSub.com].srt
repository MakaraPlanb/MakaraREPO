1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,845
 

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,375
 

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,540
 

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,340
Is it too much if I say bad things have been happening to us lately?

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,360
It’s nothing.

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,660
It’s going to be OK.

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,160
Ok?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,300
Tine!

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,360
Are you all right?

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Come here.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,600
Get up slowly.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,980
Let me help.

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,220
Does it hurt?

16
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,680
It’s pouring now.

17
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,840
Let's get on the bus.

18
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,100
We will wait until the rain stops

19
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
I am sorry.

20
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,160
It’s just that we have faced many bad things recently.

21
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,000
I just didn’t want it to get worse.

22
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,460
I caused a problem again

23
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,120
Don’t be sad about it.

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,020
The shrine you just set fire to was fake.

25
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,060
P’Dim made it all up just to mess with us.

26
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,160
As for the bad things that happened to us, it might be because of me.

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,020
Why?

28
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,400
I prayed for something.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,740
But I haven’t redeemed that pray yet

30
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,680
What did you ask for?

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
It’s…

32
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,800
If I got to see you again,

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,060
I would show you the video I made.

34
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,800
It’s the song Your Smile you are so curious about.

35
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,920
You won’t find it because I renamed it.

36
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,600
That’s why.

37
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,540
Hello. Test. Test.

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,500
Are you recording, Boss?

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,620
Just hold on.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,220
Do you think he will like it?

41
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,560
Not just like

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,760
He will love it. Trust me

43
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Hi.

44
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,620
I am Sarawat.

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,660
I…

46
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,720
I saw you at the Scrubb concert today.

47
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,980
Your smile makes me want to play this song for you.

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,960
It’s…

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,660
What next?

50
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,720
You forgot the script?

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,500
No more reading. Just play.

52
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,180
 

53
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,980
♪ Just one smile from you ♫

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,040
♪ makes me forget everything ♫

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,480
♪ It makes me realize what is more important ♫

56
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,740
♪ and what is coming to replace everything ♫

57
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,000
♪ Just one sound of you ♫

58
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,280
♪ makes me fly up high to the sky ♫

59
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,760
♪ It’s more than anything I have ever seen ♫

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,860
♪ It’s more than words can describe ♫

61
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:36,400
♪ If I close my eyes now, I see you once again ♫

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:46,820

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,780

♪ It’s not going to be easy anymore ♫

65
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,120
♪ That’s all I ask for ♫

66
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,420
After that, I went to every Scrubb concert…

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,500
just to look for you.

68
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,460
But I didn’t find you

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,360
Man told me to pray to god.

70
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,940
And if I ever saw you again,

71
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,280
I had to show you the video.

72
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,420
That’s the story.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,600
But I was too shy to show it.

74
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,760
I actually have something to say to you.

75
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,160
But it might get stuck in this video forever

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,260
I like you.

77
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
Yeah. I know.

78
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,160
I like you too.

79
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,320
It’s great that you prayed for it.

80
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,420
That made us together today.

81
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,780
The wish only drew us to cross paths again.

82
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,120
Us being together is because of something else.

83
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,980
What then?

84
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,460
Let’s start from my squad who helped me since the day we met again

85
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,360
I was losing my mind.

86
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,640
I found him!

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,460
I found him!

88
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,940
I found him!

89
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
Who?

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,420
The guy I just talked to is the one I like.

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,900
The one I like.

92
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Great!

93
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,900
But I…

95
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,040
I just told him I would kiss till he dropped.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,820
He just emailed me!

97
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,660
His name is Tine.

98
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,700
What a cute name!

99
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,760
Don’t get too carried away.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,040
Give it here.

101
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,480
Your typos will ruin it.

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,940
Let me reply to him for you.

103
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
Give it back.

104
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,660
- Wanna see?
- Yes.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,520
I just said how could he be so horny that he asked for sex via email.

106
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,620
He is going to hate me!

107
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,020
Why did you say that?

108
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,100
Isn’t it good?

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,920
That way he will never know that you like him.

110
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
 

111
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,600
You’re a psycho!

112
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,780
You’re a psycho!

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,600
Please.

114
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,380
Just enlist him in our Music Club.

115
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,480
We have enough beginners in the club.

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
Why do we need one more?

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Is there something I don’t know?

118
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
He…

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
 

120
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,500
He is the one I like.

121
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
Damn!

122
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
You can’t tell him I like him.

123
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,360
Let’s suppose that I’m flirting with you.

124
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,400
What should I say when I take you home like this?

125
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Goodnight, I guess

126
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,720
See you later.

127
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,080
Get home safe.

128
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,500
Tine.

129
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,160
Goodnight.

130
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,820
I’m gonna create an IG account to hit on him.

131
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,240
What is it called?

132
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,740
How about…

133
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,820
LoveTine?

134
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,120
Dickhead!

135
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,320
Why don’t you just name it F*ckTine then?

136
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,500
I got one

137
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,400
Sarawatlism

138
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,659
Sarawatlism

139
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,699
It’s cool.

140
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,880
It’s like an obsession.

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,320
People are obsessed with Sarawat.

142
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
I like it.

143
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,260
What will you choose?

144
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,460
LoveTine.

145
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,780
Sarawatlism is way better.

146
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,340
Tine doesn’t want to see me.

147
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,100
He thinks I like someone else

148
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,980
He must be talking about Earn.

149
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,780
The music video of you two is all over the place

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,960
But Earn has a boyfriend.

151
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,840
Tine doesn’t know that, does he?

152
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 

153
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,200
He is sulking. Does it mean he likes you?

154
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,780
That’s impossible.

155
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,660
It’s about time for you to talk to him.

156
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,700
Tell him that you met him before.

157
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,560
You get it now?

158
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,420
Us being together

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
is not a coincidence.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,460
It’s because of us.

161
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Stop overthinking it, okay?

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,360
The rain has stopped

163
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,920
Can you walk?

164
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,580
Let me help.

165
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,640
I am okay.

166
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,220
It doesn’t hurt that bad

167
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,120
I almost carried you here

168
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,640
 

169
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,045
 

170
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:22,315
 

171
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:33,585
 

172
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
 

173
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,380
I think…

174
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,760
nothing bad is going to happen anymore.

175
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,680
It’s so beautiful.

183
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,620
Excuse me.

184
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,400
Which way is the Music Club?

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,860
This is Pam, my close friend from high school

186
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,700
You said you would write me a song, remember?

187
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,080
It’s time to keep the promise.

188
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,540
100 honey toasts, please.

189
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,580
Why are you here? The tutor camp is over.

190
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,340
If you want to ride comfortably, come with me.

191
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,020
