1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,855
 

3
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,375 --> 00:00:11,375
 

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,500
 

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,780
Where have you been?

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,320
I don’t see you at the club these days.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
I am sorry

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
I’ve been busy with the cheerleading practice

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,800
Anyway…

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,480
have you seen Sarawat?

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,740
Sarawat?

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,500
He is out promoting his band.

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,980
He won’t be at the club for a while

15
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,860
What’s the matter?

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,920
Nothing.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,560
I will be on my way now.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,140
Hold on.

19
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,940
Come here.

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,260
Have you told anyone about Green?

21
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,460
 

22
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,420
No.

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
 

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,300
That’s good.

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,540
I have no problem with that but Green kind of does

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
He doesn’t want everyone to act weird around him

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,880
So only a few people know about us

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
The ones who know are friends and a few juniors.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,040
Temp does.

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,740
Sarawat does.

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,560
Sarawat?

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,560
Sarawat knows about Green?

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,760
Be quiet.

34
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,860
People are now looking at us.

35
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,900
Yes.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,560
He was there when I started a relationship with Green at freshmen orientation

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,880
He was one of the first people to know.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,620
If he did, why did he agree to help me?

39
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,980
Help what?

40
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing.

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,240
See you later.

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,560
Hey!

43
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:25,165
 

44
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:28,445
 

45
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,180
 

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,880
Your guitar,

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,180
take it back.

48
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,320
I will buy a new one.

49
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,180
You keep it.

50
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,560
It’s been yours since day one

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,520
TINE TEEPAKORN

52
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,145
 

53
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,275
 

54
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,785
 

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,680
 

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,720
It looks more like a room now.

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,100
You see pillars here?

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,480
What have you done to the real P’Mil?

59
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,580
I usually see you as a hazer

60
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,960
Never imagined you as a tutor

61
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,820
Is he the one Mil has been talking about?

62
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,160
The one that is very cute

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,760
I am a tutor and a boxer.

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
Do you want to get punched?

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,640
Wanna try?

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,620
You’re here to see Wat?

67
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,120
 

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,280
He’s rehearsing in the University.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,020
I think it can take all night.

70
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,940
That’s why I came to grab his homework for him

71
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,720
You might find him in a rehearsal studio

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,620
I saw the picture he posted on his IG.

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,480
He met me before, didn’t he?

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,220
IG?

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,560
Just tell me.

76
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,719
I want to know the truth

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,220
Come on.

78
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,000
It was at Scrubb concert.

79
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,620
My friends and I dragged him to see Scrubb concert.

80
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,760
Just before he started to get bored,

81
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,900
a person in front of him was jumping and having fun

82
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
That guy stepped on Wat’s foot.

83
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,840
He told me that

84
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,700
he had never seen anyone listening to music so happily before

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,460
When he heard that you guys wanted to get Scrubb’s autographs

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,520
he followed you.

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,140
I think we should abort the plan

88
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,800
Why?

89
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,640
It’s not like we see them every day.

90
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
I know.

91
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,200
But look at the number of their fans.

92
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
It’s going to take forever until they can rest.

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,120
If I sit this one out, I can spare them a bit more rest time

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
If you’re not taking a photo with them, should we go then?

95
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,740
Who said I wasn’t?

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,000
If I don’t, how can I call myself the biggest fan?

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
P’Muei, are you tired?

98
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,300
Here.

99
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,280
Make them look good.

100
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,740
Sure.

101
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,460
1 2.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,020
Awesome.

103
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,740
They look so good.

104
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
They are tired already.

105
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,680
You are crazy.

106
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,520
See?

107
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,720
1 2.

108
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
 

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
Smokin’ hot!

110
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,440
 

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,280
 

112
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,100
That’s the story.

113
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,260
Tine.

114
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,860
Why are you still here so late?

115
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,460
You have music practice?

116
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,020
No.

117
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,320
I am looking for my friend

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,060
But I am about to leave.

119
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,120
Wait a second.

120
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,680
Let me take you home

121
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,620
 

122
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,400
It’s okay

123
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
Why?

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Are you scared of me?

125
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,920
 

126
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,500
I won’t do you any harm.

127
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,220
I can take him home.

128
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,360
Stay away.

129
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,440
What if I don’t want to?

130
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,960
Try me.

131
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Hey!

132
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,260
What’s the matter with you?

133
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,480
What’s the matter with you?

134
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
You let him pat your head just like that?

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,900
What I do is my business.

136
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,040
You’ve been lying to me all this time. Do I get to say anything?

137
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,100
I’ve been lying to you about what, Tine?

138
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,800
You already knew that Green and P’Dim are dating

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,480
And you met me before at the concert last year.

140
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,940
Are you having fun taking me for a fool?

141
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Huh?

142
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
It’s so damn fun, right?

143
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,320
It’s not like I kept it a secret just to play with your feeling

144
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,900
Why did you do it then?

145
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
Because I really wanted to hit on you.

146
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,240
But you like Earn…

147
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,860
 

148
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:48,455
 

149
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,640
 

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,060
Just so you know,

151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,460
Earn already has a boyfriend

152
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,080
And the only one I’ve always had feelings for...

153
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,180
…is you, Tine.

154
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,880
I like you

155
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,920
I’ve liked you since the second I saw you.

156
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
If it’s so,

157
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,940
why did you refuse to help me from the beginning?

158
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,200
How could I start then?

159
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,520
You said you liked girls.

160
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,860
Even if I started, you’d ask me to get back to the way things were anyway.

161
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,060
You would definitely want us to get back to lives before we met.

162
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,760
Can you ever think of me more than a friend?

163
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,620
I posted that picture on IG

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,920
just to let you know

165
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,760
that even though you didn’t ask me to be your fake date,

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,160
you would never be a stranger to me.

167
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,140
I didn’t talk to you

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,500
I didn’t go to see you.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,580
I did what you asked.

170
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,040
I thought I could handle it

171
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,460
But when I saw you with someone else,

172
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,260
I don’t think I can stop my feeling anymore.

173
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,100
And do you think I can?

174
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
From the day you disappeared,

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,420
my life was never the same

176
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,480
Whatever I did or wherever I went, you caught up with me

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,820
Even in my dreams, you were there teasing me

178
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,880
Are you going to take responsibility for what you did?

179
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,980
Huh?

180
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,440
I can’t go back to fake flirt with you anymore.

181
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,100
From now on, I’m going to flirt for real.

182
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,700
Do you want to try?

183
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,840
Try to get to know each other

184
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,920
You don’t have to like me very much.

185
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,200
Just keep your heart open for me.

186
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,200
I really mean it

187
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,220

00:12:05,765 --> 00:12:07,700
 

194
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,380
How do you feel about him?

195
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,180
My heart was light and weak.

196
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,480
When he got his face close to mine, my heart pounded like crazy

197
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,500
If you guys win, my friend will post a love confession for your friend

198
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,680
But if you guys lose, Sarawat will have to leave my friend alone

199
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,900
Whose football jersey?

200
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,700
My brother’s.

201
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,240
What Faculty is he in?

202
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,660
The Faculty of…

203
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,280
You think you’re so hot, don’t you?

204
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,080
I heard you messed with my friends.

205
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,240
What are you guys doing?

206
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,580
Watch it!

207
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,860
 

208
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,325
 

209
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:50,085
 

210
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,245
 

211
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:55,125
 

212
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,135
 

213
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,275
 

214
00:13:02,955 --> 00:13:04,665
 

215
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,105
 

216
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:08,065
 

217
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,065
 

218
00:13:11,885 --> 00:13:12,945
 

219
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,135
 

220
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:16,755
 

221
00:13:17,345 --> 00:13:18,845
 

222
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,895
 

223
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:27,335
 

224
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,625
 

225
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:45,475
 

226
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:49,925
 

227
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,275
