1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
 

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,870
 

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,225
 

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,400
Do you have a place to sit?

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,120
You can sit beside me.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,080
I heard Architecture students are busy with the workload.

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,280
How come you have time for a trip?

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,560
I forgot my sunscreen

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,040
I brought one. You can use mine

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,740
I can take care of my boyfriend.

13
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,020
We still have lots of fun activities for you to join

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,660
And now we are going to test your bravery.

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,360
You will go into the woods in pairs

16
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,580
Are you all right?

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,360
Come here.

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,140
Get up slowly

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,040
People say the stars there are breathtaking.

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,500
Do you want to see?

21
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,620
Nothing bad is going to happen anymore.

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,100
Sarawat!

23
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,200
Tine!

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,740
What are you two doing here?

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,860
Why don’t you go back to camp?

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,160
We’ve looked for you everywhere.

27
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,720
We needed shelter from the rain

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,720
In there?

29
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,480
Yes. Do we have any other choice?

30
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,920
 

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,340
Of course, you did it!

32
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,360
What?

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,400
Let’s go.

34
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,940
Hey!

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
 

36
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:21,905
 

37
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,980
 

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,320
I can’t believe you guys

39
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
 

40
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,705
 

41
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:38,700
 

42
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,840
You can wait on the bus.

43
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,420
I will help them load.

44
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,340
 

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 

46
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,760
 

47
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,340
About last night…

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,200
Thank you for helping me search for Tine

49
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,140
I found it in the woods.

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,200
Try harder to keep it.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,360
Or I will take it back.

52
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,000
Not a chance.

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,200
Wait!

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,420
What day is it today?

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,020
You can look on your phone screen.

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
 

57
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,740
[Mil: I hope it’s a good day.]

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,780
I have nothing for you to keep.

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,660
Consider it a farewell gift from the tutor camp.

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,220
Going on a trip is more exhausting than studying.

61
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
 

62
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,600
I’m talking to Man about work.

63
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
Really?

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
You can see for yourself.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,260
I don’t have any secrets

66
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,220
Nope.

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,660
I have something better to do

68
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,100
You mean I can score with you now?

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,280
I mean I’m taking a shower!

70
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
 

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,880
Tine.

72
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,240
I found your bracelet.

73
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,320
Really? Where?

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,700
Doesn’t matter where.

75
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,420
Be more careful next time

76
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,640
I am taking a shower. Why are you here?

77
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,120
I am taking a shower with you

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
I know you want more than just taking a shower.

79
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,220
[Pam: How have you been? I miss you, Mr. Grumpy.]

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 

81
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:45,385
 

82
00:04:47,885 --> 00:04:49,245
 

83
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,785
 

84
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:55,465
 

85
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,465
 

86
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:00,145
 

87
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,835
 

88
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:07,185
 

89
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:10,065
 

90
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,155
 

91
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:14,335
 

92
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,445
 

93
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,665
 

94
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,175
 

95
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:27,015
 

96
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,005
 

97
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,585
 

98
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,005
 

99
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:36,335
 

100
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,995
 

101
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,625
 

102
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,875
 

103
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:46,635
 

104
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:50,455
 

105
00:05:51,305 --> 00:05:52,305
 

106
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:54,725
 

107
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:58,685
 

108
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,840
 

109
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,900
So how do you feel, Tine?

110
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,320
Tine.

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,520
I’m asking you how you feel about the song we just played.

112
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,380
I feel…

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,960
sleepy.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,760
What?

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,520
You want to sleep after we just played a rock song.

116
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,240
It’s not about the song.

117
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,680
I am sleepy because I’ve been with you guys for weeks

118
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,460
We need to practice hard.

119
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,180
Competitors are tough this year

120
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,180
Especially the former champion.

121
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,340
Sarawat’s favorite.

122
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Who?

123
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,700
P’Mil’s band!

124
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,580
Don’t worry. We will win the contest.

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,880
Because we have Sarawat.

126
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
That’s true.

127
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,940
I am the best guitarist

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,620
I just posted a photo of you to gain more fans

129
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,060
Oh! You got time to do that?

130
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,280
How about you practice more? You forgot the lyrics again.

131
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
 

132
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,580
[Temp: If you love Sarawat, cheer for Ctrl S.]

133
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
 

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,200
[Pam: You look so cool, Mr. Grumpy.]

135
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,460
We don’t have any more water?

136
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,140
I’ll get you guys some drinks.

137
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,780
You sit here. We’ll go get them ourselves

138
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,320
Keep on practicing

139
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,860
I’ll handle that for you

140
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,140
I want mineral water, not just water

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,360
Excuse me.

142
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,420
Which way is the Music Club?

143
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,860
It is that way.

144
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,700
I am actually headed there

145
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,220
Can I go with you, please?

146
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,740
My friend is practicing there.

147
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,980
Who is your friend? I might know him.

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
His name is Sarawat. Do you know him?

149
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,660
 

150
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,520
This is Pam, my close friend from high school.

151
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,160
Pam, these are my friends.

152
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,120
Why haven’t you told us you have such a cute friend?

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,040
Do you want to hear a love song?

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,420
No!

155
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,200
You guys just can’t hide it when you see hot girls, can you?

156
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you doing here, Pam?

157
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,420
I just dropped out of school

158
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,320
I was thinking of studying here

159
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,520
You dropped out of the Faculty of Medicine?

160
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,480
Why? You want to study Medicine here?

161
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
No.

162
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,840
I want to be in the Faculty of Music here.

163
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,560
That’s why I need a guitar teacher.

164
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,500
Well, I am a pro.

165
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,960
I’ve been playing guitar since middle school

166
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,980
Sorry.

167
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,640
I am a slow learner

168
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,179
My teacher has to be very patient

169
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,400
Isn’t it right, teacher Sarawat?

170
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Hold on.

171
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Did you teach her guitar before?

172
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes.

173
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,260
A long time ago

174
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,100
Pam, I am very busy right now

175
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,240
We are practicing for the contest.

176
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,580
I don’t have time.

177
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,800
Sarawat.

178
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
I came all the way here just to ask you

179
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,020
Please help.

180
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,660
Please.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,840
My chance of getting accepted is in your hands

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,680
Please help.

183
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,620
Please.

184
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,860
Please say yes.

185
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,040
Please.

186
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
 

187
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
 

188
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,400
Boo!

189
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,840
Boo my ass!

190
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,960
Man?

191
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,560
Why are you here?

192
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,260
The door isn’t locked so I walked right in.

193
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,300
Just kidding.

194
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,360
I had waited for you downstairs, but you never showed.

195
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
So I came up here with coffee and snacks.

196
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,980
No need

197
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,480
I am not hungry.

198
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,860
You are cruel.

199
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,700
I came to support you.

200
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,320
You didn’t come to support me.

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,980
But you came to get on my nerves

202
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,960
You can go. I have work.

203
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 

204
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
 

205
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,140
What?

206
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
 

207
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,120
Sometimes your work is not saved when the power is down.

208
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,620
How soon is this work due?

209
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,420
It’s pretty soon from the way you look.

210
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,100
Do you want some help?

211
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:58,960
No.

212
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,260
Think again.

213
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,280
If you can’t turn the work in on time, you might fail the internship

214
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,820
Tik Tok.

215
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Tik Tok.

216
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,000
Type these and print them out.

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,320
All of them?

218
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,180
Yes.

219
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,300
You are not doing it for free.

220
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,900
You’ll get paid.

221
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,600
If my wage is too much,

222
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,600
you can pay with your heart.

223
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,040
Just don’t do it.

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I will do it.

225
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,720
Thanks.

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
Whose computer is this? Can I use it?

227
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,420
You can.

228
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,335
 

229
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,415
 

230
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,780
 

231
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,400
P’Type.

232
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,260
I need to type this section here, right?

233
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,700
That’s right.

234
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,280
Be careful with the numbers

235
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
OK.

236
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,780
 

237
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 

238
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,040
Can I sit with you? It’s more convenient this way.

239
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,480
Just sit there.

240
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,720
My table is too small. It’s uncomfortable.

241
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,780
It’s easier to ask questions.

242
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
You sit there.

243
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
 

244
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
And the folder?

245
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,040
The folder?

246
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,180
Folder?

247
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,400
This is way more difficult.

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,220
You said you wouldn’t eat or drink what I brought for you

249
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,680
You’re hungry, aren’t you?

250
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,000
You can grab snacks. They are in that bag.

251
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Open it.

252
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 

253
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,860
I am done…

254
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,760
What are you doing?

255
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,460
Keeping you warm.

256
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,660
You’ve been watching too many romantic dramas?

257
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,520
If it’s really in a romantic drama, I will get to put my jacket on you

258
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,160
And when we get to be romantic, your boyfriend walks in

259
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,360
Type.

260
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,360
Why are you so early?

261
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,220
I got a little problem with the document

262
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,700
I spent the night here.

263
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,600
Wow! You are hardworking

264
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,720
How about we end the internship here and be the real employee?

265
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,140
I am flattered.

266
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,040
P’Beam, this is my brother’s friend.

267
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,400
He helped me with the document.

268
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,680
Are you Man?

269
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
 

270
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,640
P’Type talks about me?

271
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,500
He said you are annoying and following him everywhere.

272
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,480
You won’t get off his back no matter what he says.

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,460
But you are generous.

274
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,780
I have something in return.

275
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,480
Tomorrow is Type’s last day of internship. We will have a farewell party.

276
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,840
Why don’t you come too?

277
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,560
Are you sure?

278
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,840
I don’t think so.

279
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
He doesn’t have to come.

280
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,840
How can I say no to your invitation?

281
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,460
Don’t come.

282
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,920
Are you done working?

283
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,120
Are you done working?

284
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,800
You drink it too?

285
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I want to have nice skin like you do

286
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,780
You gotta look good for who exactly?

287
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
 

288
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,340
It’s not that.

289
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,400
We practice really hard these days and Temp asked me to take care of my look

290
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,880
I can’t look worn out on stage.

291
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,660
You are super busy.

292
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,080
And yet you have time to teach Pam guitar.

293
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,600
She is about to go through tests.

294
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,960
I can’t just ignore her, can I?

295
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,300
I am teaching her at the Music Club. Do you wanna come?

296
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,820
I don’t think so.

297
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,460
I am helping Phuak with his food review page

298
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Really?

299
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,840
Yes. Why?

300
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,540
You’ve been acting weird.

301
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,360
You know you can talk to me, right?

302
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,700
Nonsense.

303
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,160
You should get going.

304
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
OK.

305
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,920
See you.

306
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
 

307
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,500
Hi guys. Welcome to ‘Gross But Cheap So We Gotta Eat.’

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,940
We are here at the legendary rice porridge shop

309
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,280
The one and only legend around here.

310
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,660
Why are they legend? Because the other shops nearby are all good.

311
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,620
This is the only place that serves gross food

312
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,700
I don’t know why they still open.

313
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,100
That was just a tale.

314
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,720
The food looks yummy.

315
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,320
Yummy or yucky?

316
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,980
Let’s stop recording and eat.

317
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,240
Otherwise, the shop owner will kill you.

318
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,340
This is gross.

319
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,600
Every time we do the food review with Phuak, we need to be careful not to get beaten up

320
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,220
Are you OK?

321
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,360
Tine.

322
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,640
What?

323
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,680
It’s just that I…

324
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,080
My friend at the club had a fight with his boyfriend

325
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,160
That guy again?

326
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,780
Why so many problems?

327
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,520
Do you think I want to have…?

328
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I mean my friend doesn’t want problems.

329
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,960
Hey! Let me ask you guys.

330
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,160
If you find someone you like, will you leave the one you went after for a long time?

331
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,920
I will.

332
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,480
Don’t you guys need time to think?

333
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,740
Why do I need to think?

334
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,860
A new face is always better.

335
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,200
Not always.

336
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,840
There is one thing that someone new can’t be.

337
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,120
What’s that?

338
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,500
Armpit (sounds like ‘first love’).

339
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,920
First love!

340
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,960
People never forget their armpit.

341
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,440
First love.

342
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,180
 

343
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,060
Think about it.

344
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:30,240
We always pick someone who reminds us of our first love in some way.

345
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,580
You’re right.

346
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,840
Tine’s first love was such a princess.

347
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,880
His girlfriends after that were all similar

348
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,780
Shit!

349
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,500
I better check my girlfriend

350
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,340
Just in case I am someone’s shadow.

351
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,600
I’m worried now. I can’t eat.

352
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,340
You said you had never had a girlfriend.

353
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,560
Have you ever had a crush on someone though?

354
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,240
I have

355
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,320
Who?

356
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,960
A friend from high school

357
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,640
This is Pam, my close friend from high school.

358
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,040
 

359
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,740
Better?

360
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:34,120
Don’t let your ring finger touch this string.

361
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,420
Don’t you remember?

362
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,580
We always pick someone who reminds us of our first love in some way.

363
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,640
Trim your fingernails next time

364
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,320
Who plays guitar with such long fingernails?

365
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,720
Press harder.

366
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,960
Do it right.

367
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
I am doing it right.

368
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,100
Don’t touch the bottom string

369
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,040
Do it again.

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,700
I think you should rest your fingers.

371
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,280
Let’s take a break.

372
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,840
You are as grumpy as always, teacher.

373
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,080
Look at you. You’ve forgotten everything.

374
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,680
Do you have a song to play for the test?

375
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,480
I might play the one I wrote.

376
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
 

377
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,960
That’s good.

378
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,120
Can you even write a song?

379
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,220
I can’t.

380
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,940
But I know who can.

381
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,460
You once said you would write me a song, remember?

382
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,500
It’s time to keep the promise.

383
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
Type, get in

384
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,160
