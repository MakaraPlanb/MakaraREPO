1
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,480
If you are only here just to chase a guy, get up and find yourself out.

2
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Wait!

3
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,860
As long as you love music, we don’t mind how it all starts.

4
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,740
P’Dim, we can't take them all anyway. We have a limitation.

5
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,580
Don’t let that trivial thing ruin our standard.

6
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,180
I will deal with the University board about that.

7
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,700
Welcome everyone to our Music Club.

8
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,620
Before you become our club members,

9
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,940
you have to go through our special welcoming ceremony.

10
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,020
You all need to sing these famous songs so loud that every being in this place can hear

11
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,280
And that would be ‘Roasted Chicken’ and many activity songs.

12
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Now everyone, get up!

13
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
♪ Roasted Chicken ♫

14
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,160
♪ Roasted Chicken ♫

15
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,160

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,100

♪ Ooh! It’s so hot! So hot! So hot! ♫

19
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,240
For the next song, come out here Sarawat.

20
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,760
Come on out.

21
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,940
The reason to dance is that…

22
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,100
when we are on stage, we are all stiff.

23
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,300
This will break the ice and make you relax.

24
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,400
Kill it, man.

25
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,460
Come to the center.

26
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,320
The song ‘Apple Papaya Banana Orange’

27
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,120
♪ Apple Apple Apple ♫

28
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,560

31
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
♪ Apple Papaya Banana Orange ♫

32
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,720
I need one more

33
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,760
A cheerleader, come out here.

34
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840
Tine!

35
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
♪ Stick it in its left ass ♫

36
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
♪ Stick it in its right ass ♫

37
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,860
♪ Ooh! It’s so hot! So hot! So hot! ♫

38
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,920
Let’s pretend that I’m you.

39
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,700
Why do I have to do things like this in life?

40
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,920
Sarawat, get out of my face.

41
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,640
♪ Spider wanders out at night ♫

42
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,120
♪ When the clock hits 2 am, it bounces up and down ♫

43
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,060
Have you not been through any recreation activity?

44
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,660
What about me?

45
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,760
You…bounce on top.

46
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Who will be at the bottom?

47
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,940
No one.

48
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020
♪ Spider wanders out at night ♫

49
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,780
♪ When the clock hits 2 am, it bounces up and down ♫

50
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,260
One more time and we’ll be done.

51
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,340
One more spider and we will move on.

52
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
Do it fiercely when we sing ‘bounces up and down.’

53
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,460
♪ Spider wanders out at night ♫

54
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,960
♪ When the clock hit 2 am, it bounces up and down ♫

55
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,000
We have come to our last activity.

56
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,540
This game is called ‘Snack For Friendship.’

57
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,679
It’s so easy.

58
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
You will feed a snack to your friend using…

59
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
…your mouth.

60
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,640
Air, hand them their snack.

61
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,660
How many?

62
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,720
One for each pair.

63
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,820
If you drop it, everyone in your row will be punished

64
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,560
One for each pair.

65
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,460
It will be a bit harder for girls.

66
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,020
Start now!

67
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,460
You need to eat it too.

68
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,560
Eat bit by bit, Wat!

69
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,300
Make it as short as possible

70
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,160
They totally pass.

71
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,460
Everyone in this place has gone through our welcoming ceremony!

72
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,600
You will have a 15-minute break.

73
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,340
After that, we will talk about our club rules.

74
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
See you guys in a bit.

75
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,500
What are you thinking about?

76
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,220
Everyone has gone on their break.

77
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,060
Thinking about what you did.

78
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,460
You think you can mess with me all you want?

79
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,000
You mean the kiss?

80
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,460
It wasn’t a kiss!

81
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,900
It was just a game. Why did you have to be serious about it?

82
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,340
Why are you being hot-headed now?

83
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,720
You just asked me to be your boyfriend yesterday.

84
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,560
A little kiss from me won’t hurt.

85
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,740
Tine, you are mischievous.

86
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,380
Only two seconds in that club and you got to kiss Sarawat

87
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,140
Our lips just touched, not a kiss.

88
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,240
Shit! Who recorded this?

89
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,260
Let’s take a break from this topic.

90
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,220
What I want to know is whether Sarawat agrees to help you or not.

91
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,000
You’re right. I didn’t ask him

92
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,140
I didn’t think about it.

93
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,160
I need to hurry before Green gets you kicked out of that club

94
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,480
Don’t worry. It’s easier to see him now

95
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,740
I will ask him to help me this evening.

96
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,180
That’s my boy.

97
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,040
See you then, Sarawat.

98
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,500
What? He’s not here?

99
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Yes.

100
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,280
Those who can actually play will rehearse in a different room so you guys can focus.

101
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,860
These are the beginners from the first year?

102
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,960
For guitar, yes.

103
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
The rest are playing something else.

104
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,700
What do I need to do if I want to practice with those who can play?

105
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,880
You need to know the basic chords first.

106
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,620
You will get used to them in no time.

107
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,720
This guitar is a legend

108
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,860
It was used to win competitions?

109
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,120
Nope.

110
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,600
Its owner died of a heart attack.

111
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,540
It is now a club’s possession

112
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,160
Its strings are big and hard but you will get used to it one day

113
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Come here. I’ll teach you.

114
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,440
This is chord C. It is the most basic one.

115
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,320
Look at my fingers.

116
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,840
Use your point, middle, and ring finger

117
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,959
Try it.

118
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,220
P’Air, you’re actually cute

119
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah?

120
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,160
Chord C now.

121
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,160
Like this?

122
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,280
It sounds wired. What did you do wrong?

123
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,700
Try it again.

124
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,840
What kind of strings are they? This is painful

125
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,580
Cooking Club always welcomes you, Tine

126
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,520
I heard that Music Club was cruel to you. They gave you an old guitar to practice.

127
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,440
I was so shocked.

128
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,600
I am more shocked that you know about this

129
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,080
I know everything about you

130
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,020
Move to my club and you will get to eat delicious food every day.

131
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,120
I made this especially for you

132
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you for your concern but I am okay

133
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,240
I need to get back to the club.

134
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Tine, don’t go!

135
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,220
Tine, you seem really determined.

136
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,880
I will do whatever it takes to be in this club

137
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
What?

138
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean I will keep practicing hard.

139
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,360
I will play a song eventually.

140
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,060
That’s good.

141
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,980
But what you played earlier were all wrong.

142
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,300
No worries. You still have time. You will get better

143
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,800
We have no time.

144
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,580
Why is that?

145
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,960
The University board doesn’t allow more club members than we agreed on.

146
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,980
This Friday, newbies have to go through a test

147
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,540
Those who fail will be out of this club.

148
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
What chord are you playing exactly?

149
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,420
What chord is it?

150
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,560
I don’t know either.

151
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,120
P’Dim, are you being serious?

152
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
Do we have any other way?

153
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,440
No.

154
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,920
And don’t be too nice to freshmen.

155
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,540
My guitar. Try it.

156
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,300
Where is the guy who comes to practice every day?

157
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,440
He might be finding himself a new club.

158
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,380
I don’t think he will pass the test
