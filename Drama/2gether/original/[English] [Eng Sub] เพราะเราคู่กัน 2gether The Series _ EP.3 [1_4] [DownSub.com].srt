1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,930
 

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,390
 

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,755
 

4
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,060
 

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,340
Wait!

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,440
I have something to talk to you.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,620
But I don’t

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,320
If you are in the same club he is in, you will see him more often

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,020
If you are in the same club he is in, you will see him more often

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,760
Before you become our club members

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,100
you need to go through our special welcoming ceremony

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,940
Did Sarawat agree to help you or not?

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,420
Don’t worry. It’s easy to see him now.

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,660
I will ask him for his help

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,480
Okay.

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,260
Okay what?

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,020
Okay. I will be your fake boyfriend.

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:38,880
He is taken

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,760
So you will help me?

21
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,560
Cheers!

22
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,580
Tine, what did you do to make Sarawat help you?

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,040
You gave him some kind of special service?

24
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,820
You are gross!

25
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,980
I have no idea.

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,240
He changed his mind all of a sudden.

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,740
He might think being flirtatious in front of Green is not going to ruin his reputation.

28
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,800
It’s not like he has to flirt in front of his fans.

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,360
I guess so.

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,920
I need you guys to help me with something

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,060
Sarawat will be at his Faculty tomorrow morning.

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,880
You guys need to tell Green that I will be there

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,260
Tine!

34
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
Your friends told me someone’s been hitting on you. Is that true?

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,780
True.

36
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Sarawat.

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,700
A guitar is for you to play…

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,760
…but I am for you to love

39
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,580
You can compete for anything with anyone

40
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,280
but you can’t beat Sarawat when it comes to love.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,640
No!!!

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,640
That’s not true.

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,440
There?

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,900
There where?

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,140
In front of his Faculty.

46
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,480
Where exactly?

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,599
In front of his Faculty building where there is a parking lot.

48
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,980
Then there is a road

49
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,700
When you cross it, you’ll see his Faculty building.

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,220
Ah!! The parking lot.

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,380
Right.

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Isn’t that at the back though?

53
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
I will share you guys the exact location

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Can you do it now?

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
I want to see where

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,840
Damn it!!

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,500
You pieces of dumb shit!

58
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,620
 

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:43,320
5 4 3 2 1…

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,780
Tine!

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,840
Good morning…

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,700
Where is Tine?

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
He is where his heart belongs.

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,320
Wait!

65
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,380
You said the same thing at the same time?

66
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,980
Is this some kind of a plan?

67
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,900
It’s not a plan!

68
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,420
Really!

69
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,540
So where is Tine?

70
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,120
Tine!

71
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,920
Your friends told me someone has been hitting on you. Is that true?

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,700
You can see for yourself.

73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,280
Sarawat.

74
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,140
Hey!

75
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,540
Hey!

76
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,900
Tine…

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,240
Are you trying to make me jealous?

78
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,700
God! You are such a cutie.

79
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,920
Don’t worry

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,740
I won’t be jealous because I know you belong to mine

81
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,220
Come on. Let’s go.

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,780
 

83
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:02,585
 

84
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:04,935
 

85
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:08,825
 

86
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:09,825
 

87
00:04:10,905 --> 00:04:13,505
 

88
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,105
 

89
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:17,165
 

90
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:20,545
 

91
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:23,425
 

92
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,225
 

93
00:04:26,705 --> 00:04:27,705
 

94
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:29,515
 

95
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:33,005
 

96
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,515
 

97
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,200
 

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 

99
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
 

100
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,345
 

101
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:49,685
 

102
00:04:50,555 --> 00:04:52,355
 

103
00:04:52,805 --> 00:04:56,045
 

104
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,225
 

105
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,985
 

106
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,885
 

107
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:03,805
 

108
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:08,085
 

109
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:12,035
 

110
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,980
 

111
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Sorry.

112
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,220
I didn’t know you wanted me to start being flirtatious already.

113
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,180
I didn’t pay attention

114
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,780
Because of you, Green was stalking me for almost an hour

115
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,020
It was hard to sneak away.

116
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,020
So what do you need me to do?

117
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,520
You just don’t know anything, do you?

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,580
Do it like when you hit on girls

119
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,000
Buy me snacks and drinks. Take care of me.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,140
Something like that.

121
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,240
Got it.

122
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,080
What?

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,660
Green is not here.

124
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Just freakin’ take it.

125
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,760
Someone bought it for me.

126
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,880
I will have it all then.

127
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,500
Your fans are so kind and caring

128
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,640
Are you Tine?

129
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,140
Where is Wat? I saw you two talking just now

130
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,260
He went that way.

131
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,460
Thanks.

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,860
His fans bought him lots of ice-creams

133
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,140
Do you want one?

134
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,440
That’s okay.

135
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,680
He just gave me a snack from his fans

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,860
That can’t be right

137
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,140
He bought that from a shop himself.

138
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
You’re mistaken.

139
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,220
I have to go before these ice-creams melt.

140
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,360
No snacks!

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
Food first.

142
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,520
Why are you here?

143
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,760
To have lunch with you.

144
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,740
I skip my Faculty event just to come to see you

145
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,460
Faculty of Humanities is having an event?

146
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,480
Yes.

147
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,600
There is a charity auction on used stuff from hot girls from my Faculty.

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,800
The event is about to start.

149
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,660
You guys can go. I can stay with Tine

150
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,120
You don’t have to.

151
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,200
My friends might be jerks, but they won’t leave me for those girls

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,140
Hey!!

153
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,300
I made you a lunchbox.

154
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,720
I put all the efforts I have into this.

155
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,080
Look how cute it is.

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
Oh my god!

157
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,460
I am so surprised I can even do this.

158
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,180
Sarawat.

159
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,720
Don’t go.

160
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Do you understand my signal?

161
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Help me.

162
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,160
Sarawat!

163
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,460
Help!

164
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,940
Don’t leave me.

165
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
Let’s try it.

166
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,140
Come on.

167
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
Open your mouth.

168
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,700
Here is your lunch

169
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,320
Can I have this?

170
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,900
I already drank it

171
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
So?

172
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,560
You were exaggerating it

173
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,340
Green thought that you were just pretending

174
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,500
It didn’t look real

175
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,080
It was how people flirted in the series I saw.

176
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
What do you want me to do?

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,280
What series do you possibly think we are in?

178
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,560
The Nuisance…

179
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,819
…and the Handsome Prince.

180
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,580
I was just being sarcastic

181
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,860
You are so dull at flirting.

182
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,900
Haven’t you been in love with anyone before?

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,120
Are we all here?

184
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,400
Go back to your professional zone

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,520
This zone is for new waves only

186
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,340
Where have you been?

187
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,280
We have fewer members now so we will all practice together

188
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,700
Be focused and don’t let your weird music distract me

189
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,020
I need to rehearse.

190
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,360
Weird music?

191
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,960
I don’t play weird anymore.

192
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,120
You think?

193
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
That’s wrong

194
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,820
You need to press harder.

195
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,220
My fingers can’t press any harder.

196
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,840
Do you have a guitar with less stiff strings?

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,920
You need to put up with it for now

198
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,180
When we get the new allowance, we will buy a new one

199
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:43,400
Do you have any recommendations for guitar strings?

200
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,920
I will change them for the time being.

201
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,400
If you prefer a clear sound, I recommend Elixir.

202
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,000
If you prefer a soft and deep sound, go for D'Addario

203
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,940
Da…what?

204
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,100
D'Addario.

205
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,120
D'Ad…da…ri…o

206
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,740
Got it.

207
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Guys.

208
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,860
Before you leave, I need to inform you of two things

209
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,380
Firstly, our club will have a music show called Altermajeeb

210
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,440
You need to advertise that.

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Many cool bands will perform in this event,

212
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,740
especially the band called Sunshine, Daisies, Butter Mellow

213
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,580
That’s a band name?

214
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,600
It sounds like an essay topic

215
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,980
That’s my band.

216
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,340
Do you have a problem?

217
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,340
I don’t.

218
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,820
Secondly,

219
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,020
there will be a small evaluation for those who are in guitar class.

220
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,120
Skillful players record yourselves playing a song.

221
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,380
Beginners record yourselves playing basic chords and send it to me

222
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,880
Sucky players will be criticized on social media.

223
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,640
If you don’t turn in the video, you will be kicked out of this club

224
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,820
If you get it, now go home.

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,280
Play it like I taught you, Tine.

226
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
Keep fighting.

227
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,400
Wat, where are you going after this?

228
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,840
Why?

229
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,980
Are you asking me on a date?

230
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,860
No.

231
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,160
Can you go buy D'Addario strings with me?

232
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,420
I think maybe the flirting was awkward because we are not close enough

233
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,760
We might need to spend more time together

234
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,740
So you’re asking me on a date in a guitar shop

235
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,840
No need to beat around the bush.

236
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,580
A date is a date.

237
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,080
Sorry though

238
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,020
Shops around here don’t have the strings you want.

239
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,240
They don’t?

240
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,800
What should I do? I need to practice.

241
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,240
I have a guitar with soft strings that I don’t play very often

242
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,180
Seriously?

243
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,880
Can I borrow that one to record a video?

244
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,020
Sure, on one condition

245
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,720
What is it?

246
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,860
Sarawat, what brings you to the Faculty of Laws?

247
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,460
I came to see Tine.

248
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,460
Are you sure this is not a haunted house?
