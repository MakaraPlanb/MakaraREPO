1
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,800
Are you here hoping to see Sarawat?

2
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,640
No.

3
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,880
I just…

4
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,060
come to reminisce it one last time.

5
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,360
The place where everything started.

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,560
Unlike me.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,240
I came to recall my old Sarawat.

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,840
His eyes

9
00:00:58,245 --> 00:00:59,815
before they laid on you.

10
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,780
I had always liked him.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,860
And I thought he felt the same way.

12
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,820
I kept waiting.

13
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
I waited for him to confess his feeling.

14
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,255
Until that day,

15
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,705
we came here for the concert.

16
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:26,875
And he met you, Tine.

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,940
From then on,

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,920
his eyes have changed.

19
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,200
I learned the truth long ago.

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,000
That’s why I went to a different University.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,840
I thought I could forget about him.

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,360
But one day, he posted your photo on his IG.

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,480
And, everyone can see.

24
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,300
He didn’t have the guts to say he liked me,

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,660
but he told every on social media about you.

26
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,920
That made me wonder if I came back,

27
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,279
would things be different?

28
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,260
But no.

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,560
How do you know?

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,020
I think he still loves you.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,640
Answer me!

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,580
Pam!

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,240
I am sorry.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,700
I can’t love you.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,620
He tried to hide it

36
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,040
but I knew he was writing a love song for you.

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,760
He told you so

38
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,900
because he felt guilty towards me.

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,340
About the song…

40
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,100
Give it a try.

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,220
Why do I have to?

42
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,100
Just listen to it and you will know.

43
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,200
What a nice weather!

44
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,820
May I sit here and read with you?

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,720
Do whatever you want.

46
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,000
Just don’t bother me.

47
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Loving you is kind of bothering?

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,100
I will haunt you every day.

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,560
I will stick with you no matter what.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,340
I can follow you for the rest of my life.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,260
Did you ask me if I wanted to be followed?

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,020
We will see about that.

53
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,260
You gotta miss me if I don’t show up one day.

54
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,280
Excuse me.

55
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,660
Your friend came here the other day.

56
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,600
He asked me to return this to you.

57
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,220
Thank you.

58
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,600
Thank you.

59
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,440
I have been looking for you everywhere.

60
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,020
What a surprise you are Tine’s brother.

61
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,400
Do I know you?

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,720
You don’t remember me?

63
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,400
No.

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
You are never in my memories.

65
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,800
And I don’t think

66
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,340
I ever associated with someone like you.

67
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,560
This side.

68
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,640
Man.

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Man!

70
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:44,605
Sorry.

71
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,940
I thought you were my friend.

72
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,700
Pass me the ball.

73
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,420
Who is he anyway?

74
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,720
He comes to play with us every day.

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,580
I don’t know.

76
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,700
I guess he doesn’t have any friends.

77
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,700
What is wrong with you?

78
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,260
The contest is about to happen.

79
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,500
Why aren’t you in practice?

80
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,220
Why do you care?

81
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,920
It’s none of your business.

82
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Fine.

83
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,780
I will play with you.

84
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,220
That’s two.

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,260
Two what?

86
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,000
It was the first goal.

87
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,480
Two times you’ve lost to me.

88
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,420
One for football and

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
one for Tine.

90
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
And when did I lose Tine to you?

91
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,940
Just look at yourself now!

92
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,240
If my band wins the contest this year,

93
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,680
I’ll ask Tine out.

94
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,220
And if you can’t take it,

95
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,340
don’t dare show your face at the contest.

96
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I am warning you.

97
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,280
You must treat me BBQ pork this time.

98
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,180
You bailed on me last time.

99
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,980
Trust me on this. I won’t bail this time.

100
00:08:02,675 --> 00:08:04,195
We’ll see about that.

101
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,680
Come on. I won’t ditch you.

102
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,160
Come on.

103
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,940
Hey!

104
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,140
Man.

105
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,940
Man!

106
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,385
Why are you avoiding me?

107
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:28,495
I am not.

108
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:31,145
Are you still mad about what P’Beam said?

109
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,580
Hell yes.

110
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,879
I am mad because I was insulted.

111
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,800
I am mad because you didn’t try to protect me a bit.

112
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,940
I am mad at myself the most

113
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,755
because I suck just like they said.

114
00:08:50,715 --> 00:08:51,865
You know what?

115
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,100
I promised myself

116
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
I won’t see you again until I am more mature.

117
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,500
I don’t know if I can ever be mature in this life.

118
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,620
You cannot.

119
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,100
You can’t even keep your promise.

120
00:09:11,105 --> 00:09:12,195
What promise?

121
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:15,725
You promised to come and see me every day.

122
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,180
You came into my life,

123
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,560
followed me around every day.

124
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,880
And now you want to disappear on me?

125
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,620
All you can do is talk.

126
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,680
But you already have P’Beam.

127
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,240
Who told you that?

128
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,300
I don’t want a luxurious life.

129
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,740
I just want a simple life.

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,180
Are you OK with this?

131
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,365
I have nothing for you.

132
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I am not.

133
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
You said you would take care of me.

134
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,860
Find a way to do it.

135
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,420
If you can pester me everywhere,

136
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,960
taking care of me won’t be so hard.

137
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,140
I guess so.

138
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,680
Will you take me home today?

139
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,600
No.

140
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,100
What?

141
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,400
Just joking.

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
Sure.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,820
Didn’t you drive here?

144
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
I did.

145
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,295
But I want to ride through smoke and dust with you.

146
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,340
Dust?

147
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,560
That’s unexpected.

148
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,900
It’s not nice and clean.

149
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,700
Will you take me home or not?

150
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,280
It’s hot out there.

151
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,260
I know.

152
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Of course, I will.

153
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,540
I won’t let you go home alone.

154
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,260
So…

155
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,780
Are we cool now?

156
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,720
Um.

157
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,340
Then…

158
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
Can I hug you?

159
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,740
No.

160
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,760
Come on.

161
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
There is no one around.

162
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
Give me a hug.

163
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:03,545
Fine.

164
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
BBQ pork.

165
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,740
BBQ pork.

166
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,680
BBQ pork my ass!

167
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Don’t mind him.

168
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,740
Let go.

169
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,540
What?

170
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,720
Do you want to eat BBQ pork?

171
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,460
No.

172
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,300
Why not?

173
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,320
Are you on a diet?

174
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,820
I want to go home.

175
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,200
BBQ pork and dessert.

176
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
No. I want to go home.

177
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,740
It won’t take that long.

178
00:11:50,475 --> 00:11:51,475
What will you do at home?

179
00:11:52,085 --> 00:11:53,085
I just want to go home.

180
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,125
Fine.

181
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,000
I’ll take you home.

182
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,500
But let me hug you again.

183
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,340
Cheer up, guys.

184
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,120
Sorry I am late.

185
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,560
Hurry!

186
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,380
I have set up the guitar for you.

187
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Thanks.

188
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,760
Why do you have to look so nice and bright?

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,500
Ah!

190
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,340
It’s the Music Contest tomorrow.

191
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,820
It’s just routine.

192
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,940
You know I have nothing to do with Sarawat anymore.

193
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,740
Yeah?

194
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,020
And this guitar?

195
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,440
Why haven’t you returned it to him?

196
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
I just…

197
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,960
I will...

198
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,120
I will but I need to take my name tag off first.

199
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,120
Are you sure?

200
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Yes.

201
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,920
Stop talking about this.

202
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:03,885
Must be Ohm.

203
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,200
Hide it.

204
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,040
If he sees it, he will definitely tease you.

205
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,080
Hide?

206
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
Yes.

207
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,245
Wat.

208
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,000
He has decided not to go.
