00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,960
You guys have to help me find a way to get rid of Green.

How hot does he think he is?

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,440
This is the type of guy that can make Green back off.

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,479
Seems like it’s not just me who wants to see Sarawat

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,600
Can you help…?

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,780
What are you doing?

14

Why don’t you come tomorrow?

19
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,560
We are late because we were talking to those girls about you.

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,160
They wanted to have my Facebook or Line ID, right?

21
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,580
They wanted to know about your ‘wanting to eat Sarawat’ status

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,100
How hungry were you, really?

23
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,460
I told you a thousand times that I didn’t post that.

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,020
Sarawat did it.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,000
I have no idea how he knew my password.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,060
The first group, are you guys ready to present?

27
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,740
We are.

28
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,080
But may we have a second? We’re having a problem connecting to a projector.

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,960
Ohm, can you go borrow the cable from next door?

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,020
Me again?

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,860
Yes.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,420
Sarawat, how did you know my lock screen password?

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,760
[You set a dumb password, 1 2 3 4 5 6.]

I am sorry for being loud, professor.

Shit! Since when?

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,460
Since your dumb password.

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,600
I wanted to tell you but it was so pleasing to watch

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,420

Do you like Sarawat?

81
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,400
Of course not.

82

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,980
I do, all right?

96
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,880
Does he think he will get away with this so easily?

97
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,780
Are you getting revenge on him?

98
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,740
No.

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,520
I’m going to get his phone fixed.

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,480
Not hard, Yo! Yo!

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
It’s not hard to fix?

118
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,740
It’s not hard to give up and throw away

119
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,980
Yo! Yo!

120
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,580
May I recommend a new one? Yo! Yo!

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,200
I’ll give you a special price.

122
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,660
This one?

123
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,520
Yes.

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,020

Yo! Yo!

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
It’s a triple-sim phone.

127
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
3 SIM?

128
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,060
Who would I call?

129
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Girls.

130
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,260
Is there any other shop around?

131
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Hey!

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,600
This one is smaller and its battery lasts longer than your previous one

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,380
Plus a charger here.

134
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,920
The battery will be fully charged in no time.

135
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,080
I am sorry

136
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,380
I will ask my mom for money and buy you a new one.

137
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay?

138
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,220
Don’t need to.

139
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,960
I already bought a new one

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,580
You did?

141
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,140
Why did you want me to fix your old one then?

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
Because you needed to take responsibility for the damage.

143
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,140
Here is your phone.

144
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,620
Wait!

145
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,440
I need to talk to you about something.

146
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,620
But I don’t.

147
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,640
Please. I will take less than 10 seconds. I promise.

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
I give you 5…

149

150
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,160
Be my boyfriend.

151
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,420
What on earth did you just say?

152
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,940
Not a real boyfriend

153
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,800
Just pretend that you like me.

154
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,340
I’ve been followed around by someone.

155
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,860
So I need you to be my shield.

156
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,080
Why?

157
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,600
Is she not pretty?

158
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
It’s a guy but I like girls.

159
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,440
What’s wrong with that?

160
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,700
It’s good that someone admires you.

161
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,080
It’s not good.

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,080
I don’t like people to get too involved with my personal life

163
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,960
You will never know.

164

Someday you might want someone to be a nuisance in your life.

165
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,240
That’s funny.

166
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,860
I know you don’t like people to invade your private life either.

167
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
There is one anyway.

Where?

170
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,160
It’s you!

171
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
You’re such a nuisance in my life.

172
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Me?

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,280
You let him go just like that?

174
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,660
How stupid!

175
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,340
He said that to my face. What would you do?

176
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,500
Right, Fong?

177
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Right.

178
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,880
Phuak is right.

179
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,260
You don’t have his number. How will you contact him now?

180
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,720
You’re silly!

181
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,220
Ohm, go ahead and yell at me like these two just did.

182
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,120
Shit!

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
That’s it?

184
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,860
I wasn’t talking to you

185
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,940
Someone posted a video of Sarawat in a closed group

186
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,820
I’m sure we will get something out of this.

187
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,820
Sarawat, what club will you be joining tomorrow?

188
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,840
I don’t know.

189
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,240
What kind of activity do you like?

190
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
We might be in the same club.

191
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,720
Football, archery, planting, meditation, boxing, fencing…

192
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,520
Why doesn’t he mention scuba diving and coral planting too?

193
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,020
Scuba diving and coral planting too.

194
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,620
See?

195
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,880
Let’s not watch it.

196
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,980
It gets me frustrated

197
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
I think I just found you the way

198
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,500
If you can get in the same club he’s in, you’ll get to see him more often

199
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
That’s right

200
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,240
There’s one problem though.

201
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,440
We don’t know which club he’s going to join

202
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
Right.

203
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,380
That is easy.

204
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,620
A senior called him this morning and told him to go rehearse in the music club.

205
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,780
Music club?

206
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,840
You know and you just sit here making a dumb face?

207
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,120
What a dumb ass!

208
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,040
I don’t know what to call you, really

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,600
You give me a headache.

210
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,620
My head hurts!

211
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,680
But I can’t play any musical instrument.

212
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,520
Get into the club first and think about it later.

213
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,300
We will apply too and help you talk to Sarawat.

214
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,320
Hot freshmen over there, do you want to join Swimming Club?

215
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,780
We do.

216
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,820
Hold on!

217
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,580
What about our Music Club?

218
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,020
Music Club.

219
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,840
Music Club.

220
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,340
Swimming Club?

221
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,200
What?

222
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
We all do.

223
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
Where do we apply?

224
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
Right here.

225
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Tine!

226
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,600
Tine!

227
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,140
OH YOU'RE HERE-

228
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,080
Come with me.

229
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,860
Let me apply first.

230
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Come here!

231
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Fill out your application.

232
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,400
Are you tired swimming?

233
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,740
Don’t look!

234
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,460
I found a club for you, Tine

235
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,720
Green, why are you here?

236
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,700
Don’t look at them.

237
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,520
Ta-da! Welcome to Cooking Club

238
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,960
I used to think I would cook for my boyfriend every day if I had one.

239
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,680
I made you some cookies.

240
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,920
Let’s try it

241
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,740
Wait a minute.

242
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,340
Why not? Don’t you want it?

243
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,500
It’s not that.

244
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,960
It looks yummy

245
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,840
It looks so yummy that I want to call my friends to taste it too

246
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,060
Really?

247
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,140
Really.

248
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,360
Good.

249
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,560
I have so many dishes I want you to try

250
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Wait for me here just one moment.

251
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,460
Hurry back.

252
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,980
I’ll be back soon.

253
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,800
See you soon.

254
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,840
Okay.

255
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
[Music Club]

256
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,700
Guys, please get in line.

257
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
I got it!

258
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,820
Tine my beloved friend, how are you?

259
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,700
But you guys are bad friends.

260
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,100
You saw girls and you left me instantly.

261
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,920
How will you snatch your spot from those girls?

262
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,160
Hi guys.

263
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,220
My name is Air. I am a club secretary.

264
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,340
This is P’Dim. He is our club president.

265
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,720
Our Music Club was founded more than 30 years ago

266
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,860
It has brought fame and admiration to our University.

267
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
But this year…

268
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,980
I heard that many of you join our club because of some guy.

269
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,900
If you are only here just to chase a guy,

270
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,120
get up and find yourself out

271
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,920
Do it fiercely when we sing ‘bounces up and down

272
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,820
You just asked me to be your boyfriend yesterday

273
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,140
I guess a kiss from me won’t hurt
