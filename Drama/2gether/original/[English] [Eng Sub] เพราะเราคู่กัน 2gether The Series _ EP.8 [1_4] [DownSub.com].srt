00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020

00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,910
 

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,405
 

5
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,235
 

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,020
 

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,040
Sarawat, can I have your number?

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
I’ll call you and discuss the music video tonight.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,540
I heard Sarawat is forming a new band.

10
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,520
Yes. Why?

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,020
His guitarist is so cute. What’s her name?

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,400
Why didn’t you pick up my calls?

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,620
Why are you still here so late?

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,780
I am about to leaveI am about to leave.

15
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:27,920
Let me take you home.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,640
I can take him home

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,920
Stay away.

18
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,820
Are you having fun taking me for a fool?

19
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,200
I wasn’t playing with your feeling

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,420
Why did you do it then?

21
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,660
Because I really wanted to hit on you.

22
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,300
Let’s try to get to know each other

23
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,780
You don’t have to like me very much.

24
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,400
Just keep your heart open for me

25
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,880
♪ It might be this person ♫

26
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,420
♪ The one right in front of me ♫

27
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,400
♪ The world that used to be empty ♫

28
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,260
♪ is not the same anymore ♫

29
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,400
What the heck are you doing?

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
I said I would flirt with you

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,420
I will flirt until you agree to be my boyfriend

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,120
I know that

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,800
I just didn’t think you would be flirty in here

34
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Why?

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,400
Are you blushing?

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,380
Or…

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,900
are you actually falling?

38
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,540
 

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,500
Falling, my ass.

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,660
Bye.

41
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 

42
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,920
Wash your hands first.

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,980
I forgot.

44
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,920
 

45
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,260
You think you’re so hot, don’t you?

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,280
I don’t want to see my girl like your posts ever again.

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,620
 

48
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:03,615

00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:05,115

00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:08,845

00:02:09,615 --> 00:02:11,185

00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:15,105

00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,105

00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:19,785

00:02:20,245 --> 00:02:21,405

00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:26,825

00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:27,815

00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,845

00:02:30,845 --> 00:02:33,565

00:02:34,105 --> 00:02:37,095
 

62
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,305
 

63
00:02:39,845 --> 00:02:41,815
 

64
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,655
 

65
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:48,645
 

66
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:53,645

00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,965

00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:58,635

00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,240
 

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,200
We are having the final exams in a month.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,980
So we decided to temporarily withhold our club activities.

80
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,640
So that you guys will have more time to study.

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,240
Before we leave today

82
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,000
I have an important survey for you to fill out

83
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,740
Answer honestly.

84
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,140
What do you feel about our Music Club?

85
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,920
I have a reward for the best answer.

86
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,760
The one giving the worst answer will stay here with me a bit longer

87
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
Damn you!

88
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,960
Give the right answers!

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
 

90
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,100
 

91
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,040
What do you write about me in the last question?

92
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Nosy!

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,180
I bet you wrote down something bad about me.

94
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,400
Let me see.

95
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,300
- I want to see.
- No

96
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,420
It’s mine.

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,880
Can I have a volunteer to share your answers?

98
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,080
Whose answers do you guys want to hear?

99
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,260
Sarawat!

100
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,160
Like I needed to ask.

101
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,020
Wat!

102
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,760
Come here and read out your opinion

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,740
Loud and clear.

104
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,940
Start with how do you feel about the Club President?

105
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,120
Don’t compliment too much. I hear it a lot

106
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,060
A club president is a holy figure.

107
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,280
People treat him with respect

108
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,860
But no one wants to be friends with

109
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,040
What the heck are you laughing at, Air?

110
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,620
I admire your honesty.

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,040
Very good.

112
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,020
Let’s move on.

113
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,020
What chord do you like the most?

114
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,240
C chord.

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,740
Why?

116
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,160
It’s the first chord I taught Tine to play.

117
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Too much love around this place.

118
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
And the last question

119
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,620
what do you feel about your video partner?

120
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,580
Answer nicely. I’m helping you here

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,060
For me…

122
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,240
Tine is a living thing…

123
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,780
that I want to call ‘nuisance’ for the rest of my life.

124
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,340
I’m jealous.

125
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,300
What’s up?

126
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,720
People in #SarawatsWives group said you guys shared a sweet moment in Music Club.

127
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
Nothing sweet!

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,140
He just wanted to call me a nuisance in front of people

129
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
 

130
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,700
I guess you haven’t seen what P’Dim posted on his IG.

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,260
What IG?

132
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Look.

133
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,640
[Dim: Sarawat’s answer sheet]

134
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,580
What do you feel about your video partner?

135
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,940
Tine = Wife

136
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 

137
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,620
That’s why he didn’t let me see what he wrote

138
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720
I don’t get it.

139
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,560
Why is he still hitting on you?

140
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Green is not after you anymore.

141
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
 

142
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,120
Why can’t you look me in the eyes?

143
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,480
Is there anything we don’t know?

144
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,200
So?

145
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,460
No.

146
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,580
Nothing.

147
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,720
High pitch voice.

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,760
Will you tell us right now or should we go ask him?

149
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,980
Fine.

150
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,520
He said he truly liked me.

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,220
And he is hitting on me for real.

152
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,980
Just what I thought.

153
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,060
What about you?

154
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,580
What do you feel about him?

155
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,180
Nothing much.

156
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,160
When I’m with him, my heart is light and weak

157
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,420
When I listen to Scrubb songs with him, the songs sound better

158
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,260
And when he gets his face close to mine,

159
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,520
my heart pounds like crazy.

160
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,420
But I guess that’s normal, right?

161
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,140
Normal my ass!

162
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,600
All the things you said…

163
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
are signs of someone falling in love

164
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,340
 

165
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,620
You’re right.

166
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,440
So have I fallen for him already?

167
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
Don’t rush it.

168
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
You might just be shaken by him.

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,020
Every time you were in a relationship, you were the one taking care of your date

170
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,100
But now you are being taken care of and pleased

171
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
it’s normal to be shaken.

172
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Especially, by someone looking that hot.

173
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,600
Right?

174
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,580
It’s our fault to get you close to him

175
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
Rest assured.

176
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,460
We will go check out hot girls and recall your player soul back

177
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,579
Tine.

178
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,780
Don’t look at him.

179
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,660
Let’s go.

180
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,400
Come.

181
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,060
Don’t look back

182
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 

183
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,900
Have you seen Phukong?

184
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,540
We have an extra class here, but he doesn’t show.

185
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,340
 

186
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,820
I heard from his friend that he is sick

187
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,300
He might be resting at his place.

188
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,900
 

189
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,260
You miss him, don’t you?

190
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,440
What? Did I just hit the spot?

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,220
It’s good that he skips class.

192
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,220
I will go home and sleep then.

193
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,400
Go then.

194
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,580
Bye.

195
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,260
Where are you guys dragging me to?

196
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,340
This is far enough from Sarawat.

197
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,140
We are not running away from Sarawat.

198
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,740
We are here to check out hot girls

199
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,100
Check out girls?

200
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,420
Here?

201
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Tine likes someone cute, fair-skinned, and tiny

202
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,520
You don’t know anything.

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,300
The final exams are coming up.

204
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,920
A lot of hot girls gather here to study

205
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,000
Wait a second

206
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,360
Is that Wan, Freshy Girl from Law international program?

207
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,180
I follow her IG account.

208
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,160
She looks so damn cute in person

209
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,240
Really?

210
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,840
We are Law students from the regular program

211
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,020
Would you mind if we sit here and study?

212
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,500
Sure.

213
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,300
We are done reading.

214
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
The seats are all yours

215
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,940
It’s okay, man.

216
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,040
Are you Tine?

217
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,920
Yes.

218
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,500
You know me?

219
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,340
How can I not know a University cheerleader?

220
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,940
Do you usually come here to read?

221
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,800
Do you want to join us next time?

222
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,200
 

223
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,340
Why are you doing nothing?

224
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,900
Take out your phone and get her Line ID.

225
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
Line?

226
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,620
Hell yeah!

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,680
Here.

228
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,340
Whenever you want to study, just tell us

229
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,980
We are always ready for you

230
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,280
We are a bunch of nerds.

231
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,820
Take it back.

232
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
I’ll Line you.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,700
Once a player, always a player.

234
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,440
You get back on the field for two seconds and already get a girl

235
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,040
Post it online and let Sarawat know that you have a new girl

236
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,740
so he can stop flirting with you.

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,360
Wait a moment.

238
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,280
What now?

239
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:32,980
Shit!

240
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,940
What?

241
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,540
Someone already posted something

242
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,860
Who?

243
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,940
Where?

244
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,960
[Man: This Saturday, my friend is going to beat Engineering. And someone is going to post a love confession to him online.]

245
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,160
Man?

246
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,940
If you guys lose, Sarawat has to leave my friend alone

247
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,200
Deal?

248
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,620
Whose football jersey is this?
