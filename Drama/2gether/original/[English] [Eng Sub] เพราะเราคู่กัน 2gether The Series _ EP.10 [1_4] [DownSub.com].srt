1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,740
Sarawat, the Political Science star player is sitting on the bench.

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,520
Is he injured?

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,700
Is he…

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,040
one of the Architecture students that hurt you yesterday?

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,180
What happened to your hand?

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,600
I am not afraid of other people

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,240
Just worried about a dog that backbites

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,740
I am up for a real fight too

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,440
I can’t let you perform in this condition

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Will my show be good enough to substitute Control S?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,440
Just ask him already.

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,440
If you don’t, I will freaking hit on him myself

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
Tine.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,180
I am so done flirting.

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,900
Will you be my boyfriend?

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,900
How are you shippers doing?

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,900
You are all squealing.

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,640
Even I was shipping them.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,600
And that was a surprise show from our Music Club.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,580
Now let them take a break backstage.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,160
Give them a big hand, guys!

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
It’s all ruined.

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,060
How could he say it was just a show?

24
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,160
If he didn’t say that, the rest of them wouldn’t get to perform.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,660
Yeah yeah! Hero!

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,620
We won’t help you ever again.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,940
We are off now.

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,360
So that was just part of the show?

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,340
I’m relieved then.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,320
I was in shock for a moment

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,320
Are you really happy that it wasn’t real?

32
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,979
Yes.

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,380
If it was real,

34
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240
I would feel really bad.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,200
I thought I could do this one thing for you

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,760
but I completely failed

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,180
You told me that…

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,300
it was supposed to be the happy ending scene in the movie.

39
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,460
I ruined it

40
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,120
though I had practiced really hard for it.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,780
Maybe…

42
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,360
I am not the protagonist in your movie

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,520
That scene doesn’t have to be the end of it.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,080
You can still give it a happy ending.

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,160
How?

46
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,280
If it is our movie,

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,400
you can choose…

48
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:27,000
whether you want it to end with tragedy

49
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,520
Or end with happiness

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,220
Just be my boyfriend now.

51
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,840
Quit playing already.

52
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,200
I am asking you for real

53
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,980
What do you say?

54
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,520
What will you choose?

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,840
What are you playing, Tine?

56
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,140
I hate movies with sad endings.

57
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
Yes

58
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Yes?

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
Yes. I am your boyfriend now.

60
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,400
[Sarawat already has a boyfriend. His name is Tine.]

61
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,100
You…

62
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,440
You are so damn cute!

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Ouch!

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,460
My leg!

65
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,500
Sorry.

66
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,620
Tine!

67
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,160
What?

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,540
We wanted to know if Sarawat asking you to be his boyfriend in the concert was a real thing

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
Uh…

70
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,740
It’s…

71
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,460
It’s…

72
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,080
You know what?

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,940
Fong thinks it’s real.

74
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,000
And he thinks you already said yes to him.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,020
Right.

76
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,940
Tine curses Sarawat three times a day.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,200
If he ends up being Sarawat’s boyfriend, then he is a loser

78
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,660
Loser?

79
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,740
Exactly.

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,540
So Tine?

81
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,300
Is it real or not?

82
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,280
Real.

83
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,800
Real my ass!

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,460
You know that he likes to tease me.

85
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,620
I am going to get a coffee.

86
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,840
Slow down.

87
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,900
What now?

88
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,840
Have you told your friends that we are together?

89
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
I haven’t

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,960
You told me you would tell everyone here today

91
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,840
Change of plan.

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,420
Can we tell them later?

93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,020
I need more time.

94
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,900
They are so ready to tease me.

95
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,340
What is wrong?

96
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,340
Are you mad?

97
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
No.

98
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,340
I…

99
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,520
want to grab your boobs.

100
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,340
WHAT?

101
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,640
I want to grab your boobs.

102
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,040
Now?

103
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,900
Can I?

104
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,440
Can I?

105
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,140
Yes but just once.

106
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,160
And don’t tell your friends that we are dating yet.

107
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,660
Can I squeeze?

108
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,860
Hell no!

109
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,620
That’s enough.

110
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,980
That’s all you got.

111
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,860
I just forgot about you

112
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,400
What were you two whispering about?

113
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,700
Did you just stop Sarawat from telling us that you’re together?

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
What?

115
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,180
We were talking about the Music Club.

116
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,980
Guys, I just won a lotto. This table eats for free.

117
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,980
Are you serious?

118
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,980
Of course.

119
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,560
On one condition though.

120
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,480
Let me kiss Sarawat on the cheek.

121
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,100
What will my friend get then?

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,520
OK.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,300
Everyone here eats for free then.

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Kiss him!

125
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,880
Kiss him!

126
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,200
Kiss him!

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,120
Kiss him!

128
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,360
Kiss him!

129
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,800
Kiss him!

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,900
Kiss him!

131
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,500
Do you see the guy in this picture?

132
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,720
I do

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,860
He is my boyfriend

134
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
- Who?
- I can’t let you kiss me

135
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
Damn it!

136
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,980
You said you wouldn’t tell our friends.

137
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,440
I wasn’t telling them.

138
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,060
I was telling the one hitting on me.

139
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,340
So they are boyfriends now.

140
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,840
What are you waiting for, guys?
Give them a round of applause!

141
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,540
Keep on clapping.

142
00:09:31,055 --> 00:09:34,145
 

143
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,845
 

144
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:41,185
 

145
00:09:41,185 --> 00:09:44,165
 

146
00:09:44,165 --> 00:09:47,155
 

147
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:50,155
 

148
00:09:50,205 --> 00:09:53,665
 

149
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:56,175
 

150
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:01,015
 

151
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,025
 

152
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:06,585
 

153
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,005
 

154
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,545
 

155
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:12,995
 

156
00:10:13,425 --> 00:10:16,625
 

157
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,875
 

158
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:20,635
 

159
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:24,475
 

160
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,545
 

161
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:28,725
 

162
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,685
 

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,920
 

164
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,420
The exams are finally over.

165
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,380
Right.

166
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,000
I was about to ask you to celebrate with us.

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
But someone is already here picking you up.

168
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,540
See you later.

169
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,440
See you.

170
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,700
Are you done with your exams?

171
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,280
Yes.

172
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,280
Should we go out and celebrate?

173
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,340
Exams are over and you are walking like a pro again.

174
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,220
It still hurts.

175
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,500
I think…

176
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,280
I need to ride on your back on the way to dinner.

177
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,420
I wish…

178
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,220
it really hurts.

179
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,960
You are in pain forever.

180
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,620
But If I’m in pain and you take care of me,

181
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I’m OK with that

182
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,360
You’re such a…

183
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,260
Come on.

184
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 

185
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,700
I need to go somewhere before dinner

186
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Wow!

187
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,760
This room is way better than my dorm.

188
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,080
It’s beautiful.

189
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
You like it?

190
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,920
I do!

191
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
Let’s go upstairs.

192
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,240
Whose room is it anyway?

193
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,840
I am thinking…

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,940
it can be our room.

195
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,900
What?

196
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,300
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now

197
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,640
I want to see you before I close my eyes to sleep.

198
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,160
And I want to see you first thing after I wake up.

199
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,260
Move in with me?

200
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,700
 

201
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,160
Stay with me tonight?

202
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,900
Stay with me tonight?

203
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Fine!

204
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,300
Yes! It’s our love lair.

205
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,020
Come here!

206
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,800
Should we put our clothes together in the same basket?

207
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,540
Why?

208
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,800
Come on.

209
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,440
No. We need to separate them.

210
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,500
I want some.

211
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,360
Don’t spill it.

212
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,160
Why did you bring a ball with you?

213
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,980
What?

214
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,620
It is clean.

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,740
Hey!

216
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,800
Tine, don’t!

217
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,080
You like to bug me, don’t you?

218
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,040
Okay. You can have some.

219
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,980
Where are you putting it?

220
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,000
Don’t know.

221
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Put it right here.

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,260
Dipshit!

223
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
 

224
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 

225
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,760
I can’t.

226
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,120
Help me

227
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,200
Oh!

228
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,300
I am trying to pick a song to play at the contest.

229
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,460
Play a Scrubb song.

230
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,580
I knew it.

231
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,180
I will…

232
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,620
if you let me kiss you on the cheek.

233
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,240
No way!

234
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
No?

235
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,960
No.

236
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,220
Just one kiss?

237
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,600
No.

238
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,140
Fine then.

239
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,580
A Scrubb song will be played

240
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,020
Here it is.

241
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,340
A housewarming gift for you two.

242
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,600
Thanks, bro.

243
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
Wait!

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,240
What kind of flower are these wrapped in plastic?

245
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,600
Holy shit!!

246
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,460
They are condoms.

247
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,440
For a newly wedded couple.

248
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,560
 

249
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,400
Why are you guys turning red?

250
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
 

251
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,220
Is it hot in here?

252
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,300
No. It’s cool.

253
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,760
Are you turning red because of the condom bouquet?

254
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,740
We are interrupting their sweet moment.

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,060
We will be out of your hair now.

256
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,700
Right. Just go already.

257
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,420
But we just got here.

258
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,500
120 condoms in there.

259
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,620
Be careful with those.

260
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,260
Didn’t you lock the door? How did they get in?

261
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
I don’t know.

262
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,220
What a gross bouquet!

263
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,820
Besides Man and Boss’s, there’s another gift too.

264
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Ah huh.

265
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,340
Are you more interested in your phone than me?

266
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Ah huh.

267
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Hey!

268
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,840
I am sorry.

269
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,880
What did you just say?

270
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,680
Forget it.

271
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,400
You can continue playing on your phone.

272
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,500
I am sorry.

273
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,540
I didn’t ignore you.

274
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,200
You can see it for yourself.

275
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,260
[I like Sarawat.]

276
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,080
You promised to post a love confession to me.

277
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
Are you still mad, sir?

278
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
I am

279
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
I’m mad at myself for not being able to be mad at you, little buffalo!

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,860
What were you talking about just now?

281
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:27,079
I have something for you too.

282
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,060
Thank you for moving in with me

283
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,460
Wait!

284
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
It’s the pick I cut in half.

285
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,560
You kept it

286
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,080
I keep everything about you

287
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,240
If I could, I would keep you locked up in there

288
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,260
So the two of us can stay together forever.

289
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,920
Hey!

290
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,420
It could be my mom

291
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,020
She might be wondering about the new place

292
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,740
I’m gonna talk to her for a bit.

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,380
[Who the hell is Sarawat?]

294
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,960
[Why is he with my boy?]

295
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,840
Tine is my boyfriend. F*ck off!

296
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Tine!

297
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,280
Who the hell is this guy?

298
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,460
What?

299
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,600
He said you’re his.

300
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,580
Did he ever hit on you or something?

301
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,600
Where?

302
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
 

303
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,000
SHIT!

304
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,240
What?

305
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,960
The one you were talking to is…

306
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,160
Tonight, can I…?

307
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,180
Either you say yes or I continue pouting.

308
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,740
Yes or no?
