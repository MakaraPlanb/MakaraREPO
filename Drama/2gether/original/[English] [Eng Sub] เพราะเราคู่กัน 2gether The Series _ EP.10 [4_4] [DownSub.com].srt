00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,375
 

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,500
 

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,300
I heard the word ‘boyfriend.’

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,860
I’m going to ask you one last time.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
Are you two boyfriends?

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,080
We are just friends.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
He is my boyfriend.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,440
Yell at me all you want.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,540
Just leave him alone.

13
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,220
I asked him to keep it a secret from you.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,280
Cuddling each other on the couch is your way of keeping secret?

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,600
You know?

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,460
Of course I know.

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,620
I’m just waiting for you to tell me

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,300
I am sorry.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,960
I was afraid you couldn’t accept me this way

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,140
I am your brother.

21
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,940
I can accept whatever you are.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,600
I am just worried about you

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,820
I wanted to test you two at first

24
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,780
If my yellow tape couldn’t stop you from going to him, how can I?

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
As for you,

26
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
I don’t trust you

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,260
And I’m not so sure you can take care of my little brother.

28
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,560
I won’t ask you to believe me

29
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,680
But I will show you.

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,480
And I will keep watching.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,760
But first,

32
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,780
look after your friend.

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,360
Don’t let him come near me.

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Don’t you want me all to yourself?

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,580
Come on.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,900
Let’s give a toast and welcome your brother-in-law

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,720
Don’t touch me, Man.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,900
Stay away from me!

39
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,979
Stop scowling.

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,620
Come with me.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,600
Trust me.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
Man!

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,080
Stop it!

44
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
P’Mil,

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,580
can I ask you something?

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,800
You didn’t mean to break my brother’s leg, did you?

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,920
You think I’m such a good guy?

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Yes.

49
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,320
Just leave it.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,660
It was a long time ago.

51
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,460
That’s true.

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,680
I have something to tell you.

53
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,520
If I can goal, you will get to hear it.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,520
If not, it will remain a secret

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,960
I guess I’m not lucky enough to hear it.

56
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,440
Well, I have something to tell you too

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,040
I like you…

58
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,920
like a brother.

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,580
Like a real brother

60
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,920
I have nothing for you to keep.

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,880
Consider it a farewell gift from the tutor camp.

62
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,260
Wear it when you take an exam.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,740
So you don’t exceed the time limit

64
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,760
Thank you.

65
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,120
Thank you for everything…

66
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,760
everything you’ve done for me.

67
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,200
I’ll get going now.

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,780
Stand still.

69
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,840
Do you want to change yourself

70
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,840
or you want my help?

71
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
Hey!

72
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,620
Don’t help.

73
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
We haven’t talked about you making me jealous yet.

74
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,300
That was all Man’s plan.

75
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,960
I didn’t plot that.

76
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,440
But if you’re still mad,

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,440
you can punish me all night right here

78
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
Stop!

79
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,520
My brother can see.

80
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,500
Wait!

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,020
Where is he?

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,740
Your brother passed out.

83
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,840
Man took him to his place, so he won’t be our third wheel here

84
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,320
Damn!

85
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,860
Man must be eating him up by now

86
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,120
No, Man!

87
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,420
You are a gentleman.

88
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,620
You are a gentleman!

89
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,040
I just can’t.

90
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,620
My friend might be foul-mouthed, but he is a gentleman

91
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
 

92
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,860
You said your brother would stay for a week.

93
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Ask your friend what he did to my brother

94
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,200
Hey! You’re awake.

95
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,360
Can you get up?

96
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,020
What a dickhead!

97
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,280
I didn’t do anything.

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,520
He ran home like The Flash.

99
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
He doesn’t have to stay for a week anyway.

100
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,120
He learns the truth in one day.

101
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,060
Do you think he knows because we live together?

102
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,680
Isn’t it right?

103
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,360
He said his brother had listened only to Scrubb all his life.

104
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,380
But lately, his brother has been listening to some indie bands

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,920
Then he saw these indie band CDs on my desk.

106
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,340
I guess he knew right away that I’m your special someone

107
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,160
You’re wrong.

108
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,020
I’m just trying to open my ears to other genres

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,220
It doesn’t have anything to do with you.

110
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,720
Well, I have downloaded a bunch of indie songs in here

111
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Wanna listen?

112
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
No I don’t.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,600
I’m gonna use a bathroom.

114

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,120
Hello. Test. Test.

116
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
Have you recorded already, Boss?

117
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,620
It’s recording.

118
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,060
Hold on.

119
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Do you think he will like it?

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
Not just like.

121
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,460
He will love it.

122
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,180
Just admit you want to hear it

123
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,740
Don’t pretend like you don’t, little buffalo.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,200
Give it here.

125
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,560

Do you have a place to sit?

133
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,380
You can sit here.

134
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,760
I heard Architecture students have a hell of workload.

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,140
How come you have time to travel?

136
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,640
They said the stars there were breath-taking.

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,800
Wanna see?

138
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,860
I forgot my sunscreen

139
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,540
I brought it. You can use mine

140
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,300
He is my boyfriend. I can take care of him.

141
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,180
We have another fun activity for you. We are going to test your bravery

142
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,920
You guys will pair up and go into the forest

143
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,240
Shit! It’s raining.

144
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
You go back to the camp

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,260
