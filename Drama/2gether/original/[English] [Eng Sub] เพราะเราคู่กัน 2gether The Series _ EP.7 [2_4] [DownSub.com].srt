1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,815
 

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,655
 

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,140
 

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Really?

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,620
Open it.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,140
P’Dim!

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,340
 

10
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,200
Are you Green’s boyfriend?

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
Ex-boyfriend.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,320
When did we break up, Green?

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,620
On that day.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,760
We broke up for 2 minutes and then made love in bed

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,140
Is this what you call a breakup?

16
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,920
Why do you think I brought Green who can’t play any musical instrument into Music Club?

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,460
Of course, I needed to keep an eye on him.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,280
I just didn’t think that his new lover is in the club too.

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,700
It’s not that.

20
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,280
You’re misunderstanding.

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,900
Step aside if you don’t want to get hurt

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
 

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,500
No.

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,880
You might be his boyfriend, but you have no right to hurt him.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,580
I said step aside!

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 

27
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
 

28
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,600
Green, I am sorry.

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,760
I am sorry I hurt you

30
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,680
I know how you feel now.

31
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,320
It hurts me so bad to see you with someone else.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,560
Aren’t you here to yell at me?

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,840
No.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,500
I came to apologize

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,840
and tell him something.

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,040
If you hurt Green, prepare to get hurt even more

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
P’Dim.

38
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,620
Let me see.

39
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,640
Does it hurt?

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,480
It did

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,660
but the pain is gone now

42
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,300
Will you forgive me?

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,900
I can never be angry with you.

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
Come on. Let’s go home

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,680
Tine.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,480
I am sorry.

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,060
I won’t be bothering you again.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,740
I hope you and Sarawat are together forever.

49
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,600
Let’s go home.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,420
Someone dropped this.

51
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,440
I think it is his

52
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,220
People normally come here to escape from heartbreaks or unfortunate situations

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,720
Thank you.

54
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,040
Excuse me

55
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,300
Have you seen the guy sleeping next to me last night?

56
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,280
He went home.

57
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,380
How can I help?

58
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,940
Can I have his number, please?

59
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,160
I can’t give you that. It’s personal information

60
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
Go back to your meditation, please

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,160
Please. At least tell me his name.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
I really can’t

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,580
Please, pretty lady.

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,300
The young man who went home forget to take his phone

65
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,760
I’ll just leave it here.

66
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,640
I will call someone to pick it up later

67
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,340
Sarawat.

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,300
Yesterday, Green was…

69
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,240
Good timing.

70
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,360
Try this.

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,320
What are you playing now?

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,160
What kind of person do you think I am?

73
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,980
This is good and I want to share it with you.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,220
Hasn’t it ever occurred to you…

75
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,900
that when you see something nice, you want to share it with me?

76
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,680
No?

77
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,420
I don’t know

78
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,360
What kind of question is this?

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Do you want to try?

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,500
Try to get to know each other.

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
You don’t have to like me very much.

82
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,840
Just keep your heart open for me.

83
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,105
 

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 

85
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,520
CUT!

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Was it good?

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,640
Did you just practice your lines with me?

88
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,520
Do you think I just confessed my love to you?

89
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,180
What a relief!

90
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,280
 

91
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Sorry.

92
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,640
My class finished later than expected.

93
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,880
Did they start with the makeup yet?

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,500
No one is here yet.

95
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,920
That’s great.

96
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,380
Sarawat, have you seen the new playlist?

97
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,220
Well.

98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,640
How about we play Desktop Error song?

99
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,300
It’s really difficult.

100
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,340
I am trying to transcribe it.

101
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,540
The Connect is also interesting.

102
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,560
See? I included their songs here.

103
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,540
I know you so well, don’t I?

104
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,900
Are you guys trying to pick a song?

105
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,660
Let me help you.

106
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,180
You don’t know any bands besides Scrubb

107
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
Stay out of it.

108
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,160
I just heard this song the other day

109
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,840
It is super awesome.

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,420
Just listen.

111
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,720
If it’s great, we can include this one instead

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,960
Right!

113
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,580
I heard it and thought of you

114
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
 

115
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:17,405
 

116
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,720
 

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,080
Hey!

118
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
It’s good.

119
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,240
I am gonna go get us some drinks.

120
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,200
 

121
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
It’s good.

122
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,460
It’s awesome.

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,580
Include it on the list.

124
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,980
It’s a good choice.

125
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,960
That’s why I want you to hear it.

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,220
I liked it the first time I heard.

127
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,540
it’s cool.

128
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,640
Earn, let’s go get changed

129
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,780
Do you want to try?

130
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,520
Try to get to know each other.

131
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,600
- You don’t have to like me very much
- I…

132
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,740
Just keep your heart open for me

133
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,560
Sarawat just posted a picture.

134
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,520
I don’t give a sh*t!

135
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,840
Tine.

136
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,220
Just tell me what is wrong
