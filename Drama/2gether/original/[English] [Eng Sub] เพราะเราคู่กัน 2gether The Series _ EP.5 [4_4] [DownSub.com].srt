00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,780
Sorry to interrupt.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,540
 

8
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:28,735

00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:30,335
 

10
00:00:31,195 --> 00:00:32,195
 

11
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,415
 

12
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,115
 

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
What?

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,460
Where are you?

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,820
Why is it so loud?

17
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,340
Not your business.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,540
Fine.

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,060
I’ll call you later then

20
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,740
I am so pissed

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,720
Pissed at me?

22
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,460
No.

23
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,440
I was talking to my friends.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,660
Bye then.

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,480
I am so pissed!

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,340
You already told that to your friends.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,740
I wasn’t telling them. I was telling you.

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,160
What?

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,980
[Passed out right after hanging up. And he said he wasn’t drunk.]

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,360
[Time for revenge. I am gonna post all the pics in his phone.]

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,960
Your mom said you’d never had a girlfriend.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,720
What kind of person do you like?

33
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,120
Do you like the weird one?

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,080
I must really like a weird person.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,860
And it is so weird that…

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,460
the one I like is…

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,960
[Wat typed this. I’m helping him just because he sucks.]

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,360
Is there anything going on between you and Sarawat?

39
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
Are you crazy?

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,860
Of course not.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,680
Are you telling me that he created an IG account and followed only you

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,240
and his phone is full of your pictures…

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,940
all of this is just a plan to flirt with you to fool Green?

44
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,380
That’s right

45
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,160
Do you really think he actually likes me?

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,560
And what about this message?

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,660
What does he want to tell?

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,220
Is it a code that only you two know?

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,140
No.

50
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,840
He must have typed it when he was drunk

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,280
Why hasn’t he deleted it yet?

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,340
Is it short for something?

53
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,480
It’s easy guys.

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,980
Just google it and find out.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,300
Change the language first.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,460
Sorry.

57
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,780
Wait! Keep on typing.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,980
I loke you.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,100
What?

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,140
Wait!

61
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,560
Sarawat always makes typos

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,520
Look here.

63
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,520
O and I are close.

64
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,740
Maybe he wanted to say he liked you.

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,580
He likes me?

66
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Hello.

67
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,900
I washed your football jersey

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
So?

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,000
Nothing. Where should I give it to you?

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No need.

71
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
I will go get it myself

72
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,760
Hey!

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,280
Hello.

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,580
 

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,380
Are you drunk?

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,560
Where is my jersey?

77
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
There.

78
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,800
Wait!

79
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,740
What?

80
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,860
Hey!

81
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,540
A senior at the club asked to see our video.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
I grabbed an extra guitar here just in case

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,600
But if you can’t right now, let’s…

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,060
You okay?

85
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,560
Hi guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic.

86
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,680
The person next to me is Sarawat.

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360

Bye now.

111
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,340
Hey!

112
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,520
Sit down first.

113
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,440
 

114
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,840
I…

115
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,720
I will seriously be hitting on Pear

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Did you hear what I said?

117
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,220
I said I will seriously hit on Pear.

118
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,920
You will hit on her.

119
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,640
So I’m just your secret lover?

120
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,620
Wait!

121
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,880
Should I act heartbroken?

122
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,800
Should I cry?

123
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,560
Hey!

124
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,160
What is wrong with you?

125
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,940
I just want to have a girlfriend. Why are you…

126
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,020
You are reserved.

127
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,980
Don’t ever hit on anyone.

Between Green and Sarawat, I can’t tell who is more dangerous

134
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,840
What are you doing to me?

135
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,940
Take it all off.

136
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Why are you mad?

137
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,500
Don’t you remember what you did to me?

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,920
Last night, I was drunk.

139
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
And I…

140
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,580
Who said I hit on Tine just to get rid of you?

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,140
I do it because I really like him.

142
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,520
Faculty of Architecture is not easy

143
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,740
That’s why I need a great tutor like you.
