1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,205
 

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,185
 

3
00:00:04,745 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,900
 

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Well well.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,440
Look at you all so dull just because of a boyfriend’s brother.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,600
Don't worry. An outsider like me will find a way to help you.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Where is he?

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,420
Right there.

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,220
Walking along with Tine.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,300
Don’t go too far. He is Tine’s brother

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,660
Rest assured.

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,780
My life has no brakes.

15
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,440
When he comes, I am gonna yell at his face that…

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,700
DAMN!

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,220
What?

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,500
Tine’s brother is the guy I met at the seminar.

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,580
The one I’ve been looking for.

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,560
That’s why he looks so familiar.

21
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,180
What are you looking at?

22
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,320
Looking at a cute guy like you.

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,940
I have been looking for you everywhere

24
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,620
What a surprise you are Tine’s brother.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,520
Do I know you?

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,200
You don’t remember me?

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
No.

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,140
You are never in my memories

29
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,700
And I don’t think I ever associated with someone like you.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,480
But I really want to associate with someone like you.

31
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,500
How about we start with something simple?

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
Like you being my boyfriend?

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,560
Jackass!

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,700
If you say yes, I promise to say goodnight to you every night.

35
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,200
In daytime, I will be looking at you without blinking

36
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,620
P’Type!!

37
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,100
Calm down.

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,300
Man’s brain is not fully functional

39
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,460
He is in treatment actually.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,020
Let me take you to read over there

41
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,640
Come on

42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,860
Calm down.

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,520
Calm down.

44
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,580
Thanks.

45
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,640
He hates us even more.

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,760
Who would think this world could be so small?

47
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,340
Invite P’Type to a party tonight.

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,520
I will make him open up to me

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,300
No

50
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
I mean open up to you

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,440
I wish you all pass the test and be in the Faculty of Architecture soon

52
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Who are you missing?

53
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Judging from your puppy eyes,

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,620
I wonder if you’re thinking about that kid you tutored

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,140
You’re wrong.

56
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,280
He is not coming.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,420
He hates me.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,020
Why? Did you two fight?

59
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,680
I had a fight with his brother.

60
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,260
I like his brother’s boyfriend

61
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,320
What is he mad at you about then?

62
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,840
About you having a fight with his brother…

63
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,920
or about you liking someone else?

64
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,940
I’ll have the same, please.

65
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,100
The place is closed for a private party.

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,720
I can’t take your order.

67
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:14,905
 

68
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,105
 

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
 

70
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,480
Mil told me to keep it for you

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,140
[L Co Hol]

72
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,440
This is my friend, Oak.

73
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,680
The more the merrier.

74
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,580
Do I sit here beside Sarawat?

75
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,480
What does his boyfriend have to say?

76
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,620
No boyfriends here.

77
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,040
We are all friends.

78
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,320
We are all single.

79
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,800
What about you?

80
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,680
Your loved one is OK with you here?

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
I’m not taken.

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,840
I am very single

83
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,580
What kind of person do you like then?

84
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,140
I can recommend you one

85
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,600
No type.

86
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,660
The one I feel right is the right one

87
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,600
Liverpool is playing tonight.

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,820
Really?

89
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,640
Let’s watch it.

90
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,780
How did you know I like Liverpool?

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,660
The way you play on the field tells me.

92
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,020
I see Mohammed Salah in you.

93
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,540
Your friend here is not bad, Man.

94
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,620
Cheers to the new friend!

95
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,340
Bottoms up!

96
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
Bottoms up!

97
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,620
Bottoms up!

98
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,420
Let’s watch it.

99
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,520
 

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,020
 

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
1-0

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,740
Let me mix you a drink.

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,100
To Liverpool.

104
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,300
It’s so great to have a friend to watch football games with

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,000
 

106
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,020
Tine, what’s the matter?

107
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,480
Why are you following me here?

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,040
Go back and talk more about football games

109
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,540
And what’s wrong with that?

110
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,060
You said I needed to act like a friend.

111
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
You think I’m okay with that?

112
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,600
Do you think you’re the one who feels uncomfortable?

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,860
I’m uncomfortable just like you

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,560
Why do you put up with it then?

115
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,700
Do you want me to tell him that I’m your boyfriend?

116
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,420
Or should I say I’m jealous?

117
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,760
Or should I just say to my brother's face that you're not just a friend?

118
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,520
Is that what you want?

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
What did you just say?

120
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,940
I asked what did you just say?

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,840
I have something to tell you

122
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,780
If I can goal, you’ll get to hear it.

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,180
But if you’re still mad, you can punish me all night right here
