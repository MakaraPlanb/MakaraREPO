00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,860

00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,235
 

6
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:13,415

00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:15,855

00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:17,355

00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,495
 

10
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:21,105
 

11
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:23,595
 

12
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,345
 

13
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:28,345
 

14
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:32,025
 

15
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,665
 

16
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:39,065
 

17
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:41,945
 

18
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:45,035
 

19
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,155
 

20
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:49,335
 

21
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:51,545
 

22
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,055
 

23
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:58,895
 

24
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:00,905
 

25
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:05,885
 

26
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:08,205
 

27
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,875
 

28
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:14,505
 

29
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:16,755
 

30
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,505
 

31
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,405
 

32
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:22,355
 

33
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:24,425
 

34
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,605
 

35
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:30,555
 

36
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,500
 

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,360
Between Green and Sarawat, I can’t even tell who is more dangerous at this point.

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,540
What are you doing?

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,560
Take them all off.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,840
Why are you mad?

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,460
Don’t you remember what you did to me at all?

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,680
I was drunk last night.

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,620
And then…

44
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,980
Who said I flirted with him just to get rid of you?

45
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,660
I did it because I really like him.

46
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,880
I told you Architecture is not easy

47
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,340
That’s why I need a great tutor like you.

48
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,520
2 nights of meditation retreat?

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,140
My band is playing at L Co Hol tonight

50
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,460
It’s like a big rehearsal for the opening act for Scrubb this Saturday.

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,260
♪ Look for it in every feeling we have ♫

52
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,160
I was here watching their concert last year.

53
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,320
I got the same feeling

54
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,000
God! I miss that time

55
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,440
I was really happy.

56
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,180
I know

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,900
How did you know?

58
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,060
Because…

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
you looked so happy in this concert.

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Let’s go

61
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,060
Stop asking.

62
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,040
A year has passed but I still remember the feeling so well.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,320
It was the first Scrubb concert in my life

64
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,100
The songs they played were those I had listened to a thousand times before.

65
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,760
But when I got to hear them at a live concert

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,260
the good songs sounded even better

67
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,820
Scrubb will have a moment with fans after the concert

68
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,560
Can you take a photo of me and them?

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,880
Wait!

70
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,500
Did you misunderstand something here?

71
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,560
At our lustful party, everyone must speak out one truth on their mind

72
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,220
You asked me which Scrubb concert I liked the most

73
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,600
I am about to tell you here.

74
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,940
How is it wrong?

75
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,000
Wrong!

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,540
Because Scrubb concert that you like the most is definitely not that one

77
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,340
This recent one sure is.

78
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
 

79
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,120
I couldn’t see

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,380
So, I grabbed his shoulder. That’s all.

81
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,200
If you don’t believe me, ask him

82
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,160
Now that you are mentioned, my friend.

83
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,180
How did you feel to have someone holding on to you like that?

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,760
Happy.

85
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,820
You turn red.

86
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:09,985
 

87
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
 

88
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
What are you looking at?

89
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,760
If you were my boyfriend

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,000
I’d kiss you everywhere from your hair to your shadow

91
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,640
 

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,300
You really are a perv

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,620
Man told me to practice that line with you in case we see Green

94
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,720
I just didn’t think anyone would blush to it.

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,860
Damn! I can’t be more envious.

96
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,980
I heard you met someone at a seminar

97
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,180
When will you introduce us your special someone?

98
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,640
Introduce?

99
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,240
In my dreams!

100
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,360
We haven’t said a word to each other.

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,100
I heard that he is attending a mediation retreat

102
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,360
I don’t know if I’m going to follow him there

103
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,940
Follow him?

104
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,240
Once you step foot in a temple, you will get burned to death by hellfire

105
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,760
Not arguing on that.

106
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,680
But trying to change is not going to hurt

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,200
Like you guys.

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,420
How?

109
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,020
Look at Sarawat.

110
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,520
He changed

111
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,040
He is on IG, the thing he never laid eyes on.

112
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,500
He is a very possessive kind of guy but lets you borrow his guitar.

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,880
Because of that, I get to see him smile like normal people

114
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,720
I have news for you.

115
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,540
It’s our club tradition to form a band out of the top skilled members.

116
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,640
The band is called CTRL S.

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,480
Sarawat will be the bandleader

118
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,260
And this is their poster

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
 

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,480
Upside down.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Sorry.

122
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,660
If you think this is cool, you need to see my…

123
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,600
I heard that you named the band yourself.

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,780
What is it from?

125
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,320
On a computer, we hit CTRL + S to save

126
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,420
It’s like we are saving good memories in our hearts

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,860
 

128
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,140
Nice name.

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,520
It reminds me of when I named my band…

130
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,920
P’Dim.

131
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,400
Besides the poster, do we get any more surprises from the band?

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,780
I’ll get to the point then

133
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,720
Damn you, Air!

134
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,120
To catch up with the trend these days

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,520
we will have a music video to promote the band

136
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
Sarawat will be the male lead.

137
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,520
But we are looking for the female lead

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,880
So may I just choose now?

139
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
You wish.

140
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,180
Stop it, Green. I said female.

141
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,540
Knock it off!

142
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,140
Let’s go for…Earn!

143
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,720
Yes. You’re a band member anyway

144
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,640
It’s like a band promo.

145
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,200
Go for it.

146
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
You too, Wat.

147
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,920
Clap your hands, people

148
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,240
Are you guys jealous of Earn?

149
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,940
Want some?

150
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,700
No. You eat.

151
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,620
Not hungry?

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
I just want to be with you.

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,220
 

154
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,620
I will be busier with my band and stuff

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,300
You might not be seeing me often.

156
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,280
Come closer.

157
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,940
I have something to tell.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,420
 

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 

160
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
What the heck are you doing?

161
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,060
Too much air in my stomach

162
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,660
I think you should go puke in the toilet

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,540
I already did.

164
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,320
Puke again.

165
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,560
You just spoiled the mood

166
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,460
Haha! So funny.

167
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,420
Sarawat!

168
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,900
Can I have your number?

169
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,080
I’ll call you and discuss the music video tonight

170
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
 

171
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
 

172
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,700
Thank you

173
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,220
Don’t call so late.

174
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,560
I thought I would message you but then it’d be so hard for you to type things right

175
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,260
I type OK now.

176
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
Really?

177
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,580
So how is it going with the song?

178
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,000
It’s going OK.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,620
But I will be free to practice only after classes

180
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,760
Can I go practice with you when I finish classes too?

181
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,860
May we have your phone, please?

182
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,380
Can’t I take it inside with me?

183
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,540
No, sir.

184
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,440
Just in case I need to exchange contacts with anyone for discussing Dhamma

185
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
No, sir.

186
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,340
People normally come here to escape from heartbreaks or unfortunate situations

187
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,540
Contacting with the outside world is prohibited

188
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,200
But some people might be here hoping to find love.

189
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,880
That’s even more impossible.

190
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,240
Everyone in this camp is forbidden to talk to each other

191
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,260
What!?!

192
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,580
We can’t even talk on breaks?

193
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,820
No, sir.

194
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,280
If you’re not sure, you can still change your mind

195
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,300
Here then.

196
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,400
Thank you.

197
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,560
Right foot.

198
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,860
Left foot.

199
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,020
Focus on your steps.

200
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,600
Right foot.

201
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Left foot.

202
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,520
Try to focus on your breathing.

203
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,280
When you breathe in, think “Bud.”

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,260
When you breathe out, think “Dho.”

205
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,340
Try to control your mind.

206
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,060
Excuse me.

207
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,300
Can we switch places?

208
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,180
Thank you.

209
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,600
You go!

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
That’s it.

211
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,720
I heard Sarawat is forming a new band.

212
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,600
Yes. Why?

213
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,700
His guitarist is so cute. What’s her name?

214
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,380
It’s time to leave now.

215
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,980
I will go to bed early.

216
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,920
What?

217
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,480
It’s only 8.

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,360
I need to get enough sleep for the cheerleader photoshoot tomorrow

219
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,580
need to have nice and clear skin

220
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,100
Unlike yours.

221
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,640
Fine!

222
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,400
I will get out of here then.

223
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,005
 

224
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
 

225
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
 

226
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,160
Green!

227
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,400
What are you doing here?

228
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,500
Can I get inside, please?

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,880
No. Just go back.

230
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,540
Tine, listen to me first.

231
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
My ex-boyfriend is chasing me

232
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,960
I don’t know where else to hide

233
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,580
I think you might be able to help.

234
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
Please help.

235
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,440
Please, Tine.

236
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,840
Please.

237
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,440
My ex-boyfriend is a short-tempered guy

238
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,360
He always hurt me when I did something wrong

239
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,680
I couldn’t take it so I asked to take a break

240
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,760
And he refused, didn’t he?

241
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,520
He didn’t refuse.

242
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,020
But when he found out I had a new boyfriend, he got really jealous

243
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,700
He went to see me at my dorm

244
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,240
I saw him first so I ran to you

245
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
Hold on a second.

246
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,980
Who is your new boyfriend? Do not say that

247
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,380
It’s you, Tine.

248
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,140
Just what I thought.

249
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,520
I guess he’s on his way here

250
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,060
He doesn’t know that you live here.

251
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,820
 

252
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,380
Tine, it’s my ex.

253
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,360
What do I do?

254
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,660
 

255
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,140
Let’s do this.

256
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,760
You open the door

257
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,340
Really?

258
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,780
Someone dropped this.

259
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,380
I think it is his

260
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,120
Let’s try to get to know each other
