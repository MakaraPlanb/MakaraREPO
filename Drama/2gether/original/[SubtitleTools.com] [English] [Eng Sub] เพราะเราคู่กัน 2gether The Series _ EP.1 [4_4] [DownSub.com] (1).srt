1
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,020
Tine.

2
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,200
Tine. Are you okay?

3
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,300
Where is this place?

4
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,480
University of course.

5
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,580
Where do you think?

6
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
Just kidding.

7
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,080
University of course. Where do you think?

8
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,620
If it wasn’t for me, you would be dead already.

9
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,200
Or you want to go to my house?

10
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,380
Or you want to go to my house?

11
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,440
I will stay with you tonight to take care of you.

12
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,460
Tine.

13
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,760
Tine.

14
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,080
Tine!

15
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,240
P’Fang.

16
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,620
I’m on my way to a share-coded dinner. You want to come with me?

17
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,680
That’s okay. I’m going to…find…

18
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,940
Tine!

19
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,140
Never mind. Let’s go.

20
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Tine!

21
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,440
Wait up!

22
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,660
Let’s cheer for Ann.

23
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Go girl!

24
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,820
My name is Ann. I am a freshman.

25
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,860
I hate grumpy face. All I do is smile. Do you, seniors, like it?

26
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,780
And the next one…Go girl!

27
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,800
Tine! Wait up!!

28
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,840
Hey! Where are you going?

29
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
It’s your turn to introduce yourself.

30
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,980
I’m going to a restroom

31
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,280
Don’t be shy!

32
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,339
Come on. Get up there. It’s our tradition.

33
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:30,879
Don’t be shy. Up on stage.

34
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,620
It’s our tradition.

35
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,640
Quickly. Ann did it

36
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,540
Let’s cheer for Tine.

37
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,820
Go on

38
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,760
My name is Tine. I am a freshman…

39
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,700
What? That’s all you got?

40
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,340
Show more energy!

41
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,760
Come on.

42
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,300
Don’t keep it to yourself!

43
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
Come on.

44
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,020
My name is Tine.

45
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,140
I am a cute freshman.

46
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,600
My friends call me Mr.Chic

47
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,220
I can be top but bottom is also fine

48
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,420
I like to strike hard. Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!

49
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,640
We want more!

50
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,040
Get down here

51
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Give him a big hand.

52
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,500
I like the cry.

53
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,920
Cheers to that ‘Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!’

54
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,120
What were you laughing at?

55
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,260
Do you have a problem with the way I introduce myself?

56
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,540
I don’t.

57
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
It’s cute

58
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Damn it!

59
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,300
What the heck are you doing?

60
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,320
Getting your phone number.

61
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,460
Give it back.

62
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,940
Give it here.

63
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,040
If you want it back, then give me your number.

64
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,860
What are you playing at?

65
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,060
Shit!

66
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,200
I am sorry.

67
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,560
I will get it repaired

68
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,340
What are you doing?

69
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,160
Give it back.

70
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,680
What if you disappear on me?

71
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,080
Once you get it fixed, you can have yours back.

72
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,780
Don’t you trust me?

73
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,320
Damn right!

74
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,480
Damn it!

75
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,980
How much will it cost me?

76
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,880
Congratulations!

77
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,380
You finally got his number

78
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,560
I asked for his number but I got a broken phone waiting to get fixed

79
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
Is it worth it?

80
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
You’re right.

81
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,180
He must have something on his phone

82
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,160
that I can use to blackmail him to help me.

83
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,180
Wait. Aren’t you afraid that he can get into your phone?

84
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,820
Don’t worry. My phone is locked.

85
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,060
I’m sure he can never unlock it.

86
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,380
What’s wrong with my Facebook?

87
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,940
They might be spams.

88
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,980
[Tine Mr.Chic: He looks so yummy.

89
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,040
I want to eat Sarawat.]

90
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,920
You asshole!

Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

92
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,820
Wait. I have something to say to you.

93
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,900
But I don’t.

94
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,500
I just found you the way.

95
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,580
Get into his club

96
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,160
If you’re in the same club he’s in, you will to see him more often

97
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,260
Before you become our club members, you need to go through our special welcoming ceremony.

98
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,840
Do you like Sarawat?

99
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,960
I saw you joined Sarawat’s Wives Group.

100
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Did Sarawat agree to help you already?

101
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,720
You have to hurry because Green gets you kicked out of that club

102
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,360
Don’t worry. I see him often now.

103
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,560
I will ask him to help me.

104
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,340
What?

105
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,740
My guitar. Its strings won’t hurt you like that one does. Try it.

106
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,720
University Board doesn’t allow more members than we agreed on

107
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,320
Newbies have to go through a test. The ones that fail will be out.

108
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,160
It’s a good idea to change a club.

109
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,960
You won’t pass the test

110
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,420
If I pass, you have to be my fake boyfriend. Deal?

111
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,220
The result is out, guys.
