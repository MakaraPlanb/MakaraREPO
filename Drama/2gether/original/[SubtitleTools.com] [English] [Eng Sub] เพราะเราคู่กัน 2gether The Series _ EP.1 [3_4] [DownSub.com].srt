1
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,980
Sarawat!

2
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,720
You, asshole! Sarawat!

3
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,420
Stop complaining already

4
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,260
decide if you want to go on or find a new target.

5
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,300
No.

6
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,680
The harder it is, the more Mr.Chic wants.

7
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,860
Do you guys have anything else on him?

8
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,880
I don’t.

9
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,040
He is a very private person

10
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,380
The Cute Boy Page can’t get anything either

11
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,080
No one cares about The Cute Boy Page anymore

12
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
What page should we be looking at?

13
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,340
Do you have any news?

14
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,620
Exactly!

15
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,400
His fans crate a secret group chat just to share stories and news about him

16
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,040
The group is called Team Sarawat’s Wives.

17
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,340
Sarawat’s wives?

18
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:48,020
Speaking of which, they just found you his contact

19
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,580
Let me see. His number or his Line ID?

20
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,760
His email.

21
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,760
Email?

22
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,740
Yep.

23
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,660
Am I back to MSN time?

24
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,300
Just choose whether you email him or wait for him at his Faculty

25
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,400
I don’t know if you will see him that easily

26
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Up to you.

27
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,740
Email it is.

28
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,380
Hi Sarawat

29
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,360
I am Tine,

30
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,280
the one you said you would kiss till I dropped the other day.

31
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,800
I need to ask you a favor

32
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,560
Are you available tomorrow?

33
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,840
Meet me anywhere.

34
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
I don’t mind the place.

35
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Hey!

36
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,620
Why are you here?

37
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,020
You emailed me.

38
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,480
That’s right but I didn’t think you would come to my room

39
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,160
You said it could be anywhere.

40
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,180
What are you doing?

41
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
Helping you.

42
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,780
Do you want it now?

43
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,540
Hold on!

44
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,680
I don’t mean this kind of help.

45
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,660
I mean I want you to…

46
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,460
I can’t believe that someone just emailed me asking for sex.

47
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,900
It can be anywhere, you said? You fu*k yourself, you psycho!

48
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,660
Asshole!

49
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,680
You want it this way, huh?

50
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,940
Let the game begin.

51
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,600
In Team Sarawat’s Wives, they say he drives a white car…

52
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
A white car?

53
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,700
…with some stickers at the rear.

54
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,660
Stickers at the rear?

55
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,160
He likes to park at the back of his Faculty building

56
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,480
I’m gonna hang up now.

57
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,900
I think I found it.

58
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
Is this your car?

59
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,620
I am sorry, ma’am.

60
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Sarawat!

61
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,280
Sarawat!

62
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Wat!

63
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,240
Wat!

64
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,640
Slow down!

65
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Wat!

66
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,520
I need to talk to you.

67
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
Let’s talk.

68
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,520
I don’t talk to strangers.

69
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,060
Stranger my ass!

70
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,280
You said you would kiss me till I dropped the other day.

71
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,220
Please. Can I have five minutes?

72
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
No.

73
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,300
Three minutes then?

74
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,660
No.

75
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,940
Ten seconds?

76
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,680
Nine eight seven …

77
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,600
Wait!

78
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,020
I..

79
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,640
Can you please help…?

80
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Your time is up.

81
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,580
Look what he did to me. I followed him like a shadow yet he still didn’t care to talk

82
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,520
Do you think I will stop here?

83
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,985
I don’t think so.

84
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,100
I won’t stop and give up now.

85
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,680
If you want it back, give me your number.

86
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,540
Give it back! Hey!

87
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,060
What are you playing?

88
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,240
Shit!

89
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,940
I am sorry.
