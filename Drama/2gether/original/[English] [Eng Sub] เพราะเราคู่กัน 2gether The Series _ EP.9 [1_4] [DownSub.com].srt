1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
 

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,340
How do you feel about him?

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,560
My heart is light and weak.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,980
And when he gets his face close to mine,

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,340
my heart pounds like crazy

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,920
If you guys win, my friend will post a love confession to your friend

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,200
If you lose, Sarawat will have to leave my friend alone

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,600
The game is over. Engineering beats Political Science one-nil.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,960
If you lose, you need to leave me alone

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,680
It doesn’t mean I need to leave you alone

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,580
Was it you who messed with my friend?

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,720
What the f*ck are you guys doing?

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,120
Watch it!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,180
Are you all right?

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,420
Can you even remember getting beaten up?

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,860
Sure I can.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,900
They totally crossed the line this time.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,300
They need to be taught that

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,340
they can’t lay a hand on someone so important to me.

20
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,340
 

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Let me bandage you.

22
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:19,925
 

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,880
Does it hurt so bad?

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,560
Not so bad.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,140
Does my face look so wrecked though?

26
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,320
I’m sure I will get yelled at by the cheerleading captain.

27
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,520
You are so you!

28
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,000
After getting beaten up, all you care about is how you look.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,420
Turn this way.

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,880
Sorry.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,220
It’s going to hurt a bit.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,980
Bear with me.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,600
This one will burn.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,060
Ready?

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Sorry.

36
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Sorry.

37
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,380
Just a bit more.

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,100
 

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,340
Will you…

40
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,840
stay with me tonight?

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,400
I told you

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,260
I didn’t bring anything with me.

43
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,720
How can I crash here?

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,500
About that…

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,920
I have bought everything you need.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,220
Problem solved now?

47
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,140
You bought all that?

48
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,000
Soap, toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, razor, shaving cream,

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,960
and underwear.

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,500
I’ll take that as a yes

51
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,860
You can’t go back now. It’s late and dangerous

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,200
Right?

53
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,420
 

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,320
Choose whether you want to sleep on the couch or this soft mattress with me.

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
So?

56
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,985
 

57
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,075
 

58
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:48,195
 

59
00:04:48,305 --> 00:04:51,375
 

60
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,785
 

61
00:04:54,785 --> 00:04:56,095
 

62
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,935
 

63
00:05:01,485 --> 00:05:02,945
 

64
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,505
 

65
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:07,925
 

66
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,465
 

67
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,915
 

68
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,540
 

69
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,800
 

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,540
 

71
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:22,445
 

72
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,395
 

73
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,465
 

74
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,645
 

75
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,595
 

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,600
 

77
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
 

78
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,600
I end up snuggling up with you anyway.

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,260
Why are you nestling up with me here?

80
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,500
You said you wanted to sleep on the couch.

81
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,660
We need to snuggle up due to the small space.

82
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,620
You didn’t choose the mattress.

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,660
I said I wanted to sleep on the couch alone!

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,800
You didn’t say ‘alone.’

85
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,160
I’m letting you sleep on the couch as you wish.

86
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,580
And I’m keeping you warm here.

87
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,500
Stop complaining.

88
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,360
What are you looking at?

89
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,200
I hope you’re not having a pervy thought

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,500
I think I recognize one of them

91
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Who?

92
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,660
Do you know him?

93
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,380
I don’t.

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,560
But I have a feeling he is a senior from the Faculty of Architecture

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,160
Maybe…

96
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,200
there’s a reason behind this.

97
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,120
I don’t know what’s behind it

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,700
But now…

99
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,560
I’m more interested in what’s in front of me

100
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,840
Keep looking at me like that…

101
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,880
and I will kiss till you drop.

102
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,140
Yes, please.

103
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
I’m just kidding. You asshole!

104
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,160
 

105
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,760
Sweet dream.

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,980
You wish!

107
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,860
By the way

108
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,980
how do you kiss people till they drop?

109
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,800
Uh…

110
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,680
Like this.

111
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,100
 

112
00:08:10,105 --> 00:08:11,575
 

113
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,440
 

114
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,500
Very cute.

115
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,640
I meant the dessert.

116
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
I know

117
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,220
What happened to your hand?

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,100
I built a model with Chat last night

119
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,700
I got cut

120
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,760
[Tine: My first time checking in here.]

121
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I have to go

122
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
My shift is over

123
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,880
See you at the football field this evening.

124
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,900
Where are you going?

125
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,580
[Library]

126
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,980
What?

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
Does it still hurt?

128
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,080
No.

129
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,280
I’m cold.

130
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,620
I’m sitting right under the air-con

131
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,700
 

132
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,840
Everywhere else is full.

133
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,260
We have to sit here.

134
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,240
I will go get my jacket for you.

135
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,520
Wait here.

136
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,300
Why are you so quick?

137
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,320
Are you studying?

138
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,620
Do you want to study with me? I can tutor you.

139
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,400
That’s okay.

140
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,800
My friend just went out to grab a jacket.

141
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,020
He will be back soon.

142
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,940
I see.

143
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you doing?

144
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,640
Your boyfriend is cold.

145
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,220
I just gave him my jacket

146
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,580
No need. He has mine now

147
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,380
Take good care of your boy.

148
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,760
Lots of people want him.

149
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,560
I am not afraid of other people.

150
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,120
Just worried about a dog that backbites.

151
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,660
A dog, you said?

152
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,060
I am on for a real fight too

153
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,060
Come on then.

154
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,360
See you on the field.

155
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,160
Let’s continue our unfinished business there.

156
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,740
 

157
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,880
What did he mean by that?

158
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,240
Is he…

159
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,820
one of the Architecture students that hurt you yesterday?

160
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,900
Don’t know.

161
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,860
Might be.

162
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,740
Of course he is!

163
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,580
He bullied you because of Tine

164
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,620
He will turn a football field into a battlefield for sure

165
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,500
[Two Weeks Later]

166
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,940
Has anyone seen Tine?

167
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,980
Tine?

168
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,600
I am sorry

169
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,040
I woke up late

170
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,340
That’s okay.

171
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,620
Let me clip your hair up and apply a foundation

172
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,560
Wearing wrong foundation shade is a hit now?

173
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,100
I don’t think it’s wrong.

174
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,320
This shade fits Tine’s skin perfectly.

175
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,700
Sarawat, I think it evens his skin just fine.

176
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,800
If you don’t approve, I won’t do the foundation.

177
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,300
Eyeliner up next then.

178
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,880
I don’t think he needs it.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,220
His bottom lid is black enough.

180
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,360
No liners needed

181
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,200
Not that black, I guess.

182
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,960
Bottom eyeliner is trending.

183
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,260
Just a bit?

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,840
If you don’t approve, we can skip it then.

185
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,540
Let’s skip to the blush on.

186
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,180
A blush on will make his cheeks redder

187
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,960
I think it’s too red

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
Let’s just not wear any makeup then.

189
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,660
You can go change now

190
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,460
Go on.

191
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,620
 

192
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,620
What are you doing?

193
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,120
What are you doing?

194
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
You are cute enough

195
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,640
You wanna be cuter to attract more people or what?

196
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 

197
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,580
What the heck are you saying?

198
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,180
I’m going to get changed.

199
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,180
Wait!

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,620
Here.

201
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,280
 

202
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,800
I know you haven’t eaten anything today

203
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,300
Thanks.

204
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,080
So you can’t play today

205
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,060
I have to.

206
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,840
You gave me a promise.

207
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,080
If I win today, you will post a love confession to me

208
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,780
This is not funny.

209
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,840
Promise me you won’t play.

210
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
 

211
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes.

212
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,440
Promise?

213
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,080
Yes.

214
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,140
Promise?

215
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
 

216
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,440
Do you want an extra ball boy?

217
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,300
No ball boy needed here

218
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,400
I just need an undertaker for Sarawat’s dead body

219
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,440
Just kidding.

220
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,360
I won’t kill him. Disability is enough.

221
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,640
Sounds satisfying.

222
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,620
But wouldn’t you be prouder to win a clean game?

223
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,660
Hey! Whose side are you actually on here?

224
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,720
Your side, of course.

225
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,140
I’m gonna go warm up.

226
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,580
The players of both teams are walking into the field.

227
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,980
Sarawat, the Political Science star player is sitting on the bench

228
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,660
Is he injured?

229
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,640
That was a foul there.

230
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,760
Tine.

231
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,940
Tine.
