1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,500
Excuse me.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,500
Which way is the Music Club?

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,120
This is Pam, my close friend from high school.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,880
You said you would write me a song, remember?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,320
It’s time to keep the promise.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,220
If you want to ride comfortably, come with me.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,920
But if you want to experience a tough life, go with him.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,240
Pam is my first love.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,180
I get it.

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,140
You agreed to help me because you want

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,480
to have some experience to write a song?

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,940
I am so excited.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,680
I want to hear the song you wrote for me.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,600
I…

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,440
I want a love song that describes two close friends.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,440
They are so close that

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,440
they take their relationship for granted.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
One day,

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,840
the other friend has a new best friend.

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,800
They don’t do what they used to do together anymore.

21
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,040
And it’s when she realizes

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,540
how much she loves her friend.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,900
She is willing to do anything…

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,520
to get her friend back.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,760
You are not talking about the song.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,980
You are talking about us, aren’t you?

27
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Right.

28
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,960
I love you.

29
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,820
And I know you feel the same way.

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,320
Can we still go back to the way we were?

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,060
I am sorry, Pam.

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Why?

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,340
I met you first.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,260
Why didn’t you ask me out back then?

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Why…?

36
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,360
Why Tine?

37
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,140
Why?

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,800
Tell me why?

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,100
Answer me!

40
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Why not me?

41
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,400
Answer me!

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,160
Why Tine?

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,660
Why not me?

44
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,900
Pam!

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,260
Sarawat!

46
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,740
Just answer me.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,700
Say it.

48
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Pam!

49
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,560
Why?!

50
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,260
Are you OK?

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,340
Tine?

52
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,680
Hold this.

53
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,760
Hey!

54
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,400
Help me with him.

55
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,320
Hold on.

56
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
We’re about to reach the car.

57
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,920
Where are you taking him?

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
Don’t stop me.

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,480
I am taking him to a hospital.

60
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,460
Back off!

61
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,460
I will take him myself.

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,160
You back off!

63
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,820
I told you I will take him there myself.

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,100
Calm down, man.

65
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,420
Where the hell have you been?

66
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,400
You can’t even take good care of your boyfriend.

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,240
And you think you can freaking ask for anything now?

68
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:06,655
Tine.

69
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,065
Get him in the car.

70
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:45,755
DAMN IT!

71
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Tine.

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
Why are you here?

73
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,400
Between Pam and me, it’s not what you think.

74
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,860
Why were you hugging her then?

75
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Pam was hugging me goodbye.

76
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,280
She is studying abroad with her boyfriend.

77
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,760
Sorry for making you misunderstand each other.

78
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,660
Little buffalo.

79
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,860
Stop worrying.

80
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,400
It’s just a misunderstanding.

81
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,900
Just trust me.

82
00:07:18,695 --> 00:07:19,775
Wake up!

83
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:29,205
You OK?

84
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:33,505
Do you still have a stomachache?

85
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,900
What happened…

86
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,300
between you and Wat?

87
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,600
He lied to me.

88
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,580
I asked him directly.

89
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,280
He said he didn't have feelings for Pam.

90
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,600
It didn’t seem that way from the way I saw it.

91
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,860
Calm down.

92
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Pam?

93
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,120
His first love.

94
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,700
You know what?

95
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,960
I thought he wrote me a song.

96
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,020
It turned out that I was wrong.

97
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,600
He...

98
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,940
He wrote the song for Pam.

99
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,139
I feel like I am an idiot.

100
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,540
I hate liars.

101
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,260
When I am in a relationship,

102
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,900
I trust my love with all my heart.

103
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,160
But he just took me for a fool.

104
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,320
He lied to my face all he wanted.

105
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,560
What he has done for me was real or not,

106
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
I just can’t tell anymore.

107
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,780
Being lied to hurts.

108
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,180
But being lied to by the one you trust…

109
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,500
It hurts like hell.

110
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,960
If it hurts that bad,

111
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,160
how about you step back?

112
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,820
Believe me.

113
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,280
You should eat something mild in the meantime.

114
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,900
Why the hell are you here?

115
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,120
Tine!

116
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,760
Tine, come out and talk to me.

117
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Tine.

118
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,280
Tine.

119
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,560
Tine!

120
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,140
Tine! Just talk to me.

121
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:45,415
Please.

122
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,925
What you saw yesterday was nothing.

123
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,340
There’s nothing going on between me and Pam.

124
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,900
Just stop already.

125
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,720
I don’t want to hear whatever you have to say.

126
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,860
I can’t trust you anymore.

127
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,700
Tine.

128
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,120
I might be an ass,

129
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,960
but I’ve never been so mean to the one I love.

130
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,675
If you can’t take care of this little thing,

131
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,540
just let him go.

132
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,540
A new menu for testing, sir.

133
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,885
Thank you.

134
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:18,520
Do you want one more?

135
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,240
In case your friend comes in.

136
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,240
That’s OK.

137
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,580
He doesn’t come here much anymore.

138
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,760
- Is that so?

139
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,920
- He might be busy.

140
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,260
I will bring one if he comes then.

141
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,360
Sure. Thank you.

142
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,200
If you have nowhere to go to,

143
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,980
you can crash at my place.

144
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,680
Thank you.

145
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,600
But I told my friend I would stay with him.

146
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,540
[He is taken – Sarawat]

147
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Hey!

148
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,600
So you will help me?

149
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,880
You seem so happy.

150
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
What was wrong with you though?

151
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,300
Why did you agree to take a picture with me?

152
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,540
This picture is special.

153
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
How?

154
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:46,975
I rarely see when you don’t try to strike a pose.

155
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,100
It’s cute.

156
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,900
Wear my jersey and cheer for me.

157
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,920
Why do I have to?

158
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,120
Let’s go.

159
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,200
I am thinking…

160
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,380
it can be our room.

161
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,060
You like it?

162
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,080
I do!

163
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,940
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now.

164
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,060
I want to see you before I close my eyes to sleep.

165
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,280
And I want to see you first thing after I wake up.

166
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,220
Thank you for moving in with me.

167
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,440
100 honey toasts, please.

168
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,640
Why are you here?

169
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,260
I have nothing else to teach you.

170
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,520
I didn't come for an extra class.

171
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,380
Because I passed the test.

172
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,800
And?

173
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,460
And I want a Faculty tour from a senior.

174
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,660
Should we go now?

175
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,440
Do I have to?

176
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,140
So you want to stay and

177
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,180
make me 100 honey toasts?

178
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,700
Wow!

179
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,220
Which one is yours?

180
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,840
Be quiet, would you?

181
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,620
This piece is yours, isn’t it?

182
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,600
How can you tell?

183
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,320
That guy is having a honey toast.

184
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,060
That’s me, right?

185
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,020
Are you the only one in this world

186
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,280
who can have a honey toast?

187
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,300
The initial M.

188
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,420
M as in Mil?

189
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,340
Is there anything else to see?

190
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,940
There is one more place.

191
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,980
Are we there yet?

192
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,880
We are.

193
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,720
Woah!

194
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,480
When I need to clear my head,

195
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,380
I always come up here.

196
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,820
You can too if you need to clear your head.

197
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,900
I hope...

198
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,235
I get a chance to be here.

199
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,785
You said that...

200
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,620
because you didn’t pass the test, did you?

201
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,560
You knew?

202
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,940
Chat and I used your ID to search for the result online.

203
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,440
You didn’t pass.

204
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,700
I didn’t mean to lie.

205
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,940
I…

206
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,200
I needed an excuse to see you once again.

207
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,080
My band is playing at Jae Tun’s place tonight.

208
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Come.

209
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:47,655
Can I really come?

210
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,380
Of course, you can.

211
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,580
I’m off for the music practice now.

212
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,800
See you at the shop at 7.

213
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,360
Hold on. We’re about to reach the car.

214
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Yes, P’Mil.

215
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,960
Sorry I didn’t show up yesterday.

216
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,680
Something came up.

217
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,300
Your friend told me

218
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
you needed to take P’Tine to a hospital.

219
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,960
I understand.

220
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,980
I guess P’Tine needs you more than I do.

221
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,800
Don’t worry about it.

222
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,680
I’m gonna hang up now.

223
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,680
The movie is about to start.

224
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,140
I have a date.

225
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Yeah?

226
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,860
Why am I seeing you all alone on the bleacher?

227
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
Should I come to you?

228
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,980
You better not.

229
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,400
If you walk right in,

230
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,920
I might not let you go to P’Tine again.

231
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,460
I get it.

232
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,900
Then…

233
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,680
Bye now.

234
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,140
Good luck to you.

235
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,080
[#TeamSarawatsWives – They’ve broken up!]

236
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,240
[Great! They don’t match.]

237
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
[It served him right.]

238
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,040
[Sarawat has come back to us.]

239
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
[My husband is single again.]

240
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,440
Do they really think he will date them

241
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,020
even though you two have broken up?

242
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,720
Stop reading it.

243
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,020
What a waste of time!

244
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,600
Let’s find something else to do.

245
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,540
I’m gonna put it here.

246
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,840
Just don’t read it.

247
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,720
Look!

248
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,540
Today last year,

249
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:58,445
we were at Scrubb concert.

250
00:24:58,725 --> 00:24:59,735
I missed that time.

251
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:05,615
Hey!

252
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
The movie you want to see premieres tomorrow.

253
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,620
Wanna go?

254
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
Tine.

255
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Uh…

256
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,480
It’s OK.

257
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,220
I have somewhere to go tomorrow.

258
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,460
Why do you care?

259
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,080
It’s none of your business.

260
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,980
Ah!

261
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,620
It’s the Music Contest tomorrow.
