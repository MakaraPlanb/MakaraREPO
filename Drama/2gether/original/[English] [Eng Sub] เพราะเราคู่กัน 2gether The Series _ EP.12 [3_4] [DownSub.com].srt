1
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,155
 

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:04,205
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:07,935
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,905
 

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,065
 

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:18,255
 

8
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:20,325
 

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,700
 

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:31,240
 

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
 

12
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:41,925
 

13
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:46,965
 

14
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:53,155
 

15
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:57,395
 

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:05,740
 

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
 

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
 

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,140
Do you still have a stomachache?

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,380
Yeah.

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,300
I feel a bit queasy inside.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,040
I want to throw up, but I can’t

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,640
How about you take some rest today?

25
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,520
You didn’t get enough sleep last night

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,460
How did you know?

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,580
I know you listened to music all night.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,200
Do you want to eat anything?

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,080
How about congee?

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,900
No.

31
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,280
I am OK.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,640
Just go take a shower. You’re late

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,040
I can skip one day to take care of you.

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,360
It’s just a flatulence, not an appendicitis.

35
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,160
Just go.

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,960
But I’m worried.

37
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,540
I am OK.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,600
You can go.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Are you sure?

40
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,840
Yes.

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,300
 

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,540
 

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,720
So my friend needs to watch out for his boyfriend’s first love, right?

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,800
His first love came back and took back what was hers?

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,520
Well, not really.

46
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,640
Just tell your friend to ask his boyfriend frankly.

47
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:52,000
If he asks and it turns out to be nothing, then my friend is a fool.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,780
But if he keeps it inside, his brain will explode.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,080
If someone doesn’t love us anymore, that person will leave whether we ask the question or not.

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
 

51
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:07,265
 

52
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:09,785
 

53
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:11,985
 

54
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:17,655
 

55
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,260
 

56
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,820
Why are you calling me?

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
 

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,540
Why did you come back early?

59
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,980
I ditched the rehearsal

60
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,480
I am worried about you.

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,380
I bought you a congee.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,180
Don’t worry about the band. They are all OK.

63
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
What is it?

64
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
 

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,140
Is Pam your first love?

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,940
Do you think someone who has never been in love can write a love song?

67
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,380
Are you writing a love song?

68
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,040
I am so excited.

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
I want to hear the song you wrote for me.
