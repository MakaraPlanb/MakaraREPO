1
00:00:01,205 --> 00:00:02,205
 

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,785
 

4
00:00:08,995 --> 00:00:10,655
 

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,000
 

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,380
Hey!

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:22,180
When did my friend say he would post a love confession to your friend?

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,300
I didn’t mention any names in the post

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,020
What makes you think I was talking about your friend?

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,600
We don’t know that.

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,140
But what we know for sure is that your friend is hitting on my friend here

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,320
Don’t mess with his head like that.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,220
Who is messing with his head?

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,600
No one is.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,320
I posted it because I am very sure that we will win

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,480
You can’t be too confident

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,860
Your opponent holds six championship cups.

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,720
So?

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,800
We are going to break that record.

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,160
If you don’t think we can, you don’t need to panic

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,800
Fine.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,160
If you guys win, my friend will post a love confession to your friend.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,940
If you lose, Sarawat will have to leave my friend alone

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,300
Deal?

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,860
I think…

26
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,440
your friend here is gonna have to prepare a sweet love confession for me

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,920
 

28
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,020
Hello?

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,040
Chat told me you are sick

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,960
Yes.

31
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,760
I can’t attend the tutoring class with you for a while.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,820
That’s okay.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,780
Chat told me your address.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,880
He got it from your application.

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,680
I will meet you there and assign you some homework.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,800
You don’t have to

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
I’m almost there.

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,540
What?

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,600
See you.

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,080
What a coincidence!

41
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,340
Someone I hate lives around here too.

42
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,500
His name is Sarawat.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,340
Do you know him?

44
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,600
I don’t

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,680
I don’t come here very often.

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,580
Whose football jersey is this?

47
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,860
My brother’s.

48
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,380
What Faculty is he in?

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360
The Faculty of…

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,060
He wears number 12.

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,680
It reminds me of that jerk Sarawat.

52
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,020
The Faculty of…

53
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
 

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,100
- Poli…
- Political Science?

55
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,860
No.12 from Political Science is Sarawat.

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,480
How are you related to Sarawat?

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,420
The thing is…

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,520
my brother is having a football match against Political Science

59
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,200
So I tried to find Political Science football jersey to burn just to jinx them

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,580
You are such a great little brother.

61
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,240
You picked the right number

62
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,960
Anything that belongs to Sarawat should be burned to the ground.

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,960
That’s right.

64
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,220
Burn them all.

65
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,200
Burn them all.

66
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
We are at the checkpoint.

67
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,580
Stop and boost your energy, guys.

68
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,700
- Thank you.
- Me too.

69
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,980
That’s not refreshing enough.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,180
Try this.

71
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,440
Man!

72
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,020
You did it again!

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,400
Man!

74
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,720
Refreshing, isn’t it?

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,920
It’s sticky

76
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That girl is cute

78
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,660
Don’t look at him.

79
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,540
Don’t let him mess with your head.

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,000
Go.

81
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,320
They scream for you again.

82
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,560
I did this once

83
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,540
Taking off your shirt?

84
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,140
Yes.

85
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,620
Girls screamed their lungs out for me

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,420
Don’t play it again.

87
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,820
What? It was fun.

88
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,000
Your trick to get Tine confess is superb

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,720
Why can’t you apply that to your love life?

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,820
Do you want to get beaten up?

91
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,960
My own plan is in progress

92
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,740
I got my hand on his phone

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,480
Now I have both his number and Line ID.

94
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,860
There is one problem though

95
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,520
He is not single?

96
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,200
I’m not brave enough to call.

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,800
If I were a cute little girl, I wouldn’t worry

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,660
I am a handsome young man. I’m sure he would freak out if I called.

99
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,080
Not a problem.

100
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,960
Just create a fake Line account.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Fake Line account?

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,900
Make it up?

103
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,120
Yep!

104
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,820
Good idea.

105
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,800
Who should I be?

106
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,875
 

107
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:52,035
 

108
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,780
 

109
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,380
It’s brilliant, Boss!!

110
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,500
Thank you so much.

111
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,080
If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t know who I should pretend to be

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,320
You are super clever, my friend!

113
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,700
I know now who I’m going to be.

114
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,460
Are you pretending to be Wat?

115
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,860
Wat My Ass!!

116
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,040
Great plan!

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
She is so cute.

118
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,920
If I were him, I would definitely want to talk to her

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,720
You want to talk to every cute girl.

120
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,420
Let’s see if he’s easily deceived like you.

121
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
 

122
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,500
I’m going to start now.

123
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,820
Sawasdee Ka.

124
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,140
Are you P’Type, the one who likes to go to business seminars?

125
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,380
How do you spell ‘Ka’?

126
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,760
K and A.

127
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,020
Yes.

128
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,500
Who is this?

129
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
He replied so quickly.

130
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,880
My name is Earn. I am a freshman

131
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:12,760
I see you at several seminars so I think it would be great if we can exchange knowledge

132
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,860
Sure.

133
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,460
I am happy to help If I can

134
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,060
I told you he is friendly

135
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,280
Right? Earn is pretty.

136
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,600
If I were him, I would be friendly too

137
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,360
What’s next?

138
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,580
I need some information for my report.

139
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,020
Can I have an interview with you..?

140
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,800
Wait!

141
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,660
You talk to him for 5 minutes and now you want to see him?

142
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,660
Is it weird?

143
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,060
Of course.

144
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,220
Okay. I’m going to delete it then

145
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,300
Delete.

146
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,960
Shit!

147
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,280
I just hit send!

148
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,900
Can I unsend it now?

149
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,040
No!

150
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,220
He read it! He is quick!

151
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,900
What do I do, Boss?

152
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,760
Shit!

153
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,200
This can go in two directions.

154
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,020
He might answer that question.

155
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,280
Or he blocks your account completely

156
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Block?

157
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,300
You sound like a pervert

158
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,500
Damn it!

159
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,580
Let me see her picture again

160
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,860
Knock it off.

161
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,700
 

162
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,720
So Tine isn’t Sarawat’s boyfriend?

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,700
Sarawat is going after him but he doesn’t care, right?

164
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,440
Is that so?

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,539
I’ve been misunderstanding.

166
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,159
That’s why I didn’t reach out to you.

167
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,539
I was afraid Sarawat would get jealous.

168
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,059
Don’t be afraid.

169
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,720
My friend likes a cute little girl with fair skin just like you

170
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,100
The library will be closed this Saturday.

171
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,780
Where should we study?

172
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,460
How about Tine’s room?

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,820
It’s available.

174
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,060
He lives alone

175
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,940
We can study as long as we like.

176
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,480
Study?

177
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,740
Sounds good.

178
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,000
This Saturday, I have to go watch…

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,020
Education is more important, right?

180
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,120
We should study.

181
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,460
See you guys at Tine’s place on Saturday then

182
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
My room?

183
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:18,940
Yep!

184
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,220
I told you to deactivate your IG

185
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,000
Why is it still there?

186
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,940
What if I get ambushed on the way back?

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,380
Will you spend the night at my place?

188
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
