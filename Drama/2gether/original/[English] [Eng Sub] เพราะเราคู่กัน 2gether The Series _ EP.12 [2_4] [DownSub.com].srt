1
00:00:01,155 --> 00:00:02,155
 

2
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:06,165
 

3
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:08,835
 

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,665
 

5
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,135
 

6
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:17,075
 

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,460
 

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,080
Man.

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
This way.

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,240
Sure.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,340
Sawasdee Krub.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,120
He woke up and thought I took his clothes off

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,860
He punched me in the face.

14
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,100
What?

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,620
How could you do that to me?

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,200
I was standing there in shock.

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,580
 

18
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,980
 

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,060
I heard you are a Political Science student.

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,880
Where will you go for your internship program?

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,300
I don’t know yet

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,020
Political Science grads now have broader career path than before.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,880
What are you leaning to?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,240
I haven’t thought about that yet

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,720
I am just a first-year student.

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
People here usually plan ahead since high school

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,040
You should start thinking about it.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,820
The competitions are high these days.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,760
Well, I do plan my future.

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,580
I will graduate and ask P’Type to be my boyfriend.

31
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,620
Seriously?

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,800
But you have no clue about your job.

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,200
Type gets paid really well.

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,100
Will you be able to take care of him?

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,720
Of course, I will.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,260
I might not have a lot of money

37
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,220
But I have a heart of a fighter.

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,420
A heart, he said.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,880
A heart of a fighter.

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
 

41
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,880
Let’s stop teasing him.

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
He is still young.

43
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,580
I don’t have money

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,720
Can I pay with my heart?

45
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,000
I will pay for P’Type and me.

46
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,800
Don’t worry about that.

47
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,640
It’s my treat.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Please don’t. I will pay.

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,200
Up to you then

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,580
 

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,940
I was joking.

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,140
Give it back here.

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,180
Keep your money for the tuition. Let me take care of this meal

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,340
 

56
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,680
 

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,160
 

58
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,315
 

59
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:39,845
 

60
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:43,045
 

61
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,705
 

62
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:49,415
 

63
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,340
 

64
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,800
 

65
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,680
 

66
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,020
 

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,960
 

68
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,520
See you guys

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
Get home safe.

70
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,760
Didn’t you drive here?

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,860
Come on. I’ll give you a ride.

72
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
That’s ok.

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,780
Come on. I had only soda.

74
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,900
You’re safe.

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,360
Type, get in.

76
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,180
You can just go. I will give P’Type a ride home.

77
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,700
 

78
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
 

79
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,740
Did you ask him if he wanted to ride on your aged motorbike?

80
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,940
P’Type, are you coming with me?

81
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,100
Take your pick.

82
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,480
If you want to ride comfortably, come with me

83
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,140
But if you want to experience a tough life full of smoke and sweat, go with him

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,480
You!

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Man, stop!

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,180
Stop.

87
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,240
Just stop.

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,180
P’Beam, I’ll go with you.

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:26,680
 

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,420
Come on. Let’s go.

91
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
Please.

92
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,400
Thank you.

93
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Thank you.

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,320
But I think I better go with him

95
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,840
All these times,

96
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,640
I thought we got along pretty well.

97
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,620
Good luck to you then.

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 

99
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
 

100
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
 

101
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,500
What are you doing?

102
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,620
You seem drowsy.

103
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,220
Are you sick?

104
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,120
No. I am fine.

105
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,260
Really?

106
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,220
Actually, it’s bloating up in my stomach

107
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,960
Phuak took us to 4 restaurants.

108
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,760
OK. Just a sec.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
 

110
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Here.

111
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,820
 

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,860
Take one pill at a time.

113
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
 

114
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,420
Next time, you can just say it.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 

116
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Got it?

117
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
I’ll turn off the light.

118
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,060
Hey!

119
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,580
We haven’t had a music clip together for quite some time

120
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,160
How about we record one tonight?

121
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,760
It is late, and you are not well.

122
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,940
Let’s do it later, OK?

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
Get some sleep

124
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,300
Goodnight.

125
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,534
 

126
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,695
 

127
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,365
 

128
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,400
Yes.

137
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,860

152
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,900
You didn’t get enough sleep last night.

153
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,840
How did you know?
