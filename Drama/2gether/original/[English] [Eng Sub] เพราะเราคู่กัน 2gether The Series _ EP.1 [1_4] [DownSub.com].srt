1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,860
 

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,795
 

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,235
 

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,240
Have you ever wondered why many things are in pairs?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Like friends or…

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,940
lovers.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,520
Especially when you find the right one to pair with,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,940
you will do whatever it takes to be with that person

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,700
Of all my chic life, I have paired up with many girls

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,860
Of all my chic life, I have paired up with many girls

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,200
Ging, let’s go see a movie when you’re done.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,840
I have an extra Math class after this.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,100
Tomorrow then?

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,860
Tomorrow then?

16
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,960
I have Biology tomorrow

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Day after tomorrow?

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,000
Physics, Chemistry, Social Studies, Science, English, and then Math again.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,100
Say lychee!

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,400
I look fat. Let’s do it again

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,140
Cherry!

22
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,140
Cherry.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,340
Are you done? Let’s eat.

24
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,400
Wait!

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,360
Let’s take another selfie.

26
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,540
Selfie?

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,340
Strawberry!

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Should we call for a check? I lost appetite!

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you want to eat, babe?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,340
What do you want, Noomnim?

31
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,140
Anything.

32
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,220
Ice-cream?

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,900
It makes you fat.

34
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,920
A honey toast?

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,820
Too sweet.

36
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,280
A pudding? Bingsoo? Choux cream?

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,760
Yuck! Too boring.

38
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,980
What do you want then, Noomnim?

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,340
Anything.

40
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,080
Are you mad at me, Namwan?

41
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
NO!

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,040
That was a big fat no.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Whatever I did wrong, I am sorry.

44
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
Why are you apologizing? I am not mad!

45
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,480
I AM NOT MAD!

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
Then why…

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,580
No one has ever been the right one for me,

48
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,820
so I came to find the one in this University.

49
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,240
I never thought that this time, the right one would be so different

50
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
 

51
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:20,755
 

52
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:22,885
 

53
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,720
 

54
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,300
 

55
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,700
 

56
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:31,705
 

57
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:35,385
 

58
00:02:35,715 --> 00:02:39,025
 

59
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:42,425
 

60
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:45,275
 

61
00:02:45,405 --> 00:02:48,395
 

62
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:49,515
 

63
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:52,655
 

64
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:56,065
 

65
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:57,375
 

66
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:02,215
 

67
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,205
 

68
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:09,205
 

69
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,525
 

70
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,195
 

71
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,875
 

72
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:20,075
 

73
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:21,825
 

74
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:23,725
 

75
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:25,675
 

76
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:27,735
 

77
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:29,965
 

78
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,915
 

79
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,860
 

80
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,000
[Tine: The cheerleader audition has passed but the right one for me hasn’t passed by.]

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,700
[Two weeks earlier]

82
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,660
We intended to make it fit you perfectly.

83
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,080
It does, P’Fang

84
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,220
That’s great.

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
I just knew that we share the same student code

86
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Right.

87
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,040
Why do you want to be a cheerleader?

88
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,120
I want to have a new experience… and make new friends

89
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
That’s so great.

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,180
By the way,

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,300
someone left this for you.

92
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,360
We haven’t performed yet and you’re hot already.

93
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,660
Hey! I don’t care about this thing

94
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,920
I only focus on studying and University activities

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,700
That’s perfect.

96
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,080
We’re going to have a meal with other share-coded students next week

97
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,860
See you then

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,700
I’m going to open now

99
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,860
 

100
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,660
[Tine, I’ve been looking at you since The Freshmen Orientation. I have something to tell you. 
Meet me at the football field.]

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
You can say what you want

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
I don’t have much time.

103
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,440
Are you talking to me?

104
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Of course. Aren’t you the one who wrote this to me?

105
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,820
Are you insane? Do you think you’re Nadech?

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,380
Pervert!

107
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,980
I wrote that.

108
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
My name is Green

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,580
I’m a freshman from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences

110
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,420
Thanks.

111
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,540
Tine Teepakorn, a freshman from Faculty of Law, I like you!

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,660
What?

113
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,480
You finally found the right one.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,660
You want to die young, Fong?

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Do you hate tootsies?

116
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,740
Of course not!

117
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,320
I had lots of tootsie and gay friends back in high school

118
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,420
But it doesn’t mean I can date them.

119
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Then tell him.

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,180
I already did.

121
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820
I told him many times that I like girls.

122
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,540
But look, he said he would make me change my mind eventually

123
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,660
Damn! He’s no joke.

124
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,900
Who’s with me on Team Green?

125
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,040
Me.

126
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,800
You asshole Phuak, your friend is worried over here

127
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,720
Don’t worry

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Pay no attention to him

129
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,200
he will back off one day. Trust me.

130
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,420
Really?

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,260
 

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,580
 

133
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,520
Tine!! I’m here to pick you up. Get on.

134
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Quickly.

135
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,520
 

136
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,600
I am ready

137
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,180
Tine!! Tine, wait for me!

138
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
Guess who I just met this morning?

139
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,440
Who?

140
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,540
Green?

141
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,880
Exactly! He came to pick me up at my dorm. Lucky me I was able to sneak away

142
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,800
Wait! How did you know?

143
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,320
Because I see a guy coming towards you right there.

144
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,560
It’s Blue Hawaii, your favorite.

145
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,440
 

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,440
Take it. Drink up.

147
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,580
I am not pretty but I am yummy

148
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,300
Thank you.

149
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,280
Love you, Tine.

150
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,900
Do you need anything else?

151
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,000
You can have my heart too if you want.

152
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,140
Shit!

153
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,340
I guess he will poop for me if he can

154
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,220
I told you that he is no joke.

155
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,420
You told me that if I didn’t give him my attention, he would give up.

156
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,660
And look!

157
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,860
You guys have to help me find a way to get rid of Green.

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
I know it!

159
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,799
If you play it soft and he doesn’t go away, you need to…

160
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,320
Play hardball.

161
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,020
Hardball?

162
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,540
Hardball…

163
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,060
Is it like football?

164
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,040
My favorite.

165
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,340
Can you guys be serious here?

166
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
It’s like baseball. I love it very much

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,960
 

168
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,340
 

169
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,140
Tine, I’m so glad that you asked me out on a walk

170
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,780
But here?

171
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,640
Why?

172
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,980
It’s pretty out here.

173
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,680
This is a perfect time.

174
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
So beautiful.

175
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I don’t think it’s pretty at all

176
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,980
Let’s go somewhere else. Let’s go.

177
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,160
Hold on!

178
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Look Green, it’s beautiful.

179
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,300
So beautiful.

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,220
Do you guys hear people talking over here?

181
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,900
You guys are annoying!

182
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you doing in my territory this late?

183
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,560
I really hate it when people are in love

184
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,040
If you don’t want to end up in a hospital

185
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
break up now and never get back together again

186
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,740
Green, let’s do what they say so we don’t get hurt

187
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,920
It’s just a breakup.

188
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,320
That’s right. Quickly!

189
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,020
Tine, you wait for me here. Let me deal with them.

190
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
He thinks he’s so good.

191
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,020
 

192
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,460
Shit!

193
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,440
Are you Green or John Wick?

194
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,240
I have taken a few boxing classes.

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,500
Not just a few.

196
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,080
Are you okay,

197
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Tine? Are you hurt?

198
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,040
Damn these mosquitoes!

199
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,380
I’ll walk you to your dorm in case those guys come back.

200
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
It’s dangerous. I will protect you

201
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,500
You’re not hurt, aren’t you?

202
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
You are so fragile. Let me take care of you.

203
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,380
We’re here.

204
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,580
Are you sure you don’t want me to stay with you tonight?

205
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,460
I am. I’m fine.

206
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,820
You can go.

207
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,060
Please. Go.

208
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,240
Fine.

209
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,620
But if you need anything, I stand by to take your call 24/7.

210
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,760
I will check in a hotel around here just in case

211
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,520
Call me.

212
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,020
Take care.

213
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
Bye bye

214
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,760
Tine, my beloved friend, how are you?

215
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,940
 

216
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,240
Not good, my beloved friend Phuak.

217
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,140
All of my friends just left me alone with him.

218
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,600
How could we stay on? He almost broke my arms to pieces.

219
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,220
I think we’re screwed. We need help

220
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,500
Help?

221
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,520
Do we need a boxer or a bodybuilder?

222
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,780
It’s not what we meant

223
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,860
We need someone to be your fake girlfriend.

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,260
My girlfriend?

225
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,400
Green is shadowing you because you still don’t have anyone.

226
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,380
Find someone to be your fake date. Green will be out of your hair soon.

227
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
Good idea.

228
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,340
Who can it be?

229
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,280
Hot girls from our Faculty are not available.

230
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,240
What about that girl from your dorm, the one who asked for your Line ID?

231
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,180
She is single but not hot.

232
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,340
I don’t want to ruin a chic guy’s reputation

233
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,020
You take a fake girlfriend too seriously.

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,980
Just find a hot girl who is willing to help you. That’s it.

235
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:38,600
I know a pretty girl who might be single but…

236
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,740
But you dumped me.

237
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,260
We’re not back together for real. Just pretend to be my girlfriend to fool someone

238
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,440
Please. We are in the same University.

239
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,460
Can you help?

240
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,040
What will I get if I do?

241
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,380
What do you want?

242
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,620
A…

243
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,840
Anything?

244
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Armani, Gucci, Prada.

245
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,260
A bag from any brand I just said.

246
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,180
I see. It’s not ‘anything’ anymore

247
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,780
 

248
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
Fine.

249
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
I’ll rent one for you.

250
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
Buy one.

251
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Buy?

252
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Deal!

253
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,000
I will help you then but don’t let my boyfriend know.

254
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,120
That’s easy.

255
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
See you at The Freshy Night on Friday.

256
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Someone is going to be heartbroken.

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Tine.

258
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,420
Did you wait for long?

259
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,860
Did you feel lonely over here?

260
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,400
Not that long and I wasn’t lonely because I wasn’t here alone.

261
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,240
What do you mean?

262
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
 

263
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
 

264
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,060
This is Noomnim, my girlfriend.

265
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,920
Now you know why we can’t be together.

266
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Please give up on me

267
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Sure.

268
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,980
 

269
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Tine, don’t you think it was too harsh?

270
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
I am sorry I did that.

271
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,300
I just don’t want you to waste any more time on me.

272
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,700
So you pretend to date someone else’s girlfriend just to fool me?

273
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,180
Right. Hey!!

274
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,940
How did you know that?

275
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,300
Noomnim is my friend’s girlfriend.

276
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,820
I see them at my Faculty every day.

277
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,900
What a small world!

278
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,920
If you already knew, why did you cry then?

279
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,540
I was sad because you fooled me to make me give up.

280
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,500
But then you came to comfort me. I get it now.

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
Get what?

282
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,800
You just wanted to test if I really like you or not, am I right?

283
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
You’re not.

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,740
You’re so not right.

285
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,680
Of course I am.

286
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Don’t be shy

287
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes! I like you even more now.

288
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,460
Let’s go inside

289
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,880
 

290
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,640
Let’s go. Bye bye Noomnim. See you in class.

291
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,860
Tine come on.

292
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,960
There’s lots of food.

293
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,520
Throw the ball.

294
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,840
You suck.

295
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
That was close!

296
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,280
This one will kill. I’m sure. Oops!

297
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,720
What if this plan fails?

298
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,420
I have plan B.

299
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Here.

300
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Right here!

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
This will put him to sleep

302
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,880
Find the right time to put it in his drink and get out of there

303
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,740
We will take care of the rest.

304
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 

305
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,465
 

306
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:25,535
 

307
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:27,865
 

308
00:16:27,865 --> 00:16:29,000
 

309
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,900
Seriously?

310
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,640
Yes.

311
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 

312
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,780
Can I get three more balls and play on?

313
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,160
I don’t want to start over.

314
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,180
Green, are you thirsty?

315
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,380
I will go get you some drink.

316
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,240
Thirsty?

317
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,140
Is he alright?

318
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,960
 

319
00:16:59,305 --> 00:17:00,665
 

320
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,224
 

321
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,464
 

322
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,719
Energetic Pandan.

323
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,020
I don’t think so.

324
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,980
The Muse of Roselle.

325
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,580
Super Power Chrysanthemum.

326
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
Elephant Power Black Tea.

327
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
Two cups, please.

328
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
 

329
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
 

330
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
How much?

331
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,880
20 Baht

332
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 

333
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:40,555
 

334
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,160
 

335
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,660
The right cup. Right cup.

336
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
What are you doing?

337
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,400
What takes you so long?

338
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,140
I’m getting you a drink.

339
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,060
What drink?

340
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,920
It’s called Elephant Power Black Tea.

341
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,320
It’s strong.

342
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,960
It’s so good

343
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,980
Left or right?

344
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,840
It’s all the same.

345
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,040
Come on. The next band will be up soon.

346
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
 

347
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
 

348
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,665
 

349
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 

350
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,160
I shouldn’t have stayed up watching a series last night.

351
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Wait a minute.

352
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,820
You yawned because you stayed up late watching a series?

353
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,520
Yes. It took me until this morning to finish it.

354
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,300
 

355
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,280
So this cup…

356
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,440
Tine!

357
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,860
Tine!

358
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Are you sick?

359
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,560
Do you want me to take you back to your dorm?

360
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,720
It's okay

361
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Please welcome Sssss..! on stage.

362
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,160
Hi guys. We are Sssss..!

363
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,880
 

364
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,360
Although I’m half-awake

365
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,940
I realize at once that this is my favorite song.

366
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,260
It called…

367
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
 

368
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,400
“Together”

369
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,800
No one fits for this duty more than this guy.

370
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,560
What do you want?
