1
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,280
Shit!

2
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,200
My eyes hurt.

3
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I am sorry

4
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,000
We rescued you last night.

5
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,440
If it wasn’t for that guitarist who distracted Green

6
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,700
you might be waking up in his room by now

7
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,320
A fake girlfriend didn’t work

8
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,980
The plan didn’t shake Green for a bit.

9
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,780
He even said he would change me and make me fall for him one day.

10
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,280
Date a guy then.

11
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,760
Are you out of your mind?

12
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,520
No. I mean find a guy to be your fake boyfriend

13
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,580
so Green will give up.

14
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,460
At this moment, no one fits for this duty more than this guy.

15
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,520
Introduce yourself!

16
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,940
Introduce yourself!

17
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,740
Introduce yourself!

18
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Introduce yourself!

19
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,820
I am only here as a substitution

20
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Can I please not introduce myself?

21
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,580
Everyone is talking about him on social media.

22
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,700
He got thousands of messages from many girls.

23
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,500
This is the type of guy that can make Green back off.

24
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,380
How can we ask for his help?

25
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,340
We don’t know his name or his Faculty.

26
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,760
Who are you talking to? I am Ohm,

27
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,260
the god of social media.

28
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,120
I can find you that information

29
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,480
It’s up to you. Do you want to do it?

30
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,660
Do I have a choice?

31
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,040
From what we know,

32
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,620
our target is a real introvert

33
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,180
He doesn’t have Line, Facebook, or Instagram account.

34
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,540
That’s Line. That’s IG.

35
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,780
I can do it.

36
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,380
I’ve been refreshing the Cute Boy Page for hours

37
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,780
I still don’t have any info on him.

38
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,880
The Cute Boy Page won’t do you any good.

39
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,340
The right page is called Dilitious Boy.

40
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,420
Delicious!

41
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,560
Whatever!

42
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,460
Look what I found here.

43
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,500
See?

44
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,380
Sarawat from Faculty of Political Science, IR major.

45
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,900
What a weird name!

46
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,360
We know where he is. Let’s go.

47
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
Calm down.

48
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,780
You don’t even know what he’s like.

49
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,740
How are you going to talk to him?

50
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,220
You’re right.

51
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,220
[Sarawat]

52
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,800
Someone posted a video of Sarawat.

53
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,500
Sarawat, you bought snacks for you.

54
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,420
I don’t like snacks

55
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,120
What do you like then?

56
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,200
I don’t.

57
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,760
You don’t like anything at all? Or…

58
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,440
I don't like it when people buy me snacks.

59
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,940
That’s okay. I will take it.

60
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,600
How hot does he think he is?

61
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,180
I’m hotter but I don’t do that.

62
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,420
Let me see. Where is your hotness?

63
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,640
Why don’t I see it?

64
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Right here.

65
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,300
There’s more.

66
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
Another video.

67
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,240
Hi. Can we get a picture…?

68
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,880
Just do it.

69
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,600
1 2. Here.

70
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,540
This guy is not only antisocial,

71
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,280
but he is also a jerk.

72
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,280
This is the best one

73
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,620
Someone found his schedule.

74
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,940
He’s about to get out of class.

75
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,700
What now, Tine?

76
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,760
Should we go now?

77
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,800
Definitely! What are you waiting for?

78
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,980
Seems like it’s not just me who wants to see Sarawat.

79
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,060
Look on the bright side, this means our source is reliable.

80
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,980
Reliable my ass!

81
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,060
My spy just told me that the schedule is fake

82
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,000
What?

83
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,020
Sarawat is actually at the University's main building.

84
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,600
Main Building?

85
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,500
Main Building?

86
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,140
That’s it.

87
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,360
That’s how everything started

88
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,900
I am running to find the right one…

89
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,320
and I stop at…

90
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
…him.

91
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
Sarawat.

92
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,340
Sarawat.

93
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,580
Saraleo! (asshole)

94
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,920
I am sorry.

95
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,120
It’s…

96
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,500
What?

97
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,180
It’s…

98
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,120
Say it already. I’m in a rush.

99
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
Can you…?

100
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,560
Keep looking at me like that…

101
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
and I will kiss till you drop

102
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,100
You’re annoying.

103
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,100
Wat, I need to talk to you.

104
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,360
Can you please help…?

105
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,460
What are you doing?

106
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,560
Helping you

107
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
You said you needed my help.
