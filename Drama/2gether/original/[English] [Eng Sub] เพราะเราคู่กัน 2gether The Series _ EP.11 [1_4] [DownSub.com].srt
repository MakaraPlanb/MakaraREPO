1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
 

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,870
 

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,225
 

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,400
Wow!

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,140
This room is way better than my dorm.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,560
Whose room is it anyway?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,580
I am thinking…it can be our room

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,640
Move in with me?

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,100
No, Man!

12
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,260
You’re a gentleman.

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,580
You’re a gentleman.

14
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,740
We haven’t talked about you making me jealous yet

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,520
If you’re still mad,

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,000
you can punish me all night right here.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,960
I like you…

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,920
like a brother.

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Give it here.

20
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,480
 

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,480
Is there a special occasion? Why are we drinking?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Not really.

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,780
It’s just that we haven’t celebrated

24
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,520
since we moved in here.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,300
By the way,

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,240
is there anything troubling you?

27
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,660
Anything you want to share?

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,420
I am here for you

29
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,940
Me?

30
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,700
I’m good

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,080
Nothing is troubling me

32
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,020
Nothing at all.

33
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260
No.

34
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,740
Hey!

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,040
Let’s play a game.

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,240
Winner gets to ask one question.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,020
Loser drinks up.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,540
Let’s get started

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,480
I forgot to choose head or tail.

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,900
Dumbass.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,160
I’m head.

42
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,395
 

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,260
Head!

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,000
Drink up!

45
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,900
What do you want to ask?

46
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,000
You said you wrote a love song.

47
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,420
What’s it called?

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,760
I haven’t named it yet

49
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,860
Just describe it then

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,260
Is the lyric about…

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,620
[Your Smile by Sarawat]

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,520
… smile or happiness?

53
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
Don’t cheat.

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,200
You flipped the coin once but asked so many questions

55
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,820
Fine. I’ll do it again.

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Head!

57
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,320
Again?

58
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,120
Yes.

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,380
Look.

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,940
Drink up.

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,260
You said you had never had a girlfriend

62
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,880
Have you ever had a crush on someone though?

63
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
I have.

64
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
Who?

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,960
A friend from high school

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,420
Long time ago.

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,620
Play on.

68
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,740
Sure.

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,180
This is so good.

70
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,880
 

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Head!

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
 

73
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,680
Three times in a row?

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,580
Are you cheating?

75
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,740
I am not.

76
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,660
It’s head.

77
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,420
 

78
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Bottoms up!

79
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,000
Did you hit on her?

80
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,080
No.

81
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,260
Why not?

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,640
I don’t know

83
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,440
I’m dizzy.

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,660
Wait!

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,460
Get up.

86
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,680
Just get up.

87
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,700
One more game.

88
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,760
One more game.

89
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,180
Tine, I can’t play

90
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,680
Head!

91
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,140
Wat!

92
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,020
Did you write a love song for her?

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,500
Is the song ‘Your Smile’ for her?

94
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,320
Damn it!

95
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,175
 

96
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:35,585
 

97
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:37,815
 

98
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,445
 

99
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:41,985
 

100
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:45,665
 

101
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:46,665
 

102
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:50,345
 

103
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:54,045
 

104
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:57,385
 

105
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:00,265
 

106
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,355
 

107
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,475
 

108
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:07,655
 

109
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,065
 

110
00:05:11,065 --> 00:05:12,380
 

111
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,220
 

112
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:19,225
 

113
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:22,785
 

114
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,205
 

115
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,745
 

116
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:29,195
 

117
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,825
 

118
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:35,075
 

119
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:36,825
 

120
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:38,725
 

121
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:40,675
 

122
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:42,745
 

123
00:05:43,555 --> 00:05:44,925
 

124
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:48,875
 

125
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,820
 

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,220
Tine saw the video?

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,660
Why didn’t you tell him the truth?

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,080
That’s my business.

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,720
And now you won’t get to hear things about P’Type.

130
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
Hold on, my friend.

131
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,780
You did the right thing.

132
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,700
Personal space is important even for couples

133
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,080
Do you have any updates on P’Type?

134
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,620
He has an internship program.

135
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,740
But I’m not sure whether it’s in Chiang Mai or Bangkok

136
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,540
He seems to be interested in the one in Chiang Mai

137
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,180
How do you know?

138
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,420
Let me guess.

139
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,420
He doesn’t want to be near you.

140
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,460
You’re wrong.

141
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,780
He will end up here in Bangkok.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,760
You guys will see

143
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,360
Hold it.

144
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,760
Tine said P’Type will do the internship here in Bangkok

145
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,940
How did you know?

146
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,160
I prayed to god.

147
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,780
You’re credulous.

148
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,040
I’m out of here.

149
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,100
I have to go somewhere

150
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,140
Where?

151
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,220
The Club.

152
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,900
We’re going on a trip to plant trees.

153
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,720
You guys wanna come?

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
Sounds nice.

155
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,400
But I’m not available.

156
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
See yah!

157
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,540
And you?

158
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,240
I am not free either.

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,920
My boyfriend is having an internship program

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,500
I will spend my time taking care of him

161
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,660
Good luck, bro.

162
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,080
Be careful with them.

163
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,160
You are so cute.

164
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,940
Green!

165
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,180
Let them do it.

166
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,940
Your job is to do the headcount

167
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,500
It’s almost done.

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,760
It’s hot!

169
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
I’m gonna hit you with this

170
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,820
 

171
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,620
Do you have a place to sit?

172
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,020
You can sit beside me.

173
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,740
I heard Architecture students are busy with the workload

174
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,820
How come you have time for a trip?

175
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,740
It depends on who is on the trip

176
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,160
Well, this trip is a waste for you.

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,600
Let’s sit here, Tine.

178
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,460
 

179
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,760
What a nice weather!

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Yeah?

181
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,580
It’s polluted in my opinion

182
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,780
Aren’t you gonna ask how I know that you’re here?

183
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,480
There’s only one coffee shop near my workplace

184
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,780
It’s not hard to find for someone so nosy

185
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,000
I didn’t come to see you.

186
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,180
I came to read

187
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,559
 

188
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,119
And where is your book?

189
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,140
In here

190
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,420
Didn’t bring one?

191
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,780
 

192
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,900
I forgot my book in the car.

193
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,320
I’ll go get it.

194
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,340
Be right back.

195
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,580
 

196
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,785
 

197
00:09:05,505 --> 00:09:06,505
 

198
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:09,785
 

199
00:09:09,785 --> 00:09:11,340
 

200
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,140
Excuse me.

201
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,100
Can I buy one book from you, please?

202
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,040
I haven’t finished any of them yet

203
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Come on.

204
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,320
Trust me. It’s worth it.

205
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
You can buy a brand-new book

206
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,080
Excuse me.

207
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Have you seen the cute guy sitting right here just now?

208
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,800
He left.

209
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,740
Left?

210
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes.

211
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
Thank you.

212
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,560
Hey!

213
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,200
People say the stars there are breathtaking

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,560
Do you want to see?

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
Sure.

216
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,720
I’m going to take a nap.

217
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,760
Saving up energy for tonight’s activity.

218
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,520
Don’t take advantage of me while I’m sleeping

219
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
 

220
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,580
 

221
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,820
Can I borrow your phone?

222
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,740
I forgot to charge mine last night.

223
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,960
I want some music

224
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 

225
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,005
 

226
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,095
 

227
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
 

228
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,940
Let’s get our bags inside and go for the stargazing.

229
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,460
Ok

230
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,120
It’s raining.

231
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,480
 

232
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,480
Let’s wait until it stops and come back out.

233
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,500
You’re gonna have to wait until the morning.

234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,260
You two better take a rest.

235
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,360
We have a bunch of exciting activities for you tomorrow

236
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Let’s go.

237
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,860
It’s hot out here.

238
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,720
I forgot my sunscreen.

239
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 

240
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,520
I brought one. You can use mine.

241
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,800
I can take care of my boyfriend

242
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,200
We don’t need your help.

243
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Here

244
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,120
For you.

245
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,740
Green! You’re doing it again?

246
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,300
 

247
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 

248
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,220
So cute.

249
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Green?

250
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
You.

251
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,080
Come on. People are planting.

252
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
 

253
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,620
Can you do it?

254
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Sure I can.

255
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,260
 

256
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,220
What are you doing?

257
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,580
Naming our tree.

258
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,840
[Nuisance Tree]

259
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,180
I can tell which tree is ours in case I come back here 10 years later

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,440
Do you really think we will last 10 years?

261
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,180
Maybe not.

262
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,500
I want to be with you more than that.

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,860
I told you to take it off.

264
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,000
But I don’t think so!

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Take it off!

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,140
It’s okay.

267
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,340
 

268
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,840
Ouch!

269
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
What’s wrong?

270
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,540
I’ve got dust in my eyes.

271
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,020
I’ll get you some water.

272
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,460
 

273
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,220
Thanks.

274
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
What are you doing?

275
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,120
Well, you left him.

276
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,860
Give me your hands.

277
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,160
Wash them first.

278
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,660
You aren’t wearing the bracelet?

279
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,440
Are you sure you didn’t forget it in a bathroom?

280
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,580
I am

281
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,520
You will go into the woods in pairs

282
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,320
light your candles and pray to the pine tree spirit.
