00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:04,545
 

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:05,985
 

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:07,925
 

5
00:00:07,995 --> 00:00:10,895
 

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,740
 

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,100
Why are you checking it so closely?

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,700
Is that Sarawat?

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,980
Is that Sarawat?

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:29,980
No.

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,400
You’re mistaken.

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,500
He is.

13
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,800
Sara…

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,480
Pear, look.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,180
This case is so beautiful.

16
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,440
Touch it.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
What?

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,340
It’s so beautiful.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,120
Look.

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,960
Aren’t they all the same?

21
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,840
No.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,160
Never mind.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,180
Tine, thank you for helping me choose the guitar and waiting for my mom with me

25
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,340
 

26
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,280
It’s my pleasure.

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,780
Thank you

28
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,900
Should we do some other heavenly thing together?

29
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,480
I just realized I got something to do

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,900
If you want to go home, you can

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,360
See you later.

32
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,580
Sir, this seat is already taken.

33
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,140
I think he already left.

34
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,040
Left?

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,080
Yes.

36
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,620
Someone dropped this.

37
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,160
I think it belongs to him.

38
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,320
Thank you.

39
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,060
Here you are.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Looking for me?

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,260
I just want to see if Law cheerleaders can beat Political Science cheerleaders

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,920
Who are you looking for?

43
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,500
Wat can’t be here. He has guitar practice

44
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,740
Who told you I was looking for him?

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,520
I’m looking for my friends

46
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,200
Since we are here, let’s take a photo and capture the moment.

47
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,200
Your skin is so bright.

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,760
Send it to me.

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Okay.

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
Good luck and see you.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,440
I hope you’re qualified.

52
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,720
Your friends said you had guitar practice.

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,660
I bailed on it

54
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,540
How did you know that I’m here?

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,540
[Here to see U Cheerleader qualification. Law is the best]

56
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,640
I knew it

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,660
A bunch of girls here but they wanted to take a photo with me

58
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,940
Those guys were just messing with me.

59
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,320
Messing with you or with me exactly?

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
What do you mean?

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
Forget it.

62
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,680
Why don’t you clean your face?

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,360
I want to but the makeup is waterproof.

64
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,780
It won’t come out.

65
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
 

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,700
You go around with a makeup remover in your bag?

67
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,340
It is for you.

68
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,200
Can you be gentle? You’re plucking my eyebrows.

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,940
Did you hit on anyone when I wasn’t around?

70
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,680
No.

71
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,220
Of course not.

72
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
Who would I hit on?

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,340
The names of our University Cheerleaders are out!

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,580
Tine, you are enlisted.

75
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
I am?

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,540
Yep!

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,700
I am tired. I don’t want to practice for the U Cheerleader.

78
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,180
Isn’t it good?

79
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,980
You will get to wear makeup more often

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,400
Sarcastic much?

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,560
Give me the remover.

82
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,800
I can use it next time

83
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,180
No. It’s mine.

84
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,460
Why are you being stingy?

85
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
You’re such a hog.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,840
I’ll clean the makeup for you after every show, all right

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,140
Now stop complaining.

88
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,580
You’re annoying.

89
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Face up.

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Turn this way.

91
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
 

92
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Done.

93
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,560
A thank you would be nice.

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,500
THANK YOU!

95
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,620
My hubby, Sarawat.

96
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,840
Your wifey has brought you snacks.

97
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,500
What possessed you? Why did you bring me snacks?

98
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,540
And when did I become your husband?

99
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,820
I brought you snacks to say sorry.

100
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,860
Sorry that I teased you before.

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,460
Teased me what?

102
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,100
I think I just found the one.

103
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,200
Now I know how it feels to meet the person we like

104
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,080
But I don’t know who he is or where he lives

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,220
I don’t even know his name

106
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,960
I don’t know if I ever get to see him again

107
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,420
What do you think I should do?

108
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,700
Should I give up?

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,740
If you really are my best friend, you know the answer

110
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,860
Give me my snacks.

111
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,440
[Club Rooms]

112
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:01,220
Thank you for helping me with the guitar and for making the video with me.

113
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,260
If my friend was available, I wouldn’t have to bother you this much.

114
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,560
Don’t mention it.

115
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,060
It’s my pleasure to help you, Pear.

116
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,620
Is there anything going on between you and Sarawat?

117
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,880
Are you crazy?

118
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,300
What does he mean by this message?

119
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,840
[Time for revenge. I am gonna post all the pics in his phone.]
