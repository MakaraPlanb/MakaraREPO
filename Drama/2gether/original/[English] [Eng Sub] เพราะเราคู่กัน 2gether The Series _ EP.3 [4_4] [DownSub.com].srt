00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:05,845
 

3
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,005
 

4
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:11,375
 

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,480
 

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,000
Is there anything going on between you guys?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,300
Green is listening.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,040
Just say yes.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,720
Otherwise, my plan will screw

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,240
He’s just a friend from Music Club.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,360
What a relief!

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,320
Let’s continue your cheerleading practice.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,760
That order belongs to Sarawat

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,080
I will make you a new one.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,800
That’s okay. I can drink this one.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,420
What is wrong with you?

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,260
Do you have to ask?

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,360
What did you tell Green yesterday?

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
You told me to be flirtatious in front of Green

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,340
But…

21
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,640
I know.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,480
You were in front of your fans.

23
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,500
But couldn’t you just help say yes and deal with your fans later?

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,540
Does it mean everyone else can know that I’m hitting on you?

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,000
Forget it.

26
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,880
All you care about is your popularity.

27
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,620
I get it

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,240
You don’t get it.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,540
Don’t get what?

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,340
I will make you get it.

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,160
This girl is pretty.

32
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,380
Pretty what?

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,360
Pretty amazing!

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,880
We’re looking for info for our report, not looking at girls.

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,760
We are not looking at girls.

36
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,240
We are finding some info on Instagram.

37
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,760
Guys, look!

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,420
Nice coffee cup.

39
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,540
I think so too.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,780
It makes me want to drink coffee. My freakin’ ass!!

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,640
I didn’t tell you to look at the cup.

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,680
Look at the account name.

43
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,360
Look at the account name

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,720
Do you think it belongs to Sarawat?

45
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
He’s not the type who is on Instagram.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,800
Shit!

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,160
It is really his.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,260
His friends keep commenting on his post

49
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,040
‘Sarawat broke his own rule and created an IG account just to hit on someone.’

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,420
Is that person you, Tine?

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,200
Not me.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
He’s blushing

53
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,540
He humiliated me in front of his fans yesterday

54
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,600
Really?

55
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,080
That’s weird.

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,440
What’s weird?

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,040
He cares so much about his fans and popularity.

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,240
Are you sure?

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,520
If he really cares about that, why would he let a senior post a video of him and you together?

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,040
He could have told him to delete it if he didn’t want.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,700
I agree.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,440
Do you think he has some other reasons why he said that to his fans?

63
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
Whatever

64
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,100
Let’s do the report.

65
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,760
I’m hungry.

66
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,520
How cute!

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,380
This shop belongs to Jae Tun, a former student from the Faculty of Architecture

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,820
No one is taking our orders.

69
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,060
Regular customers don’t need to order. Jae Tun will serve you whatever she feels like it.

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,660
Eat if you like. Throw away if you don’t

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,160
People usually throw away her food.

72
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,620
Why did you take us here then?

73
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,680
You have no idea

74
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,620
The highlight of this restaurant is here

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,540
Jae Tun hires hot girls from her Faculty to help run the shop

76
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,980
She has this concept ‘gross food, good girls

77
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,420
This is strawberry milk with ketchup.

78
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:16,660
This is green tea with red lemon soda.

79
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,100
Thank you.

80
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,620
The last one here is ice-cream with spicy mango sauce

81
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,780
Do you want more ketchup?

82
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,400
Yes, please.

83
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,560
Look at each menu

84
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,640
Can we go to a new restaurant?

85
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,520
It’s called creativity.

86
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,540
Creativity?

87
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,040
Look. Sarawat just posted something

88
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,720
[1 or 2?]

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is it?

90
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
I don’t know.

91
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,780
If you want to know, ask him in person.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,780
What the heck is he doing here?

93
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,780
P’Dim told him to promote the music event around the University

94
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,300
Don’t mind him.

95
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,160
Let’s eat before this place is packed with his fans

96
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,040
Is this even edible?

97
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,900
You said it’s creativity.

98
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Go on

99
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
 

100
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,420
They look normal but edible.

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,920
Someone ordered these for you

102
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,320
They look normal because they're not on our menu.

103
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,380
Who ordered for me?

104
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,100
I can’t say

105
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
Don't ask any more questions

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,540
I don't want to slip ut.

107
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,040
It’s okay to slip out.

108
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,500
Slip out please.

109
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,580
Who is it?

110
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,160
I think I know who

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,540
Tine!

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,900
We haven’t met for hours.

113
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,660
Did you miss me?

114
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,980
Stop it, Green.

115
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,540
Why did you order a cake for me? I don’t like cakes

116
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,460
Cake?

117
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,840
What cake?

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,360
The cake you ordered for me.

119
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,980
You didn’t order this?

120
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,060
Then who did?

121
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,940
Who ordered a cake for my beloved Tine?

122
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,240
Sarawat

123
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,940
Did you order that cake for Tine?

124
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Yes.

125
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,760
I wanted to.

126
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,420
Why? You said you were just friends yesterday.

127
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,620
Friends won’t do things like this.

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,620
And what did you mean when you said you created an IG account just to flirt with someone?

129
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,540
Did you mean Tine?

130
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,300
Can you make it clear here?

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,540
Tell us.

132
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,380
1 or 2?

133
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,760
What?

134
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
Just choose.

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,200
Choose what?

136
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,400
Just choose

137
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,140
1.

138
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,180
2. means I’m hitting on you

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,000
But Tine chose 1.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,120
That means Sarawat isn’t hitting on Tine?

141
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,860
1. means you are hit on…by me

142
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,480
Both 1 and 2 mean I like you.

143
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,100
Got it?

144
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,420
What?

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,220
Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

146
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,020
I will redecorate my room.

147
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,920
Great! Your room is totally a haunted house

148
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,440
Wat, wake up!

149
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,640
Why didn’t you wear any clothes?

150
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,940
I didn’t?

151
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,720
I guess you saw everything.

152
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,180
Is he your boyfriend?

153
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,580
There is an Open House tomorrow.

154
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,140
Take Phukong with you so he can observe the Faculty he likes

155
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,260
You’ve changed a lot.

156
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,380
That makes me scare.

157
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,420
If I really like someone, will I change too?

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,740
It is not that scary.

159
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,980
You will know when you find the right one.

160
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,835
