1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,185 --> 00:00:06,175
 

3
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:09,245
 

4
00:00:09,245 --> 00:00:10,495
 

5
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:12,575
 

6
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:16,004
 

7
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:18,225
 

8
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:23,485
 

9
00:00:30,895 --> 00:00:31,895
 

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,220
 

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,180
Looking for me?

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Hey!

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,860
How can you still stand?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,660
Didn’t you break your leg?

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,440
I just got a little scrape from a wrong tackle

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,220
When did I break my leg?

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,500
Man posted on his IG that your leg is broken

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,180
Man was just being Man. You believe him?

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,680
It’s good you’re here though.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,160
So I don’t need to do it myself.

21
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,400
Why would I?

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,780
Do it yourself.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,460
My energy ran out.

24
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,160
Bandage me, please.

25
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:39,885
 

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
 

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,840
Tine, be gentle.

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
 

29
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,380
Why are your hands shaking so much?

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,540
I…

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,140
I am afraid of blood.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 

33
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,860
I guess I am too

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,740
Because I am all shaking here.

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,820
I meant my heart

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,120
Uh…

37
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,680
I got some work to do.

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,360
I will be off now

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,480
Hey!! We won!

40
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,100
I told you

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,180
8 years in practice at Old Trafford

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,640
You’re here too?

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
That’s great. We are celebrating.

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,900
Come with us.

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,020
Uh…

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,060
Come on. Come with us!

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,420
Your friends are coming too

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,780
Especially Phuak

49
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,700
He said he had stories to tell

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,360
Let’s go.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,060
To Political Science victory!

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,980
Cheers!

53
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,340
 

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,600
To 10 points for our presentation!

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,200
Cheers!

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,480
To the parking spot that we fought for this morning!

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,660
Cheers!

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,100
Bottoms up.

59
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,460
See? I drink it all.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
Drink up, Tine.

61
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,140
 

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,480
Why do you guys keep celebrating?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,100
It’s like you’re trying to get me drunk.

64
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,380
And why are you avoiding my eye contact?

65
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,740
Don’t tell me that you want them to get me drunk

66
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,220
Huh?

67
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,760
He was just playing.

68
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,500
You’re overthinking it

69
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,040
I am envious

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,180
You have someone so cute to play with.

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,360
What about the one you met at the seminar?

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,940
Go play with him.

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,980
I don’t even know what his name is

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,960
It’s no problem. Just look for him then.

75
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,960
Go to every freaking seminar.

76
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,660
Right, inspector?

77
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,740
Copy that, sergeant!

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,640
You guys talk too much.

79
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,560
To us for being lucky enough to get this table!

80
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,260
Cheers!

81
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,100
Cheers!

82
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,780
Enough already.

83
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,920
Cheers!

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 

85
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:13,765
 

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
Where are all my friends?

88
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,280
Why did they leave me to get drunk alone?

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,620
To your friends that are missing!

90
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,920
Cheers!

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,640
My beloved friend, Tine.

92
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,500
To the Line ID I got from a hot girl there!

93
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,180
Cheers!

94
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
Great!

96
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,260
Cheers!

97
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
 

98
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:55,485
 

99
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
 

100
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,120
 

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,840
 

102
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:14,905
 

103
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:16,825
 

104
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:18,385
 

105
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:22,505
 

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
 

107
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,720
How was your night?

108
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,940
They got me so drunk I passed out.

109
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,300
Which one of you got me home last night?

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,900
Don’t tell me you still haven’t seen it on your IG

111
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,900
- IG?
- Yes.

112
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,820
Where is your room key?

113
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,300
What are you trying to grab?

114
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,420
Stay still.

115
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,720
It was fun though

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
- Do it one more time
- No.

117
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,100
Hey! What are you doing?

118
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,120
I’m taking them off so you will be comfortable

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,660
Take them all off.

120
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,020
[tine_chic : I am reserved.]

121
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,540
SARALEO!!

122
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,735
 

123
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,740
Between Green and Sarawat, I can’t even tell who is more dangerous at this point.

124
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,500
I’d say Sarawat.

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,200
He found a way to your room

126
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,120
I won’t be surprised if you become his one day

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,460
By the way, Green is not bothering you anymore

128
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,140
When will you tell Sarawat to stop with this fake flirting thing?

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,120
Right.

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Right

131
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:05,980
 

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,420
A hundred drawings as promised.

133
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,060
It’s your turn to keep your promise.

134
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,560
He has done a great job

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,800
If you say no,

136
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,700
you’re a loser

137
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
Sure.

138
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,579
I will be your tutor.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,640
Are you happy?

140
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,560
Tine.

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,340
Green.

142
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,420
Why are you here?

143
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,100
I know everything

144
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,800
You asked Sarawat to fake flirting with you.

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,700
No.

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
Why did you lie to me?

148
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,400
I heard you and your friends talking in the bathroom

149
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
I know it was all your plan

150
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,820
Why did you have to be so harsh?

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,980
I didn’t mean to be harsh.

152
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,400
But…

153
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
I just…

154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,280
Tine, I know that I’m not good enough for you.

155
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,320
But please…

156
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,360
Give me one more chance

157
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
 

158
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,980
Who said I flirted with him just to get rid of you?

159
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,640
I did everything

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,000
because I genuinely like Tine.

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,340
I don’t believe you.

162
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,860
I know that everything is just a plan.

163
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,680
It was a plan at first

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,360
But then I realized…

165
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
I really like Tine

166
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,020
I will never believe that

167
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,480
You don’t?

168
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,680
Do you want us to kiss and prove?

169
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,520
This song is for someone so silly who didn’t get to hear it when I played the first time.

170
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,140
Do you want to grab something to eat?

171
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,980
You want to eat with me. It’s weird.
