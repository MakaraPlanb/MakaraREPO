1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,030
 

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,870
 

3
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,795
 

4
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:09,395
 

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,220
 

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,280
I’m refurnishing my room.

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,260
Good.

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,300
Your room is like a haunted house.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,580
Wat! Wake up!

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,760
Why did you sleep naked?

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,580
I didn’t wear anything?

12
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,960
So you saw everything in Sarawat Expo?

13
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,260
Your girlfriend said it?

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,800
Your University will have an Open House tomorrow

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,200
Take Phukong with you so he can observe the Faculty he likes

16
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,420
If you listen to Scrubb’s songs when you are happy, you will be even happier

17
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,260
If you listen when you are in love, you will be more deeply in love.

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,680
I get it now.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,280
My seniors’ band will perform at Faculty of Accountancy next week.

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,160
They are playing Scrubb songs.

21
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,180
You can take Pear to see

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,020
I’ll think about it.

23
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,380
Why?

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,180
I don’t know.

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,420
I like it better when you play guitar

26
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,080
It sounds perfect for Scrubb songs.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,600
I’m not so sure about other bands.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,380
But…

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,500
I won’t ask you to play Scrubb songs for Pear again

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,120
I feel bad

31
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,520
Asking you to fake flirting with me bothers you enough already

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,640
It’s good that you know

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,780
I’ll just see you off here

34
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,380
I need to help them clean up

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,580
See you later.

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
 

37
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:52,815
 

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
 

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
Who is that?

40
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,380
A kid from Music Club maybe

41
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,340
Why?

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,620
 

43
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,375
 

44
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:07,785
 

45
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:10,014
 

46
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,645
 

47
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,115
 

48
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,865
 

49
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:18,865
 

50
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:22,545
 

51
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:26,245
 

52
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:29,585
 

53
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,465
 

54
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:35,555
 

55
00:02:35,675 --> 00:02:36,675
 

56
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,855
 

57
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:43,265
 

58
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:44,575
 

59
00:02:47,715 --> 00:02:49,415
 

60
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:51,425
 

61
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:54,985
 

62
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,405
 

63
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,945
 

64
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,395
 

65
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:05,025
 

66
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,275
 

67
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,025
 

68
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:10,925
 

69
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,875
 

70
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,945
 

71
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,125
 

72
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:21,075
 

73
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,020
 

74
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,080
Sarawat won’t take his eyes off you, Tine.

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,100
Are you guys a thing?

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,240
Is that for me?

77
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,260
Of course not.

78
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,220
I am just scratching my cheek

79
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,060
I have a homework for you.

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,120
Last time, you guys recorded a video individually

81
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,760
This time, you will record and turn in the video in pair

82
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,160
If you got your mate already, inform Air

83
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,700
and go home.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
Tine.

85
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,740
Who said we would pair up?

86
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,460
We are both beginners.

87
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,480
We will go down in flames.

88
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,980
I’m going to ask Pear.

89
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,920
She is a beginner too.

90
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,240
She is not even here today

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,860
Plus, she must have a partner already

92
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,760
Plus, she must have a partner already

93
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,540
What should we do?

94
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,240
Hurry up!

95
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,780
I want to go home

96
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,300
Have you paired up with anyone?

97
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,200
No.

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,900
Pair with me then

99
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
No.

100
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,620
No need to ask. I have been waiting for you here

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,160
Hi guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,820
The person next to me is…

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
Tine’s boyfriend.

104
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,635
 

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,800
Hi guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic

106
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,080
The person next to me is…

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,640
Tine’s HUSBAND!

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,660
I’ll smack your freaking head!

109
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,040
Can you be serious here?

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,120
I am being serious.

111
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,340
Hi guys. I am Tine, Mr. Chic.

112
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,460
The person next to me is Sarawat.

113
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
What song are we playing today?

114
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,400
I lost the chords.

115
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
That’s right! We are playing I Lost the Chords

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,320
Can you stop playing?

117
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,380
Playing what?

118
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,160
I seriously can’t find the chord sheet

119
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,000
I just gave it to you

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,740
It’s here.

121
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
 

122
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:17,360
♪ I never thought I would have such a great day with you by my side like this ♫

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,760
♪ I instantly felt it the second we first met ♫

124
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,200
♪ It’s like there was something ♫

125
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,400
Shit!

126
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,040
My nails are too short

127
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
I can’t play.

128
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,640
Can I borrow that thing?

129
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,260
It’s called a pick

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,200
And I have only one.

131
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,640
Just put up with it a little longer.

132
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,980
Stingy much?

133
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,240
Give it here

134
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,620
What do you think you’re doing?

135
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,140
 

136
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,420
Hey!!

137
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,540
Tine!!

138
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,800
What the heck did you just do?

139
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,280
Who taught you that a pick could be cut in half?

140
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,980
Here.

141
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,340
Now we have two

142
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,840
You think this is funny?

143
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,420
One pick per person!

144
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,080
We can’t share it. It can’t be used anymore.

145
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,640
Oh what?

146
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn’t know

147
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,740
Then…

148
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,380
Let’s call it a day.

149
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,980
We will record again another time

150
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,920
My Faculty football team is playing.

151
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,640
Cheerleaders must be there.

152
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,860
They are playing today?

153
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,100
That means your Faculty plays against mine.

154
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,600
Cheer for me

155
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,680
Are you crazy?

156
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
I have to be on the Law side

157
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,720
What is with you?

158
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,100
I helped flirt with you to get rid of Green and just now you cut my pick in half

159
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,220
You can’t do this little thing for me?

160
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,320
Come on. You can’t seriously be upset

161
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,740
Fine.

162
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,860
I will be on the Law side

163
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,860
but cheer for you inside. Okay?

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Fine.

165
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,680
It’s good enough knowing that you’re there

166
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,180
You mean on my Faculty side?

167
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
No.

168
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
In my heart

169
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,520
I will be going now.

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,240
See you soon, nuisance.

171
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
What?

172
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,900
Are we so close that he can pat my head?

173
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,220
Oops!

174
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,420
5 6 7 8.

175
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
Sarawat!

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,720
Sarawat!

177
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,420
Sarawat!

178
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,840
Sarawat!

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,240
Sarawat!

180
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,740
Sarawat!

181
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,220
Sarawat!

182
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,900
You came to the wrong side.

183
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,980
It’s for Law team here.

184
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,280
I am thirsty.

185
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,400
Thirsty?

186
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,680
Tell the staff on your side.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,620
Who did the makeup for you?

188
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,320
You’re performing Chinese opera or what?

189
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,220
It’s the way cheerleaders do.

190
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,100
If you don’t like it, tell the makeup artist

191
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,940
If you don’t like it, tell the makeup artist.

192
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,900
Hold this.

193
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Bye.

194
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,060
What about your jersey?

195
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,360
Wash it for me

196
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,660
Tine!

197
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
 

198
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,620
What’s up?

199
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,760
Bad news.

200
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,640
What?

201
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,080
Hey! That’s the cheerleaders.

202
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,800
It’s Fong.

203
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,460
What’s wrong with Fong?

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,080
Come here.

205
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,180
She dumped me.

206
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,040
I saw her with some yellow-haired, motorbike dude.

207
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,700
They might be just friends

208
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,260
She tried on a freaking wedding gown.

209
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,500
calm down

210
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,520
I don’t want to calm down

211
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,920
I’ll kick his fu*king ass.

212
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,740
In this condition, he will kick your ass first.

213
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,980
Ohm, go get his shoe

214
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,120
Don’t stop me.

215
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,320
Do you want a problem?

216
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,060
[L Co Hol]

217
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,540
What a small world!

218
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,180
My name is Man. People call me Man-Oh-Hum

219
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh Ho!

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,980
I don’t know how it became Oh Hum

221
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,320
And this is…

222
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,620
Boss,

223
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,080
a warm guy with a sexy body

224
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,020
And that is…

225
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,980
You all know his name.

226
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,200
Sarawat.

227
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,160
If you want to know more about him, you can ask Tine

228
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,580
What the heck!

229
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,620
This is Fong, Phuak, and Ohm

230
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,720
Fong is going through a heartbreak

231
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,900
so we brought him here to console him.

232
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,700
A broken heart is no problem at all compared to a lover with small boobs

233
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Don’t get yourself attached to just one person

234
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,140
Right, Mr. Sarawat?

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
It’s my business.

236
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,240
Great talk, Man.

237
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,740
To Man!

238
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,160
Cheers!

239
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
Cheer.

240
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,300
That was an awesome speech, Man.

241
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,440
Cheers!

242
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,540
I am Tine

243
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,020
Man is right there

244
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,480
and he hasn’t said anything for a while now

245
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,740
Tine.

246
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
What?

247
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,400
Are you drunk?

248
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,340
 

249
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,720
Can I touch your boobs?

250
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,900
What!?!

251
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,260
Are you crazy?

252
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,400
What a pervert!

253
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Be careful.

254
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Fong!

255
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,640
Fong!

256
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,560
Hold it until you get home

257
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,920
You can’t pee there.

258
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,340
Do it here!

259
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,000
Your car is parked over there. This is not yours

260
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,620
I’ll drive.

261
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,820
Tine!

262
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,080
Tine!

263
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Tine!

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Tine!

265
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,660
Give it here.

266
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,020
 

267
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,880
Tine.

268
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,220
Big boobbies!

269
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,400
Am I in the car?

270
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,140
Let me get you home

271
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
- Let's get them home.
- That's Tine.

272
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
 

273
00:14:36,305 --> 00:14:37,305
 

274
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:38,665
 

275
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:41,185
 

276
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
 

277
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Where are we?

278
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,180
Your dorm

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,420
Your dorm

280
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,840
Fong.

281
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,720
We are here.

282
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,940
Motherfu*ker!

283
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,380
Do you want to have a problem?

284
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,060
That’s Tine.

285
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,000
Fong!

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
Come get your friend

287
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Let me help.

288
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,160
Let me go.

289
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,900
- I'll kick his ass.
- That's Tine.

290
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,000
Calm down

291
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Let me go. I'm not drunk.

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,580
Are you all right?

293
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,380
Hell no

294
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,840
I’m completely sober because of Fong’s foot

295
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,980
Are you all right?

296
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
Wat, are you coming?

297
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,640
I will look after Tine.

298
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,540
Take care of Boss

299
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
See yah!

300
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,060
See you.

301
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
 

302
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,940
Aren’t you going?

303
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,360
I am walking a nuisance to his room

304
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,420
You don’t have to.

305
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,120
My room is just here.

306
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,800
I can walk myself there

307
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,380
I left my car at the bar

308
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,980
I can’t go home.

309
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Then hurry up and catch up with your friends

310
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,440
They left just now.

311
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,700
Call them.

312
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,080
The battery just died.

313
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,520
Let me see.

314
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,860
The battery died

315
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,240
Let me crash here tonight

316
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,800
Here?

317
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,420
Let me sleep in your room tonight

318
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,020
What kind of person do you like?

319
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,120
Do you like the weird one?

320
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,160
If I hear that you hit on her once, I’ll grab your boobs once
