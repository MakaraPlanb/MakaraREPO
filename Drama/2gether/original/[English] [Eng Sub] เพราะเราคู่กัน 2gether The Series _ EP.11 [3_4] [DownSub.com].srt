1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,185
 

2
00:00:03,085 --> 00:00:04,215
 

3
00:00:04,725 --> 00:00:06,015
 

4
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:07,945
 

5
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,915
 

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
 

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,660
Are you afraid of me?

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,840
The guys that hurt you are my friends, but I dealt with them for you

9
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,020
I won’t let someone I like to get bullied again

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,480
I said I am sorry

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,480
What else do you want from me?

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,720
Take him away from my boyfriend.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,500
He is hitting on Tine there

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,200
This is a very bad time to flirt.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,780
You’ll see. He will be embarrassed in front of your boy

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Shit!

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
It’s okay.

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,100
Just a fake one.

19
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,960
He is grabbing my boyfriend’s shoulder.

20
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,200
 

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,980
I am praying to you, the pine tree spirit…

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,160
You all close your eyes!

23
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,140
Please grant me my wish.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,300
Please make it come true.

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Hey!

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Why is it out?

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
It’s nothing.

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,920
close your eyes.

29
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,020
The spirit doesn’t like it when you pray with your eyes opened

30
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,840
What the heck are you looking at?

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,440
What?

32
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,020
There is no wind blowing

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,840
How come it’s out again?

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,380
Is it because of the pine tree spirit?

35
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,220
Nonsense.

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,440
Let’s try again.

37
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,400
Now you guys see his power?

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Close your eyes.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,940
Otherwise, you are doomed!

40
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
SHIT!

41
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,440
 

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,920
I’m telling you. The pine tree spirit is a holy and very haunted figure

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,340
Super haunted.

44
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,760
Don’t think too much

45
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,560
It’s not your fault.

46
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,460
Don’t be sad, alright?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Let’s go to bed.

48
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,580
We have to get up early.

49
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,920
I’m gonna turn off the light.

50
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
Get some sleep and stop thinking about it.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,280
Goodnight Krub.

52
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:43,515
 

53
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,320
 

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,200
 

55
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:51,080
 

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
 

57
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,400
Why is it so cold in here?

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,960
Can you sleep, Tine?

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
 

60
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,180
 

61
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,320
I apologize for what I’ve done wrong

62
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,420
 

63
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:50,765
 

64
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
 

65
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
What?

66
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,100
You just have to die now, don’t you?

67
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Tine!

68
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,720
Tine!

69
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,200
 

70
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,180
He was here.

71
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,580
What do we do?

72
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,680
I look this way

73
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,840
You go that way.

74
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,480
Yes.

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
Tine!

76
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,840
Shit! It’s raining.

77
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,760
You go back to the camp…

78
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,080
TINE!

79
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,740
Sarawat!

80
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,800
Tine!

81
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,720
You go that way then

82
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,220
Tine!

83
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,260
Tine!

84
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,860
Tine!

85
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,500
Where the heck are you?

86
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
Tine!

87
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,660
Tine!

88
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,620
Tine!

89
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
Tine!

90
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,240
Damn it!

91
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,400
Give it back.

92
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
You wanna see?

93
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,100
Yes.

94
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,820
He is going to hate me!

95
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,120
Why did you say that?

96
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
That way he will never know that you like him

97
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,220
I saw you at …
