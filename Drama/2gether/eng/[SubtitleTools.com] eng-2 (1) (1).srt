00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,960
Tine Teepakorn, a freshman from Faculty of Law,

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,980
I like you!

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,860
What?

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,960
You guys have to help me find a way to get rid of Green.

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,120
Date a guy then.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,160
Sarawat from Faculty of Political Science, IR major

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,860
How hot does he think he is?

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,440
This is the type of guy that can make Green back off.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,479
Seems like it’s not just me who wants to see Sarawat

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,600
Can you help…?

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,780
What are you doing?

12
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,000
Helping you.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Sorry.

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,380
A presentation is about to start.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,300
Why don’t you come tomorrow?

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,560
We are late because we were talking to those girls about you.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,160
They wanted to have my Facebook or Line ID, right?

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,580
They wanted to know about your ‘wanting to eat Sarawat’ status

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,100
How hungry were you, really?

20
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,460
I told you a thousand times that I didn’t post that.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,020
Sarawat did it.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,000
I have no idea how he knew my password.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,060
The first group, are you guys ready to present?

24
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,740
We are.

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,080
But may we have a second? We’re having a problem connecting to a projector.

26
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,960
Ohm, can you go borrow the cable from next door?

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,020
Me again?

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,860
Yes.

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,160
[Was Sarawat delicious?]

30
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,420
Sarawat, how did you know my lock screen password?

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,760
[You set a dumb password, 1 2 3 4 5 6.]

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,960
[Even a little kid can find out.]

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,680
Saraleo! Stop messing with my Facebook account

34
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,940
Do you even get what I mean?!?

35
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,460
[Sexy Uni Girl in Classroom]

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,480
Saraleo!

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,900
I am sorry for being loud, professor.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,220
Shit!

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,000
Damn it!

40
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,800
Shit! Since when?

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,460
Since your dumb password.

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,600
I wanted to tell you but it was so pleasing to watch

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,420
Guys, I got a new cable.

44
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,360
Tine, can I ask you a question?

45
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,780
Do you like Sarawat?

46
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,400
Of course not.

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,780
I like girls.

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,200
What a relief!

49
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,220
I saw you joined Team Sarawat’s Wives Group and you posted you wanted to eat him.

50
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,840
I was in shock

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,980
My friends were just messing around.

52
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,000
Why?

53
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,180
Are you afraid I will be taken?

54
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,700
I am afraid Sarawat will be taken.

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,760
It’s all good now. See you later.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,400
You better hurry and get his phone fixed

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,160
before your image is completely ruined.

58
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,580
You don’t usually have any to keep anyway.

59
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,600
Hey!

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,980
I do, all right?

61
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,880
Does he think he will get away with this so easily?

62
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,780
Are you getting revenge on him?

63
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,740
No.

64
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,520
I’m going to get his phone fixed.

65
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,160
Sir, do you think you can fix this one?

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,580
Let me see.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,260
Not hard,

68
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,000
Yo! Yo! I can fix it!

69
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,420
You can?

70
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,060
It can’t be turned on.

71
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,840
I think the battery dies.

72
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,080
Battery dies?

73
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,780
What is that smoke?

74
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,380
An electric shock, I guess.

75
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,680
Yo! Yo!

76
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,300
It’s nothing.

77
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,960
I can fix it

78
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,120
You sure?

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,480
Not hard, Yo! Yo!

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
It’s not hard to fix?

81
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,740
It’s not hard to give up and throw away

82
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,980
Yo! Yo!

83
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,580
May I recommend a new one? Yo! Yo!

84
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,200
I’ll give you a special price.

85
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,660
This one?

86
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,520
Yes.

87
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,020
I’m sure you’ll love it.

88
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,780
Yo! Yo!

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
It’s a triple-sim phone.

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,600
3 SIM?

91
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,060
Who would I call?

92
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Girls.

93
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,260
Is there any other shop around?

94
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,340
Hey!

95
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,600
This one is smaller and its battery lasts longer than your previous one

96
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,380
Plus a charger here.

97
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,920
The battery will be fully charged in no time.

98
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,080
I am sorry

99
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,380
I will ask my mom for money and buy you a new one.

100
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,300
Okay?

101
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,220
Don’t need to.

102
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,960
I already bought a new one

103
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,580
You did?

104
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,140
Why did you want me to fix your old one then?

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
Because you needed to take responsibility for the damage.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,140
Here is your phone.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,620
Wait!

108
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,440
I need to talk to you about something.

109
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,620
But I don’t.

110
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,640
Please. I will take less than 10 seconds. I promise.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
I give you 5…

112
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,080
4 3 2…

113
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,160
Be my boyfriend.

114
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,420
What on earth did you just say?

115
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,940
Not a real boyfriend

116
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,800
Just pretend that you like me.

117
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,340
I’ve been followed around by someone.

118
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,860
So I need you to be my shield.

119
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,080
Why?

120
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,600
Is she not pretty?

121
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,640
It’s a guy but I like girls.

122
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,440
What’s wrong with that?

123
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,700
It’s good that someone admires you.

124
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,080
It’s not good.

125
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,080
I don’t like people to get too involved with my personal life

126
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,960
You will never know.

127
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,720
Someday you might want someone to be a nuisance in your life.

128
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,240
That’s funny.

129
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,860
I know you don’t like people to invade your private life either.

130
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,620
There is one anyway.

131
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
One?

132
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,980
Where?

133
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,160
It’s you!

134
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,420
You’re such a nuisance in my life.

135
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Me?

136
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,280
You let him go just like that?

137
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,660
How stupid!

138
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,340
He said that to my face. What would you do?

139
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,500
Right, Fong?

140
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Right.

141
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,880
Phuak is right.

142
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,260
You don’t have his number. How will you contact him now?

143
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,720
You’re silly!

144
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,220
Ohm, go ahead and yell at me like these two just did.

145
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,120
Shit!

146
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,360
That’s it?

147
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,860
I wasn’t talking to you

148
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,940
Someone posted a video of Sarawat in a closed group

149
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,820
I’m sure we will get something out of this.

150
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,820
Sarawat, what club will you be joining tomorrow?

151
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,840
I don’t know.

152
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,240
What kind of activity do you like?

153
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,240
We might be in the same club.

154
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,720
Football, archery, planting, meditation, boxing, fencing…

155
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,520
Why doesn’t he mention scuba diving and coral planting too?

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,020
Scuba diving and coral planting too.

157
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,620
See?

158
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,880
Let’s not watch it.

159
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,980
It gets me frustrated

160
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,000
I think I just found you the way

161
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:10,500
If you can get in the same club he’s in, you’ll get to see him more often

162
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
That’s right

163
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,240
There’s one problem though.

164
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,440
We don’t know which club he’s going to join

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,680
Right.

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,380
That is easy.

167
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,620
A senior called him this morning and told him to go rehearse in the music club.

168
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,780
Music club?

169
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,840
You know and you just sit here making a dumb face?

170
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,120
What a dumb ass!

171
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,040
I don’t know what to call you, really

172
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,600
You give me a headache.

173
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,620
My head hurts!

174
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,680
But I can’t play any musical instrument.

175
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,520
Get into the club first and think about it later.

176
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,300
We will apply too and help you talk to Sarawat.

177
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,320
Hot freshmen over there, do you want to join Swimming Club?

178
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,780
We do.

179
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,820
Hold on!

180
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,580
What about our Music Club?

181
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,020
Music Club.

182
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,840
Music Club.

183
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,340
Swimming Club?

184
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,200
What?

185
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
We all do.

186
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,720
Where do we apply?

187
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
Right here.

188
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Tine!

189
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,600
Tine!

190
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,140
OH YOU'RE HERE-

191
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,080
Come with me.

192
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,860
Let me apply first.

193
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Come here!

194
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,960
Fill out your application.

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,400
Are you tired swimming?

196
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,740
Don’t look!

197
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,460
I found a club for you, Tine

198
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,720
Green, why are you here?

199
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,700
Don’t look at them.

200
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,520
Ta-da! Welcome to Cooking Club

201
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,960
I used to think I would cook for my boyfriend every day if I had one.

202
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,680
I made you some cookies.

203
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,920
Let’s try it

204
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,740
Wait a minute.

205
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,340
Why not? Don’t you want it?

206
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,500
It’s not that.

207
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,960
It looks yummy

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,840
It looks so yummy that I want to call my friends to taste it too

209
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,060
Really?

210
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,140
Really.

211
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,360
Good.

212
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,560
I have so many dishes I want you to try

213
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,320
Wait for me here just one moment.

214
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,460
Hurry back.

215
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,980
I’ll be back soon.

216
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,800
See you soon.

217
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,840
Okay.

218
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
[Music Club]

219
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,700
Guys, please get in line.

220
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
I got it!

221
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,820
Tine my beloved friend, how are you?

222
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,700
But you guys are bad friends.

223
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,100
You saw girls and you left me instantly.

224
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,920
How will you snatch your spot from those girls?

225
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,160
Hi guys.

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,220
My name is Air. I am a club secretary.

227
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,340
This is P’Dim. He is our club president.

228
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,720
Our Music Club was founded more than 30 years ago

229
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,860
It has brought fame and admiration to our University.

230
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,860
But this year…

231
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,980
I heard that many of you join our club because of some guy.

232
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,900
If you are only here just to chase a guy,

233
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,120
get up and find yourself out

234
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,920
Do it fiercely when we sing ‘bounces up and down

235
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,820
You just asked me to be your boyfriend yesterday

236
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,140
I guess a kiss from me won’t hurt

237
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,480
If you are only here just to chase a guy, get up and find yourself out.

238
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
Wait!

239
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,860
As long as you love music, we don’t mind how it all starts.

240
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,740
P’Dim, we can't take them all anyway. We have a limitation.

241
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,580
Don’t let that trivial thing ruin our standard.

242
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,180
I will deal with the University board about that.

243
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,700
Welcome everyone to our Music Club.

244
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,620
Before you become our club members,

245
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,940
you have to go through our special welcoming ceremony.

246
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,020
You all need to sing these famous songs so loud that every being in this place can hear

247
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,280
And that would be ‘Roasted Chicken’ and many activity songs.

248
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,120
Now everyone, get up!

249
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000

256
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,760
Come on out.

257
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,940
The reason to dance is that…

258
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,100
when we are on stage, we are all stiff.

259
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,300
This will break the ice and make you relax.

260
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,400
Kill it, man.

261
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,460
Come to the center.

262
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,320

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840

275
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,700
Why do I have to do things like this in life?

276
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,920

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,660
What about me?

281
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,760
You…bounce on top.

282
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,760
Who will be at the bottom?

283
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,940
No one.

284
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,020

One more spider and we will move on.

288
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
Do it fiercely when we sing ‘bounces up and down.’

289
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,460

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,000
We have come to our last activity.

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,540
This game is called ‘Snack For Friendship.’

293
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,679
It’s so easy.

294
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
You will feed a snack to your friend using…

295
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,040
…your mouth.

296
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,640
Air, hand them their snack.

297
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,660
How many?

298
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,720
One for each pair.

299
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,820
If you drop it, everyone in your row will be punished

300
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,560
One for each pair.

301
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,460
It will be a bit harder for girls.

302
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,020
Start now!

303
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,460
You need to eat it too.

304
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,560
Eat bit by bit, Wat!

305
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,300
Make it as short as possible

306
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,160
They totally pass.

307
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,460
Everyone in this place has gone through our welcoming ceremony!

308
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,600
You will have a 15-minute break.

309
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,340
After that, we will talk about our club rules.

310
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,320
See you guys in a bit.

311
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,500
What are you thinking about?

312
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,220
Everyone has gone on their break.

313
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,060
Thinking about what you did.

314
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,460
You think you can mess with me all you want?

315
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,000
You mean the kiss?

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,460
It wasn’t a kiss!

317
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,900
It was just a game. Why did you have to be serious about it?

318
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,340
Why are you being hot-headed now?

319
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,720
You just asked me to be your boyfriend yesterday.

320
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,560
A little kiss from me won’t hurt.

321
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,740
Tine, you are mischievous.

322
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,380
Only two seconds in that club and you got to kiss Sarawat

323
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,140
Our lips just touched, not a kiss.

324
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,240
Shit! Who recorded this?

325
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,260
Let’s take a break from this topic.

326
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,220
What I want to know is whether Sarawat agrees to help you or not.

327
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,000
You’re right. I didn’t ask him

328
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,140
I didn’t think about it.

329
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:44,160
I need to hurry before Green gets you kicked out of that club

330
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,480
Don’t worry. It’s easier to see him now

331
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,740
I will ask him to help me this evening.

332
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,180
That’s my boy.

333
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,040
See you then, Sarawat.

334
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,500
What? He’s not here?

335
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
Yes.

336
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,280
Those who can actually play will rehearse in a different room so you guys can focus.

337
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,860
These are the beginners from the first year?

338
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,960
For guitar, yes.

339
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,480
The rest are playing something else.

340
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,700
What do I need to do if I want to practice with those who can play?

341
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,880
You need to know the basic chords first.

342
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,620
You will get used to them in no time.

343
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,720
This guitar is a legend

344
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,860
It was used to win competitions?

345
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,120
Nope.

346
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,600
Its owner died of a heart attack.

347
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,540
It is now a club’s possession

348
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,160
Its strings are big and hard but you will get used to it one day

349
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,200
Come here. I’ll teach you.

350
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,440
This is chord C. It is the most basic one.

351
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,320
Look at my fingers.

352
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,840
Use your point, middle, and ring finger

353
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,959
Try it.

354
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,220
P’Air, you’re actually cute

355
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah?

356
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,160
Chord C now.

357
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,160
Like this?

358
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,280
It sounds wired. What did you do wrong?

359
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,700
Try it again.

360
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,840
What kind of strings are they? This is painful

361
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,580
Cooking Club always welcomes you, Tine

362
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,520
I heard that Music Club was cruel to you. They gave you an old guitar to practice.

363
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,440
I was so shocked.

364
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,600
I am more shocked that you know about this

365
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,080
I know everything about you

366
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,020
Move to my club and you will get to eat delicious food every day.

367
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,120
I made this especially for you

368
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you for your concern but I am okay

369
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,240
I need to get back to the club.

370
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Tine, don’t go!

371
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,220
Tine, you seem really determined.

372
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,880
I will do whatever it takes to be in this club

373
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
What?

374
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,000
I mean I will keep practicing hard.

375
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,360
I will play a song eventually.

376
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,060
That’s good.

377
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,980
But what you played earlier were all wrong.

378
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,300
No worries. You still have time. You will get better

379
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,800
We have no time.

380
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,580
Why is that?

381
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,960
The University board doesn’t allow more club members than we agreed on.

382
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,980
This Friday, newbies have to go through a test

383
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,540
Those who fail will be out of this club.

384
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
What chord are you playing exactly?

385
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,420
What chord is it?

386
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,560
I don’t know either.

387
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,120
P’Dim, are you being serious?

388
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
Do we have any other way?

389
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,440
No.

390
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,920
And don’t be too nice to freshmen.

391
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,540
My guitar. Try it.

392
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,300
Where is the guy who comes to practice every day?

393
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,440
He might be finding himself a new club.

394
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,380
I don’t think he will pass the test

395
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,960
The test will be on Friday. Don’t forget to practice

396
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,600
Tine, you’re still here.

397
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,760
Yeah. I don’t have a guitar of my own.

398
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,200
So I think I will play on a bit more.

399
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,860
You guys can go.

400
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,520
I like your determination.

401
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,500
But what you play is still wrong

402
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,440
Thank you for your advice

403
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,140
Enjoy your snacks. From Team Sarawat’s Wives.

404
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,840
I am not stealing.

405
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,580
I am just protecting your snacks from anyone who wants to steal them

406
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
Wrong!

407
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,880
Wrong!

408
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,800
Can your fingers work properly?

409
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,420
Press harder

410
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,760
Wrong!

411
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
I can’t press any harder

412
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,240
Here.

413
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,340
What?

414
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,620
My guitar.

415
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,020
Its strings are better

416
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,040
Try it.

417
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,000
It’s okay.

418
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,900
Just take it.

419
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,420
Now play it.

420
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,480
It’s right this time.

421
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,380
Does it hurt your fingers?

422
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,960
No.

423
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,340
That’s good.

424
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,240
Keep practicing.

425
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,280
Now try chord E.

426
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,180
How do you do chord E?

427
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,480
Move over.

428
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Your middle finger on the second fret, fifth string

429
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,400
Your ring finger on the second fret, fourth string.

430
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,600
Your point finger on the first fret, third string.

431
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,400
Now play it.

432
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,860
Memorize it so I don’t have to teach you again.

433
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,860
Play on.

434
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
What are you looking at?

435
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:24,100
I'm just wondering why you aren't in the Faculty of Music since you're so good.

436
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,640
I play because I enjoy it

437
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,900
I’m afraid that if I actually learn it,

438
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,020
it won’t give me pleasure anymore.

439
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:40,660
I do what I like by heart, not by duty

440
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,480
What are you still looking at?

441
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,500
I’m begging you.

442
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,780
Please help me.

443
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,920
Just pretend that you like me.

444
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,300
So you’re in this club because of this?

445
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,680
It’s not like that.

446
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,700
It’s…

447
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,640
It’s…

448
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,460
Yes! I admit it.

449
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,540
Now that you know it, please help to be my fake boyfriend

450
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,840
Are you saying yes or no?

451
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,120
[Faculty Building]

452
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,920
Sarawat is here.

453
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,640
Record a video.

454
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,020
Let’s take a selfie.

455
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,320
Sarawat…

456
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,380
Have you seen a guy who comes to practice here every day?

457
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,740
I haven’t seen him

458
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,580
He might be finding himself a new club.

459
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,740
I don’t think he will pass the test.

460
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,580
P’Dim wants to see you in the storage room but I have no idea why.

461
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,660
Is that you, nuisance?!?

462
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,880
Do you think I will give up that easily?

463
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,080
If you want to get out, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

464
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,860
Deal with your own problem.

465
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,040
Let me out.

466
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,140
Up to you then.

467
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,260
Sleep tight in there tonight.

468
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,620
Are you threatening me?

469
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,500
Do you want to get hurt?

470
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,780
Do you think I’m afraid?

471
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,680
Tine!!

472
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,940
Are you in here? I think I just saw you.

473
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:28,260
You won’t get out of Music Club because you’re afraid of your seniors. Am I right?

474
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,120
Don’t be. I have friends from Bodybuilder Club just to help you.

475
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,700
Let me deal with the seniors for you

476
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,840
Open, please

477
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,080
Tine.

478
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:45,320
You don’t want to be in that club.

479
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,800
Just resign and join Cooking Club with me.

480
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,460
I know that someone is in there

481
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,160
If you don’t open the door, I will.

482
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,180
What are you doing here so loud?

483
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,040
I was sleeping in there?

484
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,220
Who are you here for?

485
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,820
In there?

486
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,080
Yeah, why?

487
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,920
I’m looking for Tine. Have you seen him?

488
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
Tine?

489
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,580
No.

490
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,980
Really?

491
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,380
I’m going to continue my sleep.

492
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,660
Anything else?

493
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,040
Nope.

494
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,500
Sleeping in a cupboard?

495
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,420
Sorry for bothering.

496
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,580
Bye bye.

497
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,820
Tine!

498
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,300
Tine!

499
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,580
Come out, nuisance

500
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,580
That was close.

501
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,240
Thank you so much.

502
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,760
I didn’t want to help you.

503
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,780
I just didn’t want to get involved in your business.

504
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,740
It’s a good idea to change the club.

505
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,600
You won’t pass a test for Music Club.

506
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,660
What if I pass?

507
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,800
If I pass, you have to be my fake boyfriend.

508
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,200
Deal?

509
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,640
If you do, I’ll help you.

510
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,160
But if you fail, you have to leave me alone

511
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,640
Deal.

512
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,960
The result is out.

513
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,160
We don’t pass.

514
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,620
You told him you would stop bothering him if you failed?

515
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,760
Yes.

516
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,880
I didn’t have time to think

517
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,860
Who would think he’d challenge me back like that?

518
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,680
Can I call him and cancel the deal?

519
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,840
It’s too late now.

520
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,400
The test is tomorrow.

521
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,660
You don’t have a guitar, don’t you?

522
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,660
I don’t.

523
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,840
Are you buying me a guitar?

524
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,880
I am.

525
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,220
A guitar practicing app.

526
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,120
I just downloaded it for you

527
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,100
You are so stingy when it comes to friends.

528
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,340
You can buy this but can’t buy me a guitar

529
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
Come on.

530
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,720
We don’t have a guitar for you but we promise to stay with you all night

531
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,740
We won’t yawn

532
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,840
Won’t lie down.

533
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Won’t sleep.

534
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,000
You guys can go back to your rooms actually

535
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,440
You all are distracting me

536
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,340
I’m cold.

537
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I’m cold.

538
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,560
That’s enough.

539
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,160
Get out.

540
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,960
Next.

541
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,340
The bottom

542
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:03,039
Down there.

543
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,900
You need some help?

544
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,100
Shit!

545
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,560
30 years since this club was founded,

546
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,360
you’re the only one who dares to do this

547
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,400
I…

548
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Get out!

549
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,040
Next!

550
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,060
Wait!

551
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,160
I am sorry

552
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,260
I really want to be in this club

553
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,660
Can I have one more chance? Let me play again.

554
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,980
Please.

555
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,240
P’Dim…

556
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,620
Tine practiced very hard.

557
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,840
He kept playing with that old guitar with hard strings

558
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,380
That’s right.

559
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,780
I think we should give him one more shot

560
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,320
Wat, bring out your guitar for him to play.

561
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,000
He did it within a week.

562
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,880
Do you know anything else apart from the basic chords?

563
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,660
I don’t.

564
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,280
Do you like acoustic, classical, or electric guitar?

565
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,040
How are they different?

566
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,480
Do you know any other musical instruments?

567
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,540
I don’t

568
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,840
Do you anything at all?

569
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,160
It’s fine.

570
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,700
If we fail, we will go find some other club together.

571
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,860
I am so excited.

572
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,260
When will the result come out?

573
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,600
The result is out, guys

574
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,740
It’s here!

575
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,400
We don’t pass!

576
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,780
Move!

577
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,880
I pass the test.

578
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,460
Don’t forget your word

579
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:20,060
They let you pass because they felt pity for you.

580
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,940
Are you breaking the promise?

581
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,200
By the way, these snacks are from your fans.

582
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,740
Hey! I got one too.

583
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,300
From Prim?

584
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,500
Who is Prim?

585
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,460
Is she that cute little girl?

586
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,880
You have a lot there. Why are you taking mine?

587
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
What?

588
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,260
What are you doing?

589
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,920
Okay.

590
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,980
Okay what?

591
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:21,060
OKAY!

592
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,360
What the heck are you saying ok to?

593
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,940
Okay. I will be your fake boyfriend.

594
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,680
He is taken

595
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,360
Hey! So you will help me?

596
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
Do you know any other musical instruments?

597
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,960
I don’t

598
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
Damn!

599
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,020
Do you know anything at all?

600
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,200
I know Sarawat

601
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,960
He is the reason I want to play guitar.

Directed by Weerachit Thongjila

603
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,980
You came to see Sarawat again.

604
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,600
Why are guys always together these days?

605
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,020
I heard the rumor saying Sarawat likes Tine. Is it true?

606
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:51,940
True.

607
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,640
You can compete for anything with anyone

608
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,680
but you can’t beat Sarawat when it comes to love

609
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,080
You agreed to help me because you wanted some experience to write a song?

610
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,680
I have a guitar with very soft strings in my room

611
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,160
Can I borrow yours to record a video?

612
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,520
You can with on condition.

613
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,340
Go get it at my place.
