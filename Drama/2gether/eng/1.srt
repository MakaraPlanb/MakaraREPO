1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,240
Have you ever wondered why many things are in pairs?

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,680
Like friends or…

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,940
lovers.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,520
Especially when you find the right one to pair with,

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,940
you will do whatever it takes to be with that person

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,700
Of all my chic life, I have paired up with many girls

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,860
Of all my chic life, I have paired up with many girls

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:38,200
Ging, let’s go see a movie when you’re done.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,840
I have an extra Math class after this.

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,100
Tomorrow then?

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,860
Tomorrow then?

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,960
I have Biology tomorrow

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,720
Day after tomorrow?

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,000
Physics, Chemistry, Social Studies, Science, English, and then Math again.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,100
Say lychee!

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,400
I look fat. Let’s do it again

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,140
Cherry!

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,140
Cherry.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,340
Are you done? Let’s eat.

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,400
Wait!

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,360
Let’s take another selfie.

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,540
Selfie?

23
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,340
Strawberry!

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Should we call for a check? I lost appetite!

25
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you want to eat, babe?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,340
What do you want, Noomnim?

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,140
Anything.

28
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,220
Ice-cream?

29
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,900
It makes you fat.

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,920
A honey toast?

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,820
Too sweet.

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,280
A pudding? Bingsoo? Choux cream?

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,760
Yuck! Too boring.

34
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,980
What do you want then, Noomnim?

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,340
Anything.

36
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,080
Are you mad at me, Namwan?

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,120
NO!

38
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,040
That was a big fat no.

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Whatever I did wrong, I am sorry.

40
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,880
Why are you apologizing? I am not mad!

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,480
I AM NOT MAD!

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
Then why…

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,580
No one has ever been the right one for me,

44
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,820
so I came to find the one in this University.

45
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,240
I never thought that this time, the right one would be so different

46
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,000
[Tine: The cheerleader audition has passed but the right one for me hasn’t passed by.]

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,700
[Two weeks earlier]

48
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,660
We intended to make it fit you perfectly.

49
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,080
It does, P’Fang

50
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,220
That’s great.

51
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
I just knew that we share the same student code

52
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Right.

53
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,040
Why do you want to be a cheerleader?

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,120
I want to have a new experience… and make new friends

55
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,740
That’s so great.

56
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,180
By the way,

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,300
someone left this for you.

58
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,360
We haven’t performed yet and you’re hot already.

59
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,660
Hey! I don’t care about this thing

60
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,920
I only focus on studying and University activities

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,700
That’s perfect.

62
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,080
We’re going to have a meal with other share-coded students next week

63
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,860
See you then

64
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,700
I’m going to open now

65
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,660
[Tine, I’ve been looking at you since The Freshmen Orientation. I have something to tell you.
Meet me at the football field.]

66
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
You can say what you want

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
I don’t have much time.

68
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,440
Are you talking to me?

69
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,640
Of course. Aren’t you the one who wrote this to me?

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,820
Are you insane? Do you think you’re Nadech?

71
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,380
Pervert!

72
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,980
I wrote that.

73
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,660
My name is Green

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,580
I’m a freshman from the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences

75
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,420
Thanks.

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,540
Tine Teepakorn, a freshman from Faculty of Law, I like you!

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,660
What?

78
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,480
You finally found the right one.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,660
You want to die young, Fong?

80
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Do you hate tootsies?

81
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,740
Of course not!

82
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,320
I had lots of tootsie and gay friends back in high school

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,420
But it doesn’t mean I can date them.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,200
Then tell him.

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,180
I already did.

86
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,820
I told him many times that I like girls.

87
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,540
But look, he said he would make me change my mind eventually

88
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,660
Damn! He’s no joke.

89
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,900
Who’s with me on Team Green?

90
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,040
Me.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,800
You asshole Phuak, your friend is worried over here

92
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,720
Don’t worry

93
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Pay no attention to him

94
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,200
he will back off one day. Trust me.

95
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,420
Really?

96
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,520
Tine!! I’m here to pick you up. Get on.

97
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,620
Quickly.

98
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,600
I am ready

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,180
Tine!! Tine, wait for me!

100
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
Guess who I just met this morning?

101
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,440
Who?

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,540
Green?

103
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,880
Exactly! He came to pick me up at my dorm. Lucky me I was able to sneak away

104
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,800
Wait! How did you know?

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,320
Because I see a guy coming towards you right there.

106
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,560
It’s Blue Hawaii, your favorite.

107
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,440
Take it. Drink up.

108
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,580
I am not pretty but I am yummy

109
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,300
Thank you.

110
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,280
Love you, Tine.

111
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,900
Do you need anything else?

112
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,000
You can have my heart too if you want.

113
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,140
Shit!

114
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,340
I guess he will poop for me if he can

115
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,220
I told you that he is no joke.

116
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:26,420
You told me that if I didn’t give him my attention, he would give up.

117
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,660
And look!

118
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,860
You guys have to help me find a way to get rid of Green.

119
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,000
I know it!

120
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,799
If you play it soft and he doesn’t go away, you need to…

121
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,320
Play hardball.

122
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,020
Hardball?

123
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,540
Hardball…

124
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,060
Is it like football?

125
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,040
My favorite.

126
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,340
Can you guys be serious here?

127
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
It’s like baseball. I love it very much

128
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,140
Tine, I’m so glad that you asked me out on a walk

129
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,780
But here?

130
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,640
Why?

131
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,980
It’s pretty out here.

132
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,680
This is a perfect time.

133
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
So beautiful.

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
I don’t think it’s pretty at all

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,980
Let’s go somewhere else. Let’s go.

136
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,160
Hold on!

137
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,040
Look Green, it’s beautiful.

138
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,300
So beautiful.

139
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,220
Do you guys hear people talking over here?

140
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,900
You guys are annoying!

141
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,840
What are you doing in my territory this late?

142
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,560
I really hate it when people are in love

143
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,040
If you don’t want to end up in a hospital

144
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
break up now and never get back together again

145
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,740
Green, let’s do what they say so we don’t get hurt

146
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,920
It’s just a breakup.

147
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,320
That’s right. Quickly!

148
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,020
Tine, you wait for me here. Let me deal with them.

149
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,920
He thinks he’s so good.

150
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,460
Shit!

151
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,440
Are you Green or John Wick?

152
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,240
I have taken a few boxing classes.

153
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,500
Not just a few.

154
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,080
Are you okay,

155
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Tine? Are you hurt?

156
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,040
Damn these mosquitoes!

157
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,380
I’ll walk you to your dorm in case those guys come back.

158
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,380
It’s dangerous. I will protect you

159
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,500
You’re not hurt, aren’t you?

160
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
You are so fragile. Let me take care of you.

161
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,380
We’re here.

162
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,580
Are you sure you don’t want me to stay with you tonight?

163
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,460
I am. I’m fine.

164
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,820
You can go.

165
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,060
Please. Go.

166
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,240
Fine.

167
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,620
But if you need anything, I stand by to take your call 24/7.

168
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,760
I will check in a hotel around here just in case

169
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,520
Call me.

170
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,020
Take care.

171
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
Bye bye

172
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,760
Tine, my beloved friend, how are you?

173
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,240
Not good, my beloved friend Phuak.

174
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,140
All of my friends just left me alone with him.

175
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,600
How could we stay on? He almost broke my arms to pieces.

176
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,220
I think we’re screwed. We need help

177
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,500
Help?

178
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,520
Do we need a boxer or a bodybuilder?

179
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,780
It’s not what we meant

180
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,860
We need someone to be your fake girlfriend.

181
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,260
My girlfriend?

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,400
Green is shadowing you because you still don’t have anyone.

183
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,380
Find someone to be your fake date. Green will be out of your hair soon.

184
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
Good idea.

185
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,340
Who can it be?

186
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,280
Hot girls from our Faculty are not available.

187
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,240
What about that girl from your dorm, the one who asked for your Line ID?

188
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,180
She is single but not hot.

189
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,340
I don’t want to ruin a chic guy’s reputation

190
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,020
You take a fake girlfriend too seriously.

191
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,980
Just find a hot girl who is willing to help you. That’s it.

192
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:38,600
I know a pretty girl who might be single but…

193
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,740
But you dumped me.

194
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,260
We’re not back together for real. Just pretend to be my girlfriend to fool someone

195
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,440
Please. We are in the same University.

196
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,460
Can you help?

197
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,040
What will I get if I do?

198
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,380
What do you want?

199
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,620
A…

200
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,840
Anything?

201
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,480
Armani, Gucci, Prada.

202
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,260
A bag from any brand I just said.

203
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,180
I see. It’s not ‘anything’ anymore

204
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
Fine.

205
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
I’ll rent one for you.

206
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
Buy one.

207
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Buy?

208
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,940
Deal!

209
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,000
I will help you then but don’t let my boyfriend know.

210
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,120
That’s easy.

211
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,600
See you at The Freshy Night on Friday.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,120
Someone is going to be heartbroken.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Tine.

214
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,420
Did you wait for long?

215
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,860
Did you feel lonely over here?

216
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,400
Not that long and I wasn’t lonely because I wasn’t here alone.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,240
What do you mean?

218
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,060
This is Noomnim, my girlfriend.

219
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,920
Now you know why we can’t be together.

220
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Please give up on me

221
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Sure.

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Tine, don’t you think it was too harsh?

223
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,120
I am sorry I did that.

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,300
I just don’t want you to waste any more time on me.

225
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,700
So you pretend to date someone else’s girlfriend just to fool me?

226
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,180
Right. Hey!!

227
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,940
How did you know that?

228
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,300
Noomnim is my friend’s girlfriend.

229
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,820
I see them at my Faculty every day.

230
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,900
What a small world!

231
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,920
If you already knew, why did you cry then?

232
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,540
I was sad because you fooled me to make me give up.

233
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,500
But then you came to comfort me. I get it now.

234
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,080
Get what?

235
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,800
You just wanted to test if I really like you or not, am I right?

236
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,600
You’re not.

237
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,740
You’re so not right.

238
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,680
Of course I am.

239
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
Don’t be shy

240
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,040
Yes! I like you even more now.

241
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,460
Let’s go inside

242
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,640
Let’s go. Bye bye Noomnim. See you in class.

243
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,860
Tine come on.

244
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,960
There’s lots of food.

245
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,520
Throw the ball.

246
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,840
You suck.

247
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
That was close!

248
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,280
This one will kill. I’m sure. Oops!

249
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,720
What if this plan fails?

250
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,420
I have plan B.

251
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Here.

252
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,560
Right here!

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
This will put him to sleep

254
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,880
Find the right time to put it in his drink and get out of there

255
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,740
We will take care of the rest.

256
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,900
Seriously?

257
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,640
Yes.

258
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,780
Can I get three more balls and play on?

259
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,160
I don’t want to start over.

260
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,180
Green, are you thirsty?

261
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,380
I will go get you some drink.

262
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,240
Thirsty?

263
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,140
Is he alright?

264
00:17:08,464 --> 00:17:10,719
Energetic Pandan.

265
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,020
I don’t think so.

266
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,980
The Muse of Roselle.

267
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,580
Super Power Chrysanthemum.

268
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
Elephant Power Black Tea.

269
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,280
Two cups, please.

270
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,780
How much?

271
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,880
20 Baht

272
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,660
The right cup. Right cup.

273
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,040
What are you doing?

274
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,400
What takes you so long?

275
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,140
I’m getting you a drink.

276
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,060
What drink?

277
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,920
It’s called Elephant Power Black Tea.

278
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,320
It’s strong.

279
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,960
It’s so good

280
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,980
Left or right?

281
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,840
It’s all the same.

282
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,040
Come on. The next band will be up soon.

283
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,160
I shouldn’t have stayed up watching a series last night.

284
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Wait a minute.

285
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,820
You yawned because you stayed up late watching a series?

286
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,520
Yes. It took me until this morning to finish it.

287
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,280
So this cup…

288
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,440
Tine!

289
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,860
Tine!

290
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,040
Are you sick?

291
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,560
Do you want me to take you back to your dorm?

292
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,720
It's okay

293
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,040
Please welcome Sssss..! on stage.

294
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,160
Hi guys. We are Sssss..!

295
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,360
Although I’m half-awake

296
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,940
I realize at once that this is my favorite song.

297
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,260
It called…

298
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,400
“Together”

299
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,800
No one fits for this duty more than this guy.

300
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,560
What do you want?

301
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,280
Shit!

302
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,200
My eyes hurt.

303
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I am sorry

304
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,000
We rescued you last night.

305
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,440
If it wasn’t for that guitarist who distracted Green

306
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,700
you might be waking up in his room by now

307
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,320
A fake girlfriend didn’t work

308
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,980
The plan didn’t shake Green for a bit.

309
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,780
He even said he would change me and make me fall for him one day.

310
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,280
Date a guy then.

311
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,760
Are you out of your mind?

312
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,520
No. I mean find a guy to be your fake boyfriend

313
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,580
so Green will give up.

314
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,460
At this moment, no one fits for this duty more than this guy.

315
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,520
Introduce yourself!

316
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,940
Introduce yourself!

317
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,740
Introduce yourself!

318
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Introduce yourself!

319
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,820
I am only here as a substitution

320
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,880
Can I please not introduce myself?

321
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,580
Everyone is talking about him on social media.

322
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,700
He got thousands of messages from many girls.

323
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,500
This is the type of guy that can make Green back off.

324
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,380
How can we ask for his help?

325
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,340
We don’t know his name or his Faculty.

326
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,760
Who are you talking to? I am Ohm,

327
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,260
the god of social media.

328
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,120
I can find you that information

329
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,480
It’s up to you. Do you want to do it?

330
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,660
Do I have a choice?

331
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,040
From what we know,

332
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,620
our target is a real introvert

333
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,180
He doesn’t have Line, Facebook, or Instagram account.

334
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,540
That’s Line. That’s IG.

335
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,780
I can do it.

336
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,380
I’ve been refreshing the Cute Boy Page for hours

337
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,780
I still don’t have any info on him.

338
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,880
The Cute Boy Page won’t do you any good.

339
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,340
The right page is called Dilitious Boy.

340
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,420
Delicious!

341
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,560
Whatever!

342
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,460
Look what I found here.

343
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,500
See?

344
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,380
Sarawat from Faculty of Political Science, IR major.

345
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,900
What a weird name!

346
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,360
We know where he is. Let’s go.

347
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
Calm down.

348
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,780
You don’t even know what he’s like.

349
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,740
How are you going to talk to him?

350
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,220
You’re right.

351
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,220
[Sarawat]

352
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,800
Someone posted a video of Sarawat.

353
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,500
Sarawat, you bought snacks for you.

354
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,420
I don’t like snacks

355
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,120
What do you like then?

356
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,200
I don’t.

357
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,760
You don’t like anything at all? Or…

358
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,440
I don't like it when people buy me snacks.

359
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,940
That’s okay. I will take it.

360
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,600
How hot does he think he is?

361
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,180
I’m hotter but I don’t do that.

362
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,420
Let me see. Where is your hotness?

363
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,640
Why don’t I see it?

364
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
Right here.

365
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,300
There’s more.

366
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
Another video.

367
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,240
Hi. Can we get a picture…?

368
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,880
Just do it.

369
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,600
1 2. Here.

370
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,540
This guy is not only antisocial,

371
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,280
but he is also a jerk.

372
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,280
This is the best one

373
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,620
Someone found his schedule.

374
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,940
He’s about to get out of class.

375
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,700
What now, Tine?

376
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,760
Should we go now?

377
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,800
Definitely! What are you waiting for?

378
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,980
Seems like it’s not just me who wants to see Sarawat.

379
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,060
Look on the bright side, this means our source is reliable.

380
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,980
Reliable my ass!

381
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,060
My spy just told me that the schedule is fake

382
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,000
What?

383
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,020
Sarawat is actually at the University's main building.

384
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,600
Main Building?

385
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,500
Main Building?

386
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,140
That’s it.

387
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,360
That’s how everything started

388
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,900
I am running to find the right one…

389
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,320
and I stop at…

390
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,380
…him.

391
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,900
Sarawat.

392
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,340
Sarawat.

393
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,580
Saraleo! (asshole)

394
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,920
I am sorry.

395
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,120
It’s…

396
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,500
What?

397
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,180
It’s…

398
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,120
Say it already. I’m in a rush.

399
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
Can you…?

400
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,560
Keep looking at me like that…

401
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
and I will kiss till you drop

402
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,100
You’re annoying.

403
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,100
Wat, I need to talk to you.

404
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,360
Can you please help…?

405
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,460
What are you doing?

406
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,560
Helping you

407
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,120
You said you needed my help.

408
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,980
Sarawat!

409
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,720
You, asshole! Sarawat!

410
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,420
Stop complaining already

411
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,260
decide if you want to go on or find a new target.

412
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,300
No.

413
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,680
The harder it is, the more Mr.Chic wants.

414
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,860
Do you guys have anything else on him?

415
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,880
I don’t.

416
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,040
He is a very private person

417
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,380
The Cute Boy Page can’t get anything either

418
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,080
No one cares about The Cute Boy Page anymore

419
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
What page should we be looking at?

420
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,340
Do you have any news?

421
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,620
Exactly!

422
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:35,400
His fans crate a secret group chat just to share stories and news about him

423
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,040
The group is called Team Sarawat’s Wives.

424
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,340
Sarawat’s wives?

425
00:27:43,379 --> 00:27:48,020
Speaking of which, they just found you his contact

426
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,580
Let me see. His number or his Line ID?

427
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,760
His email.

428
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,760
Email?

429
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,740
Yep.

430
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,660
Am I back to MSN time?

431
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,300
Just choose whether you email him or wait for him at his Faculty

432
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,400
I don’t know if you will see him that easily

433
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Up to you.

434
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,740
Email it is.

435
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,380
Hi Sarawat

436
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,360
I am Tine,

437
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,280
the one you said you would kiss till I dropped the other day.

438
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,800
I need to ask you a favor

439
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,560
Are you available tomorrow?

440
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,840
Meet me anywhere.

441
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
I don’t mind the place.

442
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
Hey!

443
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,620
Why are you here?

444
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,020
You emailed me.

445
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,480
That’s right but I didn’t think you would come to my room

446
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,160
You said it could be anywhere.

447
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,180
What are you doing?

448
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,480
Helping you.

449
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,780
Do you want it now?

450
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,540
Hold on!

451
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,680
I don’t mean this kind of help.

452
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,660
I mean I want you to…

453
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,460
I can’t believe that someone just emailed me asking for sex.

454
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,900
It can be anywhere, you said? You fu*k yourself, you psycho!

455
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,660
Asshole!

456
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,680
You want it this way, huh?

457
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,940
Let the game begin.

458
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,600
In Team Sarawat’s Wives, they say he drives a white car…

459
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
A white car?

460
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,700
…with some stickers at the rear.

461
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,660
Stickers at the rear?

462
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,160
He likes to park at the back of his Faculty building

463
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,480
I’m gonna hang up now.

464
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,900
I think I found it.

465
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,480
Is this your car?

466
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,620
I am sorry, ma’am.

467
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Sarawat!

468
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,280
Sarawat!

469
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Wat!

470
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,240
Wat!

471
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,640
Slow down!

472
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
Wat!

473
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,520
I need to talk to you.

474
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
Let’s talk.

475
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,520
I don’t talk to strangers.

476
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,060
Stranger my ass!

477
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,280
You said you would kiss me till I dropped the other day.

478
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,220
Please. Can I have five minutes?

479
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
No.

480
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,300
Three minutes then?

481
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,660
No.

482
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,940
Ten seconds?

483
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,680
Nine eight seven …

484
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,600
Wait!

485
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,020
I..

486
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,640
Can you please help…?

487
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Your time is up.

488
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:05,580
Look what he did to me. I followed him like a shadow yet he still didn’t care to talk

489
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,520
Do you think I will stop here?

490
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:11,985
I don’t think so.

491
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,100
I won’t stop and give up now.

492
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,680
If you want it back, give me your number.

493
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,540
Give it back! Hey!

494
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,060
What are you playing?

495
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,240
Shit!

496
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,940
I am sorry.

497
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,020
Tine.

498
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,200
Tine. Are you okay?

499
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,300
Where is this place?

500
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,480
University of course.

501
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,580
Where do you think?

502
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,900
Just kidding.

503
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:03,080
University of course. Where do you think?

504
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,620
If it wasn’t for me, you would be dead already.

505
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,200
Or you want to go to my house?

506
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:11,380
Or you want to go to my house?

507
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,440
I will stay with you tonight to take care of you.

508
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,460
Tine.

509
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,760
Tine.

510
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,080
Tine!

511
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,240
P’Fang.

512
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,620
I’m on my way to a share-coded dinner. You want to come with me?

513
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,680
That’s okay. I’m going to…find…

514
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,940
Tine!

515
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,140
Never mind. Let’s go.

516
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Tine!

517
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,440
Wait up!

518
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,660
Let’s cheer for Ann.

519
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,440
Go girl!

520
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,820
My name is Ann. I am a freshman.

521
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,860
I hate grumpy face. All I do is smile. Do you, seniors, like it?

522
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,780
And the next one…Go girl!

523
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,800
Tine! Wait up!!

524
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,840
Hey! Where are you going?

525
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
It’s your turn to introduce yourself.

526
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,980
I’m going to a restroom

527
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,280
Don’t be shy!

528
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,339
Come on. Get up there. It’s our tradition.

529
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:30,879
Don’t be shy. Up on stage.

530
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,620
It’s our tradition.

531
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,640
Quickly. Ann did it

532
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,540
Let’s cheer for Tine.

533
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,820
Go on

534
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,760
My name is Tine. I am a freshman…

535
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,700
What? That’s all you got?

536
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,340
Show more energy!

537
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,760
Come on.

538
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,300
Don’t keep it to yourself!

539
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
Come on.

540
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,020
My name is Tine.

541
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,140
I am a cute freshman.

542
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,600
My friends call me Mr.Chic

543
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,220
I can be top but bottom is also fine

544
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,420
I like to strike hard. Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!

545
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,640
We want more!

546
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,040
Get down here

547
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
Give him a big hand.

548
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,500
I like the cry.

549
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,920
Cheers to that ‘Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Ahh!’

550
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,120
What were you laughing at?

551
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,260
Do you have a problem with the way I introduce myself?

552
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,540
I don’t.

553
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,240
It’s cute

554
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,180
Damn it!

555
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,300
What the heck are you doing?

556
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,320
Getting your phone number.

557
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,460
Give it back.

558
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,940
Give it here.

559
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,040
If you want it back, then give me your number.

560
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,860
What are you playing at?

561
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,060
Shit!

562
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,200
I am sorry.

563
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,560
I will get it repaired

564
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,340
What are you doing?

565
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,160
Give it back.

566
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,680
What if you disappear on me?

567
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,080
Once you get it fixed, you can have yours back.

568
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,780
Don’t you trust me?

569
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,320
Damn right!

570
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,480
Damn it!

571
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,980
How much will it cost me?

572
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,880
Congratulations!

573
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,380
You finally got his number

574
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,560
I asked for his number but I got a broken phone waiting to get fixed

575
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,920
Is it worth it?

576
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
You’re right.

577
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,180
He must have something on his phone

578
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,160
that I can use to blackmail him to help me.

579
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,180
Wait. Aren’t you afraid that he can get into your phone?

580
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,820
Don’t worry. My phone is locked.

581
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,060
I’m sure he can never unlock it.

582
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,380
What’s wrong with my Facebook?

583
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,940
They might be spams.

584
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,980
[Tine Mr.Chic: He looks so yummy.

585
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,040
I want to eat Sarawat.]

586
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,920
You asshole!

588
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,820
Wait. I have something to say to you.

589
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,900
But I don’t.

590
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,500
I just found you the way.

591
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,580
Get into his club

592
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,160
If you’re in the same club he’s in, you will to see him more often

593
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:56,260
Before you become our club members, you need to go through our special welcoming ceremony.

594
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,840
Do you like Sarawat?

595
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,960
I saw you joined Sarawat’s Wives Group.

596
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
Did Sarawat agree to help you already?

597
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,720
You have to hurry because Green gets you kicked out of that club

598
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,360
Don’t worry. I see him often now.

599
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,560
I will ask him to help me.

600
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,340
What?

601
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,740
My guitar. Its strings won’t hurt you like that one does. Try it.

602
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,720
University Board doesn’t allow more members than we agreed on

603
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,320
Newbies have to go through a test. The ones that fail will be out.

604
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,160
It’s a good idea to change a club.

605
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,960
You won’t pass the test

606
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,420
If I pass, you have to be my fake boyfriend. Deal?

607
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,220
The result is out, guys.
