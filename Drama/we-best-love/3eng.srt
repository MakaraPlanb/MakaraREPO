=No. 1 For You=

13
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,453
Do you want to die?

14
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:57,124
You have gastropathy.

15
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,693
Why did you have spicy hotpot?

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,561
What's wrong with you?

17
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,098
College kids today are hard to understand.

18
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:07,235
You, too.

19
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:10,004
Make that for him every day

20
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,305
if you want him dead.

21
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,041
Won't do that again.

22
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,010
I had it.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,877
Why are you yelling at him?

24
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,380
It's none of his business.

25
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,555
In the US, the owner of a bar

26
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,323
can be fined for not stopping a customer

27
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,059
from drunk driving.

28
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,962
He cooked it for you.

29
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,264
I can absolutely yell at him.

30
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,873
Zhou Shu Yi.

31
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:49,176
This stomach medicine
can ease your pain for a while.

32
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,344
But you still need to go to the doctor.

33
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,923
You can eat light and oil-free food only.

34
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,226
But if you want to die,

35
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,462
have more spicy hotpots.

36
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:12,133
How can a school doctor

37
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,302
threat his patient?

38
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,186
(School doctor)
(Pei Shou Yi)

39
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,942
Are you sure this dummy is the one?

40
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,649
You...

41
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:29,650
Have some rest.

42
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,162
Alright.

43
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,663
I'll go and get a pack of cigarettes.

44
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,899
You get some rest, kid.

45
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,338
What's wrong with them?

46
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,772
They look close.

47
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,409
Are they...

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,214
Ouch!

49
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,019
Ouch!

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,325
Why did you say that in front of him?

51
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:14,495
Just for fun.

52
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:17,164
Someone with affective disorder
can have fun too?

53
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,169
Yeah, fun to watch.

54
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,275
So that's my future cousin-in-law?

55
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:29,844
Good-looking.

56
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:31,812
Isn't it good?

57
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:33,714
Nothing else but the look.

58
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,649
But you don't know him well.

59
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,952
I really can't tell.

60
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:39,820
Maybe...

61
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,022
I need to know more about him.

62
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,824
Don't bother.

63
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,627
There's no way that he likes me.

64
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:52,500
And you still like him?

65
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,503
He makes me

66
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,304
who I am today.

67
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,374
I met him at Grade 5.

68
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,878
My parents got divorced

69
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:06,147
that time.

70
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,949
I was really sad.

71
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,752
How could a little kid

72
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,787
possibly accept the fact that his father

73
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:14,955
abandoned the family?

74
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,592
But I knew that

75
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,194
my mom felt worse than me.

76
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,164
So I pretended to be strong.

77
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,234
But sometimes, I just couldn't help it.

78
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,610
Hey.

79
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,045
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,880
Are you hurt?

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,981
Are you all right?

82
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:49,690
Hey.

83
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,593
Look at your snot and tears.

84
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,727
So ugly.

85
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,164
None of your business.

86
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,004
My dad...

87
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,408
abandoned me and my mom.

88
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,480
You've still got a mom.

89
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:16,750
My mom has gone to heaven.

90
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:26,627
Or...

91
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,562
I'll give you my dad.

92
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,298
He always causes trouble.

93
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,302
Nobody gives their dad away like that.

94
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,046
How about this?

95
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:49,149
I'll give myself to you.

96
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,051
Let me know if you need anything.

97
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,520
Think of me as your father.

98
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,425
Good boy. That's a good smile.

99
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,427
Don't waste your time crying.

100
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:03,531
Work hard and be strong!

101
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,065
Shu Yi.

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,668
Where are you?

103
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,013
Come to me if you want to cry.
I'll be there for you.

104
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,248
My name is Zhou Shu Yi.

105
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,183
I'm in Class 1 Grade 5 of
San Qiao Elementary School.

106
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,752
Bye.

107
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,588
Although it turned out

108
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:31,158
that he was probably just passing by and
came to me out of curiosity.

109
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,260
After I transferred to his school,

110
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,095
he couldn't even recognize me.

111
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,700
But he saved me that afternoon.

112
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,269
You don't understand

113
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,939
what his hug and shoulders

114
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,007
meant to me

115
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,509
back then.

116
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,277
I'm going to the class.

117
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,082
I thought you'd skip class

118
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:30,517
and let him know what you've done for him

119
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,153
so that you can...

120
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,089
make him fall for you.

121
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,797
I just want to be his friend before graduation.

122
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,002
Keep on with the unrequited love.

123
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,340
Good, bro. You're a masochist.

124
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,444
Fine.

125
00:07:57,444 --> 00:08:00,114
Anyway, you're going to America
with your mom after graduation.

126
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,982
It's better this way.

127
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:05,619
He wasn't lovelorn,

128
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,122
I wouldn't have a chance to be his friend.

129
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,493
So you want to help him go through it

130
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:13,827
to return the favor?

131
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,698
Are you a white crane?

132
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:19,667
If you're so full of love,

133
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,301
spread it.

134
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,937
Don't you talk about me.

135
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,739
This cup is broken and you...

136
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,013
Careful with your mouth.

137
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,852
I'll leave him to you.

138
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,257
All right, that's all for today.

139
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:20,728
Let's go.

140
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,362
I'm busy.

141
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,632
Shu Yi.

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,935
Are you free?

143
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:29,169
Why?

144
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,139
We haven't had dinner together for a long time.

145
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:33,974
I'm kind of busy.

146
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,483
I was going to ask you...

147
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,887
You...

148
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,722
Do you also like Yu Xin?

149
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:54,294
Don't you say you'd give up because of me.

150
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:56,330
If you like her and she likes you,

151
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,464
then it's good enough.

152
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,333
But...

153
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,469
last time you saw us...

154
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,139
Are you OK with it?

155
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,077
If I'm not OK with it,

156
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,745
will you give Yu Xin to me?

157
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,054
I don't want to lose a friend.

158
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,924
But I like Yu Xin a lot.

159
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:25,793
I can't do this.

160
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,695
That's it.

161
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,497
Protect your girlfriend and be tough.

162
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:32,132
Never give her to anyone else.

163
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,868
So...

164
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:36,904
you don't like Yu Xin?

165
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,375
I like...

166
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,144
both of you!

167
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,449
Come on. I was so worried.

168
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,251
Take good care of her,

169
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:52,820
or I'll beat you up.

170
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,689
All right, all right!

171
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,457
Fang Zheng Wen.

172
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,894
You like her
but she expressed her feelings first.

173
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,462
Is that what a man should do?

174
00:11:04,464 --> 00:11:06,400
Because I was worried about you.

175
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,703
It's good that the one you love happens to

176
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:11,004
love you back.

177
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,372
I'm so jealous!

178
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,507
All right.

179
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,741
You need to treat me to dinner.

180
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,709
Piece of cake.

181
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:16,510
-Let's go.
-Go.

182
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:18,779
What would you like to eat?

183
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,384
Gao Shi De.

184
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,419
Gao Shi De.

185
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,024
How's your stomach?

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,795
Zheng Wen talked to me.

187
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,263
About what?

188
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,532
He asked me if I liked Yu Xin.

189
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,500
I said ,"If I did,

190
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,169
would you give her to me?"

191
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,136
Seriously?

192
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,372
He didn't even hesitate

193
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:46,940
before refusing me.

194
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,311
He's always been gentle.

195
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,847
I didn't expect him to be so tough.

196
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,418
I feel so happy.

197
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,322
I hope he treats Yu Xin well,

198
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:04,658
or I'll hit him hard.

199
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,962
You're right.

200
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,699
Time can heal everything.

201
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:14,801
Great!

202
00:12:15,369 --> 00:12:15,969
Congratulations.

203
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:16,603
All right.

204
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,338
That's it, got it?

205
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:23,377
Hey, here are the top two swimmers
of the swimming club.

206
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,515
Do you want to come to

207
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,084
the ghost night held by the juniors.

208
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,454
It's like a farewell party.

209
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,089
In a dark and scary night,

210
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:41,228
the campus horror is waiting for you!

211
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,797
And

212
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:44,464
if you come,

213
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,832
I'm sure the juniors

214
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:47,968
will be super happy, right?

215
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,003
Yes!

216
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,738
I'm not going.

217
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:55,042
Come on, man.

218
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,343
You've been hanging out with him

219
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,844
and ignored us.

220
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,413
Tell you what.

221
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:02,683
We've arranged some stage games.

222
00:13:02,683 --> 00:13:05,352
You'll get a nice present if you win.

223
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:06,153
And

224
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,889
it'll be much harder this time.

225
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,291
No phones allowed!

226
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,160
Show us how smart

227
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,728
and brave you are!

228
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,464
Come on!

229
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,467
Let's create some good memories
before graduation!

230
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,935
Alright, everyone?

231
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,637
Yeah!

232
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,141
-Competition?
-Memories before graduation.

233
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,246
One more would be nice.

234
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,048
I'll be free if I win.

235
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,224
Did you hear that?

236
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,692
Did you hear the footsteps?

237
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:46,426
Huh?

238
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,227
Footsteps?

239
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,895
There it is.

240
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,364
So terrible!

241
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:52,799
I told you guys.

242
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,067
I didn't lie to you.

243
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,337
This is the third one who came out crying.

244
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,539
I assume all of you a talisman, right?

245
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,807
I'm not kidding.

246
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,809
This school used to be a mass grave.

247
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,177
You should take it seriously.

248
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,912
Let's welcome our next challenger,

249
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,180
Zheng Wen.

250
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,181
Come on.

251
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,282
Please.

252
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,884
Please leave your phone here? Thank you.

253
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:15,355
Don't be afraid, senior.

254
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,089
I trust you.

255
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:16,990
Let me go first.

256
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,592
I'm in a hurry.

257
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,428
And it's not scary at all.

258
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,363
Alright, we've got

259
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,464
a tough challenger.

260
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,800
I hope he won't come out crying.

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,634
Sorry, senior.

262
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,637
Please wait for another 15 minutes.

263
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,874
Let's stop here.

264
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,609
So horrible.

265
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:37,177
It's scary.

266
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,178
Don't worry.

267
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,379
I'll protect you.

268
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,747
I won't leave you alone.

269
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:42,115
Don't worry.

270
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,504
Sorry.

271
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:15,982
They've made it too scary.

272
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,954
Liu Bing Wei, you can do this!

273
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,124
Zhou Shu Yi.

274
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,093
I'm coming to your rescue!

275
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,005
What are you doing here?

276
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,773
Did I scare you?

277
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,744
So cute.

278
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:20,347
The juniors asked me to join them.

279
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,582
I wanted to give you
more nice memories about the university.

280
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,185
Look. I even dressed like a ghost.

281
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,753
You're here on your own?

282
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:28,655
Well...

283
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:32,459
I'll stay with you.

284
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,898
You scared me!

285
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:39,900
What are you doing back there?

286
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,967
You got in the way.

287
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,269
Oh.

288
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,272
Go and win the games.

289
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,413
I thought you had already let go of it.

290
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,185
I'm just glad that they're happy together.

291
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:00,787
You'd better concentrate.

292
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,355
I'm gonna beat you this time.

293
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,300
(Oh, my!)

294
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,469
(When does the school get so scary?)

295
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,205
(The flashlight is out of battery.)

296
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,542
(Is Gao Shi De still here?)

297
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,979
Why are you still here?

298
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:26,913
Go ahead!

299
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,860
I...

300
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,129
I'm afraid of ghosts.

301
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,832
Seriously?

302
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,467
You're afraid of ghosts?

303
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:50,904
Well then,

304
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,672
let's stop competing with each other.

305
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,674
I won't feel the sense of achievement even if I win.

306
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,509
Let's just go together.

307
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,615
Why are you standing still?

308
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:05,752
Will I slow you down?

309
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,058
Don't worry.

310
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,960
I got your back.

311
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,370
Come on.

312
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,040
Don't be mincing.

313
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,974
Just follow me.

314
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,089
You go first.

315
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,924
It's more scary in the back.

316
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:46,626
Ready.

317
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,362
Where is Shi De?

318
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,466
Did you hear what I just said?

319
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,035
Come on, come on!

320
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,604
I'm begging you, come on.

321
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:58,772
Sorry.

322
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:00,840
I hit you too hard.

323
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:06,746
What?

324
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,715
Did you see Shi De?

325
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,217
Did you see Zhou Shu Yi?

326
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,355
What are you doing?

327
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,589
Let's go together.

328
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:18,058
Hands off.

329
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,193
Don't follow me!

330
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,428
Stop pulling.

331
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,762
Let me go.

332
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,498
You're insane!

333
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,377
Too dramatic.

334
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,879
Why did they hide the clue in the health center?

335
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,548
Yeah.

336
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:43,850
So dramatic.

337
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,389
What's that noise?

338
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:51,958
It's the wind.

339
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,431
You better start looking for clues.

340
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,799
Let's get out of here

341
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,967
after we get the stamp.

342
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,235
All right.

343
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,270
You scared me.

344
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:05,672
What's the matter?

345
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,707
I'm afraid you're scared.

346
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,642
I'm just telling you that I'm here.

347
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:13,847
Idiot.

348
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,689
Let's just leave it

349
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:23,957
and go to the next one.

350
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,561
No.

351
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,463
If we don't get the stamp here,

352
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,898
we won't get those for later stages.

353
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:34,701
Oh.

354
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,274
Don't be afraid.

355
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,108
Don't be scared.

356
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,744
Gao Shi De, let's get out of here!

357
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,046
You need to calm down.

358
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,704
Well done.

359
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:12,839
Zhou Shu Yi.

360
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,008
Hello!

361
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:16,543
Anybody?

362
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:18,077
Anyone out there?

363
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:19,179
Hello!

364
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,549
We're locked in here!

365
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,050
Hello!

366
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,418
Is there anyone out there?

367
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,219
Hello!

368
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,087
Anybody?

369
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,471
You've yelled for ten minutes.

370
00:21:45,371 --> 00:21:46,172
Have some water.

371
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,479
It's better than doing nothing.

372
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,182
Why does a health center
need iron-grating windows?

373
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59,819
I thought you know this place well.

374
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,821
Do something!

375
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,656
What can I do?

376
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,325
I don't have my phone with me.

377
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:07,994
Perhaps...

378
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,330
the school police will patrol around here.

379
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,167
Or Shou Yi will come and open
the door tomorrow morning.

380
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,609
You're not helping.

381
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:30,049
The phone isn't working.

382
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,321
There's a laptop here.

383
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,024
It should have been connected to Wi-Fi.

384
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:40,460
We can ask Zheng Wen to come and help us.

385
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,964
Password sucks.

386
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:57,644
Hungry?

387
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,852
There's got to be some food here.

388
00:23:20,033 --> 00:23:20,934
Here we go.

389
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,808
Do you have a secret crush on Pei Shou Yi?

390
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,013
That's why you two are so close.

391
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,182
You even know where he puts the instant noodles.

392
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,284
How long has it been?

393
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,120
Are you...

394
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,590
You know my affairs.

395
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,693
We're on the same boat.

396
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:48,027
Relax.

397
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,662
I won't laugh at you.

398
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:51,164
How long has it been?

399
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,869
It's been long.

400
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,039
It's just...

401
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,109
I like you, not him.

402
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,678
Then, I'm relieved.

403
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,417
You...

404
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:12,418
You like me?

405
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,088
No way!

406
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:19,325
Yeah.

407
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:21,327
No way.

408
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:25,999
You've got to be kidding me.

409
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,533
Of course I am.

410
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:32,238
You paired me up with Shou Yi.

411
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,474
Miser.

412
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,277
You like to talk back a lot.

413
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,094
Just another minute.

414
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:20,887
Here.

415
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:22,955
Eat up.

416
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:50,683
What about you?

417
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:55,555
I'm not hungry. Just eat.

418
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,435
Is this the only one left?

419
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,175
You talk too much. Just eat it.

420
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,647
Let's share it.

421
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,786
We don't have to starve together.

422
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,189
At least one of us won't be starved to death.

423
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,792
You don't have to do this.

424
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,161
That's what friends do.

425
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,732
What did you say?

426
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,067
Eat it or leave it.

427
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:46,873
Alright.

428
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,353
Though we are friends,

429
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,355
we still get to compete.

430
00:27:02,355 --> 00:27:03,623
I won't lose to you forever.

431
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,394
And I'm not gonna let you win.

432
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,156
There is no winning or losing between us.

433
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,897
That's what friends do.

434
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:53,439
Maybe...

435
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,875
it's better this way.

436
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:09,121
=Episode 3=
(It's been long)

437
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:27,907
(Next Episode)
You want a girlfriend?

438
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,541
Yeah.

439
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:29,775
Introduce one to me.

440
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,244
Aren't you going to tell him your feelings?

441
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,581
You're not as good as me.

442
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:36,916
Kiddo.

443
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,150
You like Gao Shi De...

444
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,452
He'll be mine.

445
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:42,521
I like you.
