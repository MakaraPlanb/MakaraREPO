13
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,355
(Hey, Zhou Shu Yi.)

14
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:59,160
(Do you know why being in
first place is so important to me?)

15
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,466
(I push myself forward)

16
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:19,480
(so that you can see me.)

17
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,183
(Could you please not push me away?)

18
00:01:28,623 --> 00:01:32,593
(Could you please take me to your heart?)

=Lesson 1=
(Let's suffocate!)

20
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,877
(It's a good thing to have childhood sweethearts)

21
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:53,648
(growing up with you.)

22
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,916
(But sometimes,)

23
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,151
(the three of us can't do everything together.)

24
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,120
(For example,)

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,355
(dating.)

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,323
(My dad used to tell me:)

27
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,858
("If you fail, it's fine;)

28
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,393
(If you succeed, you're a true man.")

29
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,363
(Back then, he went all the way from Japan to Taiwan.)

30
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:12,266
(And with this faith, he won my mom's heart.)

31
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,806
(I swear to my lucky necklace,)

32
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:24,445

of the swimming club for freshmen ,)

33
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:27,215
(I'll accomplish a feat of my life,)

00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,951
(turning this friendship into love.)

35
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,921
(Sorry, Fang Zheng Wen.)

36
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,925
(I'll have a girlfriend earlier than you do.)

(Jiang Yu Xin.)

38
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,728
(Wait for my confession of love.)

before my graduation.)

Come on.

43
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:10,991
OK, switch sides.

44
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,561
How do you feel? Confident?

45
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,261
What about you?

46
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,596
You'll have the rookie.

47
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,833
Top one of our swimming team.

48
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,735
Champion-to-be!

49
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,638
Senior, your swimming cap.

50
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,973
Senior. Your goggles.

51
00:03:27,075 --> 00:03:28,610
Come on, senior!

52
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,576
Thank you.

53
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,678
So handsome!

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,280
You're popular.

55
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,948
Very!

56
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,083
Do you have confidence?

57
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,050
Of course.

58
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,386
I don't even need to bring half of my strength

59
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,088
for this kind of competition.

60
00:03:40,088 --> 00:03:41,488
Don't be too proud.

61
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:43,223
Come on! I'm Zhou Shu Yi.

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:43,858
Alright.

63
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:45,460
Just focus.

64
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,193
Relax.

65
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:48,061
Shi De, in the evening...

66
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,231
Senior Gao Shi De, you are so handsome!

67
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,170
Why are you...

68
00:04:01,743 --> 00:04:03,076
(Why is he here?)

69
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,113
(Does he want to ruin my plan?)

70
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,350
(Cramp!)

71
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10,685
(Shu Yi.)

72
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:12,053
(What a shame!)

73
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,120
(What should I do?)

74
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,728
(Are you OK?)

75
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,230
(Yes.)

76
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,331
(Your feet?)

77
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,500
(I'll get you up.)

78
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,466
(No.)

79
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,668
(Don't be nosy.)

80
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,070
(Go away.)

81
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,143
(Some people say setback)

82
00:04:35,143 --> 00:04:37,045
(is the enemy in life.)

83
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:39,246
(Failure is the stone in life.)

84
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:42,383
(For me,)

85
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,551
(whether it's a stone or an enemy,)

86
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,120
(it means three words:)

87
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,955
(Gao Shi De!)

88
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,460
(From primary school to high school,)

89
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,761
(in all kinds of competitions,)

90
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:54,028
(Second Place)

91
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:55,730
(First Place)
(be it English or writing,)

92
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,898
(First Place)
(Go, debate or sprint,)

93
00:04:58,533 --> 00:04:59,166
(I was always the runner-up)

94
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:00,468
(because of him.)

95
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,385
Shi De.

96
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,355
Seniot Shi De, take it.

97
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:24,158
It's specially bought for you. Please eat it.

98
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,160
You'll love it.

99
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,860
This is for you.

100
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:32,248
[No.1 Gao Shi De]
[No.2 Zhou Shu Yi]

101
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,845
(I don't like the feeling of losing.)

102
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:45,813
(But ever since he came into my life,)

103
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,915
(I've always been)

104
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:53,220
(under him.)

105
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:04,965
Hey.

106
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:05,766
What are you doing?

107
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,968
What happened?

108
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:07,768
Are you OK?

109
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,236
Why did you suddenly fall into the pool?

110
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,605
Why did you suddenly act like this?

111
00:06:11,773 --> 00:06:13,040
Nothing.

112
00:06:13,908 --> 00:06:14,608
Hey.

113
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,711
Shu Yi.

114
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,246
What's his problem?

115
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,883
He didn't even thank you for saving him.

116
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,451
Don't say that.

117
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,121
Not even a thank you.

118
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,291
Thank you for saving Shu Yi.

119
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:33,861
Put it on. Don't catch a cold.

120
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:57,385
It's OK.

121
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,186
Safety first.

122
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:01,155
Don't be sad.

123
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:10,065
Falling into the pool is nothing.

124
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,631
Don't cry.

125
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,933
Look on the bright side.

126
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,401
Now the whole school knows you.

127
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,403
You're popular.

128
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:16,838
I'm not crying!

129
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,305
Damn it.

130
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,308
Embarrassed me in front of so many people.

131
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,811
You fell into the pool yourself.

132
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,313
Damn Gao Shi De!

133
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,115
It's his fault.

134
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,418
Why didn't you tell me he would come?

135
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,023
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,258
I thought the new member

137
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,261
just had the same name as his.

138
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:42,596
But it turned out to be him.

139
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,798
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:44,631
Forget it.

141
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,466
You've known each other for so long.

142
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,168
You're good friends.

143
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,936
I'm not his friend.

144
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:51,571
Absurd!

145
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,308
We were in the same school since primary school,

146
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,845
I didn't expect to meet him in this university.

147
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,046
But he transferred to
the Department of Computer Science

148
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,316
in his sophomore year!

149
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,418
I've been tolerating for long.

150
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,188
I'll never forgive him!

151
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,590
What did he say?

152
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,625
He said he wanted to screw Shi De.

153
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,695
Yeah!

154
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:15,530
I'll stand by you no matter what!

155
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,231
Let's show Gao Shi De what we've got.

156
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,873
What's the matter?

157
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,113
Bing Wei, is it done?

158
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,515
Wait a minute. Almost done.

159
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,648
They're coming. Come on.

160
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,218
Come on.

161
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,753
All right.

162
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:41,221
Go.

163
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:51,933
Shi De.

164
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,333
May I use it first.

165
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,403
OK.

166
00:08:55,403 --> 00:08:56,436
Thank you.

167
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:03,778
Who did this?

168
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:06,915
Who is so boring?

169
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:08,550
Damn it.

170
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,916
Let's find another way.

171
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:10,651
OK.

172
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:16,656
Who did this?

173
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,366
Good shot!

174
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,135
Shi De.

175
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,105
That lay-up was a good one.

176
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,238
Good one! Nice capping.

177
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,276
Please drink this.

178
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,613
Free drinks.

179
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:40,681
Why waste it?

180
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:44,285
It's a bomb.

181
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,688
You idiot. Why do you give it to me?

182
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,490
It's my new clothes.

183
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,414
(Stupid)

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,273
Towel.

185
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,278
I'm in bad luck recently.

186
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,458
-Hi.
-Hi.

187
00:11:25,053 --> 00:11:26,053
That's very nice.

188
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,255
Continue.

189
00:11:27,588 --> 00:11:28,221
I want...

190
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:29,823
Do I have to play because you want to hear it?

191
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:31,191
Who do you think you are?

192
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:34,995
I mean

193
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,731
it's great.

194
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,033
Bravo.

195
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,348
It was you who pulled the pranks before, right?

196
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,316
What pranks?

197
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:56,583
I don't know.

198
00:12:01,723 --> 00:12:02,423
What are you doing?

199
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,663
Smell like talcum powder.

200
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,565
Stop lying.

201
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,331
I've thrown...

202
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,533
What?

203
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,223
Sprinkle chili powder on his swimming trunk.

204
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,928
Call him and remain silent.

205
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:45,500
Use wax to remove his eyebrows.

206
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,570
Cut his nose hair secretly.

207
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:54,508
Put gum on his chair.

208
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,013
(A million pranks to be pulled on Gao Shi De)

209
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:00,015
Is that enough?

210
00:13:00,015 --> 00:13:01,581
From three o'clock till now, seriously?

211
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,050
Yeah, I'm running out of inspiration.

212
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,020
Are you punishing him or us?

213
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,125
Let's just find some hooligans to beat him up.

214
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,793
Are you stupid?

215
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,895
You study law.

216
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,163
How can you come up with this crap?

217
00:13:15,163 --> 00:13:16,230
They are quite good at it.

218
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,498
He won't find out.

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,435
Well.

220
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,236
Just forget it.

221
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,938
We're about to graduate.

222
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,573
Just bear with it for a while longer.

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,343
That's why I want a memorial.

224
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:31,913
Do you remember when we were in Grade Six?

225
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:33,881
You also said you wanted to do it.

226
00:13:34,415 --> 00:13:35,816
But you ended up falling into
the tree hole instead.

227
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,418
And he saved you.

228
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:40,121
Every time when you were about to graduate,

229
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,391
you wanted to punish him.

230
00:13:43,758 --> 00:13:44,791
And?

231
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,926
You suffered from your pranks.

232
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,593
What do you mean?

233
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:48,261
Do you think I'll lose to him?

234
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,896
I've come up with so many ways.

235
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,665
I don't mean that.

236
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:53,935
We're all adults.

237
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,570
Can't you just talk nicely?

238
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:56,303
Yeah.

239
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:57,105
I don't care.

240
00:13:57,105 --> 00:13:58,071
I have to deal with him.

241
00:13:58,506 --> 00:13:59,473
Shu Yi.

242
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,778
It's done?

243
00:14:04,745 --> 00:14:06,213
Remember to take pictures and send them to me.

244
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:10,951
He's 21 years old already,

245
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,020
still so wayward.

246
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,188
No.

247
00:14:14,755 --> 00:14:16,925
I think being like that at 21

248
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:18,793
is pretty cute.

249
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:26,666
Remember to take pictures.

250
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,816
Bing Wei's picture of
the prank plan is totally blurry.

251
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,353
I have to deal with Gao Shi De.

252
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,790
Fang Zheng Wen, be quick.

253
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,191
OK.

254
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,795
What's up?

255
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:55,196
So mysterious.

256
00:14:55,196 --> 00:14:56,698
I have something to tell you.

257
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,203
Fang Zheng Wen, do you hate me?

258
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,073
No.

259
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,075
You...

260
00:15:07,075 --> 00:15:08,376
don't hate me?

261
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,078
What are you talking about? How is it possible?

262
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,346
So you like me?

263
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,048
Didn't I say that...

264
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,885
Because I like you.

265
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,253
Before I graduate, except for my thesis,

266
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:21,088
I care about us the most.

267
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,126
If you don't hate me,

268
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:26,961
would you like to be with me?

269
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,135
But

270
00:15:36,838 --> 00:15:39,206
Shu Yi and me.

271
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,841
The three of us...

272
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,176
I'm talking about you and me.

273
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,243
Why do you mention Shu Yi?

274
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:46,313
Shu Yi.

275
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,415
Why are you here?

276
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,883
Great!

277
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:52,120
What good news!

278
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,888
The three of us grew up together.

279
00:15:53,888 --> 00:15:55,290
You two are a couple now.

280
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,623
Wonderful!

281
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,260
Just say yes to her.

282
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,430
I was worried this tomboy

283
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,165
wouldn't get a boyfriend.

284
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:04,998
Shu Yi, I didn't know...

285
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,435
I'm relieved now that you're the one.

286
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,605
I'd like to celebrate for you.

287
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,006
How about tonight?

288
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,908
-Shu Yi.
-Tonight,

289
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:15,310
eight o'clock.

290
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,745
-Shu Yi.
-I'll see you then.

291
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:21,248
Why is he in a hurry?

292
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:23,050
Is Shu Yi

293
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:24,518
OK?

294
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,386
What are you doing?

295
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,988
It's dangerous running down the stairs!

296
00:17:02,556 --> 00:17:03,358
Are you OK?

297
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,578
Why Zheng Wen?

298
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,751
Why choose him instead of me?

299
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,656
Zheng Wen is an idiot.

300
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,960
Yu Xin is a fool!

301
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,866
Both of you are idiots!

302
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:55,736
I tried so hard.

303
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:01,341
Why do you do this to me?

304
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:34,108
You said it was a custom-made lucky necklace.

305
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,618
Not lucky at all!

306
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,226
(Next episode)

307
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:08,195
Did you know how you look just now?

308
00:22:08,195 --> 00:22:08,963
Do you want them to find out

309
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,365
that you love Jiang Yu Xin?

310
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:12,433
Recently,

311
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:13,801
I need a page boy.

312
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:15,470
You take the job.

313
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,671
You have to be on-call

314
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,805
and obey me

315
00:22:17,805 --> 00:22:19,040
until we graduate.

316
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,508
No way!

317
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:21,676
Wait and see.

318
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,578
