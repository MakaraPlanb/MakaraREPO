The juniors did work hard on it.

14
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,740
Are there really ghosts?

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,080
Seriously? Who's that girl?

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,790
I'm so wronged.

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,930
Why is she fluttering?

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,290
Why is she fluttering!

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,770
Help me!

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,380
No, no!

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,180
This way.

22
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,910
No.

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,950
They didn't tell me there's such an area.

24
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,850
No.

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:35,920
No, really, please!

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,150
-It's on the map.
-Stop messing around.

27
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,320
Let's just leave, OK?

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,790
Hurry.

29
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,860
What is that?

30
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,660
It's fake.

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,830
It's just a costume.

32
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,760
No...

33
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,370
Impossible.

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,030
They set it up.

35
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,670
You've gone too far!

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,540
Back off.

37
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,340
Let's get out of here.

38
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,810
Go. Let's leave.

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,510
Don't go.

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,210
I'm bored.

41
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,150
Let's hang out.

42
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,890
I'll carry you, go.

43
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,670
You're so good at this.

44
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,770
Fang Zheng Wen!

45
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,900
I might kick your ass.

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,880
Oh, my!

47
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
It's my first night out.

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,810
And this place is horrible.

49
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,250
Gao Shi De.

50
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,290
Are you afraid?

51
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,560
Do you dare to sleep by yourself?

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,090
Oh.

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,730
I dare not.

54
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,660
I was afraid you'd laugh at me.

55
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,930
I don't laugh at my friends.

56
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,760
Why don't you come over here?

57
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,260
I'll protect you.

58
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,570
Could you fall sleep?

59
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,040
Move the bed a little closer.

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,210
I'll talk to you.

61
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,770
What do you wanna talk about?

62
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,200
Well.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,710
What kind of person do you like?

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,140
Personality, appearance,

65
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,450
and the things he likes.

66
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,410
Let me analyze it for you.

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,250
You're curious about everything,

68
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,920
aren't you?

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,290
If you see me as your friend, just tell me.

70
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,900
He...

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,810
He's cute.

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,980
Some people think

73
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,650
he's arrogant

74
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,320
and narcissistic.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,990
But in my eyes,

76
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,320
he's just cute.

77
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,490
You even like his disadvantages.

78
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,860
True love, huh?

79
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,100
Maybe.

80
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,970
Though he's proud and stubborn,

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,410
he's good to his friends.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,710
He'd protect his friends

83
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,350
at all risks.

84
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,050
He's loyal.

85
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,020
That's an advantage.

86
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,490
There are more.

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,730
Aren't you going to tell him?

88
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,770
We've just become friends.

89
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,740
I don't wanna lose him so soon.

90
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
We are the same.

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,510
I understand you.

92
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,180
I've moved on.

93
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,390
You're still suffering.

94
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,190
Poor man.

95
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,690
Come to me if you need someone to talk to.

96
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll listen to you

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,300
and keep your secrets.

98
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:46,170
You're welcome.

99
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,070
Thank you.

Do me a favor.

Sing for me.

103
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,890
Me? Singing?

104
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,930
I'm used to listening to music
before going to sleep.

105
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,400
Come on, sing it.

106
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,770

You're really good at being a female ghost.

159
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,900
I didn't see him.

160
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,670
Didn't he come back with you?

161
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,440
I thought he was behind you.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,710
No way!

163
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,480
Shi De's not back either.

164
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,510
How come!

165
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,380
Hey.

166
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,580
Are those the only places
where you've kept the clues?

167
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,220
What's the matter?

168
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,920
Two people aren't back yet.

169
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,460
What? Who?

170
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,130
Zhou Shu Yi and Gao Shi De.

171
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,600
Hold on a second, everybody.

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,570
Has anyone seen Shu Yi and Shi De?

173
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,600
It's okay. They sent me a message.

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,810
They said they were bored and went back first.

175
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,480
-Are you guys bored?
-Give me the phone.

176
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,040
(It's so boring!)

177
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,350
(Zhou Shu Yi and I are leaving.)

178
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,580
(Keep the phones for us.)

179
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,350
(We'll get them tomorrow.)

180
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,880

181
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,850

182
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,790
How's your leg?

183
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,690
Give it back.

184
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,330
I'm fine!

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,160

It's late already and this is it for tonight.

187
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,330
Why don't we go home and get some rest?

188
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,480
Did you...

189
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,650
confess your love?

190
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,250
Get out.

191
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,020
Beg me.

192
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,090
Get out.

193
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,660
Please!

194
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,670
I meant it when I said

195
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,340
I liked you

196
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,710
yesterday.

197
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,150
I also meant it when I said
I would get to you when you're hurt.

198
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,120
But I'm not gonna do that to you.

199
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,030
You said

200
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,800
the person I like is lucky.

201
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,440
But the lucky person

202
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,540
has always been you.

203
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:04,080
But you'll never know!

204
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,050
Zhou Shu Yi.

205
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,980
I like you.

206
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,880
I'm going to play ball after class today.

207
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,680
Sure. It's a beautiful day.

208
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's kick their asses off!

209
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
You and me, together we are undefeatable!

210
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,650
You came so early today.

211
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,490
That's something new.

212
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,260
You were so rude yesterday.

213
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,590
How could you said it was bored and left like that?

214
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:58,800
Yeah.

215
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,430
We were trying to figure out how to scare you.

216
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,400
But we didn't even see you.

217
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,500
Did you get the notes from yesterday's class?

218
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,270
Give it to me.

219
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,770
Of course not.

220
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:11,140
I didn't even bring the textbook.

221
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,410
Shame on you.

222
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,180
Did you get the notes from yesterday's class?

223
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,250
Give it to me.

224
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,810
What notes?

225
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,720
The notes that the professor said

226
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
which would be in the exams.

227
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,790
Ask Yu Xin

228
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,890
if there's any dating party recently.

229
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,790
You want a girlfriend?

230
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,560
Yeah.

231
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,130
Introduce some to me.

232
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,600
What reminded you of that suddenly?

233
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,340
You two displayed affection in front of me.

234
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,270
I'm gonna take revenge.

235
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,770
Idiot.

236
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,940
Please.

237
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:46,940
All right.

238
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,910
I'll talk to her.

239
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,890
Hey.

240
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,790
This is Zhou Shu Yi.

241
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,170
Have you waited for long?

242
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,130
No.

243
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,040
Order whatever you want.

244
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,840
My treat.

245
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,370
OK.

246
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,040
Thank you.

247
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,780
(Where are you?)

248
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,380
(We agreed to have dinner together.)

249
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,150
(Damn idiot)
(Did You forgot it?)

250
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,190
Anything wrong?

251
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,490
It's okay.

252
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,720
What would you like to eat?

253
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,990
-Let me see.
-Okay.

254
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,270
Well...

255
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,880
Do you know where Shu Yi is?

256
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,850
What's the matter?

257
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,850
I've decided to learn to swim.

258
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,720
You all are good at swimming.

259
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,260
I want to take some photos of myself

260
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,330
swimming in the sea.

261
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,060
Look!

262
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,270
Or...

263
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,430
let's go and watch baseball games.

264
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,400
When I'm free,

265
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,570
I'd go to watch some baseball games

266
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,310
and cheer for the players.

267
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,240
Swimming.

268
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,640
It sounds good.

269
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,910
Or,

270
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,650
maybe we should go bowling.

271
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,450
(Shu Yi said)

272
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,820
(he wanted a girlfriend?)

273
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,020
A junior I know has liked him for long.

274
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,990
So...

275
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:52,260
Shu Yi and you are so close lately.

276
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,300
Are you

277
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,530
good friends?

278
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Right.

279
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,570
Yeah.

280
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
Friends.

281
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,070
We're good friends.

282
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,840
Yeah.

283
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,450
I love shrimp the most.

284
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,590
How about you? Do you like it?

285
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,920
I do.

286
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,850
Have a bite.

287
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,950
Why would I think of him!

288
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,580
Senior, how do you like the food?

289
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,350
Are you free tomorrow?

290
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,260
Shall we go to the cinema tomorrow?

291
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,830
The food is good.

292
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,300
I think it's delicious, too.

293
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,000
So...

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,030
Senior, do you like Korean food?

295
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,370
I know a really good restaurant.

296
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,300
Maybe we can go together next time.

297
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,870
I'm busy tomorrow.

298
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,400
I can't make it.

299
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,710
He's so cold.

300
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,010
Am I not being proactive enough?

301
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,350
Zhou Shu Yi.

302
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,520
Are you under the weather?

303
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,160
You've been distracted all day long.

304
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,490
Senior.

305
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,300
Shu Yi.

306
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,030
I...

307
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,370
No!

308
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:47,910
Ouch!

309
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,150
Forget it.

310
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,880
You don't really wanna date me.

311
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,220
What?

312
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,420
I have a class later.

313
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,450
Thank you for your time today!

314
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,730
Another hallucination!

315
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,200
It hurts.

316
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,470
It's true!

317
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,270
What are you doing?

318
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,640
It's all your fault!

319
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,940
Now I twisted my ankle.

320
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,340
I'll take you to the infirmary.

321
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,410
No, thanks.

322
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,280
Shall I carry you on my back or with my arms?

323
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,120
Choose one.

324
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,050
Just hold me.

325
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,250
Hold me.

326
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,100
He's not a doctor.

327
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,470
Fine.

328
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,100
It's my break anyway.

329
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,140
Blame yourself for that.

330
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,680
Figure it out yourself.

331
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,440
Where's the bandage?

332
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,240
I'll do it myself.

333
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:56,510
But I run out of bandages.

334
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,580
I'm gonna go get some.

335
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,920
In the warehouse behind?

336
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,050
Go ahead.

337
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,810
What are you looking at?

338
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,050
Well.

339
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm relieved.

340
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
You're not as good as me.

341
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,820
You won't attract Shi De.

342
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,290
What do you mean?

343
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,790
Don't you know that men would also like men?

344
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,860
Kid.

345
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
You like Gao Shi De...

346
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,830
He'll be mine.

347
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Keep it a secret.

348
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm gonna get him next month.

349
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,740
Wish me luck.

350
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,170
Wish my ass!

351
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,940
Who's gonna keep your secret?

352
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,040
Forget it!

353
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,450
Gao Shi De said he liked me.

354
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:11,590
It seems

355
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,890
that your secret is not a secret anymore.

356
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,170
Pei Shou Yi.

357
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yes?

358
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,210
Don't go.

359
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,920
Make it clear.

360
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
No regrets, OK?

361
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,270
What do you want?

362
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,030
(Next Episode)
Yes, I like you.

363
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,060
But it's none of your business.

364
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,800
How can I give up someone I like?

365
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,970
I know I'd fail.

366
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,900
Should I keep on trying?

367
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,770
It is not that you will get something in return

368
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,170
for your efforts when it comes to love.

369
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,270
Miss me?

370
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,570
I'm doomed.

371
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,910
I think I've fallen for him.

372
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,910
