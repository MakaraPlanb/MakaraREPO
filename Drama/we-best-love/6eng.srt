Gao Shi De. I'm serious!

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,285
Stop it!

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,727
Zhou Shu Yi likes Gao Shi De!

16
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,797
Very much!

17
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,249
Damn.

18
00:01:23,266 --> 00:01:24,884
I'm off duty.

19
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,886
You caught me while I was having fun drinking.

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,424
You guys!

21
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,693
-Will you just leave me alone?
-Ouch!

22
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:34,628
Easy!

23
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,333
Displaying affection in front of me?

24
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,536
I'd like to introduce to you

25
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,338
your future cousin-in-law.

26
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,406
Zhou Shu Yi.

27
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,408
And he

28
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,577
is my cousin, Pei Shou Yi.

29
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,315
You're his cousin, why did pretend to love him?

30
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,082
It made me...

31
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,083
What?

32
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,019
Jealous?

33
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:02,055
Annoying.

34
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:02,889
All right.

35
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,557
Leave him alone.

36
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,425
Couldn't bear to watch?

37
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,726
Yeah.

38
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,095
Whatever.

39
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,566
I'm tired of looking out for you kids.

40
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,637
I think I should do something for myself.

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,474
It's on me today.

42
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,208
No need.

43
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,378
Same old.

44
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:27,947
So?

45
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,849
That couple

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,253
reminds you of how lonely you are?

47
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,388
That's nice.

48
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,691
I want somebody to love.

49
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:42,662
Here.

50
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,953
-Would you like some noodles?
-OK.

51
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,334
When did they get together?

52
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,237
I wondered why I hadn't seen Bing Wei

53
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,839
in our department lately.

54
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,907
He was there for you.

55
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,279
I mean...

56
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,982
he might be yhere for some club activities.

57
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,292
Gao Shi De.

58
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:48,561
You're spoiling him.

59
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,562
Really?

60
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,265
The shrimp, the vegetable, and the drinks.

61
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,600
Why don't you just feed him?

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,101
Why didn't you do that for me?

63
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,369
Here.

64
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,036
Come on.

65
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,113
Keep an eye on her.

66
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,015
She's two years older than us,

67
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,050
but still acting like a child.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,952
All right.

69
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,087
Leave him alone.

70
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,428
I'll leave Shu Yi to you now.

71
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,199
You know

72
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,034
he's short-tempered.

73
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,769
If he ever gets mad at you,

74
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:31,905
don't take it to heart.

75
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,375
I know.

76
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,610
Don't worry.

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,078
I'll take care of him.

78
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,613
Wait a minute.

79
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,849
What do you guys mean?

80
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,017
Am I that hard to deal with?

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,488
You didn't know?

82
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,423
You're the reason why we're dating.

83
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,760
Well.

84
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,495
You know, we talked about you all the time.

85
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,462
And...

86
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,998
then we fell for each other.

87
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,537
You owe me a thank you.

88
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,539
-No way.
-No way!

89
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:07,473
We were always talking about

90
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,008
how to clean up your ass.

91
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,276
You should thank us

92
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,444
for doing that.

93
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,348
By the way, I'll tell you what...

94
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,985
You still send e-mails to your boyfriend?

95
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,988
Yeah, at least once a week.

96
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,457
So romantic!

97
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,092
And our e-mail addresses

98
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,193
are quite meaningful.

99
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,628
It's the code I used when

100
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,929
I confessed my love to him.

101
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:30,830
He's not listening.

102
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,031
It's not too late.

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,299
Is it?

104
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,634
Run!

105
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,741
We're going to the library tomorrow

106
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:42,775
to study for the final exam.

107
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:43,576
Would you like to come?

108
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm going to study at Gao Shi De's.

109
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:48,715
Are you sure you're going to study there?

110
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,554
Jiang Yu Xin, look at your creepy smile.

111
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,923
Make sure you bring the seductive underpants,

112
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,792
just in case.

113
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,527
What are you talking about?

114
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,695
Ignore her.

115
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,830
Get ready for the final exam.

116
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,898
Of course.

117
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll beat him this time in the exam.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,135
All right, see you.

119
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,270
Bye.

120
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,504
Bye-Bye.

121
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:16,709
What's the seductive underpants?

122
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,418
(seductive underpants)

123
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,585
You're distracted.

124
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,458
How can you be so calm?

125
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,032
What's wrong?

126
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,677
Sit still.

127
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,515
What are you doing?

128
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,187
Now I can focus.

129
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,254
Read your book.

130
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:40,226
It's upside down.

131
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,896
Aren't you nervous with

132
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:44,797
the one you like?

133
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:47,867
Are you?

134
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,802
Why would I be if you're not?

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,637
I'm very nervous.

136
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:52,672
Oh?

137
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:54,607
So...

138
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,908
I'm just as nervous as you are.

139
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,112
Really?

140
00:07:59,112 --> 00:07:59,912
Yeah.

141
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,748
You bet I am. It's your first time here.

142
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,487
Did I treat you badly?

143
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,090
I wasn't very nice to you, either.

144
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,958
We're even.

145
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,693
Oh?

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,661
Doesn't ring a bell.

147
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,333
I took all the first ranks.

148
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,371
Are you trying to provoke me?

149
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,874
I'll beat you this time in the final exam.

150
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:28,975
Alright.

151
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,512
I have to win, OK?

152
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,614
Why?

153
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,419
Only in this way

154
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,953
will you keep focusing on me.

155
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,656
How much do you like me?

156
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,759
A lot.

157
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,630
I like you too much to be rational.

158
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:54,200
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

159
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,069
I can't believe that you actually like me.

160
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,812
Mama's home, son!

161
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,213
Mom.

162
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,148
Hi, auntie.

163
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,984
I'm Zhou Shu Yi.

164
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,257
Hello.

165
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,726
I'm Shi De's mom.

166
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,896
Nice sofa, huh?

167
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,866
I'll go inside first.

168
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,271
Hi, I'm Gao Shi De.

169
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:37,510
I thought you said you would be working late.

170
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,479
I was very productive today.

171
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,947
And I finished early.

172
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,416
I didn't know you were bringing your friend home.

173
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,051
Am I interrupting you?

174
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,519
(What should I do?)

175
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,988
(Will his mother hate me?)

176
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:50,857
Shu Yi.

177
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,192
Why don't you study in the room

178
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,094
with Shi De?

179
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,463
I'll make you a nice dinner later.

180
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,631
Thank you, auntie.

181
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,567
Go.

182
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,803
Don't get in my way.

183
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,007
Go to my room.

184
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,775
Get the books.

185
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,587
All right.

186
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,392
Come on.

187
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,529
Have a try, please.

188
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,033
What's wrong? You don't like sweet and sour ribs?

189
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,434
-Or would you like some...
-It's not that.

190
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,104
It just reminded me

191
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,673
of my mom doing the same thing for me
when I was a kid.

192
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,444
Well, have some more.

193
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:47,380
Save the etiquette, alright?

194
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,981
Thank you, auntie.

195
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,753
Yummy.

196
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,455
Auntie, you're so good at cooking!

197
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,624
-Thank you.
-Don't be so exaggerated.

198
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,726
He is being polite.

199
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,928
Eat more.

200
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,964
Don't let Shi De bully you.

201
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,831
Mom.

202
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,099
It's his first time here.

203
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,100
And you're playing favorites.

204
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,602
Who's your son?

205
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:13,406
I can't help it, but Yi is so cute.

206
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,540
Do you mind if I call you that?

207
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,942
Of course not.

208
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,977
Yi.

209
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,746
Auntie has my permission, not you.

210
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:21,914
I have his permission, not you.

211
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,551
You guys enjoy.

212
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,453
-What's up?
-What's up?

213
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,688
So petty.

214
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,723
-Only I can call him that.
-Yeah.

215
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:34,760
Yi, you're super cute.

216
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,361
Thank you.

217
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,395
Okay.

218
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,030
Here are your sweet and sour ribs.

219
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,666
Don't say that I play favorites

220
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,468
and stop eating as a silent protest.

221
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,037
No, no. Yi should have more.

222
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,072
So he will get bigger

223
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,673
and won't get bullied.

224
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,808
Why are you jealous?

225
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,376
Or should I call you De?

226
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,245
That's disgusting.

227
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:52,878
De.

228
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,447
Yeah, I used to call you De when you were a kid.

229
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,448
You said

230
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,882
you were a grown up

231
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,451
and I had to stop calling you that.

232
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,819
I didn't call you ma'am then.

233
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,055
You little brat.

234
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,290
I'm telling you, that's how he behaves.

235
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,191
If he bullies you,

236
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:05,725
let me know.

237
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,759
I'll deal with him.

238
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,010
You...

239
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,778
You're washing the dishes like this?

240
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,313
That's it?

241
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,080
Yeah.

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,049
No.

243
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,584
Use the dishcloth.

244
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,320
This one.

245
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:36,856
So troublesome？

246
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,628
Is it troublesome for you to take a shower?

247
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,401
Is someone helping you with the bath?

248
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,935
No way!

249
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,885
Wait a minute.

250
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,086
Alright.

251
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,254
Alright!

252
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,356
Am I wrong again?

253
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,893
It's a bit too wet.

254
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:17,963
Okay.

255
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,165
Just leave it to me.

256
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:31,944
Is it all done?

257
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,913
Thank you.

258
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,314
Put the fruits here, please.

259
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,216
Yi, come and sit with me.

260
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,818
What about me?

261
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,586
Get your own chair.

262
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,256
Sit down and have some fruits.

263
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,026
Thank you for the work.

264
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:52,965
Not bad.

265
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,904
Why are you so nervous?

266
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,073
Thank you.

267
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,610
All right.

268
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,178
Take it easy.

269
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,147
You don't have to be nervous

270
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,216
or do anything special to impress me.

271
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,083
I didn't.

272
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,918
I really wanted to help.

273
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,588
Okay, mom.

274
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,990
He won't do things he doesn't want to do.

275
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,892
I know.

276
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,561
But I'd like you to relax for a bit.

277
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,296
You could act cute in front of me.

278
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,532
He hasn't done that for a long time.

279
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,069
I'm really happy.

280
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,139
Shi De likes someone as cute as you.

281
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,140
You're a good boy.

282
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,045
You think I don't know?

283
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,313
I'm your mother, okay?

284
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,250
You've been following him everywhere
since elementary school.

285
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,186
You even transferred to his college.

286
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,621
All those paintings

287
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,924
were about him, weren't they?

288
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,126
I'll shut it, or he's gonna be pissed.

289
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,261
So...

290
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,198
Do you mind

291
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,667
us...

292
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,069
Of course I do.

293
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,546
I want you to be truly happy

294
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,515
and take good care of each other.

295
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,585
How wonderful it is when you can be

296
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,554
in a relationship with someone you like!

297
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:23,489
If you feel satisfaction

298
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,126
when you look at him,

299
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,197
then you've found the right person.

300
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,502
Thank you, auntie.

301
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,739
You're so...

302
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,544
So...?

303
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:49,148
So modern and open-minded?

304
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,950
So young and beautiful?

305
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,488
Would you like to know how I take care of my skin?

306
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,691
I've been doing yoga and drinking juice.

307
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,430
You have a good mother.

308
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:07,266
She will be yours one day.

309
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:10,736
Or maybe right now?

310
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,238
Come on.

311
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,540
We're only together for less than a month.

312
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,276
I've thought about this for years.

313
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,379
Cut it out.

314
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,914
I'm serious.

315
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,883
I'll go first.

316
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,218
Text me when you get home.

317
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:29,588
Oh, by the way.

318
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,991
My dad bought a cottage in Pingdong.

319
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,459
Let's go there for a few days

320
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:34,827
in July.

321
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:36,295
Bye.

322
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,118
Gao Shi De.

323
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,589
Pei Shou Yi.

324
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,724
Have you seen Gao Shi De?

325
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,967
They're not here?

326
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,880
Where are they?

327
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,649
It's Dr. Pei's working hours, no?

328
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,786
I haven't told him yet.

329
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,991
I didn't expect

330
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,160
he'd be a completely different person
after we dated.

331
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,062
He helps my mom

332
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,296
and worried about her feelings.

333
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,900
You don't know

334
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,035
how cute he is when he's serious.

335
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,103
That's enough.

336
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,272
No more showing off.

337
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,741
Know your limits, OK?

338
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,714
I was surprised when he invited me to the trip.

339
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,517
He looked forward to it very much.

340
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,186
I couldn't bear to tell him

341
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,021
that I'm going to America after graduation.

342
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,155
You're going to America?

343
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,295
Why didn't you tell me you that?

344
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,396
You're so...

345
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,664
And...

346
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,601
If it's gonna be a long-distance relationship,

347
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,770
you have to ask if I'm OK with it.

348
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,538
Do you have any respect for me?

349
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,339
No.

350
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:28,107
Listen to me.

351
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,509
Shi De.

352
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,413
Remember to bring me

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,181
some cigarettes when you come back.

354
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,808
So...

355
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,110
why are you going to the United States?

356
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,879
My mom's getting remarried.

357
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,614
He's American.

358
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,550
She'll live with him there afterwards.

359
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,985
I'm going to her wedding

360
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,056
and see how she's getting along with my step dad.

361
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,958
I need to get to know him.

362
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,193
After all,

363
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,594
he's gonna be my family.

364
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,230
Oh.

365
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,867
You're my family, too.

366
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,338
Any other questions?

367
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,873
How long will it take?

368
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,576
Maybe a few months.

369
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,215
Can't live without me

370
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,250
for a few months?

371
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,890
Do you like me that much?

372
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,425
Shut up.

373
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,194
Come over tonight.

374
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,161
No.

375
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,297
My mom wants to know you better.

376
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,998
You should say that first.

377
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,366
What's your answer?

378
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,534
OK.

379
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,443
Oh, I see.

380
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,779
Well, thank you for preparing for the contracts.

381
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,349
Thank you.

382
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,856
Have you made the reservation?

383
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:26,992
I'm going to have dinner with Shu Yi.

384
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,794
Remember to ask him to come.

385
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,963
Master, Young Master is staying over
in his classmate's tonight.

386
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,269
Why wasn't I informed?

387
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,237
Young Master...

388
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,739
seems to be in love recently.

389
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,940
It's just...

390
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:43,909
What?

391
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,180
It's just what?

392
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:53,685
Cheers.

393
00:20:59,792 --> 00:21:01,226
It's so cozy here.

394
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,164
What are you doing?

395
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:15,274
I saw this when I was shopping with my mom.

396
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,842
I think it suits you well.

397
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,014
Don't you ever take it off!

398
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,056
Not even in the shower?

399
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,524
Well...

400
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,061
OK.

401
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,262
That's an exception.

402
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,833
But you can only wear what I gift you.

403
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,000
Nothing else.

404
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,570
Why?

405
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,874
I didn't make it

406
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,009
to be part of your past.

407
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,647
But...

408
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,619
I'll be the only one in the rest of your life.

409
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,391
Answer me.

410
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,933
I wish I could take you with me.

411
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,103
Let me know if you need anything,

412
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,037
I'll send it to you.

413
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,206
Yi is so thoughtful.

414
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,874
You should learn to be.

415
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,278
He's only this sweet to you,

416
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:01,313
but to the others...

417
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,215
All right, we're leaving.

418
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,318
I'll give him back to you as soon as I can.

419
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,719
Auntie.

420
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,121
Remember to miss me, okay?

421
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:09,988
Good boy.

422
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,390
Your turn.

423
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,464
I don't know why my mom likes you so much.

424
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,099
She treats you better than she does to me.

425
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,168
Everybody loves me.

426
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:24,870
Oh, yeah?

427
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:54,266
Wait for me.

428
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,137
Bye-Bye.

429
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,263
(Though I hate e-mails,)

430
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,334
(I've got a special account just for you.)

431
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:30,936
(Let's see if you're smart enough)

432
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,838
(to know the meaning behind it.)

433
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,145
Stupid son.

434
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,481
He called you stupid yet you are still smiling.

435
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,417
Abruti means stupid

436
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,486
in French.

437
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,889
You're really sick.

438
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,491
Why are you so happy?

439
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,892
No, mom.

440
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,596
In ASCII, 87887278

441
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,297
can be translated into four letters in English.

442
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:04,603
And WXHN in Pinyin

443
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,639
means "I like you".

444
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,741
Together with the word "Abruti",

445
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:10,842
the e-mail address

446
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,712
is "Stupid, I like you."

447
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,281
Yi is so romantic.

448
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,850
That's how educated young men date?

449
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,585
Smart!

450
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,620
No big deal.

451
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,354
No big deal?

452
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,288
You're my son.

453
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,156
You're excellent.

454
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:24,956
Excellent!

455
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,396
If you like him, you should cherish him.

456
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:33,065
Treat him well!

457
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,266
Okay, mom.

458
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,034
He's got my back.

459
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,436
What about me?

460
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,171
Just take care of yourself.

461
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,605
Sir, the plane is about to take off.

462
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:41,873
Put your phone away, please.

463
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,275
Sorry.

464
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,281
All right, don't be wordy.

465
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,150
Why do you keep peeking?

466
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,295
(Stupid Shi De)
(I like you, too.)

467
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:38,096
Gao Shi De.

468
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,965
Still sleeping?

469
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,933
Yeah.

470
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,469
Tired?

471
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,241
It's all your fault.

472
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,846
All right, take a break.

473
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,959
You're filming?

474
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:10,562
What takes you so long?

475
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:17,736
(Love makes you)

476
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,905
(stupid.)

477
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,007
