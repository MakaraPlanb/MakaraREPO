Gao Shi De.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,060
Let's finish this first.

15
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,237
Sorry, I overheard it.

16
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,777
That's why

17
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,147
you tried to avoid me?

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,287
You want a girlfriend,

19
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:28,688
right?

20
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,590
I...

21
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,732
I don't want to fall for a man.

22
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,077
Got it.

23
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:04,124
But you don't have to find a girlfriend

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,625
because of this.

25
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:07,761
It's not fair to the girl.

26
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,364
I'm not that odious.

27
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,366
Okay, then.

28
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,434
Find a girl you like

29
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,670
and be nice to her.

30
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,479
The best way to comfort a broken heart

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,247
is to fall in love again.

32
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:09,789
Wish you happy.

33
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,092
Gao Shi De.

34
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
See if you can stand up.

35
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:21,801
Much better.

36
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,271
Thank you.

37
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,145
Zhou Shu Yi.

38
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:40,553
Yes, I like you.

39
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,392
But it's none of your business.

40
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,932
Forget what I said the other day.

41
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,766
Still alive?

42
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,769
I thought my son was Le Penseur.

43
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,473
What's the matter? Something's bothering you?

44
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,408
Nothing.

45
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,110
Nothing?

46
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,178
You're my son.

47
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,947
I know you too well.

48
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,915
Don't bother to lie to me.

49
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:43,816
What's the matter?

50
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:44,617
Just tell me.

51
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,558
I was just thinking...

52
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,362
how I can give up someone I like?

53
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,367
Have you tried to pursue that person?

54
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,740
Why would you give up without even trying?

55
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:10,143
I thought you had guts.

56
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,045
I remembered you used to be pretty brave.

57
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:12,979
Did you lost it?

58
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,514
Would you like me to help you find it?

59
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,683
Mom.

60
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,819
If you like someone,

61
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,387
try as much as you can

62
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,222
if nothing stops you from doing it.

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,325
If you don't even try,

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,110
you won't know how things will turn out.

65
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,778
Without trying,

66
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,980
you must regret it later.

67
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,767
What if

68
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,037
I know I'd fail.

69
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,473
Should I still try?

70
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,810
Son.

71
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,778
What's wrong with you?

72
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,113
My handsome boy!

73
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,183
Have some confidence, come on!

74
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,353
You're not him.

75
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,421
How do you know what he'll say to you?

76
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,690
You should definitely try.

77
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,625
Even if it doesn't work out,

78
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,793
so what?

79
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,964
Setbacks will only make a man more attractive.

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,067
But you still have to

81
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,469
go to America with me.

82
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,536
If you choose your lover

83
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,637
over your mother,

84
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,072
you're too ungrateful.

85
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,407
I won't, Mom.

86
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,942
I'll keep my words.

87
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,543
That's good.

88
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,678
Let's eat.

89
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,580
I rarely cook.

90
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,782
Yeah. You rarely cook.

91
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,952
No work, then.

92
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,987
Enjoy your dinner with your son.

93
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:31,424
Yes, baby boy.

94
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,792
Let's eat.

95
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,630
This is your favorite.

96
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,969
Eat more and think less.

97
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,070
OK.

98
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:23,242
There you are!

99
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,781
It smells like talcum powder.

100
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,949
Is the shrimp ready?

101
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,251
Yes.

102
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,823
So cool.

103
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,891
I thought...

104
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,860
you were asking me on a date.

105
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,727
I'll take you to the infirmary.

106
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:42,829
No, thanks.

107
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,631
Should I carry you on my back or in my arms?

108
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,632
Choose one.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,935
Zhou Shu Yi.

110
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,270
I like you.

111
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,774
None of my business?

112
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,209
You like me.

113
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,710
Of course it's my business.

114
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,929
(Damn idiot)
The deal's off.

115
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,464
I'll delete the video.

116
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,666
Thank you for being my friend these days.

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,235
These days?

118
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,437
Did I say I was done with you?

119
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,439
Fine, don't be friends anymore.

120
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,640
Who cares!

121
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,328
You are crazy about spicy pot, right?

122
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:49,962
Tell you what,

123
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,931
I went to a really great restaurant serving that last week.

124
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,965
Shall we go together?

125
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,333
Invite Gao Shi De to join us.

126
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,302
I won't eat with him.

127
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,870
Shi De.

128
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,739
It's been a long time since we
went out together last time.

129
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,375
Oh, you two had a fight?

130
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,210
That's why I haven't seen you together lately.

131
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,878
No.

132
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,880
It's Gao Shi De.

133
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,482
What's the matter?

134
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,856
I forgot my phone.

135
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,693
Shu Yi.

136
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,361
The classroom is over there. Where are you going?

137
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,102
If it hurts, find something to bite on.

138
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,638
Doc, there's no such thing here.

139
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,907
It's done.

140
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,011
If you drive fast again,

141
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,247
I'll break your bones

142
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,682
before putting plaster on it,

143
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,319
so you'll know the importance of
taking care of your body

144
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,588
and won't hurt yourself again.

145
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,756
It's not that we won't.

146
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,725
We simply don't dare to.

147
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,530
Get out!

148
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,332
Thank you, school doctor.

149
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,919
Pei Shou Yi.

150
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,429
Miss me?

151
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,473
Pei Shou Yi!

152
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,515
What's the matter?

153
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:53,119
Nothing.

154
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,087
You standing by the door

155
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,024
reminded me of a troublesome kid

156
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,892
when I was a high school doctor.

157
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,198
You're done with Mr. Zhou?

158
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,433
Yeah.

159
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,601
Right.

160
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,436
Why did you mess with us?

161
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,677
You ate my instant noodles without asking.

162
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,779
Just a bowl of instant noodles.

163
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,080
Seriously?

164
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,086
You can eat anything you want,

165
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,322
but not that bag of instant noodles.

166
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,222
That's mine!

167
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:35,461
If it weren't for you,

168
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,063
we could have been friends

169
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,331
until we graduate.

170
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,435
You can't hide your feelings.

171
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,439
You have affective disorder,
don't talk about feelings with me.

172
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,508
Mind your words.

173
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,878
Where's your easy-going persona?

174
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,449
Busted.

175
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,619
I'll save it for you.

176
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,082
Alright, so much for today.

177
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,451
Remember your homework, okay?

178
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,753
OK.

179
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,016
[Gao Shi De]

180
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,520
I heard the teacher
would talk about the exam questions today.

181
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,921
Do you think it's true?

182
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:18,924
Hey!

183
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:20,860
Hey!

184
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,064
Don't pretend to be strong!

185
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:25,931
What?

186
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,132
Gao Shi De!

187
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:27,867
Hey!

188
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:28,934
Why are you hiding from me?

189
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:30,870
What are you doing?

190
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,371
Sorry, man.

191
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,639
He thought you were someone else.

192
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,675
What are you doing?

193
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm doomed.

194
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,281
What?

195
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,150
I think I've fallen for him.

196
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,398
You asked me to come here

197
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,033
just to ask me this?

198
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,434
Answer me.

199
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,836
Do you like Zhou Shu Yi?

200
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:07,206
It's none of your business.

201
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,275
Wait!

202
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,776
Hear me out.

203
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,644
Okay?

204
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,525
You know I've liked you for so long.

205
00:15:26,525 --> 00:15:28,460
Do you think it's fun seeing me follow you around?

206
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,330
Shi Zhe Yu.

207
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,933
Don't impose your feelings on others.

208
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,969
It is not that you will get anything in return

209
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,437
for your efforts when it comes to love.

210
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,041
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

211
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,282
If I made you

212
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,417
misunderstand before,

213
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,853
I sincerely apologize for that.

214
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,727
Gao Shi De, you bastard!

215
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,495
How could you do this to me?

216
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,697
You bullied me!

217
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,035
What are you doing?

218
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,503
You've scolded him for long,

219
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,771
you must be thirsty.

220
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,074
Go away!

221
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,109
I won't accept you.

222
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,646
What?

223
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:23,182
Still pretending?

224
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,218
Every time I teased Zhou Shu Yi,

225
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,653
you came and interrupted us.

226
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,489
I know what's on your mind!

227
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,391
You are not my cup of tea!

228
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,627
Of course not.

229
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,935
I don't like you.

230
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,503
I did it for Zhou Shu Yi.

231
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,671
Zhou Shu Yi!

232
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,872
Again?

233
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:54,947
Am I that bad?

234
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,588
I just don't like you.

235
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,226
Are you done?

236
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,968
You can't force people to like you.

237
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,742
You can cry if you want.

238
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:25,210
Bullshit!

239
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,848
Smile, then.

240
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,221
Or...

241
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,558
let me buy you dinner.

242
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,196
Good food is for the lovelorn, right?

243
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,764
I'm not lovelorn!

244
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,072
Then let's celebrate the birthday.

245
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,742
It's your birthday today?

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,414
Yesterday, yeah.

247
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,462
If you miss him, go find him.

248
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,732
You think I haven't tried?

249
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,502
Then why don't you just ask him out?

250
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:24,937
Why should I?

251
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,674
He'll know I'm looking for him.

252
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,875
It's so embarrassing.

253
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,111
Kiddo.

254
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:34,213
You've been running around school lately

255
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:35,814
just to meet him, right?

256
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,983
So what?

257
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,321
I thought it wasn't so hard to find
someone in the information era.

258
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:43,989
Now I know

259
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,592
you can never find whoever tries to avoid you.

260
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,962
How did he find me before?

261
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,197
We're from different departments,

262
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,899
but I met him every day.

263
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,437
It occurs to me

264
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,206
he's been there in your whole life.

265
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,545
Do you remember when we played hide and seek?

266
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,313
As long as he was the ghost,

267
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,082
you were always the first to get caught.

268
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,352
Sounds like it.

269
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,758
Because he's been watching you.

270
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,362
What a stalker!

271
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,463
So creepy.

272
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,971
Zheng Wen told me

273
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,741
you had a crush on me, right?

274
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,177
It's over.

275
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,147
But you didn't notice

276
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,216
that Gao Shi De has always been the one

277
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,083
by your side.

278
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:48,754
Shu Yi.

279
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,523
You've fallen for him, right?

280
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,997
Do what you have to do.

281
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,066
You can make it!

282
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,621
(What are you doing, Gao Shi De?)

283
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,523
(I can't find you anywhere.)

284
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,495
Gao Shi De!

285
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:32,998
You are avoiding me!

286
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,400
You're tired of the game?

287
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,038
I deleted the video.

288
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,173
You can check my phone...

289
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,509
You threatened me to be your page boy

290
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:46,345
with the video

291
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,347
because you were worried about me.

292
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,453
You said I could be free if I beat you once

293
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,489
just to distract me.

294
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,157
I'm not that good.

295
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,793
I did it partly for myself, too.

296
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,497
I wanted us to be closer

297
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,000
and be friends till graduation.

298
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,168
Aren't you going to tell him?

299
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,413
We've just become friends.

300
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,081
I don't want to lose him so soon.

301
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,317
Are you stupid?

302
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,485
Being friends is enough?

303
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,387
You did the same to Jiang Yu Xin
and Fang Zheng Wen.

304
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:35,594
Well, I gotta go.

305
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,398
Am I still the lucky one?

306
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,839
That day at the infirmary,

307
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:49,708
I said the one you liked was a lucky guy.

308
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,778
When I was asleep, you said

309
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,846
the lucky one had always been me.

310
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,217
Is it still me?

311
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,220
Say it!

312
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:03,855
Is it still me?

313
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,892
It doesn't matter now.

314
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,462
I'm being serious, Gao Shi De.

315
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,797
Stop it!

316
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,881
Zhou Shu Yi.

317
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,084
Stop it, or I'll get mad.

318
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,152
I'm the one who should be mad!

319
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,988
So am I still the lucky guy or not?

320
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,656
Or were you just kidding that day?

321
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,257
What the hell are you trying to do?

322
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,859
I like you!

323
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,071
What about Jiang Yu Xin then?

324
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,573
I thought you said you didn't like boys.

325
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,741
Because it's you.

326
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,276
I have no choice.

327
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,351
You don't believe me?

328
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:07,586
OK.

329
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,188
What are you doing?

330
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,923
You don't believe me.

331
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,492
I'll prove it to you.

332
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,394
Will you believe me if I throw it away?

333
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,063
It doesn't mean anything.

334
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,301
I,

335
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,105
Zhou Shu Yin, like Gao Shi De

336
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,175
very much!

337
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,411
I really do!

338
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:37,015
I love him the most!

339
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,185
I like him so much!

340
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,288
I like...

341
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,592
Trust me now?

342
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:02,874
What's mine is mine.

343
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,210
It'll always be mine.

344
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,521
Was that your first kiss?

345
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,831
Who was it?

346
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:05,370
That day in the swimming pool.

347
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,441
That doesn't count.

348
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,451
(When you like someone,)

349
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,822
(is it his business?)

350
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,895
(Because it's you,)

351
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:34,399
(I have no choice.)

352
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,880
(Lesson 5: Because It's You）

353
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,794
(Next episode)
Aren't you nervous with

354
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:03,762
the one you like?

355
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,298
Mama's home, son!

356
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,365
I'm so nervous.

357
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:08,700
Do you mind if I'm with...

358
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,602
Of course, I do.

359
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,505
Young master seems to be in love.

360
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,410
What?

361
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,511
