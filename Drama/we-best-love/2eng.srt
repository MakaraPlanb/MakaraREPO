(Lean on me.)

14
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,360
(If possible,)

15
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:01,561
(just look at me.)

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,300
(Let me be with you.)

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,835
(Don't be sad.)

18
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:13,775
=Lesson 2=
(Let me take you away)

19
00:01:41,703 --> 00:01:43,070
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,371
Do you want to die?

21
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,240
What's wrong with you?

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,340
Why did you kiss me?

23
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,878
You weren't coming up.

24
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,415
None of your business!

25
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:55,450
Why do you care?

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,718
Do you like Jiang Yu Xin that much?

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,520
Seeing her with Fang Zheng Wen

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,188
makes you want to die?

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,258
How do you know I like her?

30
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,860
Were you stalking me?

31
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,763
Yes, all the time.

32
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,170
So that you can defeat me,

33
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,571
make me a runner-up

34
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,873
and laugh at me, right?

35
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:22,176
I knew you didn't mean well.

36
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,545
You see it now.

37
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:24,445
Are you satisfied?

38
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,480
Piss off!

39
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,616
You don't have to pretend to be strong
when you're sad.

40
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,286
I'm not sad.

41
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,421
I'm happy to see them together.

42
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,256
Very happy.

43
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,026
See?

44
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,061
Very happy.

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
Zhou Shu Yi.

46
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,603
Do you want to be beaten up?

47
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,038
Get lost!

48
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:26,240
(Some people say that unrequited love
would never fail.)

49
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:27,741
(Bullshit.)

50
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:30,078
(When the one you love is with)

51
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:32,213
(your good friend since childhood,)

52
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,416
(it hurts more than being dumped.)

53
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:37,318
(You'll feel the pain.)

54
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:39,020
(You would rather destroy the world.)

55
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,790
(It hurts so much that your world is gray)

56
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,858
(on a sunny day.)

57
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,026
(The turbulent wind precedes the mountain storm.)

58
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,313
(The most painful part of losing your love isn't
that the one you like left you,)

59
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,281
(but that you start to doubt yourself.)

60
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,183
(Am I not good enough?)

61
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:10,585
(Don't I deserve to be loved)

62
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,153
(so she chose others?)

63
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,656
(To get rid of the pain and save yourself from it,)

64
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,593
(you have to tell yourself
that she is not the one.)

65
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,598
(You have to force yourself to let go)

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:27,001
(and believe someone must like you in this world.)

67
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,370
(So I have to cheer up)

68
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,840
(and find the right person.)

69
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,183
Hi.

70
00:04:42,183 --> 00:04:43,618
Sorry, we're going to rehearse.

71
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,153
Which club are you from?

72
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,855
You're sitting on the chair for our rehearsal.

73
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:07,075
What are you doing these days?

74
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,478
I didn't see you anywhere.

75
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:17,785
Shu Yi.

76
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,621
I have something to discuss with you.

77
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,023
Do you mind...

78
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,625
Sorry, I'm late.

79
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm late.

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,495
The tutor didn't let us leave.

81
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,563
Come on. I'll treat you to lunch.

82
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,501
You two just go and enjoy your meal.

83
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,203
I don't want to be the third wheel.

84
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,606
You know Fang Zheng Wen.

85
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,308
I don't know if he's stupid or putting on airs,

86
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,043
he hasn't give me an answer yet.

87
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:44,445
But it's fine. I've waited for long anyway.

88
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,346
If you don't give me an answer,

89
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,480
think about the consequences!

90
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,715
(Sometimes,)

91
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:50,018
(reality could strike you hard.)

92
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,286
(Who does she love?)

93
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:54,255
(When did she fall for him?)

94
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:56,123
(Since when have you been loved?)

95
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,125
(All these are bloody cruel.)

96
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,260
Zhou Shu Yi.

97
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,631
I've finally found you.

98
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,600
Did you forget
we're supposed to have lunch together?

99
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,370
You have lunch with him?

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,441
Come on.

101
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,608
I have classes in the afternoon.

102
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,210
Let's go.

103
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:15,943
Bye-bye.

104
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,446
When did they become so close?

105
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:21,515
No idea.

106
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,685
Is he up to any prank again?

107
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:25,653
Why don't you stop him?

108
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,188
You know him well.

109
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,656
He looks like he doesn't care much,

110
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,260
but he always keeps things to himself.

111
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,561
Yeah.

112
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,130
I wonder who will change him.

113
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:38,966
Let go!

114
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:41,601
Why do you grab me?

115
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:44,171
Will you come with me if I don't?

116
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,006
Did you know how you look just now?

117
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,643
Do you want them to find out
that you love her?

118
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,911
So what if they find out?

119
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:52,546
Yeah.

120
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,781
Then why did you hide and cry?

121
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,783
Even jumped into the swimming pool.

122
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,051
Excuse me?

123
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:03,958
Zheng Wen is an idiot.

124
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,761
Yu Xin is a fool!

125
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:10,431
Both of them are idiots!

126
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,801
I tried so hard.

127
00:07:15,403 --> 00:07:17,005
Why do you do this to me?

128
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:21,710
What do you want?

129
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,478
Do you want to show them?

130
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:24,145
Bastard!

131
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,346
I could have done that just now.

132
00:07:26,748 --> 00:07:27,781
What do you want?

133
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,850
Why do you follow me all the time?

134
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,018
Don't you have anything else to do?

135
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:31,618
What do I want?

136
00:07:35,156 --> 00:07:36,490
Recently,

137
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,891
I need a page boy.

138
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,560
What about this?

139
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:41,963
You take the job.

140
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,230
You have to be on-call

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,365
and obey me.

142
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,135
Why should I?

143
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,303
Well...

144
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,973
Go on.

145
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,343
Do you think I'll be scared?

146
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:58,211
Cool.

147
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,691
How long?

148
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,226
Not forever, right?

149
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,463
Do you want to be in college forever?

150
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,265
How dare you curse me!

151
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:19,800
How long?

152
00:08:22,003 --> 00:08:23,203
Until we graduate.

153
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,973
Will I be paroled?

154
00:08:27,108 --> 00:08:28,443
Even prisoners have that.

155
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,045
What are your conditions for a parole?

156
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,715
Alright.

157
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,818
If you beat me once,

158
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,085
you'll be free.

159
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:42,023
Anything will do?

160
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:42,990
Anything.

161
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,593
Let's wait and see.

162
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:47,495
I'll defeat you hard.

163
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,363
You'll admit that you are inferior to me.

164
00:08:57,105 --> 00:08:59,206
I'll send you my class schedule and the venues.

165
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,341
Tomorrow morning, 8 AM. Downstairs of my house!

166
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:03,043
If you're late...

167
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:03,778
I see!

168
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:41,716
Sit in the front.

169
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,283
I'm used to taking the MRT.

170
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,553
I'm used to sitting in a car.

171
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,823
Cool.

172
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,235
Are you satisfied?

173
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,470
It's all your fault.

174
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,971
You'd be late for the first class.

175
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,640
You don't have class until two in the afternoon.

176
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,346
I have your class schedule.

177
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,150
Got my class schedule to pull pranks on me?

178
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:17,718
Scheming boy.

179
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:20,755
Let's go.

180
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,590
My class is at 10 AM.

181
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,926
Why do we have to meet at eight, then?

182
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,263
For breakfast.

183
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,301
I have to accompany you in class.

184
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,470
Now breakfast as well?

185
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,538
Come on, we're running late.

186
00:10:37,538 --> 00:10:38,540
Stay close.

187
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:41,375
OK, students, today we

188
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,410
are going to talk about

189
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,813
what information technology

190
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,181
can be applied to increase

191
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,583
the overall market liquidity.

192
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,586
In fact, through information digging,

193
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,355
we can provide customers with the most

194
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,990
complete, correct, direct, and

195
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,360
effective communication module.

196
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,395
First of all, we can find out

197
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:02,796
what kinds of customers

198
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,965
we are facing

199
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:09,936
through overall logical analysis.

200
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,173
We can use big data

201
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:14,008
to get people to know...

202
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:20,581
Hey.

203
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,416
Wake him up.

204
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,785
It's embarrassed if the teacher sees it.

205
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:26,586
It's OK.

206
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:28,656
No.

207
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:31,726
He's from Department of Economics and Management.
Why is he here?

208
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,728
And he's sitting next to you.

209
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,796
What does he want?

210
00:11:35,796 --> 00:11:36,630
Shh!

211
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:39,500
Concentrate.

212
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,151
After we return the books,

213
00:11:58,151 --> 00:11:59,353
let's grab something to eat.

214
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,155
Alright, alright.

215
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:03,156
There are two more classes in the afternoon.

216
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,926
I'd be free between the two classes.

217
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:06,795
Gao Shi De.

218
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,463
I'm so hungry.

219
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,065
Let's have lunch first.

220
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:13,901
Hurry.

221
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,003
I'm so hungry.

222
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,105
Hey.

223
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,940
How come it's your call?

224
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,281
What are you doing?

225
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:30,018
My feet hurts.

226
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,171
How long do you have to hide from her?

227
00:13:00,315 --> 00:13:01,381
If you keep doing this,

228
00:13:01,683 --> 00:13:02,983
they will find out.

229
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:04,851
I know.

230
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,786
But...

231
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,023
Seeing her still...

232
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,598
I'm sad. It's my problem.

233
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,233
If she knows about it,

234
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:21,736
we can't be friends anymore.

235
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,340
Idiot.

236
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,041
You're the idiot.

237
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,180
Why do I tell you this?

238
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,658
You have to face it

239
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,460
so you can let go.

240
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,396
Love is not commodity.

241
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,733
You can't put it back to the shelf
when  you don't like it.

242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,103
Only the inexperienced people would say this.

243
00:13:58,873 --> 00:13:59,706
I'm not inexperienced.

244
00:14:00,341 --> 00:14:01,175
Really?

245
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,311
Is it Zhe Yu?

246
00:14:05,646 --> 00:14:06,480
Idiot.

247
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:07,781
Huh?

248
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:10,018
Are you scolding me, Gao Shi De?

249
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,375
You're so smart.

250
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:43,310
You're so smart..

251
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,781
You sneak into the enemy's camp to spy on them.

252
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:49,483
How is it going?

253
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,318
Did you find any of his weak point

254
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:51,218
that helps us teach Gao Shi De a lesson?

255
00:15:51,218 --> 00:15:53,621
Leave it. I'm quite busy.

256
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,888
Why are you with Zhou Shu Yi

257
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,725
all the time recently?

258
00:15:57,358 --> 00:15:58,560
What happened?

259
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:00,928
Right?

260
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:02,363
Yeah.

261
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:05,466
Shi De.

262
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:15,643
What are you doing?

263
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,745
I don't want to eat so much meat.

264
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,385
I want it, too.

265
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,823
What?

266
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:33,861
I don't want yours.

267
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,796
All you know are eating and sleeping.

268
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,331
If you sit on our class again,

269
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,201
take a seat in the back.

270
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:41,936
You might doze off

271
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:42,903
and influence me and Shi De.

272
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:46,073
Even so, Shu Yi would win over you.

273
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,241
I'm talking to him. Why did you interrupt?

274
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,043
So what?

275
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:52,046
With the criteria of logical judgment,

276
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,415
analyze customers' preference, purchasing time,

277
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:55,616
properties of the purchased goods

278
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,986
to find out whether they are married
and their social status.

279
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,655
From that, we can tell
the related products they like.

280
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,293
Some people can learn even when they are asleep,

281
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,361
such as me.

282
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,266
You still lose to Shi De all the time.

283
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,636
Zhou Shu Yi  didn't lose.

284
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,238
He lost to Shi De on purpose.

285
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:20,275
It doesn't sound any better.

286
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:23,478
I did lose.

287
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:25,046
I won't deny it.

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,450
You are quite honest, though.

289
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,886
No empty seats?

290
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:35,256
Over there.

291
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:38,291
I'm leaving.

292
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,160
I'll wait for you outside.

293
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,195
I haven't finished yet.

294
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,663
Not you.

295
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,698
Shi De.

296
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:47,501
Stop looking at me.

297
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,076
You've decided not to mess with
Gao Shi De.

298
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,978
You two are good friends now?

299
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,280
No way.

300
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:01,548
I have to.

301
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:03,485
Why?

302
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:05,386
Anyway,

303
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,653
leave it.

304
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:07,688
Be quiet.

305
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:09,456
But

306
00:18:10,091 --> 00:18:10,825
you hate him so much.

307
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:12,426
Why are you so close to him now?

308
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,195
Don't ask,

309
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,430
or you'll be scared.

310
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:18,466
That scary?

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,601
Very!

312
00:18:27,075 --> 00:18:28,476
Not bad.

313
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,345
King of the game!

314
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:31,980
Thank you.

315
00:18:32,713 --> 00:18:33,481
Nice.

316
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,850
This is it!

317
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:37,785
Huh?

318
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:40,555
What?

319
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,550
(Taipei City Shi Lin Public Market)

320
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,330
That's what you want to compete?

321
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,498
I've thought it through.

322
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,900
We've competed in everything,

323
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,738
except games.

324
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,113
I thought...

325
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,048
you asked me out for a date.

326
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,616
No way.

327
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:10,718
Who's going to date you?

328
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,455
Tell me.

329
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:14,288
In or out.

330
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:26,728
I don't believe it!

331
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,063
Next one.

332
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:50,385
Thank you.

333
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:58,291
What's next?

334
00:20:58,726 --> 00:20:59,660
Next one is...

335
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,001
Zhou Shu Yi.

336
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,238
You have a class tomorrow morning at eight,
just go back.

337
00:21:11,806 --> 00:21:12,606
Damn it!

338
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,475
I'm really your page boy now.

339
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,270
(He fell asleep.)

340
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,571
(Go to hell!)

341
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:56,350
(A good chance to check his cell phone.)

342
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:02,890
(Wanna play with me?)

343
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,491
(You are too amateur for that.)

344
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,500
(Why isn't it in the bag?)

345
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,568
(Where will it be?)

346
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,440
(In his pocket.)

347
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,958
(Why is it so hard to get?)

348
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,628
(Almost there.)

349
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,701
(Shit!)

350
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,470
(What are you doing?)

351
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,671
(Let go of me!)

352
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,473
(Come on, let go!)

353
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:17,031
I'm sorry.

354
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,500
Shu Yi.

355
00:23:18,933 --> 00:23:21,068
Don't get angry.

356
00:23:21,435 --> 00:23:24,138
I thought you and Gao Shi De were together.

357
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:26,675
How is that possible?

358
00:23:26,675 --> 00:23:28,108
I told you!

359
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,243
But that day,

360
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:31,411
I saw you...

361
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,346
Bye.

362
00:23:33,681 --> 00:23:35,350
You have to face it.

363
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,516
So that you can let go.

364
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,753
Love is not commodity.

365
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,856
You can't put it back to the shelf
when you don't like it.

366
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,558
So I thought you two...

367
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,828
Even if you really are,

368
00:23:47,828 --> 00:23:48,896
it doesn't matter.

369
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:50,098
It's the modern age now.

370
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,266
Don't listen to her nonsense.

371
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,001
Listen.

372
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,236
I mean it.

373
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,171
Go after it if you like him.

374
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,806
Otherwise, he wouldn't know, right?

375
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,776
Take us for an example,

376
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:02,943
I am two years older than him.

377
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,311
But you need to tell him.

378
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,646
Be brave!

379
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:06,681
So I'm telling you,

380
00:24:06,681 --> 00:24:07,848
I will support you.

381
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:15,556
We have something else to do,

382
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:16,456
we shall leave.

383
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:21,763
They...

384
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,531
are...

385
00:24:23,531 --> 00:24:24,965
Are they really not a couple?

386
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,871
Have more meat.

387
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,711
Why do you make a spicy pot if you can't take it?

388
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:39,080
Cuz you like it.

389
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,116
How do you know that?

390
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:46,253
I know you too well.

391
00:24:51,191 --> 00:24:52,360
Thank you...

392
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:53,861
for just now.

393
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,736
If you didn't take me away,

394
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,205
they'd probably know it.

395
00:25:06,941 --> 00:25:08,141
That's how she's always been.

396
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:09,610
She never knows what's going on.

397
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,911
A bit bossy, too.

398
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:19,320
Only Zheng Wen can stand her.

399
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:22,590
They are a perfect couple.

400
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,331
Is the shrimp ready?

401
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:31,833
Yes.

402
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,146
It seems that you don't care

403
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:48,883
so much about Jiang Yu Xin now.

404
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,185
Agree.

405
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:53,186
Thanks.

406
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,696
Actually,

407
00:26:02,496 --> 00:26:03,631
it's even sadder

408
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,833
when you don't even

409
00:26:06,868 --> 00:26:08,703
have a chance to fight for your love.

410
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,705
It ends before

411
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,240
it starts.

412
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:15,776
If your beloved one likes others,

413
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:16,711
what would you do?

414
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:20,648
Me?

415
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:27,855
I will

416
00:26:28,523 --> 00:26:30,091
try to separate them

417
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,060
and take advantage of it.

418
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,998
Are you kidding me?

419
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:41,970
Yes, I am.

420
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:03,256
Gao Shi De.

421
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,226
Would you allow your page boy

422
00:27:05,526 --> 00:27:06,660
to take a leave?

423
00:27:11,498 --> 00:27:12,566
Where are we going?

424
00:27:12,566 --> 00:27:13,668
Aren't you going to have a class?

425
00:27:13,668 --> 00:27:14,601
Slow down.

426
00:27:15,036 --> 00:27:16,170
Slow down.

427
00:27:24,011 --> 00:27:25,646
Do you want to die?

428
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,151
This week, take light and oil-free food only.

429
00:27:32,486 --> 00:27:33,888
But if you want to die,

430
00:27:35,023 --> 00:27:36,290
have more spicy hotpot.

431
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,203
(Next episode)
Do you like Yu Xin, too?

432
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:50,738
Will you give Yu Xin to me?

433
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:52,406
I thought you skipped classes for him

434
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:53,441
so you can

435
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:54,408
make him fall for you.

436
00:27:58,646 --> 00:27:59,513
You...

437
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:00,648
You like me?

438
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:01,950
You scared me!

439
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,183
Follow me.

440
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,153
