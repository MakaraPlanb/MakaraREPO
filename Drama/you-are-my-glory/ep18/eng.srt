Slowly.

Are the antenna and equipment

27

to six meters ahead of it.

42
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,280

Yu Tu,

58
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,120
ever since I came to the testing ground,

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,519
my belly is getting bigger.

60
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,839
Noodles can make people fat.

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,680
Mr. Zhou.

62
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,439
Are you taking the car

63
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,319
just to get the noodles?

64
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,120
Wait for me!

65
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,399
Hurry up, drive.

66
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,279
I'll order some noodles for you.

67
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,120
It seems like

68
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,439
we should organize

69
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,399
some weight management classes
on the side.

70
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,600
How is

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,639
Doctor Guan holding up?

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,240
The surgery was a success.

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,879
I visited him before I came here.

74
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,120
He's in good spirit.

75
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,319
Good.

76
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,120
Without him at the base,

77
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,839
things are a little less fun.

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,720
Our beloved Doctor Guan

79
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,639
is intelligent beyond measure
and highly professional.

80
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,600
He can hold his liquor and boast.

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,120
He brings people joy.

82
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,600
He's all-rounder.

83
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,399
I'll pass your compliments to him.

84
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,240
That won't be necessary.

85
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,560
I've already

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
express my respect for him

87
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
in person.

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,040
Yu Tu.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,800
You should hang out

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
with co-workers after work.

91
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,639
Don't give yourself too much stress.

92
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,920
Our field test went well.

93
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,279
One must

94
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,240
be serious with his work.

95
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,040
But one also needs to relax.

96
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,199
Don't make your life
during the field test

97
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,439
a time of hardship.

98
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,319
Every night,

99
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,560
the workers

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,759
partake in ping-pong, photography,

101
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,720
and some card games.

102
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,360
You should join them.

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,319
Sure.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,279
It works.

105
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,079
Have a look.

106
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay.

107
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,759
Yu Tu!

108
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:32,800
Would you

109
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,040
like to join us?

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,839
You won't get

111
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,439
a clearer sky in the city.

112
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,120
We were looking for you.

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,519
It's the "Jade Rabbit".

114
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,639
It is similarly to the pronunciation
of your name.

115
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,879
I know you have a telescope,

116
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,959
but how can you know where it is?

117
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,360
I mean the general location.

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
Don't take it so seriously.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
It's 203 mm.

120
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,680
Who brought this?

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,839
It belongs to Mr. Li.

122
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:14,959
The Jade Rabbit

123
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,600
landed in Sinus Iridum.

124
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:17,920
Do you have

125
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,279
a lens with a higher power?

126
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,120
That's the biggest zoom we get.

127
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,680
Let me have a look.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,319
Our poor Rabbit

129
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,519
is all alone

130
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,240
on the Moon.

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,839
Let me see it.

132
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,319
(A saying just crossed my mind.)

133
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,279
(It suits you.)

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,160
(What is it?)

135
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,079
(But)

136
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,879
(you're already the Rabbit)

137
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,600
(who's seen the most stars.)

138
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,319
Yu Tu.

139
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,199
Where is Mercury?

140
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Can we see it this month?

141
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:16,959
I think so.

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,720
However,

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,800
its observation window is smaller.

144
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,199
It's a little too late.

145
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,519
An hour after sunset

146
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,800
is usually the best window to observe it.

147
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,000
It's about

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,120
at this location.

149
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,120
We can try again tomorrow.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
- Okay?
- Sure.

151
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:48,759
Enjoy your stargazing.

152
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:49,879
I have to go now.

153
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,559
(A saying just crossed my mind.)

154
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,480
(Jingjing)
(It suits you.)

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,360
(What is it?)

156
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,320
(But)

157
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
(you're already the Rabbit)

158
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,840
(who's seen the most stars.)

159
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,519
Your words almost got to me.

160
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:17,519
How could you say

161
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,759
you had achieved nothing at all?

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,159
Even if you

163
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,240
gave up your career

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,360
to start over,

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,639
what you've done with your life

166
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,720
remains as your memory.

167
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,360
I'm not sure

168
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,600
what you did exactly,

169
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,519
but it must have been meaningful.

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,879
So even if you choose

171
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
a different job,

172
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,679
don't deny your past achievements.

173
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,320
At least

174
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,279
you once fought

175
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,559
to pursue your dream.

176
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,919
It's better than not trying at all.

177
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,600
I don't think

178
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
it's a mistake.

179
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:56,620
(Chatting history with Jingjing)

180
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,480
(I was chilling and
watching live streams.)

181
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,080
(I found this funny streamer.)

182
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,440
(You can watch it on the road.)

183
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,960
(Watch videos of streamers
who focus on techniques.)

184
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,399
(I already have one)

185
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,000
(during the daytime.)

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,399
(He is skilled and brilliant.)

187
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,799
(He's strict with everything.)

188
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,799
(I'm flattered.)

189
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,440
(I accept the first part,)

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,279
(but I'm not that strict.)

191
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
(Do you want me to be?)

192
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,600
(Never mind.)

193
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,120
(You're good enough as it is.)

194
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,559
Where are you now?

195
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,840
I have a craving for youtiao.

196
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,039
Could you get me some?

197
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,279
What about the calories?

198
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,840
I'll only eat half of it.

199
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,200
There is also the shorter variant.

200
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,039
Yu Tu.

201
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,799
Are you texting your girlfriend?

202
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,200
If you're sitting out here,

203
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
it must be serious.

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,039
I was about to go in.

205
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,080
I overheard that she wanted you

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,360
to bring her breakfast tomorrow.

207
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,120
Doesn't she know you're
in a desert?

208
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,480
Even if that's the case,

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,799
does she know you've been away?

210
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
These are old messages.

211
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,120
You must miss her a lot.

212
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
Yu Tu, Mr. Zhou.

213
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,759
Come on, I need your help.

214
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,919
The guys from our game

215
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,679
went calling their

216
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,120
girlfriends.

217
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,799
Come on, hurry up.

218
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,799
We were having a conversation.

219
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,519
Come with me.

220
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,820
(XS-2 Mission, Worker's pass, Yu Tu,
XS-2 Testing Team, General Engineer)

221
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,879
Telemetry malfunction.

222
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,000
(Finish Point)

223
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,440
It deviated from the track.

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,559
Navigation test, drive cycle three.

225
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,480
There's been a malfunction.

226
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,519
The rover deviated from the track.

227
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,519
Stop the test.

228
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,620
(Malfunction)

229
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,600
Mr. Li.

230
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,519
We don't know why it stopped.

231
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,919
Everyone,

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,039
analyze the possible causes.

233
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,399
This happened

234
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,320
on the testing ground.

235
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,799
We must resolve it immediately.

236
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,320
(XS-2 Rover's possible causes
of malfunction)

237
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,500
(XS-2 Rover, field test)

238
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,679
I remember it now.

239
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
I think the navigation software

240
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
didn't account for

241
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,360
the difference caused

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,679
sunlight's angle of incidence

243
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,000
under natural lighting.

244
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,840
Indeed.

245
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,919
The lighting at the testing ground

246
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,240
is different from that of

247
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,279
our indoor labs.

248
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,200
It's very likely so.

249
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,519
The difference causes

250
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,720
the visual system to miscalculate

251
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
during the recognition process.

252
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,679
How could we overlook that detail?

253
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,759
We must adjust the parameters

254
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,639
and update the algorithm.

255
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,039
For the time being,

256
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,240
this is likely the cause.

257
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Make use of the time
to run confirmation tests.

258
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,440
I think

259
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,519
we should all call it a day.

260
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,519
Dunhuang Weather Station

261
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,679
announced the weather forecast.

262
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,519
Later today,

263
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,679
there could be

264
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,799
some sand and dust storms.

265
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,279
Let's go to the shower together.

266
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,119
You didn't wait for me?

267
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,200
How could you?

268
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
Let's go.

269
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,239
I've never seen

270
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,119
a sand dust storm.

271
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:37,200
Later on,

272
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,840
we have to run

273
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,960
the sandbox test.

274
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,159
We could make use

275
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:40,960
of the sand dust storm

276
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,759
for the test.

277
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,720
Quantifiable condition,

278
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,600
analytic result,

279
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,479
repeatable measures.

280
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,560
Don't you know about these?

281
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
Of course I know.

282
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,040
Don't you have a sense of humor?

283
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,519
Stop talking, start showering.

284
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,040
Our friends are waiting for their turn.

285
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,119
Finish it in five minutes.

286
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:53,840
Let's have a card game later.

287
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,920
I want Yu Tu on my team.

288
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,560
Have some decency.

289
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,239
Yu Tu is from my dorm.

290
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,680
We even work in the same department.

291
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,239
You already won

292
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,320
a whole bag of my snacks.

293
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
At least let me win for once.

294
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:04,999
Have me on your team.

295
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,200
Don't bother Yu Tu.

296
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,960
His brain must be exhausted.

297
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,479
The card game is just tiring for him.

298
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,560
Don't be such a buzzkill.

299
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,399
How could you

300
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,479
be so mean?

301
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:13,080
You are

302
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
sidelining Yu Tu

303
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,040
simply because he is

304
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
good at the game?

305
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,239
There are only 108 cards

306
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,920
in the deck.

307
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,399
Don't mock my intelligence.

308
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,879
But I'll pass tonight.

309
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,840
All the snacks Mr. Zhou won

310
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,239
were given to the ladies.

311
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:28,840
I don't want to help his evil cause.

312
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,399
You betrayed me!

313
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
When you gave them

314
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,920
all the snacks

315
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,479
and left me

316
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,840
with nothing for my effort,

317
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,800
you should have seen this coming.

318
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,200
Well you have a girlfriend,

319
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,999
I don't want to sabotage
your relationship.

320
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,600
Mr. Zhou.

321
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,960
You can't fool us with that.

322
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,840
Yu Tu may be handsome and smart,

323
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,560
but he is just

324
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,239
another single man.

325
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:45,920
He has no girlfriend.

326
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Don't be silly.

327
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,920
You're still single.

328
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,440
But Yu Tu has a girlfriend.

329
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,759
I saw it some days ago.

330
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,440
His girlfriend was sending him
voice messages.

331
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,159
She even asked him

332
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,040
to get her breakfast.

333
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,239
Breakfast?

334
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,600
No way.

335
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,279
He has his breakfast at the cafeteria.

336
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,680
Is your girlfriend

337
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,560
one of our co-workers?

338
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,320
Is your girlfriend

339
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,359
really one of our co-workers?

340
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Get on with it.

341
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,879
People are waiting.

342
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,900
(Qiao Jingjing)

343
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:13,320
(Qiao Jingjing)

344
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,240
Hello?

345
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:34,240
Is everything going well over there?

346
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:37,159
We ran into some minor issues.

347
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,560
But we resolved them.

348
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,480
We should be able

349
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,719
to finish sooner than we expected.

350
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,679
So why would

351
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,679
Mr. Li complain to me?

352
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,199
Is something wrong?

353
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:49,760
Don't you know?

354
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,719
Mr. Li

355
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,520
is a strict and lively person.

356
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,040
He wants to know everything
about the project.

357
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,600
He's also worried

358
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,639
about the happiness

359
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,199
of his subordinates.

360
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,159
He was

361
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:01,280
planning to fix the boy up

362
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,919
with one of the ladies

363
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,119
from other institutes.

364
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,359
But as it turned out,

365
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,679
you've been acting

366
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,760
melancholic all the time.

367
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
You always stargaze all alone.

368
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,199
You don't socialize after work.

369
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,199
A bunch of young and innocent girls

370
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,159
are mesmerized by your charm.

371
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:22,480
You decimated the chances

372
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,040
of your comrades.

373
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
Yu Tu,

374
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm pretty sure

375
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,359
you didn't have this habit back then.

376
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:31,679
I've been winning games for days.

377
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,879
They kicked me out of the card game.

378
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:35,159
That sounds like

379
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,679
you're acting too cool.

380
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,959
If you're acting cool
when you're handsome,

381
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,959
the other gentlemen will have
no chances at all.

382
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,480
I'm calling you right now

383
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,240
to give you a warning.

384
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,480
You must keep

385
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,639
acting cool.

386
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:57,159
It's all right.

387
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,959
Trust me.

388
00:19:58,959 --> 00:19:59,760
Do not

389
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,240
leave the other guys

390
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,399
with any glimmer of hope.

391
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,480
When the time comes,

392
00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:05,719
you will earn the title
as the institute trademark.

393
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,280
Is your wife there?

394
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,399
Let me talk to her.

395
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,000
Hello?

396
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,639
How is

397
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,480
Guan Zhai?

398
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,679
He's doing well.

399
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,480
His recovery is better

400
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,560
than expected.

401
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:27,399
Hey...

402
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,119
You...

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,520
Don't be so nosy.

404
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,719
You know nothing.

405
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,159
Tell me,

406
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,040
Mr. Li called me

407
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,119
to see if

408
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,240
you have a girlfriend.

409
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,800
What should I tell him now?

410
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,159
I could just be honest with him

411
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,719
and tell him you're in love

412
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,760
with your high school sweetheart
Qiao Jingjing.

413
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:58,359
Listen up.

414
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,199
There is a video of you

415
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,439
gaming with Qiao Jingjing

416
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,000
in the group chat.

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,399
Everyone knows

418
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:06,080
she was your classmate.

419
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,000
I pondered on it a little.

420
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,520
She was

421
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,600
the girl you kept bringing up

422
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,359
back in Xi'an.

423
00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:13,399
And you were saying

424
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,520
she had a crush on you.

425
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,040
But judging by that video,

426
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,879
I think

427
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,879
she has

428
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:19,199
some special feelings for you.

429
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,760
So why are you still single?

430
00:21:28,439 --> 00:21:29,639
I've been thinking.

431
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,600
What can I possibly give her?

432
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,359
I get no dough.

433
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,520
I can't even...

434
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,600
keep her company.

435
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,719
Yu.

436
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,639
According to my wife,

437
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,600
that's not how it works.

438
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,199
Are you a fool or what?

439
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:29,760
You're right.

440
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:31,959
What?

441
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,959
You finally admitted it.

442
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:36,280
Have you come to your senses?

443
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,919
Objective facts are always true.

444
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,000
They are not a realization.

445
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,320
Indeed...

446
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,280
I couldn't handle it.

447
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:31,140
(Starting Point)

448
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,720
(Finish Point)

449
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,080
Run some tests.

450
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:36,439
Pick up the spirit.

451
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,359
Our job will be done

452
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,480
in a few days.

453
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,080
I hereby announce

454
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,760
all rover functions

455
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,000
have reached the expected level.

456
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,879
The field test is a complete success!

457
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:05,879
Yes!

458
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,679
Let's take a picture together.

459
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,080
Over here!

460
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,959
Come on.

461
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,320
Come on, everyone.

462
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,159
Hurry up!

463
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:13,879
Let's go.

464
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:16,679
Three,

465
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:17,439
two,

466
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:18,040
one.

467
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,560
We will conquer

468
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,959
the endless cosmos!

469
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,480
Try it out.

470
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Have some drink.

471
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,639
Enjoy.

472
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:43,600
We'll make plans

473
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,879
after we're back in Beijing.

474
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:45,719
I'll hold you to it.

475
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:46,719
Don't go back on your words.

476
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,600
Sure, you have my words.

477
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,760
Mr. Li.

478
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,600
The roasted mutton is ready!

479
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,719
Have some mutton!

480
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:56,919
Let's go.

481
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:58,719
Come and try it out.

482
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,000
Hurry up!

483
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,800
Everyone is enjoying it.

484
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,040
Mr. Li.

485
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,719
Roasted mutton. Almost ready.

486
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,359
Yeah, Mr. Li. You should try it.

487
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,199
Mr. Li is here.

488
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,159
Let's have a toast.

489
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,480
Yeah!

490
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,320
Well done.

491
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,159
Cheers!

492

493

494
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,520
Now! Cheers!

496

00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:05,919
Everyone,

544
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
our meeting today

545
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,159
is about

546
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:10,480
the modifications to Project "Uno."

547
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,000
I'd like to have

548
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,959
your opinions on the matter.

549
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,159
Before the field test,

550
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,600
I visited Mr. Guan at the hospital.

551
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:21,719
I asked him

552
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,159
to give this project a proper name.

553
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,119
It's called...

554
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,879
the "Search for God."

555

(SK-1 Deep Space Probe,
General Solution, Base 158)

556
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,000
In the seemingly endless cosmos,

557
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,159
we search for the truth

558
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,520
of human and Earth's origins.

559
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:45,000
In this infinite time and space,

560
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,760
we search for the existence

561
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,280
of another God's miraculous work.

562
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:50,480
Its duty is to prove
that we're not alone

563
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,679
in this world.

564
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
I wasn't paraphrasing.

565
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,040
I think

566
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,159
it was the goal of our toiling.

you cared for Uno...

00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:14,679
I mean, Search For God.

572

He's been working on this

573
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,959
to the point he didn't socialize.

574
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,240
But whom did you

575
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
learn that tone from during the testing?

576
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,959
Haven't you noticed it?

577
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,480
"Keep up the good work."

578
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:27,399
You sounded just like

579
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,159
my high school teacher.

580
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,520
That sent a chill down my spine.

581
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,860
(To Jingjing: There was
a blizzard at the South)

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,439
Yu Tu.

585
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,760
Are you sending a letter?

586
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:20,240
You're old-fashioned.

587
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,000
Doctor Zhao.

588
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,560
Good morning.

589
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,280
Good morning.

(Beijing)

591
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,879
It's heavy snow in Beijing.

592
00:32:45,879 --> 00:32:46,480
It started snowing

593
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,639
in Shanghai a few days ago.

594
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,240
Over here!

595
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,560
The Star Award is over.

596
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,800
Wait for a little.

597
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,480
The company is
throwing a cocktail party.

598
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,399
The director and screenplay

599
00:32:57,399 --> 00:32:59,000
of your next drama are there.

600
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,800
You should meet them

601
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,840
at the party.

602
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,199
Okay.

603
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,199
I'll head over there
after I get changed.

605

I'm counting on you, Mr. Zhang.

606
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,159
I'm flattered.

607
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:13,919
We are

608
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,199
counting on Jingjing.

609
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:16,439
Her great performance

610
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,560
pulls in the audience.

611
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,879
Congratulations, Jingjing.

612
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,119
The film draws well.

613
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,080
Thanks.

614
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,719
Weren't you investing in the project?

615
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,320
Just a little.

616
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,600
It was only for the joy.

617
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,679
