00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,000
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:39,680
I'll pick the loadout

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,079
set by the system.

5
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:41,959
I pick whatever shows up

6
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,879
on the left side.

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,000
I know.

8
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,439
A Mage's loadout

9
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,519
is usually very conventional.

10
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,120
Take Wang Zhaojun for an example.

11
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,680
If

12
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
your opponent is playing as Cai Wenji,

13
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,439
you may buy the Nightmare Fang

14
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,719
based on the situation.

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
What for?

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,159
To suppress health regeneration.

17
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,560
Also,

18
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,040
there is an issue

19
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,400
you should know.

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,760
What is it?

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,439
When you play as a support,

22
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,079
don't upgrade to Tier Three
Support Item.

23
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
What is a Tier Three Support Item?

24
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,960
Who taught you how to play?

25
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,159
You said you were a beginner.

26
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,719
How do you know so much about it?

27
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:21,840
You don't need researches.

28
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,159
I learned by playing a few matches.

29
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,080
These are the basics.

30
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,080
It's getting late.

31
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
I'll see you off here.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,319
See you tomorrow.

33
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:38,199
Come over tomorrow at 9 am.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,879
As you know,

35
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,520
it's not easy for me to go out.

36
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Sure.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,879
See you.

38
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,879
Bye.

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,159
Xiao Zhu!

40
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,039
One of my teenage dreams

41
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,680
just came true.

42
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,800
What was it?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,599
The genius taught me maths!

44
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,120
Hello?

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,039
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

46
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:24,840
How was it?

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,800
Is Jingjing back yet?

48
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,879
Did he agree?

49
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,520
He did,

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,520
but...

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,800
Did something go wrong?

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
I think they are having...

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
maths lessons.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Seriously?

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,599
He's back.

56
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,319
Relax.

57
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,919
Why is it taking so long?

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
I missed the train
and had to use the other subway line.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,080
Save me!

60
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
I couldn't save you.

61
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,000
Yu Tu.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,479
Did you fix the air purifier?

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,960
Ask Ms. Qiao.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,360
Cotton.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,599
It's up to her.

66
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,080
I have something

67
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,959
What kind of answer is that?

69
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,800
Aren't you joining us?

70
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,040
I have something

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,639
I'm sure not if I should say.

72
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,680
I'm busy. I can't join you.

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,439
He started acting weird

74
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,000
after going to Cotton's home.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,360
Cotton.

76
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,040
Is your air purifier

77
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,879
fixed or not?

78
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:41,680
Yes.

79
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,439
Master Yu Tu

80
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,600
was amazing.

81
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,240
You live with him,

82
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,120
are you his colleague?

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,800
No.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
We studied in college together.

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,879
I just quit my job.

86
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,439
The rental contract just ended.

87
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,160
So I moved out.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,240
I'm staying with him
while transitioning.

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,000
Only a handful of people

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
of our age

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,600
are still single.

92
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,000
Cotton.

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
Were you surprised

94
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,600
when you met

95
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,920
the mighty Jade Rabbit God?

96
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:09,959
He is great at the game,

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,920
but also strikingly handsome.

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,480
Not bad.

99
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:30,519
Come again?

100
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,680
If he's only mediocre to your eyes,

101
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,680
you're setting a high bar, Cotton.

102
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,800
You just stole my kill!

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,480
Who taught you that?

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,319
A professional tournament?

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,519
When did you start dabbling in this?

106
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,680
I think...

107
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,600
it started with a whim.

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
Do you think Cotton...

109
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,000
look pretty?

110
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
You can see her picture everywhere.

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,800
Don't be so mean.

112
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,839
You can't

113
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,040
be so harsh on her.

114
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,680
I was honest.

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,360
Fine.

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,839
She thinks you look...

117
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,920
mediocre.

118
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,360
Normal.

119
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,800
Mr. Zhai.

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
Please stop bothering me.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,160
Carry on. I'm hitting the sack.

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,839
Close the door.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,279
Get out.

124
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Then, close the door.

125
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,160
Good night.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,839
(Do you trust me?)

127
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,360
(You're my classmate.)

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,879
It's only 2 am.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
(I missed the trained and had to
use the other subway line.)

130
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
(Order the driver to pick up Yu Tu.)

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,320
(That doesn't seem adequate.)

132
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,559
(Right.)

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,799
(I forgot to ask for Yu Tu's WeChat.)

134
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,480
(Jingjing, what was the message
you retracted?)

135
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,480
(Did you need me to do something?)

136
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,480
(Did you have a stomachache?)

137
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,879
(Bring me two sets of breakfast.)

138
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,159
(Hold on.)

139
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,759
(You don't need to
come here this morning.)

140
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,720
(Rabbit God, bring me my breakfast.)

141
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:57,679
Hi.

142
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,720
I bought you some.

143
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:02,960
Thanks.

144
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,039
Come in.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,399
The slippers are behind you.

146
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,039
Can we even finish all of this?

147
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,080
I had my breakfast.

148
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,559
This is all for me?

149
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
Do you think

150
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,320
all celebrities eat so much?

151
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I don't know what you like,

152
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,440
so I bought everything.

153
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,000
Then we could have
the leftover for lunch.

154
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,679
I won't need Xiao Zhu to send me lunch.

155
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Right.

156
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:47,440
Well...

157
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
I can't go out.

158
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,159
So Xiao Zhu will send me

159
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,639
my lunch and dinner here.

160
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
Is that okay with you?

161
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,919
Dinner?

162
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,559
Yes.

163
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
So my working hour

164
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,440
will end at...

165
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
It's 9 pm.

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,759
Okay.

167
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,320
As long as your hand is fine.

168
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,399
Did you finish it?

169
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

170
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,320
You brought your laptop.

171
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,440
Who taught you how to play?

172
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,679
My manager's husband.

173
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,720
Did he teach you how to play

174
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,639
as Cai Wenji and Sun Di?

175
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,519
Yes.

176
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,720
He thought I would do better

177
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,679
as a Support.

178
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,559
But after I played

179
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,559
with you and your friend,

180
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,720
I think I play better

181
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,759
with Wang Zhaojun.

182
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,799
Have you watched a pro match before?

183
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,039
Watch this.

184
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,960
What do you think?

185
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,320
(He actually asked for a report.)

186
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,519
They didn't die as many times.

187
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:38,960
Unlike we,

188
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,159
we die a lot.

189
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,480
They are aware of the damages

190
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
they take.

191
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:43,799
Can they win?

192
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Is the fight worth it?

193
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,480
They don't start team fights recklessly.

194
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,320
Have you noticed

195
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,120
how You Yu from Team Luo Shen played?

196
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,919
The guy who used Zhang Fei
in the first round?

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,320
The commentator

198
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,559
mentioned his name a lot.

199
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,879
In the last team fight,

200
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,440
he played a decisive role.

201
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,559
He was the MVP

202
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,360
of that round.

203
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,919
Support

204
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,039
plays an important role.

205
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,080
Sometimes

206
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
it acts as the commander.

207
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,639
Guo,

208
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
the husband of my manager,

209
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,919
he said Support was easier to play with.

210
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,080
So he was wrong.

211
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,200
I can see

212
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
you're at Gold rank.

213
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,960
You got it yourself?

214
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,840
I was even the MVP

215
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,759
for a few matches.

216
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,399
Try playing with my account.

217
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,879
carry on.

218
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,480
You could play well in Gold rank.

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
But you don't do well in Diamond rank.

220
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,279
The tournament you'll join

221
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
has pro players in it.

222
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,279
The difficulty will be even greater.

223
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:23,559
I didn't know

224
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,720
the challenge you might face.

225
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:25,360
That was

226
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,879
why you thought using
Wang Zhaojun was good.

227
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
The truth is,

228
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,120
this is far from enough

229
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,600
to face the challenge that awaits.

230
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,639
What should I do now?

231
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,399
There is one month left.

232
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:38,600
Become the best

233
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,159
with your own strength.

234
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,480
I think I can do it.

235
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,720
Should we start playing
ranked matches now?

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,519
No.

237
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,759
We'll do 1v1 matches.

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
After I went home last night,

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,480
I watched a few pro matches.

240
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,080
I have a general understanding

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
about the current sandbox of the game.

242
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,759
Up next,

243
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,080
we will practice with every hero

244
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,840
through our 1v1 matches.

245
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
You must remember their skills,

246
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,960
the cooldown of their ultimate moves,

247
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:29,799
damages,

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,200
and some fine maneuvers

249
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,759
with practice.

250
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,799
All of the heroes?

251
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
There must be over

252
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,759
100 heroes in this game.

253
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,960
So there aren't that many of them.

254
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:43,840
Yu Ji is the best Marksman

255
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,519
in the current sandbox.

256
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,759
She's easier to control.

257
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,080
Her specialty

258
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,519
is the second skill

259
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,759
that gives physical invulnerability

260
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,480
and speed boost.

261
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:52,240
That protects her from Assassins
with physical damages.

262
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,519
Donghuang Taiyi.

263
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,399
This Support suits you.

264
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,559
But you upgraded

265
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,240
the wrong skill.

266
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,759
You should upgrade the first skill.

267
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,120
I must stay strong.

268
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,799
I must stay strong.

269
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,399
Stop watching!

270
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,919
Get ready.

271
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,080
We'll practice with Xiao Qiao.

272
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,519
Jingjing!

273
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,360
I brought you dinner.

274
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,519
How did it go today?

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
Don't ask me

276
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,120
questions I can't answer.

277
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,519
Is there any meat?

278
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:05,400
I crave meat.

279
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,640
Hard-boiled chicken breast.

280
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,440
I want brased chicken.

281
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,759
I didn't prepare yours,

282
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,799
only Mr. Yu's portion.

283
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,519
We can't have meat at night.

284
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,119
Be good.

285
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,920
I'll do the dishes

286
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
after Mr. Yu left.

287
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
I should stay outside.

288
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,480
Practice well.

289
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,400
Be good.

290
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,759
Is it too much for you?

291
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,000
Never mind. Carry on.

292
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,240
I put on some weight lately.

293
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,640
This isn't fair.

294
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,920
Look. My level is too low.

295
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm below level 30.

296
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,079
The affinity bonus isn't full.

297
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,000
Yours is higher than mine.

298
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,400
Of course I couldn't beat you.

299
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,039
I barely have any.

300
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,400
Are you flexing with this?

301
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,720
My ranking is too low.

302
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,359
I see.

303
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,599
We've been at it all day.

304
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,079
Can you tell

305
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,599
which hero suits me the best?

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,759
We'll see after more practice.

307
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,039
You might as well tell me

308
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,240
more tortures are waiting for me.

309
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,839
Hold on!

310
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,920
Wait! No...

311
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,559
I died.

312
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,559
It's been two days,

313
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,440
why can I win just one round?

314
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
That's not what I mean.

315
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,839
Then you're asking too much.

316
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,519
Look at my scores.

317
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:07,880
Yeah.

318
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,440
You can only beat other players.

319
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,160
(I can only win against other players?)

320
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,240
(It's a fact,)

321
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,759
(but you are)

322
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:17,519
(too narcissistic.)

323
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,480
A solo match with other players?

324
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Do you think I can win?

325
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
If you can't,

326
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,480
then pass me your phone.

327
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:28,799
Here I go.

328
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,079
Did I win already?

329
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:52,920
Carry on.

330
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,960
Hurry up.

331
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,359
Can we make a comeback?

332
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,640
You died too many times just now.

333
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,839
You have less money and worse gear.

334
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't fight him head-on.

335
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,519
Run around and stall him.

336
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,119
Remember to clear the lane.

337
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,759
Don't let the creeps approach the tower.

338
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,680
Eat this!

339
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,519
Can you win against the wind?

340
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,559
This is your punishment!

341
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,160
(He made a comeback from
after falling so far behind.)

342
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
(Were you messing with me earlier?)

343
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,480
I told you.

344
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,880
Yu Ji's second skill

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,559
shields her from any physical damage.

346
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,079
But you didn't

347
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:56,960
time the skill well.

348
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,559
How about this?

349
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,960
I'll use the Assassin, you use Yu Ji.

350
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:00,880
We'll carry on.

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,599
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

352
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,200
Sorry, Mr. Yu.

353
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,160
Goodbye, Mr. Yu.

354
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,680
I saw Mr. Yu leave

355
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,720
while I was downstairs.

356
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,599
So I came up.

357
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,440
It took you

358
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,519
longer than usual today.

359
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Everything is already cleaned.

360
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,359
Didn't you tell Mr. Yu

361
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,680
I would clean the dishes?

362
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,480
I couldn't tell him.

363
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,400
He would have known

364
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,759
I was too lazy to do my chores.

365
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,519
Well, you need some cover.

366
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:50,319
How did it go today?

367
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,559
Not only did he teach me maths,

368
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,240
he played for me.

369
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,279
I mean, homework.

370
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,559
Homework?

371
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,279
After so many 1v1 matches,

372
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,440
you should understand

373
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,200
all the heroes

374
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,599
in this game.

375
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,359
Next, we'll practice with 3v3 matches.

376
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,119
But I'll be your opponent.

377
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,680
How can you be sure

378
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,920
you would be matched against me?

379
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,799
We can open a lobby in this game.

380
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,559
We each can have

381
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,200
two AI teammates.

382
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,440
I'll invite you over.

383
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

384
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,960
I need some rest.

385
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,119
See?

386
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,119
We've been playing with AI teammates

387
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,720
almost the whole day.

388
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,960
Let's not

389
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,599
get a lobby, okay?

390
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:58,599
Sure.

391
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,160
We should team up

392
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,279
and play against the others.

393
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:04,200
I'll allow you to go jungling

394
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,119
and skip team fights.

395
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,400
Let me get you some water.

396
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,359
Get in the team.

397
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:19,359
What about the break?

398
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,039
Forget about the break.

399
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,240
What for?

400
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,039
I need to win.

401
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,359
I've lost too many times against you.

402
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,200
Are you jungling with Zhang Fei?

403
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,319
I stole your pawn.

404
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:47,880
You learn fast.

405
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,359
Money is very important.

406
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,960
But do not be reckless to get it.

407
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,880
Don't delay your teammates' leveling.

408
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,000
A team fight.

409
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,039
My teammate is losing.

410
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,039
Why did you stop?

411
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
A phone call...

412
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:10,920
Aren't you answering?

413
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:11,960
Finish the game.

414
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,720
The creeps.

415
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:16,759
They got to the tower.

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,240
My tower!

417
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,519
I need to make a phone call.

418
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:34,759
Sure.

419
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,200
I need to go out.

420
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Continue your practice.

421
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,039
Is Xia Qing working in Shanghai too?

422
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,160
She should still be in Beijing.

423
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,680
(She should be?)

424
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,119
She should be in Beijing.

425
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,279
But there are things
we can't know for sure.

426
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,400
Is he going to

427
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,240
stop giving me lessons?

428
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,880
Miss, your Americano.

429
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,160
Should we serve the other drink

430
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,279
when your friend arrives?

431
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,039
Serve it now. He's here.

432
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
I order an Americano for you.

433
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,039
Are you on a business trip?

434
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,920
I am supposed to be in Hangzhou.

435
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,160
Why are you in Lujiazui?

436
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,640
I have work here.

437
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,960
I thought you had an interview here.

438
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,920
I had dinner

439
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,319
with Dragon King in Hangzhou.

440
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:06,720
He told me

441
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,279
you planned to resign
from graduate school.

442
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,640
Is that true?

443
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,160
I plan to do so.

444
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:17,920
But why?

445
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,400
You broke up with me

446
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,519
for your own pursuit,

447
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,799
but now you're giving up so easily.

448
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,519
I hope

449
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,559
you carry on with the work.

450
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:33,839
Otherwise,

451
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,559
it'd seem as though
I meant nothing to you.

452
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,359
You are willing to give up your pursuit.

453
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,920
It's just that I wasn't worth it.

454
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,640
Before we had the relationship,

455
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:49,960
you knew

456
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
what my goal was.

457
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,559
What was the saying again?

458
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:01,559
The most foolish fantasy
is the misconception...

459
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,279
that you could

460
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,440
change a person.

461
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,480
Are you still in QE?

462
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,240
I hopped to another job.

463
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,039
I'm now a marketing director.

464
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,160
My salary is far more handsome
than when I was

465
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,960
a fresh grad.

466
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,640
There are also more works to do.

467
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,839
You've always been outstanding.

468
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
But I'm tired.

469
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,079
I've been thinking.

470
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,119
Why should any woman

471
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:35,039
work herself to the bones?

472
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,480
Which field do you plan to work in?

473
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,119
From what I heard,

474
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,920
the DF headquarters in Beijing

475
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,079
gave you the job offer.

476
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,880
DF has been doing well.

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
We share the same office building.

478
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,279
I know them well enough.

479
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
If you need any help,

480
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:00,759
I could give you a free inquiry.

481
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,160
Thanks.

482
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,720
But I turned down the offer.

483
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,519
I see.

484
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,759
Look.

485
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,000
It's Qiao Jingjing.
