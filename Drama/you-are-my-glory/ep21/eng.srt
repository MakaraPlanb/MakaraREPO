13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 21=

14
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,480
It's been a long time
since I last saw the top student.

15
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,560
He's still as handsome as before.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,479
Tell me.

17
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,240
Why is his driving license

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,439
at the back seat

19
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,759
of your car?

20
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,280
What did you do

21
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,599
in the car?

22
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,840
We didn't do anything.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,759
I don't believe you.

24
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,080
I saw you playing

25
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
at the Honor of Kings match together.

26
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,560
I asked you about that too.

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
What did you tell me?

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,479
You said you met him in the game,

29
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,360
so you invited him
to watch the match together.

30
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,599
Look at what happened.

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,960
His driving license is

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
at the back seat of your car.

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,680
How did you get in touch?

34
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,800
I met him in the game.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,080
He played well.

36
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,319
So, I asked him to teach me.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,719
Then,

38
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,360
you met each other

39
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,840
in real life too.

40
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,039
Something like that.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,639
Because back then,

42
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,960
I couldn't play well.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,800
So,

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,599
he

45
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,479
came over

46
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,960
to teach me how to play.

47
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,080
So, were you alone?

48
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,919
There were Zhao Yun, Li Bai,
and Zhuge Liang.

49
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,000
Those Junglers don't count.

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
Zhuge Liang is the Mid.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
Qiao Jingjing.

52
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,199
Even if you're telling me

53
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,560
all the lame jokes,

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,120
you can't stop me

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,680
from being curious.

56
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:22,879
Then, what happened?

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,360
Are you dating?

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,319
Why didn't you tell me about that?

59
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
Think about it.

60
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,759
If I'm really dating him,

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,360
I won't be here

62
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
with you.

63
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,039
That makes sense.

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,800
For you, it's always dates before mates.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,199
But, you can't say it

66
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,719
as if it were the right thing to do.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,599
What I was saying is,

68
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,319
if I were really dating him,

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,919
I wouldn't come here alone.

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,400
I would surely bring along my plus-one.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,439
You're right.

72
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
Oh, no. Jingjing.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,199
(Class 5 Senior 3)
It seemed like

74
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,200
(Peipei, are you with Qiao Jingjing right now?)
someone took a photo of us.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,639
(Peipei, are you with Qiao Jingjing right now?)
They uploaded it to their Moments.

76
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,879
The photo has been circulated,

77
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,000
and even has been spread in our chatroom.

78
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,919
Look at this.

79
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,840
(Class 5 Senior 3)
When did they take this photo?

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,199
They are so good at this.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll just play dead.

82
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,079
But then again,

83
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,839
why did you

84
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,000
start playing Honor of Kings?

85
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,279
I saw you playing

86
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,439
and thought it was interesting.

87
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,439
And, I started playing.

88
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,240
Jingjing,

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,439
what account

90
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,879
are you using?

91
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,040
My main account is my QQ account.

92
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,480
I was busy last month.

93
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,560
So, I didn't get to play.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,839
If you want to play,

95
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll use my WeChat account
to coach you.

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,879
Sure.

97
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,639
All right.

98
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,759
Since

99
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,920
you're willing to coach me,

100
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,560
I won't

101
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
interrogate you anymore.

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,199
You're so secretive.

103
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,680
You won't tell me anything.

104
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,600
I know what you were trying to do.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
You were trying to change the subject.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,879
You're so mean.

107
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,560
This was really unexpected.

108
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,199
So many years have passed,

109
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,879
and you were still able
to get in touch with Yu Tu.

110
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,680
It must be fate.

111
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,120
I didn't expect that too.

112
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,079
Don't worry.

114
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,839
You shall do the talking.

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,120
This is hot.

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,279
Yu Tu.

117
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,240
Sit here.

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,279
I have something to tell you.

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,279
The young girl I mentioned

120
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,720
during the meal.

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,439
Don't you want to consider meeting her?

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,639
You haven't even seen her photos.

123
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,120
Take a look.

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,399
You should meet her.

125
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,000
Give yourself a chance.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
It won't waste much of your time.

127
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,160
Aunt,

128
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,000
there's no need for that.

129
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,720
I don't want to waste her time.

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,959
You guys carry on.

131
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,100
(Yu Tu)

132
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,700
(What time are you
coming back to Yixing?)

133
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,319
Yu Tu sent you

134
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,399
so many messages,

135
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,560
and you didn't reply at all.

136
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,279
There aren't many messages.

137
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,160
That's a lot.

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,720
What are you doing?

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
Concentrate on your game.

140
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm updating the app.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
Jingjing, you're so great.

142
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,160
You...

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,680
Can I have a look?

144
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,120
When I was

145
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,800
dating my husband,

146
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,319
I took

147
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:00,959
hundreds of screenshots

148
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,759
of our conversations and sent them to you.

149
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,000
I didn't ask for that.

150
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:03,839
You sent to me,

151
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,519
and took up

152
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,399
my phone's storage.

153
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,839
You're so mean.

154
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,000
But, anyway,

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
I feel rather pleased.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Have you ever seen

157
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
the top student behaving like this?

158
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,439
Jing,

159
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,600
how do you feel

160
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,639
about him?

161
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:22,319
If you have feelings for him,

162
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,319
don't keep him waiting.

163
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,240
The top student is a proud man.

164
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,399
I'm not keeping him waiting.

165
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,480
Jing.

166
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,199
Can you lend me

167
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,800
your Honor of Kings' account?

168
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,399
I want to try

169
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,839
playing as a high-level player.

170
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,160
Are you trying to fool the others?

171
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,120
I'm not.

172
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,000
I play quite well too.

173
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,079
Unfortunately,

174
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,879
I haven't got any ranking.

175
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:58,839
Please.

176
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,480
No.

177
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll get reported for that.

178
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:08,079
I really want to play
as a high-level player.

179
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,680
All right.

180
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,399
Here.

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
Pass it back if you're losing.

182
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,759
Okay. Got it.

183
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,639
You're the best.

184
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,319
(Can I defeat anyone?)

185
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,920
Pass it to me

186
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,279
if you're losing.

187
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,800
You have a cute nickname.

188
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,399
Hand-picked Cotton.

189
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,519
You...

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,679
(Win Rate: 81%)
You have such a high win rate.

191
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
You even have two Penta Kills.

192
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,559
That's so amazing.

193
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,720
What?

194
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Two Penta Kills.

195
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,080
Did you forget your own achievement?

196
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,340
(Penta Kill X2)

197
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,173
(Hand-picked Cotton: MVP)

198
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,440
(What do you want)

199
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,799
(for your birthday?)

200
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,360
(Give me a Penta Kill.)

201
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,519
(So far,)

202
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
(I haven't gotten a Penta Kill.)

203
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,480
(Ms. Qiao.)

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,519
(You're invited)

205
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,039
(to present the Best Toplaner Award.)

206
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay. I'll go now.

207
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,039
You go ahead.

208
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:07,919
I'll go now.

209
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,600
Thank you.

210
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,519
Jingjing, you've worked hard.

211
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
Jingjing.

212
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Jingjing.

213
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,440
What's wrong?

214
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,559
Peipei,

215
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
if a person

216
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,840
bid you goodbye,

217
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,559
but later prepared

218
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,039
a birthday present for you in secret,

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,279
what do you think that would imply?

220
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,559
That...

221
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,080
Perhaps,

222
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,960
he has his own reasons.

223
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,799
I don't want

224
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,879
to like someone

225
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
more than he likes me.

226
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,279
This is not a valid reason.

227
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,320
I don't like you less than you do to me.

228
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, you do.

229
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,039
You said that
were not meant for each other.

230
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,440
When you truly like someone,

231
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,799
you'll be reckless.

232
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,679
You won't hesitate.

233
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,279
You won't overthink.

234
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm probably different from you.

235
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,240
I thought too much.

236
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,399
(I've even thought about
the rest of my life.)

237
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,279
Jingjing.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,080
What's wrong with you?

239
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm just

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,360
a little sad.

241
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,200
Are our classmates gathering
at the karaoke?

242
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,780
(Li Ming)

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,639
Hey.

244
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
Hello, Yu Tu.

245
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,480
It's our high school reunion today.

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,799
We're gathering at the karaoke.

247
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,200
Do you want to join us?

248
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,399
You have fun.

249
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,759
I'll skip.

250
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,600
I knew it.

251
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,679
But, if you are free,

252
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,559
come join us.

253
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,440
Even Qiao Jingjing is coming.

254
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,360
What did you say?

255
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,360
Qiao Jingjing.

256
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,080
The superstar.

257
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:52,879
She said

258
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,159
she would be joining the reunion.

259
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,639
I'm going out.

260
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,480
Don't have to wait for me.

261
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,200
Where are you going?

262
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
I shouldn't have asked him.

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,080
The beautiful girl

264
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,120
must have asked him out again.

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,679
Jingjing.

266
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,480
Monitor said that

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
they had moved to a bigger room.

268
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,320
It's at B11 of Zone B.

269
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,000
It's here.

270
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,720
Is it that room?

271
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,960
We're here.

272
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,039
Let's go.

273
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:24,399
Peipei.

274
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,919
Superstar!

275
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,440
Keep it down.

276
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,480
What are you doing?

277
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
Friends.

278
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,159
Jingjing.

279
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:38,919
Let's drink.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,559
Jingjing.

281
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,159
Since we graduated from high school,

282
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,399
we haven't met each other.

283
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,399
I was so surprised

284
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,679
when I saw you on the screen.

285
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,159
I didn't expect my classmate

286
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,639
to become a superstar.

287
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,519
Isn't she pretty?

288
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,120
Jingjing.

289
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,840
My daughter

290
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,159
is a fan of yours.

291
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,440
You are a mother now.

292
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,600
She was the first one to get married

293
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,960
among our classmates.

294
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,000
Her husband

295
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
is right there.

296
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,480
Qiao Jingjing.

297
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
It's been a while.

298
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,320
So  you guys get married to each other?

299
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,240
I'm going to pick a song.

300
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,360
You go pick the songs.

301
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,639
I'll say a few words.

302
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,960
This year's reunion

303
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,039
is one of the rare chances

304
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,600
to have so many of us gathering together.

305
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,240
Am I right?

306
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,039
Yes.

307
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,039
Thanks to who?

308
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,159
Jingjing.

309
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,559
Thanks to Jingjing.

310
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,360
Let's see who's absent.

311
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,519
The two smart students

312
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,440
are not here, right?

313
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,720
I asked Xia Qing.

314
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,799
She went back to her hometown

315
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,200
to attend her family gathering.

316
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,039
What about Yu Tu?

317
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,799
Yu Tu is not here either.

318
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,799
I called Yu Tu.

319
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,200
He didn't check the chatroom.

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
I'm not sure if he'll come.

321
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,639
Then...

322
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,480
Jingjing,

323
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,639
aren't you and Yu Tu close?

324
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:01,799
Yes.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
We saw

326
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,000
the video of your playing gaming together.

327
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,919
He'll listen to you.

328
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,240
I'm sure he will.

329
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,679
We haven't contacted each other

330
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,759
since that game.

331
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,279
Exactly.

332
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,559
They didn't stay in touch.

333
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,399
Why don't I sing a song?

334
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,759
Sure.

335
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,519
Good.

336
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,039
Let me remind you.

337
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,480
We are all classmates,

338
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,279
and good friends.

339
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,559
After we take pictures,

340
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,919
don't upload it to Moments.

341
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,919
That's for sure.

342
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,559
Don't worry.

343
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:26,799
Qiao Jingjing,

344
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,840
which song do you want to sing?

345
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,159
This one is good.

346
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,240

Nice song, Jingjing.

375

One more song.

376
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,160
One more song. You sing so well.

377
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,559
That's too much.

378
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,759
I'll sing a song for you.

379
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:31,960
Nice.

380
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,039
Yu Tu is here.

381
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,920
Yu Tu.

382
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,720
Yu Tu.

383
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,160
Why is Yu Tu here?

384
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,880
Qiao Jingjing is here.

385
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,640
Yu Tu is here too.

386
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,880
You're late.

387
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,720
Drink the liquor.

388
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,559
Yes, you should.

389
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,680
Top student, long time no see.

390
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
What have you been up to?

391
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,000
Yu Tu.

392
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Why are you still so handsome?

393
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
I'm bald already.

394
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,119
Let me have a look.

395
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,079
Yu Tu is still so popular.

396
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,000
Reminds me of our high school years.

397
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,000
Back then,

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,519
our class was doing so well.

399
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,720
Not only did he
get first place in exams...

400
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,640
It's been a while.

401
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,319
He was also the most handsome guy
in school.

402
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,400
Every time I spoke of

403
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,319
our class,

404
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,160
I felt so proud.

405
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,680
Too bad Xia Qing isn't here today.

406
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,640
Otherwise...

407
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:11,839
Jingjing.

408
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,480
How do you usually
take care of your skin?

409
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,039
Why do you look younger and younger?

410
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,880
Yes.

411
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,039
Everyone else looks pretty young too.

412
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,119
Lately, I've started using

413
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:20,880
a new skincare product.

414
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,799
It's a very nice product.

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,960
But, it's difficult
to pronounce its name.

416
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,680
Let me see.

417
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,559
What are you doing?

418
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,720
You're playing with your phones again.

419
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,200
Aren't you here to sing?

420
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,200
Let's drink, brothers.

421
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:30,799
Come.

422
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,559
Let's drink.

423
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,480
Get Yu Tu some drinks.

424
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,400
Wait a minute.

425
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,799
I have something to do.

426
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,119
You go ahead.

427
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,519
Sure.

428
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,039
Are you here

429
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:18,160
because of me?

430
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,680
I forgive you.

431
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,480
Thank you.

432
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:50,759
Let's go.

433
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:54,839
Yu Tu.

434
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,519
What are you saying?

435
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,319
Why don't you

436
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,200
find yourself a seat?

437
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,279
Let's go.

438
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,119
Sorry.

439
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,519
We've got to go.

440
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,279
You guys have fun.

441
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,000
Friends.

442
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:57,920
Was I...

443
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,400
hallucinating?

444
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,960
So the two of them...

445
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,519
are dating too?

446
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,240
Friends.

447
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:09,960
Let's create a chatroom

448
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,200
for everyone present today.

449
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,880
I'll send everyone Red Packets.

450
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,839
Sure!

451
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll pay the bill.

452
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:15,880
I'll pay the bill.

453
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,200
You...

454
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,319
You...

455
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,359
Why?

456
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,839
On the day of the match,

457
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:27,880
when I was on stage

458
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,720
presenting the award,

459
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,799
you took my phone

460
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:33,359
and got me two Penta Kills.

461
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,920
Didn't you say that
you wouldn't get me a present?

462
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,039
Why did you do that?

463
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,200
I didn't play with you.

464
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,079
I didn't think it counted.

465
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,960
Is it because of that?

466
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,640
No.

467
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,799
I'm just wondering

468
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,799
how you knew

469
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,000
the password to my phone?

470
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,319
I saw it accidentally.

471
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,839
You played two rounds,

472
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,920
and won two Penta Kills.

473
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,119
My rank wasn't that low.

474
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,799
I told my teammates,

475
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,200
"Give me the money.

476
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,200
I'll carry you."

477
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,440
Someone in the second game asked,

478
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:30,680
"Why should I?"

479
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,519
Then, I answered,

480
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,559
"My girlfriend is watching.

481
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:36,400
Brother,

482
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,799
please do me a favor."

483
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,400
That was

484
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,720
not like you.

485
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,440
I'm not like me now too.

486
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,839
Can we stop talking

487
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,279
about the game?

488
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,839
Then, what should we talk about?

489
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,359
Does it mean that

490
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,880
you've said yes?

491
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:15,599
I remember, at that time,

492
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,160
I asked you other questions too.

493
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,200
Yes.

494
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,359
Also, immigration to Mars.

495
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,200
You have to keep writing it.

496
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,359
Sure.

497
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,599
But, you don't have to stay up late.

498
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm not in a hurry.

499
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,359
All right.

500
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,920
The elevator is cramped.

501
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,319
We might as well take the stairs.

502
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,519
They're dating at
the fire escape stairs.

503
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:56,640
I think there's a story behind them.

504
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,559
The guy is so good-looking.

505
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,279
He has a girlfriend.

506
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Look at how thin his girlfriend is.

507
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,599
She must be pretty too.

508
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll start my diet plan
after the Chinese New Year.

509
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,279
Mr. Yu is so handsome.

510
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,640
When I'm with you,

511
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,119
even the fire escape stairs
have become a dangerous place.

512
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,839
Then, you have to get used to it
as soon as possible.

513
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
I've already gotten used to this.

514
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,160
Let's go somewhere else.

515
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:24,440
Where can we go?

516
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,680
It's crowded everywhere.

517
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,839
I'm sure

518
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,519
this place is empty.

519
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,580
(Yixing No.1 Middle School)

520
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:50,839
You can go in now.

521
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,279
Thank you.

522
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:51,680
Thank you.

523
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,440
Okay.

524
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,400
Thank you, sir.

525
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
You may go in.

526
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,000
It's so late now.

527
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Why did he allow us to come in?

528
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,559
I told him that

529
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
I was a student here.

530
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,039
I wanted to show my school
to my girlfriend.

531
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,079
He said he still remembered me.

532
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:20,759
Top Student Yu Tu.

533
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,039
Of course, he remembers.

534
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,240
Unfortunately,

535
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,039
it's not convenient for my girlfriend
to show her face.

536
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,039
Otherwise,

537
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,319
we could enter the school
even more easily.

538
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:30,960
You're right.

539
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,000
In fact, I was here in the morning.

540
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,119
He didn't notice me.

541
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,119
You were here this morning?

542
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,160
What happened to the field?

543
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,880
I guess they are expanding.

544
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,880
Oh, yes.

545
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,400
Did you once

546
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,640
pick the flowers

547
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,839
with some other female students

548
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,480
and get reprimanded
by our class teacher?

549
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,359
Can't you remember
something good about me?

550
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,440
Let's go.

551
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,640
Back then,
after I finished eating at the canteen.

552
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,200
I would take this way
to go back to the classroom.

553
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,359
At that time,

554
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,759
I thought our school was
the most beautiful place.

555
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,599
I think you rarely came here.

556
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,240
I was usually at the field.

557
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,279
So, I seldom ran into you.

558
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,680
Once, I ran into you...

559
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,000
There.

560
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,720
Do you remember that incident?

561
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,640
Yu Tu.

562
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,839
Are you free?

563
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,200
I have a question for you.

564
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,960
Sure. Go ahead.

565
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,799
Do you want a girlfriend?

566
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,119
If you want one,

567
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,400
what do you think about me?

568
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,680
When we were on our way,

569
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:28,759
I was thinking about something.

570
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:29,880
What is it?

571
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,880
What should I do
if you bring up the past?

572
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,640
Not today.

573
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,799
But, I might do that in the future.

574
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,839
I'm looking forward to it.

575
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,759
We've arrived.

576
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,640
I can't see anything.

577
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,079
Look.

578
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,319
They have changed all desks and chairs.

579
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,839
That's for sure.

580
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,920
It's been more than ten years.

581
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:52,799
Your seat was in the last row.

582
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,480
Do you remember where my seat was?

583
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,359
In the third row.

584
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:03,039
Do you remember

585
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,960
everyone else's seats too?

586
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:05,759
I don't think

587
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:07,039
you cared about

588
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:07,960
where I sat.

589
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,039
Lately,

590
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,720
I've been trying to recall

591
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,720
what happened in high school.

592
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,519
Then, what have you recalled?

593
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,680
I recalled

594
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,599
how you bribed me with fried chicken

595
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,680
to teach you math.

596
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,519
Why do you

597
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,920
only recall the bad things?

598
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,519
I can bring up the past too.

599
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,480
At that time,

600
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
I had a goal

601
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,079
that I failed to achieve.

602
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,799
You wanted to go
to the same university as me.

603
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
How do you know?

604
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,519
I read the conversation

605
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,160
in Space Fans.

606
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,119
You even found the chatroom.

607
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,880
I believe that you've really
been trying to recall everything.

608
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,640
In fact,

609
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,200
I was pretty depressed

610
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,359
during that time.

611
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,240
I got good grades in junior high school.

612
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,160
I was very confident.

613
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,319
But, when I started high school,

614
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
my results were not as good as before.

615
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,599
I always thought that

616
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:23,640
as long as I worked hard enough,

617
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,759
I would get a better score.

618
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:30,359
I only found out later

619
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,480
that

620
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,000
hard work

621
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,440
doesn't always pay off.

622
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
I should have taught you.

623
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,960
Would you have the patience?

624
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,240
I would.

625
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,079
What if I had been really stupid

626
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,279
and understood nothing?

627
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,200
You would have understood it well

628
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,079
because I was really smart.

629
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,720
Can you not take this chance

630
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,440
