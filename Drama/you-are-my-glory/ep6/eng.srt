00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,719
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,079
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,520
What do you want for breakfast?

4
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,959
Anything.

5
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,119
Finally awake?

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
I bought you breakfast.

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,840
Thanks, Mr. Yu

8
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,319
Jingjing,

9
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
I suppose I don't have to

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,039
buy you breakfast today again?

11
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,079
You're asking me now?

12
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,639
Stop playing dumb.

13
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,880
I just woke up.

14
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,760
Mr. Yu took my job.

15
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
I have quickly adopted

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,599
the habit of sleeping in.

17
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,800
He sent me a message on WeChat

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,120
and said that he already bought the breakfast.

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,279
It should arrive soon.

20
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,639
However,

21
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,079
what he bought these two days

22
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,279
are high in calories.

23
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,200
I gave him an earful yesterday.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,519
I wonder

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,279
if he'll learn today.

26
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:48,639
Jingjing,

27
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,999
do you notice that

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
ever since

29
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,040
you gave Mr. Yu that bottle of wine,

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,159
he started to

31
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,359
behave differently.

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,519
He'll ask you

33
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:00,040
if you want breakfast or not.

34
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,840
That's to be expected.

35
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:06,320
I was keeping him company that day.

36
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,079
I'm such a sweet person.

37
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,359
He must have been touched by my kindness.

38
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,359
Were you with him?

39
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,320
You were busy

40
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
posting selfie in the group chat.

41
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,920
More than ten selfies, at least.

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,840
Let me count them.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,359
You see, that's my trick.

44
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,320
That's how I make him relax.

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,279
Someone with high EQ like me

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,040
convey messages through actions, not words.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
I have to go now.

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm trying to find out how to brew coffee.

49
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,480
See you!

50
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,559
The calories of today's breakfast

51
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,359
should be within the limit you set.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,399
What a quick-learner!

53
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,920
As expected from a brainiac.

54
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
I simply used addition...

55
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,320
By the way,

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,200
I made you coffee.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,679
It's in the kitchen.

58
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:14,679
Find it yourself.

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,720
I feel like I've been taken advantage of?

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
How so?

61
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,200
I came all the way to bring you breakfast

62
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:35,639
and now,

63
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,839
I have to get the coffee myself too.

64
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,200
But I

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,559
brewed the coffee.

66
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,320
I even drew something

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
on the foam.

68
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,880
I don't know what you drew

69
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:49,839
but I appreciate it.

70
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,639
Wait.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,880
Can't you tell it's a rabbit?

72
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,920
Look at those ears.

73
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,959
So obvious.

74
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,359
I was wondering

75
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,239
why you drew three parabola.

76
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,480
You lack artistic perception.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,440
Should we

78
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,920
queue up on 5v5 today?

79
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,280
You have been playing for a while.

80
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,920
Which heroes do you like?

81
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:28,119
Wang Zhaojun, Shen Mengxi,

82
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,639
Dong Huang Tai Yi, Cai Wenji,

83
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,160
Yu Ji, and Luban No. 7.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,320
They are all good.

85
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,359
But my favorites

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
have to be Zhuge Liang and Li Bai.

87
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:37,839
They are the flashiest on the Valley.

88
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,119
You can't use heroes

89
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,160
with high mobility.

90
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,280
Judging

91
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,639
from the matches these few days,

92
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,519
you should

93
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,239
avoid the jungle.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,799
During the casual match,

95
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,559
find a

96
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,439
professional

97
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,160
jungler.

98
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
The positions that suit you the most

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,080
are mid

100
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,160
and bottom.

101
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,640
So, marksmen, mage, and support.

102
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,759
For mage, you can use Shen Mengxi,

103
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,119
Ganjiang Moye, or Ying Zheng.

104
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,359
They have long range

105
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
so they suit your playstyle.

106
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,679
As for support,

107
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,439
you can go for Dong Huang Tai Yi,

108
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,559
Zhang Fei, Niumo, or Zhuang Zhou.

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,640
Especially

110
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
Zhang Fei.

111
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,759
He has a simple kit.

112
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:20,759
Very easy to use.

113
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,480
As for marksmen,

114
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,720
you like Yu Ji.

115
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,759
Her Skill 3 is sueful.

116
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,920
Her Skill 2 allows her to escape.

117
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,879
You sure run very quickly, though.

118
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,359
Thank you.

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,960
You never leave other players high and dry

120
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,679
but when it comes to me, you never hesitate.

121
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,480
I have always wanted to ask you this.

122
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,480
How

123
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,520
are you feeling?

124
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,679
Just have faith.

125
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:56,960
Thank you.

126
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,840
But they are not flashy enough.

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,160
Not cool enough.

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
If you want someone flashy,

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,960
you can use

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
this marksman.

131
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,960
Which is...?

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Baili Shouyue.

133
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,999
His kit is flashy.

134
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,400
Long-ranged snipe.

135
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,080
Are you sure that I can play him well?

136
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,119
Your aim is good.

137
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,160
You hit the enemy

138
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,679
with Yu Ji's skill 1 quite consistently.

139
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,319
You had a bad game just now because

140
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,879
one, your teammates took resources from you and

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,799
two,

142
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,199
you need to kite better.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,359
Yu Ji and Baili Shouyue

144
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:12,679
requires kiting

145
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,239
but they are not

146
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,600
as demanding as Sun Shangxiang

147
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,799
and Marco Polo.

148
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,239
You can even save

149
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,400
two teammates.

150
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
You are...

151
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I don't know how to describe you.

152
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:26,040
You're harsh, you know.

153
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:26,840
Your comments

154
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,160
regarding my performance on Nakoruru

155
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,840
were circulating

156
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,520
in the office thanks to Xiao Zhu.

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,920
What did I say?

158
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,119
Feeder and suicidal.

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,600
It was an objective view.

160
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Stop laughing!

161
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,400
Other than kiting,

162
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,480
you also lack map awareness.

163
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,960
You always ask a lot of questions

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,160
while you're playing.

165
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,359
Such as?

166
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,799
Where should I go?

167
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
What should I do?

168
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,520
Should I use my ultimate skill?

169
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
From now onwards,

170
00:09:01,199 --> 00:09:02,600
we'll spend half a day practising,

171
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,799
and another half

172
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,999
watching pro games.

173
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,199
Before the match,

174
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:10,879
you need to come up with

175
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,879
a basic overview of

176
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,400
both parties' composition.

177
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,199
Are they early game-focused or late game-focused?

178
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,359
What will they do?

179
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,559
What will you do?

180
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,600
Star with the red buff or the blue buff?

181
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,920
Any early invasion?

182
00:09:21,239 --> 00:09:22,080
These are all strategies.

183
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,879
I guess.

184
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,439
Do you have a pen

185
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,799
and paper?

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,599
The only difference is that

187
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,599
you need to clear minions before level 4.

188
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,280
Got it now?

189
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,040
At night,

190
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,079
watch some pro games

191
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:28,040
and try it out.

192
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,839
If you can predict

193
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,319
what they will do next,

194
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,959
then you'll pass this test.

195
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,679
That's a lot.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
I kind of hate you now.

197
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:44,400
What?

198
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,280
I mean,

199
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,719
you're merciless,

200
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,360
demanding, and dead serious.

201
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,599
If you had taught me maths

202
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:52,599
in high school,

203
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,760
I could have gotten into Tsinghua too.

204
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,520
What's your result in the National Exam?

205
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:02,880
How dare you ask me this question!

206
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm just like

207
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,599
70 or 80 points lower than yours.

208
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,520
Your score was too high anyway.

209
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:13,599
If I could get into Tsinghua,

210
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,319
I could be one of the

211
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:17,439
smartest actresses.

212
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,799
My fans would be over the moon.

213
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:25,679
If your fans know that

214
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:27,439
you want to get into Tsinghua for them,

215
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,479
they would be really happy.

216
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,839
Not because of...

217
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:38,679
Let's call it a day.

218
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,880
I'll head back now then.

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,520
All right. Take care.

220
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,599
I'll stay here.

221
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,400
Shui Jing and I are tired now.

222
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,760
I think Shui Jing is fine.

223
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,920
See you tomorrow.

224
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,079
I have to go to Jiangsu tomorrow

225
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,240
for the Double 11 Celebration.

226
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,400
I'd like to take a day off.

227
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,040
Okay.

228
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,319
Feel free

229
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,479
to watch my performance.

230
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,360
I'll sing

231
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,000
but my slot is quite late.

232
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
Send me a message

233
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,079
before you perform then.

234
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:05,959
You want a reminder?

235
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,040
Who are you, the VIP?

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,319
Respect your teacher.

237
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,719
All right, Mr. Yu.

238
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,559
See you!

239
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,679
Why are you still here?

240
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,760
What have you been doing recently?

241
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,240
You always sneak out

242
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,160
early in the morning

243
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,439
then come back late.

244
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,400
I went to be a teacher.

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,360
What?

246
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,520
Nothing.

247
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,679
Are you heading out now?

248
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,280
Why so mysterious?

249
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,640
Didn't I tell you already?

250
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,280
I'll hang out with Dragon King for two days.

251
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,439
Let's go together then.

252
00:14:18,319 --> 00:14:19,040
Hangzhou?

253
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,839
Yes.

254
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,799
Just to travel a bit.

255
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:21,479
Let's go.

256
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,760
I'm not as free as you.

257
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,559
Breakfast.

258
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,640
Eat on the way.

259
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,760
Why is this so odd?

260
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,120
I have to go now.

261
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,799
Are you free tonight?

262
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,839
Let's have dinner together.

263
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,120
Sure.

264
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,920
6PM sounds good to you?

265
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,000
Something western?

266
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,000
Can do.

267
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,679
Also, I have

268
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,120
some questions regarding

269
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,520
aerospace materials.

270
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,640
Okay.

271
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,760
Beautiful.

272
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,880
I dare say that if Jingjing

273
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,000
wear this gown,

274
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,679
she'll look even better than the supermodels.

275
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,799
Of course.

276
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:04,319
My fans haven't met me for half a month.

277
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,959
I need to surprise them tonight.

278
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,199
You look so good.

279
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,040
I suddenly feel like

280
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,319
I'm a female celebrity.

281
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,199
Who else

282
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,240
can you be then?

283
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,040
An emotionless machine that queues up

284
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,000
for a match.

285
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,319
An emotionless lost soul in Valley of Kings

286
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,360
wandering around the map.

287
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,280
Speaking of which,

288
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
now that the rehearsal is over,

289
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,280
we have a couple of hours

290
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
before your performance.

291
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,760
Time for you to practice.

292
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,719
No, I want to take a break.

293
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,160
Give me the phone.

294
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,000
I will never

295
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,280
click on Honor of Kings.

296
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,439
I'll watch livestream.

297
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,520
Are you sure?

298
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,120
Yes.

299
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,760
I won't press on that icon.

300
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:41,799
When you put it that way,

301
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,280
it sounds clearer to me.

302
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,479
I haven't really

303
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:45,439
researched on this area.

304
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:45,920
It seems like

305
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,520
you have covered more grounds.

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,599
If you want, I can

307
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,719
send you some

308
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,439
latest relevant research papers to you.

309
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,079
Yes, please.

310
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,679
Let me brush up my knowledge.

311
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
That said,

312
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,199
I really hope that

313
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,079
you can

314
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,280
join my team soon.

315
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,760
That way, everything can run smoother.

316
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,000
We have two projects

317
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,760
pertaining

318
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,599
to this field next year.

319
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,319
We need an analyst

320
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,599
who's well-versed in this area.

321
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,520
This area

322
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,280
became popular recently.

323
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:13,479
Truth be told,

324
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,959
we have candidates who can

325
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,000
do this.

326
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:17,880
But personally,

327
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
I want you

328
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,319
to join my team.

329
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:22,160
After all, we're friends.

330
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,880
Right?

331
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,439
Also, you told me that

332
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,920
you gave your tutor your words.

333
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,880
You have a month

334
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,199
to think this through.

335
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,520
I won't rush you.

336
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,439
Once you make up your mind,

337
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:31,439
you tell me.

338
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:32,079
Today is just

339
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,679
a friendly get-together.

340
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:39,719
Thanks,

341
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,800
Ren Wang.

342
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,759
Don't be so polite.

343
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,479
Come.

344
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,519
Here's to hoping that

345
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,160
you'll be back to the Earth soon.

346
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,080
Are you there?

347
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:00,800
Yes.

348
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,719
I'm bored.

349
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,959
Let's play a game.

350
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm hanging out with Ren Wang.

351
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I need 30 minutes.

352
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,120
You know,

353
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,279
you're still

354
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,999
the lady's man.

355
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,400
Do you know that

356
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,679
when you came to my office,

357
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,759
after you left,

358
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,759
the girls in my company

359
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,120
kept pestering me

360
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,479
because they wanted to know

361
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:26,560
who this handsome guy was,

362
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,039
where was he from etc.

363
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,800
When they knew that

364
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,560
you might be

365
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,959
a new colleague,

366
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:32,560
they all went ballistic.

367
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:34,160
It's just like back then

368
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,719
when you joined the football team.

369
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,479
After you joined

370
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:38,640
the football team,

371
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,600
we were in

372
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,880
the spotlight.

373
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,120
My effort

374
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,239
to persuade you

375
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,640
to join us paid off.

376
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,920
So you asked me to join the football team

377
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,239
solely for my looks?

378
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,080
No,

379
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,360
for your talent.

380
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,800
Your looks

381
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,999
is your talent.

382
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,840
Let's talk about your private life then.

383
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,679
When I met Sandbag that day,

384
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:02,320
he told me that

385
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:03,880
you're still single.

386
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,880
How can someone

387
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,640
like you

388
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,880
remain single?

389
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,719
Okay.

390
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:13,800
Let me know when you're done.

391
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,920
I'll play on my own.

392
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,640
I'm still single.

393
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,479
It's good to be single.

394
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,439
No need to find a girlfriend now.

395
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:24,199
Soon,

396
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,519
you'll be in even higher demand.

397
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,719
Oh,

398
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,679
do you have any plans

399
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:29,759
after this meal?

400
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,959
Do you want to

401
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,199
grab a drink

402
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,560
in the bar next door?

403
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,640
I don't feel like it.

404
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
Next time, perhaps.

405
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,959
I have plans.

406
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,519
I knew it.

407
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,600
The night life of a handsome guy

408
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,719
is always eventful.

409
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,600
All right then.

410
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll let you be.

411
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,279
I'll just let

412
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:45,519
my female colleagues

413
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,279
return home disappointed.

414
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,840
Cheers.

415
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,519
What are you doing?

416
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,519
It's nothing.

417
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:04,920
We still have time.

418
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
Mr. Yu asked me to practice.

419
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,039
Can I say no?

420
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,080
I can't.

421
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,239
Come back in half an hour.

422
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,360
Now

423
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
So punctual. You guys finished your dinner?

424
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,199
Yes.

425
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,120
Are you still in the restaurant?

426
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,479
Did your senior leave?

427
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,519
Yes.

428
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,719
He went to the bar.

429
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,800
Without you? Poor thing.

430
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,239
I know right.

431
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,239
He left me alone.

432
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,920
Let me try Niumo this round.

433
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
You'll play marksman.

434
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,560
Sure.

435
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:02,600
Did I enable team's voice chat?

436
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:13,479
I think Niumo is harder to use than Zhang Fei.

437
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:15,239
I don't know where to place my ultimate skill.

438
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,519
Just play whatever,

439
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,840
you'll win anyway.

440
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,239
I'll record it.

441
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,439
And then we'll review it?

442
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Yes.

443
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,560
I knew it.

444
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,479
Marco,

445
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,039
Why do I feel like

446
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,160
your girlfriend plays worse

447
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
that my girlfriend?

448
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:39,880
But you didn't play

449
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,400
as well as my boyfriend either.

450
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:47,719
I have to win this argument.

451
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,600
Don't mind it.

452
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,199
Settle down.

453
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,479
He played marksman.

454
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm not familiar with Li Bai.

455
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,759
Let me invite you next game

456
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:56,239
and show you how a good Marco looks like.

457
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,120
You can do it, darling.

458
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,560
Stop arguing.

459
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,920
Or I'll go idle.

460
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,239
Today is the Double 11 Festival, the day of singles.

461
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:09,279
Couples are everywhere.

462
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,400
I decided to stay home,

463
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:10,999
play some game,

464
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:12,560
and yet, I found two couples.

465
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,080
I'm done.

466
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:15,199
I'll be idle now.

467
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:17,479
Wait,

468
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,479
you got the date wrong.

469
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,719
Double 11 is tomorrow.

470
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:20,840
Today is the 10th.

471
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,479
Really?

472
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,320
Yes.

473
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,199
Then, I'll play one more game.

474
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,479
Thanks.

475
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,560
We won!

476
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:57,039
Gaming is exhausting nowadays.

477
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,719
You have to coax those single guys.

478
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,239
Li Bai invited you last round.

479
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,840
In the last round, Mr. Yu's Marco

480
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,479
was the MVP.

481
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,080
Does he want

482
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,320
to show off his Marco too?

483
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,759
Men are so childish.

484
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
What are you guys talking about?

485
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,999
Seems interesting.

486
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:14,719
Let me see.

487
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,039
Why did your boyfriend reject my invitation?

488
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,719
Did he chicken out?

489
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,519
Hold on.

490
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,560
Invite me.

491
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,039
I knew he wanted to show off his Marco.

492
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:50,039
Mr. Yu chose Li Bai.

493
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:51,800
This is war then.

494
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,080
They swapped heroes.

495
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,640
Look at how excited you are.

496
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,719
Why did you disable the voice chat?

497
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:57,360
I'm worried that

498
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
Mr. Yu would put on a great show

499
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,880
and you guys start fangirling.

500
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,600
Is his Li Bai that good?

501
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,199
I have never seen him play

502
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,479
Li Bai in 5v5.

503
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,719
Technically, he's a talented player,

504
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,320
especially with those mobile heroes.

505
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:11,999
Li Bai?

506
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:13,600
You're provoking us then.

507
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,999
I rarely use him. Just want to try him out.

508
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,320
You can do this, darling.

509
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,239
All the best!

510
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,239
Two couples, I see.

511
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,039
Stay strong. Don't go idle.

512
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,360
I won't.

513
00:25:35,959 --> 00:25:36,880
I have a cat.

514
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,439
In this vast dream,

515
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,439
I remain awake.

516
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,719
Mr. Yu's Li Bai

517
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,880
is so good.

518
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,320
Penta Kill!

519
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,320
Sit down.

520
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,600
This is nothing.

521
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:45,920
This hurts.

522
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,600
It's okay, darling.

523
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,560
You're the best.

524
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,679
You can do this.

525
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,640
Cheer up.

526
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,800
We won.

527
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:09,479
Mr. Yu made up

528
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:11,039
for 40% of our damage.

529
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,600
Not bad, Mr. Yu.

530
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,479
Guo

531
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,920
never got a Penta Kill before.

532
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,880
He never mentioned it.

533
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:25,439
You're mischievious.

534
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,039
Let's review this part.

535
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,880
You engaged too early.

536
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,279
Your teammates were behind you.

537
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,120
Can you see?

538
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,199
I used Marco Polo

539
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,400
so I can follow up.

540
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,279
But if I used a short-ranged marksman...

541
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,199
Niumo

542
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,840
is more suitable for counter-engage.

543
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,560
So yesterday,

544
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,439
why did you delete the message?

545
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:48,640
Come.

546
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,199
Let's watch two pro games

547
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,160
where they used

548
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,239
Niumo.

549
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,479
大好的光棍节 It's the singles' day.

550
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,600
单身就算了 I'm single.

551
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,999
I have to train.

552
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:59,120
Let me pick a cooler hero.

553
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:01,360
Niumo is so ugly.

554
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,600
Did you see their teamwork?

555
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,039
Got it?

556
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,039
Yes.

557
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,600
So,

558
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,439
what was their synergy then?

559
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,279
I...

560
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:25,439
This screen

561
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,880
is too small.

562
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
I can't view the teamfights clearly.

563
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:29,600
Oh,

564
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,600
we have a multimedia room.

565
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,999
Should we watch it there?

566
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,920
Not bad.

567
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,800
You have lightning fast reflex

568
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:37,360
when you're looking for an excuse.

569
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,080
Let's call it a day.

570
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,080
I have a gathering with my colleagues tonight.

571
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,199
I have to leave soon.

572
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,080
I'll check out

573
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
the multimedia room tomorrow.

574
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,439
You have a lot of gatherings.

575
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,600
Is that not normal?

576
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,199
Also,

577
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:55,199
it's about

578
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,360
the Singles' Day.

579
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,320
They want to ask me something

580
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,439
about work.

581
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:11,920
Go ahead then.

582
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,479
Practice supports like

583
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:16,959
Niumo and Zhang Fei.

584
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:17,759
Understood?

585
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Yes.

586
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,600
He's out there

587
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,880
having fun while I have to practice.

588
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,320
How nice would it be if I could

589
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,920
hang out with you.

590
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,279
You sure you would come with me if I said yes?

591
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,039
Have fun!

592
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,479
Bye.

593
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:49,999
See you tomorrow.
