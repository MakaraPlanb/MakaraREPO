Then record it.

16
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,120
Mr. Yu.

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,320
You should eat first.

18
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:18,960
The cafeteria will close at one.

19
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,320
You still have to eat something.

20

(Northwest Satellite Control Center)

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,199
(It's so familiar.)

22
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,359
(I saw her ad today,

23
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,520
and remembered)

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,639
(your classmate that day

25
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,199
was Qiao Jingjing.)

26
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,060
(Spend some more time together)

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
(Sorry, Mrs. Wang.)

28
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,999
(I just got your message.)

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,120
(It's her.)

30
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,439
Why didn't you invite me for lunch?

31
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,639
I saw you doze off at your desk,

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,960
so I didn't call you.

33
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,639
I brought you some food.

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,199
Let's eat outside
and get us some fresh air.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
I'm getting older,
not like I used to be.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
I don't know what's come over me,

37
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,559
dozing off a lot lately.

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,639
Why didn't you order noodles?

39
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,040
You're not having noodles here in Xi'an?

40
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,680
We have oily noodles, saozi noodles.

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,520
They're delicious.

42
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,639
You don't know when to eat it.

43
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,200
Noodles lump easily.

44
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,640
You're particular.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,520
By the way,

46
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,159
I received a message

47
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,480
right when I came out.

48
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,520
The ESA's Tycho Brahe

49
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
was also affected by the solar wind.

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,999
Their situation is worse than ours.

51
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,960
They announced
that they gave up on saving it.

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,240
The Brahe?

53
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,319
The one they launched last year?

54
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:07,439
They said,

55
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,159
its power supply got hit hard,

56
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,279
so it's hopeless.

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
JX has only been out
for more than a year.

58
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,319
It's supposed to last five years.

59
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,120
It hasn't completed its mission.

60
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,559
So many stars are yet to be seen.

61
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:27,999
My,

62
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:29,400
you sound artsy all of a sudden.

63
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:30,839
Let me correct you.

64
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,279
JX is to observe the earth.

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,800
It's a quote from Jade Rabbit's Weibo.

66
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,719
Someone told me that.

67
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,120
You didn't take a hint, did you?

68
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,120
Look on the bright side.

69
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:49,360
JX will not end up like Brahe.

70
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,680
At least we have

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
successfully established

72
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,240
sun orientation regular recharge.

73
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,279
These past few days,

74
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,520
every step in the way,

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,080
it's been suspenseful.

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,599
We figured out

77
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,400
that our attitude orbit control

78
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,120
may have abnormalities,

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,839
but we did not expect

80
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,439
the main interface to be broken too.

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,159
By the way,

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,039
currently, the earth-oriented

83
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,920
attitude maneuver

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,319
can only be implemented by the backup.

85
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,159
We still have to optimize

86
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,279
the implementation strategy.

87
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:25,999
I have to go back.

88
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,080
You haven't finished your lunch.

89
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,559
I have.

90
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,240
What a workaholic.

91
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,860
(Two days later)

92
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,079
(Attention, all units.)

93
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,319
The Jiamusi Station reports

94
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,840
that the satellite will make entry
in one minute.

95

(Real-time fault diagnosis system
for on-orbit spacecraft)

96
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,639
Let's hope nothing goes wrong.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,199
(Attention, all units.)

98
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,360
(The Jiamusi Station reports)

99
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,639
(that the satellite has made entry.)

101
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,620
(Satellite Codename JX-1)

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
According to telemetry data,

103
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,319
all systems are working normally

104
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,999
and it is conditioned
for attitude maneuvering.

105
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,079
As planned,

106
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:46,280
send the Satellite-to-Earth
Orientation Command Sequence

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,240
right away.

108
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,740
(Real-time fault diagnosis system
for on-orbit spacecraft)

109
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,840
(The satellite has entered
earth orientation mode.)

110
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,600
(Attitude normal.)

111
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,120
(All system parameters normal.)

112
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,079
(It is now conditioned

113
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,240
for on-orbit missions.)

114
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,120
We did it!

115
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,399
Thank you.

116
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,280
Mr. Li,

117
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,480
thank you.

118
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,079
Thank you for rescuing

119
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,600
this satellite with us.

120
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,280
It's our responsibility.

121
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,319
We're satellite herders.

122
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,319
The satellite is yours

123
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,199
and ours too.

124
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:07,999
Yeah.

125
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,519
We'd like these young people

126
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
to get some rest.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
They haven't slept much lately.

128
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,360
Mr. Hu.

129
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,480
I'm impressed

130
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,480
by your younger members.

131
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,999
The same goes for your unit.

132
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,040
They're all fine young people.

133
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,240
Dedicated, persistent,
and full of ideas.

134
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,360
They carry our hopes
for the future of aerospace.

135
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,759
You've been out for a month.

136
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,199
You're as sharp as ever.

137
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,959
You're still thinking one step ahead.

138
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,280
You deserve praise too.

139
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,079
Mr. Guan,

140
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,360
your orbit simulation
calculation capability

141
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,959
is also very amazing.

142
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,079
Even Mr. Li was about
to poach you on the spot.

143
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,840
Good news

144
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,879
can put Mr. Hu on edge.

145
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,399
But the lifespan of the satellite

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,040
was still affected.

147
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Still, it could exceed
its planned lifespan.

148
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,079
Should be way more than that.

149
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,280
It's already very lucky

150
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,600
to be rescued.

151
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:44,879
This satellite,

152
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:45,999
you participated in the design

153
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:47,319
of the first model.

154
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,399
It was the first time
we worked together.

155
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,040
Do you know how I felt

156
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,399
when I first met you?

157
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
You were jealous?

158
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,319
It was quite obvious.

159
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,120
Nah.

160
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,439
When I first met you,

161
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,199
I thought

162
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
you were keeping up appearances.

163
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,039
It didn't take long

164
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:11,999
before you gave me

165
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,519
a detailed plan
of the information flow interface.

166
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,200
So I thought,

167
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,759
your talent was as good as your looks,

168
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,360
so we'd make a good couple.

169
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,039
Watch your words.

170
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,120
You're making us
engineering students turn red,

171
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
okay?

172
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,720
Shall we...

173
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,759
talk about our finances?

174
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,679
Did the professor tell you?

175
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,560
When Mr. Zhang called me,

176
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,600
I wished I could beat around the bush.

177
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,919
Are you facing any difficulties?

178
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,240
Or...

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,600
is it about your family?

180
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,039
By the way,

181
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
I remember

182
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
after you answered a call
from your family,

183
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,759
something was up with you
the next day.

184
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,759
No, not at all.

185
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,919
I was just flustered.

186
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,399
Glad to hear that.

187
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,679
I'm a little curious.

188
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:18,600
Are investment banks really profitable?

189
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,759
You earned over a million
upon graduation.

190
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,799
Really?

191
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,840
Well...

192
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,679
It depends on the situation.

193
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,399
Before the 2008 financial crisis,

194
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,600
someone could achieve it.

195
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,560
By the time I graduated,

196
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,440
the crisis was abating.

197
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:34,999
It wasn't too bad.

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,600
If I were in Google,

199
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,999
I'd earn huge paychecks.

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,960
Rather than Google,

201
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,399
how about NASA?

202
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,399
But we're merely foreigners there.

203
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
We'll probably

204
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,799
never have access to their core tech.

205
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,600
Do you know

206
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
why I never urged you to stay?

207
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,720
Because I never thought

208
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,840
you'd leave.

209
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,399
I thought we're two peas in a pod.

210
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,600
Just like my wife said,

211
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,200
simply put,

212
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,560
it was untimely.

213
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,080
I also made a bet with my folks

214
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
that if you were really leaving,

215
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,039
I'd change my name

216
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,080
to Pigpen Guan.

217
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,720
Wouldn't that be a reunion?

218
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,879
We're all siblings, right?

219
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,879
Shut up.

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Aren't you and I brothers?

221
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,320
Can I ask you something, Yu Tu?

222
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,480
About the satellite failure,

223
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,720
no one could tell what caused it.

224
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,679
We solved it in five days.

225
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,159
Some cases took us

226
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:46,960
months to solve.

227
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,960
If it really takes months,

228
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,999
will your investment bank wait?

229
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,399
Or...

230
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,879
Would you run away

231
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,039
and abandon us?

232
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,039
It's almost 5 am.

233
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,120
Jing should be up by now.

234
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:21,840
By the way.

235
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,560
How's it going

236
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,360
between both of you?

237
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,120
Nothing.

238
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,720
She has a junior

239
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,999
whom she'd like to introduce to you.

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,399
Last time she saw

241
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,560
our group photo

242
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,999
and asked if you have a girlfriend.

243
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,560
You're so good-looking,

244
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
so you stand a good chance.

245
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,639
But it took Jing

246
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,159
a lot of effort to court me.

247
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,720
Turn her down for me.

248
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
You really don't need one?

249
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,519
But I met her.

250
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,720
She's quite pretty.

251
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,279
Please, no.

252
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,759
Recently...

253
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,080
I met

254
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,759
a girl.

255
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,120
She's quite clever,

256
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:28,960
a little mischievous,

257
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,960
and receptive.

258
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,759
That's great.

259
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,480
You met her on vacation?

260
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,639
No.

261
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,320
We're from the same high school.

262
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
From the same high school?

263
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,279
Why are you dating with her only now?

264
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,560
Back then,

265
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:57,279
I had poor judgment.

266
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:00,879
So I didn't date her.

267
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,279
You're kidding me.

268
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:05,639
Is it because she doesn't like you?

269
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,560
But I don't think so.

270
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,399
You still got it.

271
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,279
It's locked.

272
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,279
Not a soul in sight.

273
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,799
Maybe they're busy.

274
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,200
Just keep waiting.

275
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,480
In ten minutes,

276
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,759
Jing should be up from bed.

277
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,720
Then we'll call her,

278
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
tell her I'm safe,

279
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,919
so we don't have to go in.

280
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,120
Otherwise, once it gets warmer,

281
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,519
I'll go out like a light.

282
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,080
Let's rest here for now.

283
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:31,840
(Yu Tu.)

284
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,560
(I hope)

285
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
(you'll reconsider your resignation.)

286
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:38,240
(You belong to aerospace.)

287
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,799
(Luckily, I'm fine.)

288
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,440
(Otherwise, we'll end up spending)

289
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,919
(what's left of our savings.)

290
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,840
(At times like this,)

291
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,639
(I think)

292
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:12,279
(our son doesn't need
to be a high achiever.)

293
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,600
(He might as well find a job)

294
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,279
(in our little hometown)

295
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,600
(or dabble in finance.)

296
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,999
(At least he'll have some free time.)

297
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,039
(Can I ask you something, Yu Tu?)

298
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,080
(If it really takes months,)

299
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:30,759
(will your investment bank wait?)

300
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,679
(Or...)

301
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:33,799
(will you run away)

302
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,120
(and abandon us?)

303
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:39,240
(Yu Tu.)

304
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,879
(I'm so disappointed at you.)

305
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,120
(Do you know why)

306
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,639
(I never urged you to stay?)

307
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,120
(Because I never thought)

308
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,080
(you'd leave.)

309
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,600
(I wish more than anyone else)

310
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,200
(for you to remain)

311
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,320
(an aerospace designer.)

312
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,340
(Qiao Jingjing)

313
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,340
(Jingjing: I'm off to a business trip.
Don't know when I'll be back.)

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,280
We can call her now.

315
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,520
Easy there.

316
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,840
You should take it easy a few days

317
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,840
before you return to Shanghai.

318
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,679
I'll have to go back sooner or later.

319
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,879
I'm getting homesick.

320
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,800
Once I'm there,

321
00:20:25,439 --> 00:20:26,719
I'll head straight home.

322
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:29,239
You should go home and rest too.

323
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,840
You don't have to take me

324
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,800
to hospital in Shanghai.

325
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:34,959
No.

326
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
I'll speak to her

327
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,000
alone.

328
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
So...

329
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,120
I will take you downstairs.

330
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,340
(Shen Jing)

331
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,180
(Yu Tu, tell me what you like to eat.
Even Zai has no idea.)

332
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,340
(Anything will do. Thanks for asking.)

333
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:31,933
(I shouldn't count on engineers
like you for advice.)

334
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,360
She asked me yesterday,

335
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,679
when I'll be home.

336
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,479
I didn't reply.

337
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,560
What should I tell her?

338
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:45,800
I promised her last year

339
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,399
that I'd take her,

340
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:48,280
and our son out this year.

341
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:51,879
I reneged twice.

342
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,159
I was thinking

343
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,840
of taking them out by year-end.

344
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,199
I fibbed.

345
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
What should I say?

346
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,000
Get me my medical record

347
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,879
and examination report.

348
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:16,080
I'll take them to hospital myself.

349
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,520
Bear this in mind

350
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:26,320
that if I hadn't sensed something wrong,

351
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,360
I'd be pressing the doctor for answers.

352
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,760
You weren't

353
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,320
planning to tell me?

354
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,679
I...

355
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,120
haven't come up with what to say.

356
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,120
Neither have I.

357
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,460
(Jingjing: I'm off to a business trip.
Don't know when I'll be back.)

358
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,020
(Jingjing: I'm off to a business trip.
Don't know when I'll be back.)

359
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:10,580
(All-time Records)

360
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,360
Mengmeng,

361
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:38,760
it's breakfast time.

362
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,239
Mom, have you figured out

363
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:45,479
how to solve this additional problem?

364
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:46,399
Wei Wei said,

365
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,159
her dad came up with two solutions.

366
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:49,679
Your phone.

367
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,840
Now eat.

368
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,399
Have you figured it out?

369
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
What grade are you?

370
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:01,520
Can a math problem be so hard?

371
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,800
My teacher said,
it's an additional problem.

372
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,199
Take it or leave it.

373
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,800
But it'll be a shame to leave it.

374
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,000
So...

375
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,840
You haven't figured it out, did you?

376
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,040
You're not as good as dad.

377
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,600
He'd know.

378
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,560
Is this your homework

379
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,800
or mine?

380
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,239
My teacher said,

381
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,000
you can ask your parents.

382
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,360
Maybe,

383
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,199
they wanted to test the parents' IQ.

384
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,120
Mom,

385
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,560
are you a little slow up there?

386
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,600
Then I inherited it from you.

387
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:37,479
Only very few people are as smart

388
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,000
as your father.

389
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,719
I am only of

390
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:40,679
average IQ.

391
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,360
I'm not slow or anything.

392
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,000
I'm not so sure about that.

393
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Remember Uncle Yu

394
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,320
who dropped by for dinner?

395
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,560
I had one question I couldn't answer,

396
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:49,719
but he managed to answer it

397
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,800
at just one glance.

398
00:25:51,719 --> 00:25:52,360
Uncle Yu

399
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,040
graduated from Tsinghua.

400
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,719
He's awesome enough

401
00:25:55,719 --> 00:25:56,719
to earn two degrees.

402
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:58,040
That puts him

403
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,760
in the same league as your dad.

404
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,280
Coming.

405
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,360
Who is it so early in the morning?

406
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,159
Eat up.

407
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,520
Your savior is here.

408
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,719
There are two kinds.

409
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,199
Dad, write another,

410
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,600
and I'll be the first in my class.

411
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Wait till you see.

412
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,120
Plus four...

413
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Multiply by...

414
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,520
Done.

415
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,879
I'm the first in my class!

416
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,199
But I'll hold it back

417
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:50,479
from my class for now.

418
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:51,879
Then I'll show them tomorrow.

419
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,959
No one can surpass me

420
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,000
by then.

421
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:56,520
I wonder who he inherited
his wit from.

422
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,520
All right.

423
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,719
You should pack up

424
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,959
and head for hobby class.

425
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:01,919
I'll pick you up at noon

426
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,959
and we'll have delicious lunch.

427
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,280
I don't want to go to hobby class.

428
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,159
It's not every Sunday
that dad is home.

429
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,439
I want to be with him.

430
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,800
You have no class in the afternoon.

431
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,840
You'll have time to be with him.

432
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,239
Hurry up and get changed.

433
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,879
I'm not so sure about that.

434
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,800
You know how elusive dad is.

435
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm afraid he'll disappear

436
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:20,800
by afternoon.

437
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,520
Then ask your dad,

438
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
"Will you wander away?"

439
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,679
I'm home now.

440
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,760
No business trips.

441
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,560
Hello?

442
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,159
What you asked me this morning,

443
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:00,399
Kings got back to me.

444
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,800
The competition

445
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,159
will use today's updated version.

446
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:04,919
There could be new heroes.

447
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:08,560
So can I try out one of them?

448
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,159
The equipment could use
a little adjustment.

449
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,040
Sorry for the trouble.

450
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,520
About a month ago,
you were a newbie at this.

451
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,479
And now, you're an expert.

452
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,360
You even took notice of details

453
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,040
like what version to use.

454
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,439
Well?

455
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,479
Any idea?

456
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,159
In e-sports,

457
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,719
I could be wrong,

458
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,439
but there can't possibly be
any shoo-ins.

459
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:29,080
Even pros will lose.

460
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
And I'm no exception.

461
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:31,919
The least I can do

462
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,800
is to show off

463
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,679
the very best of me.

464
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:34,719
I think

465
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,479
you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

466
00:28:36,479 --> 00:28:37,199
Besides,

467
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,120
I think you're doing

468
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,280
really great at it.

469
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,800
Look at you.

470
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,919
You're in Ace 2.

471
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:41,719
Right?

472
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,520
As for Mr. Yu,

473
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:46,919
he is

474
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,120
not teaching you lately?

475
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,800
I can climb the ranks myself,

476
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,199
whether he's around or not.

477
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,520
I have a script to read.

478
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,479
You're excused.

479
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,280
Okay.

480
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,639
Goodbye then.

481
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,020
