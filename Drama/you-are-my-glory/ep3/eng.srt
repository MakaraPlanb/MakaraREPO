1
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,000
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,120
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,040
(Can you be my coach?)

4
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,560
(I think)

5
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,400
(you should find someone else.)

6
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,920
(I might quit this game)

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
(at any time.)

8
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,719
(Well, could you at least)

9
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,079
(give me some advice when we play?)

10
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,560
(Like telling me where I do wrong,)

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,439
(or how it should be done.)

12
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,280
(Is that all right?)

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
(If you feel like quitting,)

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,439
(I'll find someone else.)

15
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,560
(Please, Jade Rabbit God.)

16
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,039
(Okay.)

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,080
Okay?

18
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,159
One step at a time.

19
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,759
Since you agreed to the first step,

20
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,360
the second one is not far now.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,800
Wait.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,039
What's the second one?

23
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,520
(Let's get started then.)

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,840
Hey, my support character.

25
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,919
(Use Wang Zhaojun.)

26
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,560
(Use Wang Zhaojun?)

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,439
(I don't know how to.)

28
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,599
(I haven't tried it before.)

29
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,840
If you guys have a unit competition,

30
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,919
there's a good chance
it's in Draft Mode.

31
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,120
You might not necessarily get Cai Wenji.

32
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,039
It's all right for a newbie
to get Wang Zhaojun.

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
The summoners' abilities.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
Change it to Flash.

35
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,560
Hold on.

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,840
Is there something

37
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
that I'm not aware of?

38
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,560
What unit competition?

39
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,560
It's the Honor of Kings competition

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,759
organized by our unit.

41
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,840
I would like Jade Rabbit God

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,560
to teach me.

43
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,520
Look.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,039
Yu Tu is quite a good coach.

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,719
Zhai Liang is a good example.

46
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,000
Look how screwed up it was

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,039
when he used Xi Shi.

48
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,599
I watched him for a bit

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,159
to learn the techniques.

50
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,599
But I learned the rest

51
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,000
all by myself.

52
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,400
Come off it.

53
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:45,199
Finally,

54
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,439
the kill counts are more
than the number of times slain.

55
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,919
(Why are the opponents
using Wang Zhaojun as well?)

56
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,400
(It feels worse than an outfit clash.)

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,240
I won't lead you guys to defeat.

58
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:22,240
Get to higher ground!

59
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,800
When I was learning acting,

60
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,839
I had to watch the videos

61
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,720
of my seniors repeatedly.

62
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,680
Now, I have to do the same and watch

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,040
how I got slain when playing games.

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,160
I bet

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,879
it's because I have been gifted

66
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,160
with such great beauty.

67
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,399
So all other talents
need to be cut back.

68
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,560
That was so devious.

69
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,399
Yu Tu is way more devious.

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
That's why we won.

71
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,639
Is this game

72
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,639
all about being devious?

73
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,879
That explains why I lost.

74
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,480
It's all because I'm an upright person.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Chill.

76
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
Chill.

77
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,759
Sure enough.

78
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,839
It's more satisfying
than using Cai Wenji.

79
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,240
Cotton, not bad, huh?

80
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,560
How is it?

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,079
I'm doing better now
than I did yesterday, right?

82
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,800
That's really good.

83
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
I've been practising

84
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,040
all day today.

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,639
Hard work pays off!

86
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,240
I'll prove it with my singing!

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,959
I have to save this game.

88
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,519
Cool!

89
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,959
Nice one, girl.

90
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,319
Yu Tu, I never thought
a kill stealer like you

91
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,759
would let her get the kill.

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
(He let me get the kill?)

93
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,839
(True enough. He let me win.)

94
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,800
He still won't reply to me.

95
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,839
I know you let me win

96
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,959
when I got the Triple Kill.

97
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
I've earned enough.

98
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,160
You should get the kill.

99
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:07,920
Thank you.

100
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:22,959
Dandan.

101
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,319
Get me

102
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,959
the cosmetics contract.

103
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:25,439
I'll go over

104
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,639
and discuss the details with them later.

105
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
Tell Mr. Wang to get the car ready.

106
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,519
Okay.

107
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,879
Give Mr. Wang a call.

108
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,360
Where's Jingjing?

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,679
It's only one o'clock,

110
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,399
and she's gone already?

111
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,919
Jingjing hasn't been here
for a few days now.

112
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,559
Xiao Zhu said she did apply for leave.

113
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,799
She merely asked

114
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,039
for a day off.

115
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,120
Wait, she didn't come here at all

116
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
while I was away on the business trip?

117
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,840
Why didn't you tell me?

118
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,720
I'll check her place.

119
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Jingjing.

120
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,279
Jingjing.

121
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,440
Why didn't you come
in the past two days?

122
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,399
You've been practising at home?

123
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Let me see.

124
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Not bad.

125
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,879
Are you battling AI players?

126
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,759
Are you kidding me?

127
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm doing solo queue, all right?

128
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Solo queue?

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
Not bad, huh?

130
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,960
You have the guts to solo queue now.

131
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,559
I was nervous at first.

132
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,279
But it's better now.

133
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,679
I've reached Gold IV now.

134
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,840
I solo queued and ranked up myself.

135
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,120
What has gotten into you?

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
You're so good now.

137
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,799
I'm gifted.

138
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,440
That's so awesome.

139
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,600
Let me see.

140
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,600
Wait.

141
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,039
Guo never taught you
how to use this hero.

142
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,320
Did you practise it yourself?

143
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,919
Actually, I asked a game expert

144
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:17,879
to teach me.

145
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,519
I think he's better than Guo.

146
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,320
That's hard to say.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
Is he reliable?

148
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:25,840
Will he expose your identity?

149
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
Don't worry.

150
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,080
I bet he doesn't even know

151
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,759
who I am.

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,360
Is he an online friend?

153
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,879
How did he teach you then?

154
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,159
Through the voice chat.

155
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,919
He teaches me how to use the abilities,

156
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:35,840
how to move,

157
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,519
and what I should do.

158
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,159
I'm going to take a sip.

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,399
Let's see.

160
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,879
Which is it?

161
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,519
Open up my friend lists

162
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,480
in the game.

163
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,679
His name is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

164
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
Click on the avatar,
and you can see his performance record.

165
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,200
He has a 93-percent win rate.

166
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,600
For real?

167
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,519
Indeed.

168
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,120
He seems to be better than Guo.

169
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,799
It's a shame.
He's just an online friend.

170
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,919
If there's such a good player

171
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,759
in real life who's that reliable

172
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,799
to teach you in person,

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,159
you'll progress

174
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,679
a lot faster.

175
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,039
(Yu Tu)

176
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,840
(exists in real life.)

177
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,919
(If he teaches me in person...)

178
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,159
But it's okay.

179
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,440
Just keep up the training.

180
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,879
There's still a month to go.

181
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:19,799
You need to step up the game.

182
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,720
Basically,

183
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,080
I've declined all the job offers.

184
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,200
But for those that we accepted
a few months ago,

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
we still have to fulfil them.

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,799
Why are you in a daze?

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,360
I know.

188
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,320
You do?

189
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,279
Really?

190
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,559
I'll get going then.

191
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,679
I still have a contract to discuss.

192
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,440
Okay.

193
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,960
Keep it up.

194
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Okay.

195
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,720
Drink more water.

196
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,559
Protect your skin.

197
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,279
Bye.

198
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:52,799
Why is Yu Tu

199
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,320
online every day?

200
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,200
He plays games every day.

201
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:00,200
Is this how he spends his holidays?

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,559
(Rabbit God.)

203
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:10,720
(Do you spend your holidays)

204
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,879
(playing games at home?)

205
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,240
(What does he work as now?)

206
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:19,279
(It doesn't feel like
he's in the financial industry.)

207
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,000
(Peipei.)

208
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,000
(Do we have any classmates)

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,600
(who have a really cool job now?)

210
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,519
(It's you, isn't it?)

211
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,360
(I mean)

212
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
(what are those with good grades)

213
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,559
(doing right now?)

214
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,000
(I see. Those guys?)

215
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,039
(Qi Qi is working as an editor-in-chief)

216
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,039
(in a book company.)

217
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
(Wang Jiang is now a vice president)

218
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
(in one of the top 500 corporations.)

219
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,600
(Who else?)

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,039
(Sun Xiu is working in the Office
of the Secretary to the Mayor.)

221
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,279
(How about Yu Tu?)

222
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,720
(I think Yu Tu is working)

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,360
(in Aerospace Research Institute
in Shanghai.)

224
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,120
(Aerospace?)

225
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,759
(He's in the aerospace industry?)

226
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:28,960
(But didn't he study finance)

227
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,200
(back in college?)

228
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,480
(How do you remember so clearly?)

229
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,480
(How would I know)

230
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,759
(why did he join aerospace?)

231
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,279
(Why do you ask?)

232
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
(Check this out.)

233
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,639
(Yu Tu)

234
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,240
(bought the air purifier)

235
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,639
(that your friend posted on Moments.)

236
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,519
(It broke down all of a sudden.)

237
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,720
(He called to request a repair,
but he couldn't get through.)

238
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,080
(Could you help him with it?)

239
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:57,879
(I just managed to reach him.)

240
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,840
(He said)

241
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,720
(he could only go over tomorrow night
to fix it.)

242
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,320
(This is for the kid's room.)

243
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,360
(Could you inform him)

244
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,080
(to come as soon as possible?)

245
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,679
(This kid coughs a lot
when he has a cold.)

246
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,120
(Yu Tu sells purifiers?)

247
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,200
(I think they developed it)

248
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,039
(for civilian use or something.)

249
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,720
(I thought aerospace tech
must be really cool.)

250
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,679
(But still, totally unexpected.)

251
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,440
(Which part is broken?)

252
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,480
(I couldn't turn it on.)

253
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,919
(Are you staying in Minhang?)

254
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,679
(I'll go over and take a look.)

255
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
(Why did you send this to me?)

256
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,840
(It was in the group chat.)

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,759
(I just recalled.)

258
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,759
(So I sent it to you.)

259
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,559
(He's indeed in the aerospace industry.)

260
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,279
Yu Tu.

261
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,480
Chang'e 1 has been launched.

262
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,159
Someone else

263
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,080
is a step ahead of you.

264
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,159
That's perfect, isn't it?

265
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:42,879
Perhaps, by the time I graduate,

266
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,679
the moonbase has been built.

267
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,200
I'll use the moon as a starting point

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
to conquer Mars

269
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,120
and fly through the solar system.

270
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,279
Come off it.

271
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,840
It doesn't cost me anything

272
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,679
to brag, isn't it?

273
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,120
Fine.

274
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,480
You're the top student.
So you must be right.

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,720
Wait up!

276
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,120
It turns out that
he didn't give up on his dream.

277
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,919
Yu Tu is in this city too.

278
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,799
(Peipei.)

279
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:49,999
(Show me the purifier advertisement)

280
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,639
(that Yu Tu sent you.)

281
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,960
(It's time to unleash my acting skills.)

282
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,919
The smog in Shanghai

283
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,200
is too serious.

284
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
How about your place?

285
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,879
What a coincidence.

286
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,440
Yu Tu and I are in Shanghai too.

287
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,080
The smog in Hangzhou

288
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,200
is pretty serious too.

289
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:27,799
The situation in Wuhan

290
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,879
is all right.

291
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:31,080
What brand of purifier

292
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,840
do you use?

293
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,159
I bought

294
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,840
a Jade Rabbit Air Purifier.

295
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,960
But it broke down after a few days.

296
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,519
Yu Tu?

297
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,480
Isn't that your company's product?

298
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,919
Is that a product

299
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,279
of Jade Rabbit God's company?

300
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,679
That explains it.

301
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,399
I bought it because it's the same
as your name.

302
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,679
What a coincidence.

303
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,879
It's a product developed by our lab

304
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,919
and another company.

305
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,759
Try using another adapter.

306
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,200
A classmate of mine bought it

307
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,279
and said it wasn't working either.

308
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,519
I took a look

309
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,440
and found out it was the adapter.

310
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,159
(Why did this classmate)

311
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,159
(steal my idea?)

312
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,879
I tried using another adapter,

313
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:04,960
but still, it didn't work.

314
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,880
I called for repair,

315
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,279
but they said it was scheduled

316
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,279
for the day after tomorrow.

317
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:09,400
But my parents

318
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
are having really bad coughs.

319
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,920
The after-sales service isn't that good.

320
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,799
Yu Tu.

321
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,680
Take a look for Cotton.

322
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,680
(What a good line.)

323
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,799
(I have to send So Panicky)

324
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,880
(a set of skin.)

325
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,759
Jade Rabbit God.

326
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,920
You even know how to do that?

327
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Of course.

328
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,039
He is a part-time
troubleshooting expert.

329
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, Jade Rabbit God,

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,599
could you

331
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,319
take a look at the purifier at my place?

332
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,559
Send me

333
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,400
your contact details.

334
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,920
(That was easy.)

335
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll get the guys at the lab

336
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,839
to go to your place

337
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,400
and take a look.

338
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:47,680
(I knew it wouldn't be that easy.)

339
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,799
(It was so hard to get him
to add me on QQ back then.)

340
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,960
(Good thing
I have a trick up my sleeve.)

341
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,519
Thank you.

342
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,319
But

343
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,920
this is actually

344
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
the second repair.

345
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,920
I think there's no point for them
to come anyway.

346
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,000
That's so unreliable.

347
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,680
What actually went wrong?

348
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,319
I wanted to buy it.

349
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,440
But I changed my mind now.

350
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,440
That's right, Yu Tu.

351
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039
Are your products reliable?

352
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,720
Jeez.

353
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,519
That's right.

354
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,759
I bought it

355
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,200
because it says on the ads

356
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,079
that it's the aerospace tech.

357
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,759
But I never expected this.

358
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
(Sorry.)

359
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,519
(The great aerospace industry
of the motherland.)

360
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,039
(I'll make it up to you next time.)

361
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,319
Didn't the repair guy say

362
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:23,519
what went wrong?

363
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,920
He seemed to be in a bad spot,

364
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,480
and he didn't say what was the problem.

365
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,000
Yu Tu.

366
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,960
Why don't you go and take a look?

367
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,279
Do you stay with your parents?

368
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,319
That's right.

369
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,440
Are they in now?

370
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,599
Yes.

371
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:42,720
If it's convenient,

372
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I'll go over and take a look.

373
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,079
My house is in Pudong.

374
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:50,400
Is it too far?

375
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,839
So sorry to bother you.

376
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,240
It's fine.

377
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,759
Send me the address.

378
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,240
You're so lame.

379
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,960
Why do you have to go

380
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,000
when her parents are around?

381
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,279
You're the lame one.

382
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,079
Xiao Zhu.

383
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,000
Xiao Zhu.

384
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,640
Quickly unpack

385
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,519
this newly bought purifier.

386
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,279
Hurry.

387
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:41,599
How's my makeup?

388
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,640
It's too thick, isn't it?

389
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,119
I knew it.

390
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,240
It's too thick.

391
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,440
Do I look girlie?

392
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,759
Yes.

393
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,599
Well.

394
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,400
Jingjing, it's late at night.

395
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,440
What are you doing?

396
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,119
Is this a dress-up game?

397
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,319
Destroy the air purifier.

398
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,160
Cotton.

399
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,400
No, it's not me.

400
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm her assistant.

401
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,640
She sent me down to get you.

402
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,119
Assistant?

403
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,400
It's right in front.

404
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm Xiao Zhu.

405
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We're almost there.

406
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,519
Jingjing, why did you come downstairs?

407
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm worried someone might think

408
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,480
that I'm being a snob.

409
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,039
That's why I came down to welcome him.

410
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:27,759
Long time no see.

411
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,160
Long time no see.

412
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,240
Has it been ten years?

413
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,480
About that.

414
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,319
Let's take a look at the purifier.

415
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,799
I've stayed in the house for days

416
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,720
and haven't stepped out of it since.

417
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm feeling a little lightheaded.

418
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,559
Why don't we go for a walk first?

419
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,480
Here's the thing.

420
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,079
I wanted to use the excuse

421
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,279
that the power's off.

422
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,920
But I didn't expect Ding Chaoqun
to have used it.

423
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,720
I couldn't bear the thought

424
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
of destroying such a cute purifier.

425
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,160
So it's doing its work right now.

426
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,599
It's quite cold out there.

427
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm going back up to get changed.

428
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,920
Wait for me.

429
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,960
I don't feel so safe

430
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
walking with you.

431
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,319
Are you kidding me?

432
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,319
I should be the one to say that.

433
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,079
Look.

434
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,880
When I came out with Xiao Zhu,

435
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,799
which is the girl you saw earlier.

436
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,160
There weren't as many people

437
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,079
who turned around to look at us

438
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,319
when I came out with her.

439
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,960
Don't make me get photographed,

440
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
or I'll hit the headlines.

441
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
Why would you play games with me?

442
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,240
Didn't you invite me?

443
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,680
You added the wrong person.
Have you forgotten?

444
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
But...

445
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,559
why would you

446
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,000
be in my QQ friend list?

447
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,000
Do I have to explain about me

448
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,400
using an alt

449
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,440
to secretly add your QQ account?

450
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,799
Do you have amnesia or something?

451
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,720
Are you also

452
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,359
going to ask me

453
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,039
why I asked you here?

454
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,279
Do you have a Weibo account?

455
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:28,960
Yes.

456
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,279
Well, log in to your account

457
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,480
and check out mine.

458
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,680
(Yes, my muse is so adorable!)

459
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,000
(An air purifier
recommended by the muse.)

460
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,720
(I'm buying it!)

461
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,559
(I'm posting the review.)

462
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,680
(I think it's the last unit.)

463
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,559
(When I checked again,)

464
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,880
(the product is sold out.)

465
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,559
(I'll post one.)

466
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,359
(I almost didn't get it.)

467
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,559
(You snatched the same product
as my muse.)

468
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,920
(How much did she get paid
for posting this?)

469
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,440
(Xieyue Yilun.)

470
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
(Isn't your husband)

471
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,839
(working with that company?)

472
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,480
(Ask him.)

473
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:07,680
(I did.)

474
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,640
(He said he didn't pay her.)

475
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,240
(The less popular celebrity)

476
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,519
(charges 300,000 yuan for one post.)

477
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,799
(Let alone Qiao Jingjing.)

478
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:12,599
(My husband said)

479
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,440
(it's all sold out.)

480
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,559
(There are many more orders)

481
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,359
(with limited stocks.)

482
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,759
(We didn't see this coming.)

483
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:17,799
(Speaking of,)

484
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,400
(the only publicity)

485
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,039
(is for all employees)

486
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,279
(to post on their Moments.)

487
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,720
(This is so cool!)

488
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,799
Why?

489
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,200
It's not like I'm endorsing
any other similar products.

490
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,000
There's no conflict.

491
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,279
Support the motherland's

492
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,680
aerospace industry.

493
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,960
Thank you.

494
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,599
That's so not cool of you.

495
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I thought what was uncool

496
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,480
was lying to me

497
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,119
about taking part

498
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,400
in the Honor of Kings tournament.

499
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,039
I didn't lie to you.

500
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,519
I'm taking part in the tournament.

501
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't you know I'm the spokesperson

502
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,799
of the Honor of Glory?

503
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
I did see the event of you
giving away inscriptions

504
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,920
when I logged into the game.

505
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,720
A few months ago,

506
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,759
a WeChat friend of mine

507
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:00,079
recorded a video of me

508
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,000
playing games

509
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,799
and sent it to the marketing account.

510
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,279
You should know

511
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,480
my gaming skills.

512
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
So one month later,

513
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,720
I'll be going on the same stage

514
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,559
with professional players

515
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,880
to prove myself.

516
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,480
Thus, everything that has happened.

517
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,400
Are you playing
with professional players?

518
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:20,440
Not all.

519
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
There are five lucky players.

520
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,039
So there are six of us including me.

521
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,039
Four professional players.

522
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:24,880
Two on each side.

523
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:29,799
What do you think

524
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:31,400
of my gaming skills

525
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,039
if I were to join the tournament?

526
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,039
There's no telling if we will win

527
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,640
even with you on the team.

528
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,880
So you want me to teach you?

529
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,119
Can you?

530
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,759
Not the kind

531
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,079
through the Internet.

532
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,000
That's too inefficient.

533
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,039
It's best if you could teach me
in person.

534
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,039
You happened to be on a break

535
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,720
right now anyway.

536
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,240
It wouldn't get in the way

537
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
of your work, right?

538
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,960
Here's the thing.

539
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,799
I've never watched a professional game.

540
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,720
I don't know much

541
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
about their gaming skills.

542
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,400
I don't know if I can teach you.

543
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,960
It's okay.

544
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,039
I won't get anyone else

545
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,039
to teach me anyway.

546
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,359
You should know that.

547
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,440
You trust me?

548
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
You're my classmate.

549
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:34,319
Yu Tu.

550
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,799
Teach me Math.

551
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,039
I'll treat you to crispy chicken.

552
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay.

553
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,400
Really?

554
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,519
Are you doing it willingly?

555
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,640
Enough walking then.

556
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Let's go back and play games.

557
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,440
Hold on.

558
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,440
Your parents are at home.

559
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,799
It's not so appropriate.

560
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
Says who that my parents are around?

561
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,039
My parents are in their hometown.

562
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,880
The only thing at home
is the Jade Rabbit Purifier.

563
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,680
What day is the game next month?

564
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,039
Sunday, the second week
of next month.

565
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:19,920
It's on the 10th.

566
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,799
There's not much time left.

567
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's get started now.

568
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,000
And do what?

569
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,680
I've just started playing this game
recently

570
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,240
and haven't studied it.

571
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,480
So I'm not so sure

572
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
how I should teach you.

573
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,079
But

574
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,799
you can start by telling me the mistakes
you made

575
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,680
when you had a match with us

576
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,799
in the last few days.

577
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,000
(That was quick of him)

578
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
(to enter the coaching mode.)

579
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,119
Let's start with the errors collection.

580
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,640
Are there a lot?

581
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,160
Not really.

582
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,480
More than ten.
