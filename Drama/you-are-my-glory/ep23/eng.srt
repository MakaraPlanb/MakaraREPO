13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 23=

14
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,120
He works in Shanghai.

15
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,680
At the Aerospace Research Institute.

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,439
He explores Mars, the moon

17
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,199
and the like.

18
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,400
I didn't want to hide it from you.

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,439
I just wanted to tell you
a few days later.

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,360
No we really just started dating.

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,479
We just started dating yesterday.

22
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm not lying to you.

23
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm not being irresponsible.

24
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,680
Mom, believe me.

25
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,759
I didn't...

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,000
My mom said

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360
that I was irresponsible
for my relationship.

28
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,280
What a coincidence.

29
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,000
My mom said the same thing about me.

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,719
My mom said

31
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,000
that I'm inconsiderate
of other people's feelings.

32
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:47,960
What a coincidence.

33
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,879
My mom said the same thing about me.

34
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,240
My dad even told me

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
to treat you better.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,560
My dad didn't do that.

37
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,520
He doesn't have the right

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
to express his opinion
in front of my mom.

39
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,680
Why exactly

40
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,240
are we ruining each other's reputation

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,360
this way?

42
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:06,599
I'm sure

43
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,039
that you did it first Ms. Qiao.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,520
Mr. Yu.

45
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,439
You're so hard to bully.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,520
I've learned from my girlfriend.

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,599
Your girlfriend is very innocent.

48
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,000
You're the one
who has a doubtful nature.

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,680
Help me check that.

50
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,280
Perhaps my mom hasn't educated me enough

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
and sent me another message.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,879
Is it that bad?

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
It's not your mom.

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,560
Someone named Zhai Liang

55
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
sent you a voice message.

56
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:51,800
He

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,759
is So Panicky.

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,919
Check

59
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,840
what he sent.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,520
So Panicky?

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:57,960
No wonder

62
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,479
the name sounds so familiar.

63
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,719
Yu Tu I went home for the New Year

64
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,919
and I was forced to go
on a blind date indeed.

65
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,800
But I quite like

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,759
the girl.

67
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,080
And she's also working in Shenzhen.

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,319
I'm going to make her my girlfriend
in one month

69
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,479
and become taken earlier than you.

70
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,439
The way he speaks

71
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,879
is really similar to when we were
playing games.

72
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,840
I'll help you reply to him.

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,000
Wish him luck.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Don't scare him.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
How would I scare him?

76
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,399
He said that he wished you luck.

77
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,680
But he became taken earlier than you.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,639
Why isn't he replying?

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
Perhaps his core processor

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,879
is burnt.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,759
That's a bit too weak.

82
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,740
(Yu Tu waiting for the invitation
to be accepted)

83
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,439
Cotton?

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,120
Hello So Panicky.

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,959
You're really Qiao Jingjing?

86
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,600
Are you surprised? Is this unexpected?

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,920
You're with Yu Tu now?

88
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,720
He's driving.

89
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,079
It's not convenient for him to talk.

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,199
Wait.

91
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,439
Let me calm down first.

92
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:12,879
My phone

93
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,079
fell into my cup earlier.

94
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,000
Later on

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
if the call gets cut off

96
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,079
don't be surprised.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,959
I wiped it dry just now.

98
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,000
Now

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,079
I'm taking the risk of my phone's
getting burnt

100
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,000
in talking to you.

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,480
Do you want

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
to turn off your phone
and let it dry first?

103
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,600
Don't.

104
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,439
Let's make good use of the time.

105
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Turn the camera towards him.

106
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,120
Let me see

107
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,720
if he has the look of love on his face.

108
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,399
I don't think there's any change.

109
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,439
There is.

110
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,439
You haven't lived with him.

111
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,759
His facial expression now

112
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,480
is the look of love
at a typhoon level.

113
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,600
Typhoon level?

114
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,800
Then his face is a bit paralyzed.

115
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,040
Fine.

116
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Let's not look at him.

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,800
Turn the camera over.

118
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
You were really classmates
in senior high?

119
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,040
Don't find it strange
that I'm so surprised.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
It was really because Yu Tu was usually...

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,720
Well...

122
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,560
How was he usually?

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,360
Usually...

124
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,639
Usually when he saw

125
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,839
your ads on the streets

126
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,480
he didn't even lift his head.

127
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,920
Really?

128
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,759
Yes.

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,759
A while ago

130
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,160
didn't the game have an event?

131
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,360
As the game endorser

132
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,519
you gave runes to players,
didn't you?

133
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,879
That ad was so beautiful.

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,519
I myself even took a few more glances.

135
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,319
But he always

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,759
just got the runes

137
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,839
and closed the page.

138
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,040
His facial expression
didn't change at all.

139
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,199
His hands moved so fast.

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,879
I was right beside him watching him.

141
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,519
Zhai Liang.

142
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
And previously when he helped you fix

143
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,279
the air purifier,

144
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,480
I asked him after he came back.

145
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,959
"How does that girl look?"

146
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,560
He said that she could be seen
everywhere on the streets.

147
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,360
I really can't forget that.

148
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,240
Don't listen to him.

149
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,399
What I meant was

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
that your ads were everywhere
on the streets

151
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,800
so you could be seen everywhere.

152
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
That happens to prove

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,279
that every time

154
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,600
I passed by your ad, I did look at it.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,079
Otherwise how would I know

156
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
that you could be seen everywhere
on the streets?

157
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,360
Am I right?

158
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
You're shameless.

159
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,240
You're so shameless.

160
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,839
Get lost.

161
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:31,720
Survival is more important now.

162
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,279
Look at him. Isn't he flirtatious?

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,360
Isn't he flirtatious?

164
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,480
Based on your reaction
and desire for survival

165
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,160
it was such a waste for you

166
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,480
to be single for so many years.

167
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,439
Cotton.

168
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,959
Don't... Don't look at him. Look at me.

169
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm taking the risk

170
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,079
of my phone's being burnt

171
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,199
in having a video call with you.

172
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,519
Why did you

173
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,680
only start dating

174
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,319
after I left Shanghai?

175
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
I can't see you two in person

176
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,879
even if I want to.

177
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Ask him.

178
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,839
No.

179
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,600
Am I that easy to pursue?

180
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,600
Right.

181
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:03,959
Before I left,

182
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,079
there was a period of time

183
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,360
when Yu Tu was very down.

184
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,000
It seemed like

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,120
you tortured him quite badly.

186
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,639
How was he down?

187
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,079
What is your phone's model,

188
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:13,560
Zhai Liang?

189
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,879
What's the matter? Are you planning
to get a new phone?

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,839
If your phone doesn't die

191
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,519
in a few more minutes

192
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,639
I'll consider it.

193
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,160
Fine I'll show you some respect.

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,079
Cotton.

195
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,680
I'll still call you that.

196
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,040
Add me on WeChat.

197
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:25,519
I'll give you detailed scoops.

198
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,120
Okay.

199
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I'll check his WeChat later

200
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,199
and I'll send you my contact card.

201
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,040
He's letting you use his WeChat

202
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,639
so randomly nowadays?

203
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,879
Yu Tu.

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,240
Don't you have a limit to how low
you can go?

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,080
Cotton, add me.

206
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,679
Add me.

207
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,399
Let's chat later.

208
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,039
Okay.

209
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,559
I think

210
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,279
my phone doesn't have
a problem at all.

211
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:56,320
Come on.

212
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,960
Let's play a game and see.

213
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,879
Okay.

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
You dare to play with him?

215
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,440
It should be a while

216
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,200
since he last played.

217
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,799
He only had 50 percent skill.

218
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,399
Now it should be down to 20 percent.

219
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
You're shameless.

220
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:17,240
Are you bearing a grudge?

221
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,679
Why are you slandering him this way?

222
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Bearing a grudge?

223
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,159
Did he ever drag me down?

224
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,720
It's hard to say.

225
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,639
I'll remember

226
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,840
what he said

227
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,799
Mr. "Not worth a glance" Yu

228
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,720
about Ms. "Seen Everywhere"
Qiao Jingjing.

229
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,440
Enjoy the game.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,720
I haven't arrived yet.

231
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,639
Don't start team fights now.

232
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,840
Don't be a coward. Come on.

233
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,120
I got three of them!

234
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,679
Wait for me.

235
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,879
You started too early.

236
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:12,840
Why are we on the first floor?

237
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,200
Have you forgotten which floor
my house is on?

238
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,240
What?

239
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,240
Yu Tu, you're in Cotton's house?

240
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:19,519
(The microphone is off.)

241
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,180
(Hand-picked Cotton)

242
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,740
(Double Kill!)

243
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Is someone else playing?

244
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,159
What are

245
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,159
you two doing?

246
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,840
You're insulting my ears.

247
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,159
Listen to my instructions.

248
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,840
Go on the top lane.

249
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,900
(Victory)

250
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,000
You were right.

251
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
So Panicky's skill is only 50 percent.

252
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:06,480
You're the most incredible one.

253
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,559
Let's do a duo matchmaking later.

254
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,039
I'll go and get something.

255
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
My mailbox's pin

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,559
may be the same

257
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,320
as my door's

258
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,200
but didn't you

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
press it a little too smoothly?

260
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,559
I'll make sure to do it
less smoothly next time.

261
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,799
It's too late.

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,200
Why is your letter

263
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
in my mailbox?

264
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:35,960
Play fewer games

265
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
and eat more carbs.

266
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,159
What do you mean?

267
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,799
The brain needs sugar to think.

268
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,759
You sent this letter to me.

269
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,080
I remember now.

270
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,320
In the ninth letter you said

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:50,879
that I might not receive

272
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,039
one of the letters before New Year.

273
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,039
It's regarding
the Jade Rabbit.

274
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Jingjing.

275
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,840
When I was writing this letter

276
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,279
guess what I was thinking.

277
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,039
What?

278
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,919
This letter is a bit deep.

279
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,559
While writing this back then,

280
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,039
I was wondering
that when you received this letter,

281
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,679
would I be able

282
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,519
to read it to you

283
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,360
and help you answer your questions?

284
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:20,200
Do you want to listen to it?

285
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,120
(Jingjing.)

286
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,360
(While I'm writing this letter)

287
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,039
(the Jade Rabbit model
is right in front of me.)

288
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,400
♪Looking back in time
and meeting the past again♪

289
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,159
(One day)

290
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,159
(if you see it in my house)

291
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,200
(you'll surely like it very much.)

292
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,799
(The model is very small.)

293
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,759
(The real Jade Rabbit)

294
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,440
(is actually not big either.)

295
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,840
♪I write down my greetings for you
in my heart♪

296
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:53,140
♪Trying to piece together the reason
for my longing♪

297
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,700
♪It's the look in your eyes at a moment
in my memories♪

298
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,220
♪Today can you feel it♪

299
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,300
♪The stars in the sky can attest♪

300
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,740
♪That you're the one I want to find♪

301
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,700
♪In my dream♪

302
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,700
♪Carved in my memories♪

303
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,860
♪Is your courage♪

304
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,980
♪That makes me want to treasure it♪

305
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,440
You're making me feel sleepy.

306
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,759
Go to bed earlier then.

307
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,639
You still have a flight tomorrow.

308
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:53,080
Don't you need to pack your luggage?

309
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,440
This morning

310
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,840
I already asked Xiao Zhu to do it.

311
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
She didn't need to come
in the afternoon.

312
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:04,799
Go.

313
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,000
The subway won't be available later.

314
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm staying over tonight.

315
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,200
I'll sleep on the couch.

316
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,600
Jingjing.

317
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,120
I'll take the initiative in the future.

318
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:22,519
But I'm not very experienced

319
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:23,480
in taking the initiative.

320
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
If it's out of line

321
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,000
remember to tell me.

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,639
For example

323
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,240
is it out of line for me

324
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,159
to stay over tonight?

325
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,000
Your flight is at 8 AM tomorrow.

326
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,840
To go with you to the airport

327
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,360
should I

328
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,039
come here at 4 AM from my house?

329
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
You're going to send me off tomorrow?

330
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,039
Do you require so little

331
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,879
from your boyfriend?

332
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,600
Even while I'm on vacation,

333
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,679
I don't need to send my girlfriend off
at the airport?

334
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,200
It's not out of line.

335
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:18,919
It's not out of line.

336
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,879
I really like you this way.

337
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,679
Jingjing you're up so early...

338
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,960
Mr. Yu.

339
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,000
Good morning, Xiao Zhu.

340
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,639
Good morning.

341
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,440
Why are you here?

342
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,639
You came so early in the morning?

343
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,159
I stayed over last night.

344
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,440
Jingjing just woke up.

345
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,360
I'll call her.

346
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,360
Come in.

347
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:17,759
He stayed over?

348
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
She just woke up?

349
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,639
Jingjing, Xiao Zhu is here.

350
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,960
I'll be done soon.

351
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,360
Have you had breakfast?

352
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,600
I ordered some breakfast.

353
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:37,360
I ate already.

354
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,639
I brought some breakfast today too.

355
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,360
What did you buy?

356
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,799
Xiao Zhu you're here.

357
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,559
Corn

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,799
boiled egg

359
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,279
soy milk.

360
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,279
I want to eat something with flavor.

361
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,480
I have that.

362
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,639
Deep-fried dough sticks.

363
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,359
And look

364
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,839
I got rice balls.

365
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:09,000
Forget it. I'm overweight.

366
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:11,799
I also brought some.

367
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,720
This is so sweet.

368
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,240
I'll get fat.

369
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,680
I ordered one with no sugar.

370
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,279
This one isn't sweet.

371
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,319
You might have gotten the one
from the meal.

372
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,839
I just drank something with flavor.

373
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:44,880
Now I feel sad

374
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,880
drinking soy milk

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,119
with no flavor.

376
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,440
Do you mind if I drink some?

377
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,319
Try it.

378
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,279
Is it sweet?

379
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

380
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,839
Well...

381
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,240
Excuse me.

382
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,759
I have a question.

383
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,200
In the future

384
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,559
is it not convenient for me
to come in directly?

385
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,839
Should I knock first

386
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,920
then ring the bell

387
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
and wait for someone to open the door?

388
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,799
I got it.

389
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,440
You don't need to answer me anymore.

390
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,039
I'm already

391
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,319
a very mature and sensible assistant.

392
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,759
Xiao Zhu.

393
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:50,680
Where are you now?

394
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,119
We're at the airport.

395
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:52,960
We're in the parking lot.

396
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,920
We'll be right there.

397
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,799
I'm at the elevator area

398
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:56,480
of B2.

399
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,000
Tell Mr. Wang not to go the wrong way.

400
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,319
Today's driver isn't Mr. Wang.

401
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,400
What do you mean?

402
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
I see you now.

403
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,279
Ms. Ling, over here.

404
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:24,799
Ms. Ling, Happy Spring Festival.

405
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,440
Mr. Yu?

406
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
Why is it you?

407
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
The way you look now

408
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,880
is similar to how I did

409
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,680
when I opened the door this morning

410
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,400
and saw Mr. Yu.

411
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,640
This morning?

412
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,240
Opened the door?

413
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,960
Okay.

414
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,759
I'll prepare the PR plan immediately.

415
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,839
Mr. Yu.

416
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,599
From now on

417
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160
please wear a mask.

418
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,480
From now on

419
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,759
this will be a must when you go out.

420
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,480
Later

421
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,559
will you be going back to Yixing?

422
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,559
Yes.

423
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:05,319
For the Spring Festival this year

424
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,079
I can take my vacation
until seventh day.

425
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,599
I'll go home

426
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,319
and let my mom criticize me
for a few more days.

427
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,519
I'll go inside first.

428
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,160
Until when
will you be filming this movie?

429
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:19,960
It will be quick for movies.

430
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,119
Around beginning of May.

431
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,279
Will you be back
in the middle of filming?

432
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,319
It's hard to take days off
from the film set.

433
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,759
There's a brand event

434
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:28,720
in the middle of filming

435
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,079
but the location is not set yet.

436
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,400
I might not be in Shanghai.

437
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,799
So

438
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:34,960
we might

439
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,039
not be able to see each other
for two months?

440
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,519
I guess so.

441
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,119
What's the matter?

442
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,200
I realize
that I was overthinking before.

443
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,279
I thought that I went
on business trips a lot

444
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,000
and I was too busy with work

445
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,359
so I wouldn't have time to take
good care of you.

446
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,119
But in reality

447
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,319
you go on business trips

448
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,440
more than me.

449
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,720
Who's the one delaying someone's youth?

450
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,759
Is it worth it?

451
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,559
It doesn't matter who delays it.

452
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't have any objections.

453
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,880
I couldn't look at you two.

454
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,400
You were in public.

455
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,920
Weren't you afraid of getting
your photos taken?

456
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,559
Be honest with me.

457
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:47,799
When

458
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,119
did you start dating?

459
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,960
Was it just the past two to three days
when you went home?

460
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,839
Did you start dating a long time ago?

461
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,720
Hey.

462
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,279
Can you stop giving us

463
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:02,119
such a big surprise?

464
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:02,920
I need time

465
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,559
to prepare.

466
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,559
Tell me

467
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,960
the details now

468
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,240
so I can prepare the PR plan.

469
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,720
Jingjing.

470
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Did you hear

471
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,799
what I just said?

472
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:17,880
I'm thinking of something
even more important.

473
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,759
What else can be

474
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,240
more important than this?

475
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,440
Dating.

476
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:27,319
A long distance relationship
is very hard.

477
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,279
I have to think

478
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,119
about what to do.

479
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,940
(Jingjing)

480
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,039
(Have you arrived?)

481
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:17,680
(Nice meeting you.)

482
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,839
(Guess who I am.)

483
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,920
(Nice meeting you. Who are you?)

484
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,799
(I'm your mobile girlfriend.)

485
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,160
(AI Jingjing.)

486
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,500
(Yixing Station)

487
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,799
(What did you have for breakfast?)

488
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,740
(Actors get in position!)

489
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,100
(My pay will get deducted!)

490
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,680
(My breakfast)

491
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,300
(Received one unread message)

492
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,039
(You made that yourself?)

493
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,519
(I can't believe
that you can make breakfast!)

494
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,920
(I can only make breakfast.)

495
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,039
(You're returning to work
starting today?)

496
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,640
(Today)

497
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,000
(we're officially starting filming too.)

498
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,119
(You're only starting today?)

499
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,400
(We had the table read and confirmed
our looks these days.)

500
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,480
(We'll start filming today.)

501
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,599
(I'm a bit nervous.)

502
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,480
(You still get nervous
when filming nowadays?)

503
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:29,359
(I've never worked
with Director Li before.)

504
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,400
(Why are you up so early?)

505
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,839
(What time does your work begin?)

506
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:35,839
(9 AM.)

507
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,960
(But I usually arrive at 7 AM.)

508
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,559
(You sleep late and wake up early.)

509
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,359
(Do you get enough sleep?)

510
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,440
(Sleeping four to five hours
is enough for me.)

511
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
(I hate you.)

512
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,759
(That was why your grades were so good.)

513
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,519
(While ordinary people)

514
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,880
(like us were sleeping)

515
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,720
(were you secretly studying?)

516
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,480
(In the future,)

517
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,039
(you can observe me
in a close distance.)

518
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,799
(By the way you're AI.)

519
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,440
(Considering yourself
an ordinary person)

520
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,480
(isn't appropriate.)

521
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,559
(I'm sad.)

522
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,799
(I'm shutting down.)

523
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
You're here so early again?

524
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,319
I came earlier to organize some files.

525
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:26,880
(I'll be at the conference room
in the morning.)

526
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,200
(My phone won't be with me.)

527
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,759
(Okay I'll wait
to hear from you backstage.)

528
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,400
(I'll only get reactivated
after hearing from you.)

529
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,960
Here have some yogurt.

530
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,480
There are the original

531
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
and white peach oats flavors.

532
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,359
Choose one.

533
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,640
Thanks.

534
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,079
You eat at the canteen daily
and you're still taking photos?

535
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,359
I'm reactivating

536
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,480
my AI app.

537
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,319
Which app is reactivated this way?

538
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,759
The online dating kind.

539
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,400
(There's a lot of food!)

540
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,799
(Are they delicious?)

541
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:27,300
(Ms. AI)

542
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,319
AI girl?

543
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,519
Interesting.

544
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,519
There's such a thing in WeChat?

545
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,319
Is it a Wechat robot?

546
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,039
It's so smart.

547
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,079
I guess you can call it that.

548
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:52,880
(They taste very good.)

549
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,480
(You're at the office canteen?)

550
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,400
(We have five canteens
in the institute)

551
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,839
(just like how it was in university.)

552
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,319
(Bring me there for a meal next time.)

553
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,720
(I haven't eaten in a canteen
for so long.)

554
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:04,599
(That's not right.)

555
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,599
(Your office is confidential.)

556
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:06,680
(Am I not allowed inside?)

557
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,240
(You can enter)

558
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,759
(but you must leave your ID
at the gate.)

559
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,039
(Do you mind?)

560
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,200
(Why should I mind?)

561
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,440
(My ID picture is as beautiful
as a fairy.)

562
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:19,960
(That's good.)

563
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,200
(Actually mine isn't bad either.)

564
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,720
It turns out that Mr. Yu

565
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,039
is very narcissistic too?

566
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,359
What are you talking about?

567
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,200
If he's really narcissistic

568
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,799
he can defeat everyone here.

569
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,039
But you don't need to be so arrogant.

570
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,799
You're filming quite smoothly
over there.

571
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,200
I'll go ahead then.

572
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,880
Where will

573
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,160
the starlight activity be held?

574
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,640
Why didn't we

575
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,839
hear anything this year?

576
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:03,519
It's so late.

577
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,559
The internal organizers

578
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,160
still have some differences in opinions.

579
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,440
But don't worry.

580
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,720
I expressed

581
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,000
that I hoped it would be held in Shanghai.

582
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,039
I thank you on behalf of Mr. Yu.

583
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,240
There's no need.

584
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,640
He isn't willing to let me manage him.

585
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,759
You're still not giving up?

586
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Now I think

587
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,279
that if Mr. Yu

588
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,759
gets into the entertainment circle

589
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,680
he won't become famous either.

590
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:23,720
Why?

591
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,680
Mr. Yu is so handsome

592
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,440
and he's so smart.

593
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,359
But he's transparent.

594
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,680
He has an invisible effect.

595
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,759
Haven't you noticed?

596
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,640
What?

597
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
He had been going to your house

598
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,240
for over a month before

599
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,398
and no one took any photos of him.

600
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,400
Of course

601
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,599
when you were together

602
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,759
you didn't go out often.

603
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,200
I can understand that.

604
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
But at the airport

605
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,079
and in your hometown

606
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,000
you two were so open and brazen already

607
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,160
and still no one exposed you.

608
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,400
Isn't he transparent then?

609
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,920
(Ms. Ling said that you were transparent.)

610
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:08,759
(Transparent?)

611
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,640
(I can confirm that light rays
can't penetrate me.)

612
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:14,319
(What a lame joke.)

613
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,319
So why am I invisible?

614
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,440
It's very strange.

615
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:24,160
Before

616
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,440
you went in and out of my house
for over a month

617
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,440
and no one took any photos of you.

618
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,039
It was the same
in the KTV hall back home.

619
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,640
There were so many people

620
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,799
yet no one exposed us.

621
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,599
I know the reason

622
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,279
for the latter.

623
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,640
Peipei added everyone there

624
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,359
to a group chat

625
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,160
and gave everyone money.

626
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,799
Really?

627
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,000
She didn't tell me.

628
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,799
I'll return the money to her.

629
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,599
I'm so touched.

630
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,519
I gave it to her already.

631
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,400
Initially she didn't want to take it.

632
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,160
She said that you gave her
a lot of clothes.

633
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,759
But she quickly thought things through
later on.

634
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,119
She said that she couldn't let me
have the advantage

635
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,559
and even asked me to pay her
to keep her mouth shut.

636
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,519
I knew

637
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,440
that she was acting strange that day

638
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
saying that she earned 500 bucks.

639
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
She said that she'd return it to us

640
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,559
as a wedding gift in the future.

641
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:01,519
I think that's very reasonable.

642
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
How much money did you give?

643
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,720
Around half a month's salary.

644
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,720
That much?

645
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,240
Then they should have just exposed us.

646
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,039
What a loss.

647
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,079
I'll deduct it from my betrothal gifts
in the future then?

648
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:17,480
I'm going to memorize my script. Bye.

649
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,920
A good boyfriend won't disturb

650
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,559
his girlfriend's work.

651
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:31,880
A good boyfriend

652
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,400
won't mention the betrothal gift
for now.

653
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:34,279
Okay?

654
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,400
Then be good. Don't make a sound.

655
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,359
I'm going to memorize my script.

656
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,680
"Please show me some respect.

657
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,920
26 years ago..."

658
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,200
"Please show me some respect.

659
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,559
26 years ago..."

660
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
What are you doing?

661
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,119
Writing a letter.

662
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,559
(Yu Xiaoqiao)

663
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,759
(Trip to Mars)
(17 years old)

664
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,799
(a grade 10 student in a senior high
somewhere in Shanghai.)

665
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,720
(Since she bought fried chicken
for the classmate)

666
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,960
(who tutored her in Math)

667
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,160
(she accidentally won a prize.)

668
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,559
(She got a ticket)

669
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,480
(for a trip to Mars this summer.)

670
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,119
What's this?

671
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,240
I promised that I'd answer your question
regarding the immigration to Mars.

672
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:43,880
Have you forgotten?

673
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,200
Why is there a lead character?

674
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,279
Yu Xiaoqiao?

675
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
Numbers are too boring.

676
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,640
If there's a lead character

677
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,079
and we use her point of view
as a narrator

678
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,799
you might find it more interesting.

679
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,400
This must be hard on you.

680
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,160
You just combined our surnames together.

681
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,039
This name

682
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,319
is so random.

683
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,720
Is it random?

684
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,680
We're still very far
from immigrating to Mars

685
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,839
so the lead character should be

686
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,640
our future generation.

687
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,839
There's a possibility of her
having that name.

688
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,240
Okay.

689
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:14,680
Write your letter well then.

690
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:15,720
I'm going to memorize my script.

691
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,240
You're talking about betrothal gifts

692
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,519
and future generations.

693
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,079
That makes sense

694
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,720
but why

695
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
does she need a tutor in Math?

696
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,799
Didn't she get

697
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:36,759
your genes?

698
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,640
That's a question for you, Ms. Qiao.

699
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,039
Will you allow my genes

700
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,559
to influence your genes?

701
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,079
Will you let me memorize
my script or not?

702
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,599
