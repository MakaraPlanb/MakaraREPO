13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 14=

14
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,560
My choice is...

15
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:55,760
Yu Tu.

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,199
He's so cute!

17
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,240
That's one big secret
Jingjing had kept.

18
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
He's Jingjing's friend.

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,599
Of course he's extraordinary.

20
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:27,520
You look a little nicer than usual.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
A little, you say?

22
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,439
Come here, man.

23
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,520
Stand on my side.

24
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,120
Let me guess.

25
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,840
Are you part of the showbiz?

26
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,879
No.

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
We're from the same high school.

28
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,680
From the same high school?

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,479
Actually, we also went
to the same middle school.

30
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,479
Sounds like you're destined.

31
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,159
You went to the same
middle and high schools,

32
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,800
but what about college?

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
Unfortunately, not.

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,039
After all, I didn't go to Tsinghua.

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,520
So I trust that you play well.

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,879
How long

37
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,360
have you been getting along?

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Actually,

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,639
we kinda

40
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,919
lost contact for many years.

41
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,560
It was getting into this game

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,439
that brought us back together.

43
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,840
In fact, there are really
many examples of this.

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,960
Honor of Kings has really

45
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
brought many people closer.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,759
It has given mere acquaintances

47
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,719
a sense of mutual understanding,

48
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,479
and even tied some knots.

49
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,400
I wasn't referring to you.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,639
If we end up trending,

51
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,599
I'll come after you.

52
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,520
Please don't.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,759
(Jingjing, you're the best!)

54
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,400
Oh no.

55
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,360
Do you remember

56
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,639
that exposé on Jingjing

57
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,800
from high school?

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,800
And now,

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
she called up Mr. Yu,

60
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,159
a Tsinghua graduate,

61
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,120
saying she knew him
at high school.

62
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,879
It's absolutely certain

63
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,159
that netizens will dig it up.

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,840
And then someone will figure out

65
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,319
that it was Mr. Yu

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,360
who dumped her.

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,120
It was also written

68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
that he already had a girlfriend.

69
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,439
I hope they don't think of her

70
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,680
as stepping in between.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,360
To me, what the emcee said is right.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,800
Honor of Kings is indeed

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
a game that can

74
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,719
restore old friendships

75
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,479
separated by time.

76
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,520
It's through this game

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,639
that I met a lot of my old classmates,

78
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,919
and some old friends.

79
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,240
We all managed to catch up
with each other

80
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,919
while chatting over our game.

81
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,479
But most of them

82
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,399
are already busy
with their families and careers.

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,120
Unlike Mr. Yu.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
He's remained single for so long,

85
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,399
and he so happened to be on vacation.

86
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,480
So I thought,

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,680
I'd treat him to a game.

88
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,560
(A Message from Li Ming)
(Yu Tu.)

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,879
(Look at high school class chatting group.)

90
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,319
(There's a post)

91
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,800
(about you and Qiao Jingjing.)

92
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,959
No way.

93
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,120
You were the top student,

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
yet you're still single now?

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,680
Don't change the topic.

96
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,079
But I also find it peculiar.

97
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,120
Not to mention,

98
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,639
he plays so well.

99
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,839
Nothing peculiar.

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
So are you.

101
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,480
Top student makes a comeback.

102
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,920
But Jingjing is clever.

103
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
She brought it up right away
so articulately.

104
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,120
Mr. Yu is getting along really well.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,240
They know each other
better than we think.

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
Mr. Yu is so responsive.

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
It's really a pity

108
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
for him to not join
the entertainment industry.

109
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,800
Okay, I'll do the dubbing.

110
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,839
Ace!

111
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,519
Thank you for speaking up.

112
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,560
Now we know

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,160
that good looks

114
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,639
won't get you out of singlehood.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,439
Come to think of it,

116
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,800
it's a little inspiring.

117
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,920
(Check the time.)

118
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,560
(Get with introductions)

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,399
(and start the game.)

120
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:24,879
All right.

121
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,920
Mr. Yu, as you've witnessed

122
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,079
before coming on stage,

123
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,480
I'd like you to introduce yourself

124
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
just like those before you.

125
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,000
That is, your ID, rank and profession.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,879
And then, we'll start the game right away.

127
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,240
Hello, everyone.

128
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,240
My ID is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,480
My rank is

130
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
King 50 stars.

131
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,040
And I work as...

132
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,560
an aerospace engineer.

133
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,519
An aerospace engineer?

134
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,240
That's amazing.

135
00:05:59,240 --> 00:05:59,879
Do you build rockets?

136
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,000
I know CZ-5.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,759
No.

138
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,879
I work on deep space exploration.

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,879
What an expert!

140
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,839
That's it from me.

141
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,000
Contestants, return to your teams

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,560
and take your seats.

143
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,500
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)

144
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,879
We worked pretty well

145
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,959
in the last match.

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,600
For this one,

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,399
let's see their lineup,

148
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,639
and strategize accordingly.

149
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,439
By the way,

150
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,560
can you play the Marksman

151
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,720
to make up for Snow?

152
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,319
Sure thing.

153
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:30,879
Good.

154
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,800
But,

155
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,040
Their bans in the last match

156
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,240
were aimed at Jingjing,

157
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
but they didn't expected that

158
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,759
Jingjing's Donghuang Taiichi

159
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,680
played brilliantly.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,279
So they should realize by now

161
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,839
that they had strategic issues.

162
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,519
If a casual game

163
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,920
doesn't do Global BP,

164
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,720
(Global BP: Each team member
can only pick one hero per round.)

165
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:45,920
the bans

166
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,839
would probably go to

167
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,160
the three non-pro players' heroes

168
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
from the last round.

169
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
As you can see,

170
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,839
the BPs are swapped

171
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,360
for the second round.

172
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
The blue team, the Star-reaching Team,

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,439
and the red, the Good Luck Team.

174
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,079
The Star-reaching Team
will ban and pick first.

175
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,879
You mean, they will ban Donghuang,

176
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,000
Bian Que and Kai?

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,959
That's very likely.

178
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,279
The non-pros' hero pool

179
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:03,240
is relatively shallow.

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,680
(Star-reaching Team)
They'll probably make do with one or two.

181
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,839
To ban them,

182
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,920
it can disrupt

183
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,000
their entire lineup.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,160
So ban Donghuang?

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,120
Good.

186
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,720
The blue team

187
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,199
has banned Donghuang Taiyi.

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,040
How respectful of them.

189
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
It's a token of recognition

190
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,480
for Jingjing's prowess.

191
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,439
The second ban is Kai.

192
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,079
It's also

193
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,000
the hero they previously used.

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,959
That's right.

195
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,240
They're really banning

196
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,319
the heroes we used last round.

197
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,759
Good Luck Team has banned Meng Ya,

198
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:26,079
(Good Luck Team)
followed by Marco Polo.

199
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,480
They also exercised their special right

200
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,639
to ban Gongsun Li.

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,399
That's three Marksmen banned.

202
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,600
The legendary Snow

203
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
is a master of our time,

204
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,120
but Wine Among Flowers
is out for now.

205
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,519
That's right.

206
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,759
They're out of heroes.

207
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,319
Jingjing.

208
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,399
We won the last round.

209
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,279
Shall we push further in this round?

210
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,759
In last round,
the Star-reaching Team pros

211
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,879
were too kind to that streamer.

212
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
If they keep this up this round,

213
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,240
the first hero to pick

214
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,519
should be for a Marksman.

215
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,079
We once studied together

216
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,600
the streamer's hero pool.

217
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,439
He'll likely take Consort Yu,

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
so we should be able to get

219
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,199
Baili Shouyue.

220
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,079
You mean...

221
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,600
I'll play a Mid.

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,959
You play a Marksman.

223
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,319
Good Luck Team is focusing their BP

224
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,920
on Wine Among Flowers' hero pool.

225
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,680
All his three Marksmen

226
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
have been banned,

227
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,600
leaving only Consort Yu.

228
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,700
(Star-reaching Team)

229
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Gongsun Li couldn't carry just now,

230
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,639
it made sense for him to switch

231
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,079
to Consort Yu

232
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,839
for this round.

233
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:21,399
We'll see

234
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,480
which Marksman
Good Luck Team will choose.

235
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,199
Before that,

236
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,040
let's see what they've got

237
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,079
for their first and second heroes.

238
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,240
Jingjing's Donghuang Taiyi got banned.

239
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,839
What will she take now?

240
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
Chill.

241
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,439
Our Jingjing

242
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:32,240
isn't only good at one Support.

243
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,279
Look, Cai Wenji isn't banned.

244
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,559
Cai Wenji sounds good.

245
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,559
(Good Luck Team)
She swept Cai Wenji right away

246
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,919
after her first-round selection was banned.

247
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,080
That's right.

248
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,159
Jingjing previously played Donghuang

249
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,000
when Cai Wenji was banned last round,

250
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,720
so this round she's taking

251
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,879
Cai Wenji to peel.

252
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:43,639
Right.

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,759
Shouyue.

254
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,440
Shouyue was chosen by the rookie.

255
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,039
I mean, Jade Rabbit.

256
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,360
Because he's Snow's replacement.

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,799
Yes.

258
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,360
Actually, to use Shouyue

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,840
in your first game

260
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,279
is quite risky.

261
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,200
That can be nerve-wracking.

262
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,320
Yes, it gets awkward if he misfires.

263
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,399
This is just a casual game.

264
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,200
Two mids got banned,

265
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,519
that is Wan'er and Shen Mengxi.

266
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,039
Next is the fourth hero
used by Nine Tomatoes.

267
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,159
She's chosen

268
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,879
Zhou Yin's Pei Qinhu.

269
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,600
This is

270
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,159
assigning the midlane counter-attack

271
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,039
to fan of Jingjing,

272
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,200
Nine Tomatoes.

273
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Besides that, let's see.

274
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,919
Pig Rider chose Ganjiang.

275
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,080
I think Pig Rider got angry

276
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,720
because Diaochan failed to pounce.

277
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,039
That's right.

278
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,879
He was about to unleash
his signature hero.

279
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes.

280
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:19,960
And the last

281
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,159
midfield counter-attack is...

282
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,600
Really?

283
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,279
Zhuge Liang?

284
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,639
He locked it so decisively.

285
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
Just like that.

286
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
Everyone on the livestream is commenting

287
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,360
that Jingjing can only support

288
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,600
rather than fight.

289
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,039
She's only riding on coattails.

290
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,639
Says who?

291
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,080
I saw it too.

292
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
They're all jeering at her,

293
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
saying that she's incapable.

294
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,720
Let me see.

295
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,027
(She won't do so well because Cai Wenji
is all she has to against some pros.)

296
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,159
This is outrageous!

297
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,879
Who told them

298
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,039
that support is not important?

299
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,513
(I know her strategy a little bit.
Playing support is a great idea anyway.)

300
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,759
It's because Bian Que

301
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,799
was a relatively passive

302
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,240
kind of mage.

303
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:47,759
Yes.

304
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,559
While Zhuge Liang is relatively

305
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:48,960
intensive to control.

306
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
- Wait a second.
- Fa Ci.

307
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,900
(Change)

308
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,440
(It's peaceful at the Great Wall today.)

309
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
No, they're changing.

310
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,679
They're changing.

311
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,360
Is it Baili Shouyue?

312
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,320
No way.

313
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,440
Still looking for what they want.

314
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,440
Five seconds to go,

315
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,840
and they're still choosing.

316
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,000
Jingjing wants Baili Shouyue.

317
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,200
This hero's name is Baili Shouyue!

318
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,399
Three, two, one!

319
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,240
There it is,

320
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:15,519
they're locked!

321
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,720
That's it, really!

322
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
No way!

323
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,879
Baili...

324
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,039
Nice!

325
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,559
She chose Baili!

326
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,039
Let's look forward

327
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:26,759
to our endoser,

328
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,840
Qiao Jingjing's Baili Shouyue!

329
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,680
(Enemy minions will arrive
in five seconds.)

330
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,600
(Please be ready.)

331
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,840
All right,

332
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,600
both teams

333
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
have finished selecting.

334
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
We were very surprised

335
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,759
to see that Jingjing has taken

336
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,840
Baili Shouyue,

337
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,000
such a difficult hero,

338
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,879
while her handsome companion got himself

339
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,799
Zhuge Liang.

340
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,159
We just can't wait!

341
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,799
So, we have the blue team,
the Star-reaching Team,

342
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,399
and the red team, the Good Luck Team.

343
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,840
It's game time.

344
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,140
(Good Luck Team)

345
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,039
I'm a little nervous.

346
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,879
Who do I go with?

347
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,279
You as support, go with Shouyue.

348
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,480
You're okay going alone midlane?

349
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah, no sweat.

350
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,559
Cai Wenji, don't be nervous.

351
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,960
Our lineup

352
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,679
is highly fault-tolerant.

353
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,000
Besides, we have Zhou Yin.

354
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,000
We have Zhou Yin.

355
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,360
Guys,

356
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,679
don't resonate like this.

357
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,440
You're making me feel lonely.

358
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,240
Come on, Jingjing!

359
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,039
Jingjing sticks to the wall.
She's discreet.

360
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,480
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing)
Increasing move speed with her passive

361
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,639
to check the blue side's jungle.

362
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,679
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing's first person view)
I think for this round,

363
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,559
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing's first person view)
we should leave the rest

364
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,320
and turn our attention

365
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,840
to Jingjing's Baili Shouyue.

366
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,360
Though it sounds a bit harsh.

367
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,919
Yes.

368
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,860
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing)

369
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,279
There goes our first shot.

370
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,720
(You broke in yourself.)

371
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,679
Got it!

372
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,320
Yeah!

373
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,519
The hit rate is currently at 100%.

374
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,399
Every dog has its day.

375
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,399
That's normal.

376
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,080
I knew

377
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,559
you wouldn't praise Jingjing.

378
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,580
(Star-reaching Team got no moves,
even I can take on them.)

379
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
She's making another hit.

380
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,559
Will it be 50

381
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:01,120
or 100 percent?

382
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,399
Re-aim.

383
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,639
She's not holding back.

384
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,200
There goes the second shot!

385
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,759
What a pity, it missed.

386
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
Not too bad.

387
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,120
I thought it was pretty accurate.

388
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,120
That was a good shot.

389
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,200
Actually I predicted

390
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,440
that she'd miss anyhow.

391
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,159
Thankfully, I nailed the first shot.

392
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,360
If I missed two shots in a row,

393
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,559
I would've been a laughing stock.

394
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,519
It's tough being an idol.

395
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:18,879
Of course.

396
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,559
You drew first blood

397
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,879
while chatting with me?

398
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:25,879
First blood is drawn.

399
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,879
Let's take a look at the replay.

400
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:28,000
I see both sides on the midlane,

401
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,759
laning against each other,

402
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,200
and Jade Rabbit was savage!

403
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Hua Mulan, you leveled up?

404
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,519
- Right away.
- You're level two.

405
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,360
You're so weak.

406
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,559
How did you do that?

407
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,279
It's unexpected, Pig Rider.

408
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,799
I think he's annoyed.

409
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,759
I put one player

410
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,080
on the midlane,

411
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,320
and you killed it.

412
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,919
That's right.

413
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:44,519
By the way,

414
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,320
a hero like Zhuge Liang

415
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,159
can get so comfy

416
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,399
- after drawing first blood.
- Yeah.

417
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,440
It was very smooth.

418
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,799
Can you please not chat

419
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,279
during a teamfight?

420
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,399
Be serious.

421
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,600
If you mess up
because you're fooling around,

422
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
my image as an idol will be gone.

423
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,200
I won't.

424
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,720
Let's take a look.

425
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,240
After Zhuge Liang got the advantage,

426
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
what will he do?

427
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
Hua Mulan is clearing the minions.

428
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,360
Let's get him.

429
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,039
On my way.

430
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,380
(Good Luck Team: Zhou Yin
Good Luck Team: Jade Rabbit)

431
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,639
Caught on the road.

432
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,080
A tragic end for Hua Mulan.

433
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,000
That's too bad.

434
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Zhuge Liang's ultimate skill

435
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
did not land.

436
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,960
Killing Spree.

437
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,559
It was a direct kill.

438
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
I'm here to make a kill.

439
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,799
Ganjiang is out of skills.
We can kill him.

440
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,279
On my way.

441
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,413
(Star-reaching Team: Pig Rider)
(Good Luck Team: Zhou Yin, Jade Rabbit)

442
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,879
Pig Rider makes his pursuit,

443
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:24,399
and bites off Zhou Yin!

444
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,399
Nice shot!

445
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,279
Good Luck Team does
a Mid-Jungler synergy

446
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
and builds up their momentum.

447
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Just a few minutes in,

448
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,559
and let's take a look.

449
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,840
With a huge monetary lead

450
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,679
and an advantageous lineup,

451
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,879
Pei Qinhu and Zhuge Liang

452
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,840
are being played to the fullest.

453
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,320
Especially

454
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,039
when we all know

455
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,440
Zhou Yin is famous for getting cocky
when things are better.

456
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,000
He acts like that in a match

457
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,720
and it's more obvious

458
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,559
in a casual game.

459
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,519
Surprisingly enough,

460
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,919
Jade Rabbit can

461
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,960
work with him so well

462
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,600
as an amateur midlaner.

463
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,720
He's a force to be reckoned.

464
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,879
Two against five.

465
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,600
You'd be cocky

466
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,639
if you don't retreat!)

467
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,240
Zhuge Liang is also about

468
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,679
to be taken down by Zhao Yun.

469
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,720
Pei Qinhu retreats to the tower.

470
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,960
They messed up in this fight.

471
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,159
I told you not to mess up.

472
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,480
Did you all get so arrogant?

473
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,799
You don't usually mess up like that.

474
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
- It's the Junglers.
- It's the Mids.

475
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,559
Where do you guys come from?

476
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,279
This Mid-Jungler Synergy
by Good Luck Team

477
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,480
has put a lot of pressure
on their opponents.

478
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,519
Pig Rider's Ganjiang

479
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,360
is leaning downward.

480
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,759
The Star-reaching Team must
have ideas in this wave.

481
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,200
Looks like Pig Rider

482
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
is charging at Jingjing's Shouyue.

483
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
She has to be careful.

484
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,360
Jingjing, Ganjiang's coming your way.

485
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,159
Watch out.

486
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,559
Ganjiang moves up.

487
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,799
He sees Shouyue.

488
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,519
Camouflage, and he misses!

489
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,879
His ultimate skill also misses!

490
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,200
It widens the distance
and shoots him on the spot!

491
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Pick up the phone.

492
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,200
Continue.

493
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,660
(Damage)

494
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,840
Spectacular!

495
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,799
Simultaneous hits!

496
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:24,960
It stands to reason

497
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,480
that their timing and damage
were all clear-cut!

498
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,000
You're right.

499
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,080
It has to be said

500
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,879
that Jingjing's shot

501
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,080
was very critical,

502
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,320
and also very precise.

503
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,759
Reasonably, it was astonishing.

504
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,799
I didn't expect that.

505
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,440
I also thought

506
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,879
that Jingjing would just pass off.

507
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,159
Whoops,

508
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,159
I spoke too soon.

509
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,840
But even so,

510
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,679
I love her too.

511
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,200
Show me the live barrage.

512
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,853
(I'm a little surprised.
That was a clean shot.)

513
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,207
(She must have trained for it.)

514
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,320
It was refreshing.

515
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,399
I could boast about that shot
for ten years!

516
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,559
It was so clear-cut!

517
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,840
I'm going around.

518
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,240
Jingjing, go and give it all.

519
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,919
You sound a little scummy.

520
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,399
You have plenty of health.

521
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,159
Here it is.

522
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,360
The star of the show is ready.

523
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's take a look

524
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,039
at the dying tower.

525
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,639
But Shouyue's not leaving.

526
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:06,600
He keeps going forward.

527
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Zhuge Liang's got him,

528
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,879
and didn't take him down.

529
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,440
It's broken.
Zhang Fei's out of ultimate skills.

530
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,679
(He flashes, he steps,)

531
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,679
(and sends him off!)

532
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,600
(Unstoppable.)

533
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
He's wiped out.

534
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:15,960
And if you watch closely,

535
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,679
his movements in this wave

536
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:17,919
were all predetermined.

537
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,559
He pretends to retreat

538
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,519
while he's actually going around.

539
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,200
After this wave is over,

540
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,000
the momentum is basically all in

541
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,759
the hands of the red team.

542
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,639
That's right.

543
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:27,840
He Liu,

544
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
how much money
are you behind?

545
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,399
Over 3,000, but still good.

546
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:30,759
Hua Mulan,

547
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,799
don't come over now.

548
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,399
All right.

549
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,039
Just lead us well.

550
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,639
All right.

551
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,440
Let's make this quick.

552
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,279
Force them to a teamfight.

553
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,120
Don't give them a chance to farm.

554
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,080
We have the edge now.

555
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,960
We can try.

556
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,039
Wait till the minions reach the tower.

557
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,559
I'll engage.

558
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,960
Lv Bu made a big pounce.

559
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,919
He is too rash in this attack.

560
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,679
- They're throwing.
- They gave us an opening.

561
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,559
They are so daring!

562
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,759
Not a single pounce landed.

563
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,720
Zhang Fei makes three roars,

564
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
Zhao Yun counter-attacks,

565
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,960
Zhuge Liang didn't chop off Pig Rider,

566
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,480
and Pig Rider turns back around!

(Good Luck Team. Ace)

568
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,759
To be honest,

569
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,079
Our amateur player,

570
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,920
Lv Bu did pounce a bit early.

571
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
Battle Bear, you're more of a tiger

572
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,440
than a bear.

573
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,240
We messed up.

574
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
It's my fault...

575
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I've engaged early.

576
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
It's okay, they're doing great.

577
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:20,480
My Bright Moon will respawn soon.

578
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,519
I'll backdoor later.

579
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,640
When Lv Bu

580
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,920
caused an Ace in the last wave,

581
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,480
both teams are neck-to-neck

582
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,640
in terms of money.

583
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,279
Lv Bu, retreat.

584
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,440
The minions are almost cleared.

585
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,960
You're going nowhere.

586
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,680
Lv Bu goes a little too far in this wave.

587
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,599
He'll get caught!

588
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,640
He has no ultimate skills,

589
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,799
so he's done for.

590
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,960
Zhang Fei does a big cross flash!

591
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
(Jingjing, you're the best!)

592
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm in a good position.

593
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,759
We can win this fight
if I surround them.

594
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,240
Zhuge Liang's got a nice spot!

595
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,400
No one notices him!

596
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,000
Now.

(Good Luck Team: Jade Rabbit)

598
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,039
Consort Yu doesn't hold back
her ultimate skill,

599
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,279
delivering a fatal crush
while stepping back!

600
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,599
Zhao Yun was inflicted,
but the damage wasn't great!

601
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,880
Bright Moon dodges his Skill 2.

602
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,440
Zhuge Liang makes his ultimate skill

603
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,400
and crushes again!

604
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,559
His Skill 1 staves off a double combo.

605
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,319
He does a passive...

606
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,480
Triple Kill!

607
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,039

608
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,799
There's one more!

Nice move!

615

Just to stick the audience
to their seats,

616
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,720
isn't that a fourth?

617
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,240
You're exaggerating.

618
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,519
We won.

619
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,920

Like I always do.

has brought the house down.

one of the King of Amateurs!

627
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,880
The Zhuge Liang was awesome-sauce.

628
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,279
I didn't think

629
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,559
Qiao Jingjing can make a kill.

630
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,319
She's so damn awesome,

631
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,319

632
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,400
I'll go home and watch the rerun

633
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,599
just so I can see how they did it.

634
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,510
There's a lane. Hit the heights.

635
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,240
Without Dark Tyrant and Ruler,

636
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,640
they're going to go head-on at them.

637
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,319
They're about to push the crystal.

638
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,480
Isn't it a bit too reliant
on ultimate skills?

639
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,160
Zhang Fei's doing an ultimate skill.

640
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,039

641
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,319

Lv Bu still pounces pretty well
in this wave.

Right in between two players,

645
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
he shoots twice at Zhao Yun.

646
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,400
Jingjing, be careful when you aim.

647
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,440
Shouyue does a quick scope,

648
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,200
and takes down Zhang Fei.

and takes damage.

and thrashes Consort Yu!

Yes.

Hit the crystal.

Hit it...

I'd like to call upon both teams

709

to take the centerstage.

710
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,599

Great.

Congratulations again
to the Good Luck Team.

713

It's a pity

714
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,079
that the Star-reaching Team has lost.

715
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,519
Do you have anything to say

716
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,839
to the audience this time?

717
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,519
It's a real pity.

718
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,279
But,

719
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,200
we were really glad

720
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,039
to have come this far.

721
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,240
At the same time,

722
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,119
I was also very fortunate

723
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,000
to be sniped incessantly

724
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,079
by my 'goddess'.

725
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:57,160
What about your teammates?

726
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,000
We didn't expect

727
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,440
to lose the second round.

728
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:02,400
I guess we somehow took them lightly.

729
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,440
You played well with Zhuge Liang.

730
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,599
And your Shouyue was sharp.

731
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,279
As for Zhou Yin,

732
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,519
enough said.

733
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,440
I couldn't stand seeing it.

734
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,519
All right, thank you once again.

735
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,279
Could you please

736
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,920
give them another round of applause?

(Zhou Yin, Heliu)

738
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:28,839
You know, Jingjing

739
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,880
made the most astonishing
performance today.

740
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,079
Do you guys agree?

741
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes!

742
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,759
All I know is,

743
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,440
we're in for another round
of exchanging praises.

744
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,160
But can you please

745
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,079
show a little restraint?

746
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,720
Let me talk a little more, okay?

747
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,799
She is

748
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,559
the most powerful female player.

749
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,759
You're flattering me, okay?

750
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,160
Speaking about mosts,

751
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:47,799
I'm probably

752
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,279
wearing the highest heels today.

753
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,200
I just saw you almost fall.

754
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,440
So, Jingjing...

755
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,200
how are your heels?

756
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,319
My feet...

757
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:57,720
My heels?

758
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
I'm just kidding.

759
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,400
Jingjing did great.

760
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,200
Her Baili Shouyue

761
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,000
was a spectacle.

762
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,960
I was astounded.

763
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,319
Were you specially trained?

764
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:05,880
Yes.

765
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I saw you worked pretty well

766
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
with your classmate.

767
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,319
Especially in the wave
against the Pig God.

768
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,079
Do you usually team up like this?

769
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,400
He plays Zhuge Liang,
you play Shouyue?

770
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,839
Actually, no.

771
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,440
He can play in any position.

772
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,319
Any hero will do.

773
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,200
So,

774
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,599
he's been teaching me.

775
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
I also saw

776
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
that Zhuge Liang

777
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,119
was too sloppy with his movements.

778
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,680
You did great yourself, young man.

779
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:28,559
Have you thought of

780
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,759
joining a pro league?

781
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,319
No,

782
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,240
he's too old for that.

783
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,519
Now you've fallen out with him?

784
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,359
Have you forgotten

785
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,640
how much he backed you up
as his ex-classmate?

786
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,319
That's how it should be.

787
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,799
Right?

788
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,160
Yes.

789
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,359
What do I do?

790
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,960
I can't help but scream!

791
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,960
I feel like

792
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,200
I'm not attending a game,

793
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,119
but I'm watching
Jingjing's idol drama!

794
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:53,960
That young man...

795
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,519
I so approve of him!

796
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,279
Me too.

797
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,119
Jingjing, Jingjing...

798
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,519
Oh my gosh!

799
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:06,559
You were fantastic!

800
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm more thrilled
than you winning a prize.

801
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,319
You sound like

802
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,880
I won an official prize.

803
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,079
Almost everyone is praising you

804
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,599
for that Triple Kill.

805
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,240
Your fans are deifying you!

806
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,559
Ms. Qiao?

807
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,599
I'd like to invite you

808
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,119
to present this year's Toplaner Award.

809
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,759
You may rest at the guest's corner.

810
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:21,480
All right,

811
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,000
I'll be heading there.

812
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,920
Go ahead.

813
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,599
Thank you for your hard work.

814
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Jingjing hugged me

815
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
so many times today.

816
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,799
I feel like I'm going to be her fan.

817
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,000
Two to zero,

818
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,039
and even a Triple Kill.

819
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:42,880
I didn't expect

820
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,559
such a wonderful ending today.

821
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,200
Mr. Yu?

822
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,279
Thank you.

823
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,240
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

824
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,759
I'm so glad to have you.

825
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,839
Thank you.

826
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
You're welcome.

827
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,240
By the way,

828
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,559
we've prepared some gifts

829
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,599
for our five lucky winners.

830
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,319
In addition,

831
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:58,680
they may choose one hero figurine.

832
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,960
Could the two of you please select...

833
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,519
By the way,

834
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,000
you may rest at the lounge,

835
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,799
where we've prepared

836
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,519
snacks and drinks.

837
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,759
Sure, thanks.

838
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,640
Thank you.

839
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,920
Let's go, Mr. Yu.

840
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:22,039
That was brilliant.

841
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,799
Watching the match at the venue

842
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,000
was exhilirating.

843
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,519
The last two waves of teamfights

844
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,440
almost made my heart jump out.

845
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,200
Did the tension make you thirsty?

846
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,519
Here, have some water.

847
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Get some for Mr. Yu too.

848
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,240
Sis.

849
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,319
Client was very pleased
by today's outcome.

850
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:37,799
I believe

851
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:39,240
that Jingjing's brand endorsement

852
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,279
is set for a renewal.

853
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,599
Come on.

854
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:42,680
Let's wish her well in advance.

855
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,319
Mr. Yu.

856
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,039
Here.

857
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,400
Ms. Qiu!

858
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,720
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiu.

859
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,160
I am so sorry.

860
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,079
Hello there.

861
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,200
I was so busy today.

862
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,680
I couldn't get to you

863
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
because I had to

864
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,960
hand over some prizes.

865
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,759
What do you mean?

866
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm in really good hands.

867
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,799
But you see,

868
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,319
as soon as I entered the VIP room,

869
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,160
I started to regret it.

870
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,160
I thought I should've
come down to watch,

871
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,039
where I could feel
the buzz all around.

872
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Great.

873
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,960
Next time, I'll arrange
for you to come down.

874
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,599
OK?

875
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,279
No problem.

876
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,319
Mr. Yu,

877
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,119
you may sit down for a while.

878
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,119
We have to talk.

879
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:22,599
Sure, go ahead.

880
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,720
This way, Ms. Qiu.

881
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,759
Sure, please.

882
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,440
Goodbye, Mr. Yu.

883
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,880
Congratulations to Sweet Dream
for winning

884
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,200
the most popular Toplaner of the year.

885
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,519
(TG, you're the champion)
Congratulations once again.

886
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,200
You may step down

887
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,839
and take a break.

888
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,559
Thank you.

889
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,599
Our next award

890
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:37,519
is the Most Popular Botlaner
of the Year.

891
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:38,599
Please watch the big screen.

892
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,279
Ms. Qiao,

893
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,480
you may rest there.

894
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
In half an hour,

895
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,480
there will be a photo session.

896
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,039
Right this way.

897
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,039
Jingjing.

898
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,880
As for our nominees

899
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
for the Most Popular Botlaner

900
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,559
this time around,

901
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,319
we have five of them.

902
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,079
They all come

903
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,319
from various categories.

904
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,119
One of them is good at using

905
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,680
Phantom-type Marksmen.

906
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,880
For example, Houyi, Luban VII,

907
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,279
Huang Zhong, Jialuo,

908
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,799
they are all undisplaced Marksmen.

909
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,119
Jingjing,

910
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,279
your Baili Shouyue was spectacular.

911
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,559
Is he your favorite hero?

912
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,359
Yes.

913
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,519
He was so sharp,

914
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,119
especially with those two shots
at Pig Rider.

915
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,279
Actually,

916
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,440
it's mainly because I was lucky,

917
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,599
and my hands were nimble.

918
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,480
Tell me before you guys take off,

919
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,440
okay?

920
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,599
I'll take you through a safe passage.

921
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,400
Sure.

922
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Where's Ling?

923
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,279
She and Zhu

924
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,000
are having a meeting with the clients.

925
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,440
She told her chauffeur
to drive you home.

926
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,519
Your coat.

927
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:43,799
Thanks.

928
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:50,920
Did you retrieve it?

929
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,680
A lot of people watched me.

930
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,000
Your phone.

931
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,759
Ling said she'll catch up in a bit.

932
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,839
Let's go home first.

933
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,640
But we're not heading the same way.

934
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,119
There's a subway station nearby.

935
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,119
I can go by myself.

936
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:39,319
Hang on.

937
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,400
You can't go out all alone.

938
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:42,200
The folks are now scattered outside,

939
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,559
queuing up at the exit.
