1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,159
That's all

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,800
for the presentation.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,239
We welcome any comments or questions.

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,040
After the discussion,

5
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,040
the panel of experts

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,319
agree unanimously that

7
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,560
Proposal SK-1 is both innovative

8
00:01:02,919 --> 00:01:04,040
and refreshing.

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,760
However, aerospace belongs to
systems engineering.

10
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,360
The prerequisite

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,480
of your proposal is

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040
an engine with high specific impulse.

13
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,319
Why are you

14
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,279
so quiet today?

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Feeling down?

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,160
Is it that bad?

17
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm not someone chatty to begin with.

18
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,760
But during the defense just now,

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,000
you were so...eloquent.

20
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,040
And now, you look moody.

21
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,040
Why? Discouraged?

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,239
Didn't we

23
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,559
anticipate this already?

24
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:46,760
It's a research project

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,199
huge research project on a new model.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
Rome wasn't built in one day.

27
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
It's not that.

28
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:57,839
You're right.

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,440
You've been brooding

30
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,919
for several months.

31
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,000
Guan Bo,

32
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,599
I was looking for you.

33
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,720
I have a question.

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,400
I...

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
We'll talk later.

36
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
Due to a cold front,

37
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,440
expect

38
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,639
a drop in tonight's temperature
in Shanghai.

39
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,960
Welcome to the navigation interface.

40
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,160
Traffic jam anticipated.

41
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,559
Please leave earlier.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
Hi, everyone.

43
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm current in the

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,559
Shanghai Exhibition and Convention Center.

45
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,639
The anniversary event

46
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,119
of Penguin TV shall begin soon.

47
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,279
A resplendent night

48
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,080
awaits us here.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,559
Let me hear

50
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,360
your applause and your passion.

51
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:59,160
Look at the live scene.

52
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,240
Our fans have all

53
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,919
gathered here.

54
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:02,919
One more hours

55
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,399
till the opening ceremony

56
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,919
but everyone has arrived

57
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,360
at the scene.

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,759
It will be a resplendent night.

59
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,639
Due to a cold front,

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,839
expect

61
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,039
a drop in tonight's temperature
in Shanghai.

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,760
Traffic jam anticipated.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,279
Please leave earlier.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,559
Jingjing, there will be traffic.

65
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,760
We should leave earlier.

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
It will be cold tonight

67
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,920
so bring a jacket with you.

68
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:37,839
The Best Actress for this year is

69
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Qiao Jingjing!

70
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,280
=You Are My Glory=

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,480
=Episode 1=

72
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,320
Look at this!

73
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,200
Your high school friend said that

74
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,440
you were humiliated and rejected
by a guy in high school.

75
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,160
Some of your high school friends
are haters?

76
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,079
(Sir Drama, I have an explosive news.)

77
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,760
(I went to the high school in Y city.)

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,320
(A very popular female celebrity)

79
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,279
(was my classmate.)

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,720
(Let's call her Q for now.)

81
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,279
(In high school,)

82
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,000
(Q wasn't pretty at all.)

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,839
(She looked so different.)

84
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:22,959
(Plastic surgery, I bet.)

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,399
(Back then, she wasn't)

86
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,320
(the prettiest girl.)

87
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,640
(It was another girl.)

88
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,399
(There was a smart guy in our class.)

89
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
(He's quite handsome too)

90
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,839
(so Q confessed to him)

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,160
(but she was)

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
(rejected mercilessly.)

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,559
(He said that he wanted someone smart.)

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,200
(In the end,)

95
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,320
(the smart guy went to)

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,359
(the Tsinghua University with her.)

97
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,119
(They became a couple.)

98
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,000
(That's what I called
a match made in heaven.)

99
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:42,480
This is crossing the line!

100
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,160
He can't slander her like that.

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,040
Calm down.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,920
The fans have already come to you defense.

103
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,399
(If that is true,)

104
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,799
(please also tell everyone that)

105
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,079
(Jingjing was in the elite class)

106
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,320
(and she graduated from a 211 university.)

107
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,079
(She was bad academically?)

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,920
(Impossible!)

109
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
And now I'd like to ask

110
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,760
the victim in question:

111
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:06,880
are they real or fake?

112
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,679
Some are real, some are fake.

113
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,000
That one about me being ugly was fake.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
I've always looked this good, okay?

115
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,119
Also,

116
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,119
he rejected me, yes,

117
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,239
but it wasn't ugly.

118
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,320
He was really polite.

119
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,359
So you admit that

120
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,679
you confessed to him

121
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,519
but got rejected?

122
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,160
Yes.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,720
That guy...

124
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,079
(Yu Tu)

125
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
was cute

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
and really smart.

127
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,559
So did he really

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
think that you're dumb

129
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,959
and so he chose the other girl over you?

130
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not dumb. You are.

131
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
I graduated from a 211 university.

132
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,040
(Jingjing,)

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,320
(check out the screenshot I sent you.)

134
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,959
(Which jerk said that?)

135
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,519
(You have always been pretty.)

136
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,640
(You were just a bit...unpolished.)

137
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,640
(By the way,)

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,279
(I heard from Li Ming that)

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,080
(Yu Tu and Xia Qing broke up)

140
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,359
(when they were in
the fourth year of university.)

141
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,719
(They were together for around a year.)

142
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:36,440
(You still remember Li Ming,)

143
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,000
(our high school friend?)

144
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,880
(He lived in the same area as Yu Tu.)

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
(Their parents know each other.)

146
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,159
(I heard Yu Tu is now in Shanghai.)

147
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,679
(Speaking of which, Jingjing,)

148
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,520
(do you think Yu Tu
regrets rejecting you?)

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,119
(Don't be this childish.)

150
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:25,760
Yu Tu.

151
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,359
Do you have a moment?

152
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,479
I have a question.

153
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,200
Sure, go ahead.

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,479
Do you want a girlfriend now?

155
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:35,679
If so,

156
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,760
what do you think of me?

157
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,599
Sorry.

158
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I want someone

159
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,479
who can work together with me.

160
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,919
(But who you found)

161
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,880
(didn't stick with you till the end.)

162
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,520
It's already 10PM.

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,280
Should we

164
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,840
return to Shanghai?

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,960
We'll leave tomorrow morning

166
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
and arrive at Hengdian World Studios
in the afternoon.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,760
I'll ask them

168
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,039
to postpone your scenes.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,520
No.

170
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:04,679
I have ten scenes tomorrow.

171
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go to Hengdian now.

172
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,320
Ask the driver to drive slowly.

173
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,039
Look how tired you are.

174
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,159
Mister,

175
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Hengdian it is.

176
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,039
No problem.

177
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,760
Thank you.

178
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,719
An exam?

179
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,039
How many calories
does a strawberry have?

180
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,039
That's tough.

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Even a brainiac won't know the answer.

182
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,479
Jingjing.

183
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,919
Jingjing.

184
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,080
Wake up!

185
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:43,719
Did you play Honor of Kings?

186
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,520
Xiao Qiao,

187
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,159
you can become stronger.

188
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,479
This Xiao Qiao was you?

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Congratulations.

190
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,880
You're famous on Weibo now.

191
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,840
Look.

192
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,559
First in trending:

193
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,440
Qiao Jingjing, a fake gamer,

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,000
sending ripples through
the entertainment

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and the e-sport industry.

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,559
When did you start playing this game?

197
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,799
When I was filming earlier this year.

198
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:19,960
I played it on-and-off.

199
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,479
I didn't play it for long.

200
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,440
In Honor of Kings,

201
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,039
you can be a spectator

202
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,760
and watch people fight,

203
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,719
even record it.

204
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:27,719
Don't you know?

205
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,320
Such a function exists?

206
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,640
You don't know?

207
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,760
Do you even play the game?

208
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,359
I have endorsed the game.

209
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,919
You guys said I was a pro gamer.

210
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,960
Fake it

211
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,280
till you make it, right?

212
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,119
I knew you're like this.

213
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,000
Just one or two compliments

214
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,440
is enough to make you think
you're good at something.

215
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,200
It's serious, you know.

216
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,479
Do you have any idea
how popular this game is?

217
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,960
How many people are lining up

218
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,479
to endorse it?

219
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,719
Some will even do it for free!

220
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,840
Honor of Kings

221
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,359
was supposed to renew
the contract with us.

222
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,080
But with the current drama,

223
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,239
I guess it's gone.

224
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,119
Of course, this is not the worst.

225
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,159
You're an actress.

226
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,280
Endorsement is just a side job.

227
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,719
What's more important

228
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:11,679
is the leading actress role
for Mr. Li's latest movie.

229
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,760
Do you know

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,679
what this new movie

231
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,640
will be called?

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,359
Authenticity.

233
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,479
You're saying that

234
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,000
someone stirred this up

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,440
to get the role for...

236
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,799
Call from Honor of Kings.

237
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,359
Hi,

238
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,080
Ms. Qiu, I'm Alex.

239
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,359
Hi.

240
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:38,640
What's with the trending topic today?

241
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,359
Does that alt belong to Jingjing?

242
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,119
Was she practicing some heroes?

243
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
She was using her alt

245
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,039
to practice heroes
she's not familiar with.

246
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,239
That's why it's like this.

247
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,599
In this case,

248
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,159
you should clarify

249
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,599
on Weibo.

250
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,520
Or else,

251
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,840
you'll put us in a weird spot.

252
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,000
You're right.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,559
We'll do it right away.

254
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:56,799
By the way, Ms. Qiu.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,359
We have had internal discussion
and we believe that

256
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,000
a clarification on Weibo

257
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,799
might not be able to cut it.

258
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,599
We will have an event soon

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,359
and we might be able to turn this crisis

260
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,400
into opportunity.

261
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
What event?

262
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,559
So,

263
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,080
the World Champion Cup

264
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,599
will end in a month.

265
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,280
And then,

266
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:14,919
we'll hold

267
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,640
an award ceremony.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,520
In this ceremony,

269
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,599
we would love to invite Jingjing

270
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:20,840
to play a casual match.

271
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,840
We will select randomly

272
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,599
five lucky players from Weibo.

273
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:25,119
Together with Jingjing, the six of them

274
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,280
will be divided into two teams.

275
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,159
Each team can select

276
00:14:28,479 --> 00:14:31,039
two professional players
as their teammates.

277
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,559
But this is not stipulated

278
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,880
on our contract.

279
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:35,960
The contract also didn't say that

280
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,599
a video like this

281
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,679
would be leaked.

282
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,039
It's just a casual match.

283
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't worry.

284
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,880
Unless Jingjing is...

285
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not about her player skill.

286
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,479
It's that in our...

287
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:46,799
It's okay. I'll do it.

288
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Ms. Qiu.

289
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,640
Hello.

290
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,280
That voice just now was...

291
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,559
It's Jingjing.

292
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,880
As you know,

293
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,640
she's an avid fan

294
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,880
of your game.

295
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Since

296
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,960
Jingjing already said yes,

297
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
I see no point in refusing you.

298
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,760
Let's discuss more in details.

299
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,280
Qiao Jingjing updated her Weibo.

300
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,559
That was the best I could do.

301
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,039
We both have Qiao in our name

302
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,799
so why can't I use you well?

303
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,280
The comments and the reactions

304
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,159
from the netizens seem good.

305
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,159
Many bought

306
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:23,880
her explanation.

307
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,799
However, some still remain skeptical.

308
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,640
Post the message we said just now.

309
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,719
In this year's award ceremony,

310
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,039
the endorser of Honor of Kings,

311
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,000
Qiao Jingjing will have a casual match

312
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,159
with some lucky winners.

313
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,840
Are you excited for

314
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,239
Qiao Jingjing's Xiao Qiao?

315
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,400
Apply now.

316
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,719
After announcing that

317
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,000
Qiao Jingjing will play
in a casual match,

318
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,280
the tide has turned.

319
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,479
Everyone is looking forward to it now.

320
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,599
In fact, everyone thinks that

321
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,280
it's normal

322
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,919
to not be able to perform well
on certain hero.

323
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,000
Look.

324
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,159
Some players came to her defense too.

325
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,679
However,

326
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,760
how good is she?

327
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,000
If she's as bad as she was

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,080
in the video,

329
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,080
then that would be disastrous.

330
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:04,200
We will look bad.

331
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,200
When that happens,

332
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,960
we'll remove her as our endorser.

333
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,400
The dissenting voice

334
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,520
has gone down temporarily

335
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,799
but the casual match

336
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,000
will begin
in around a month.

337
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
Your level

338
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,520
is not good enough for a match.

339
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,640
I have already found

340
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,039
an excuse for you.

341
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:32,799
You really don't have to

342
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,280
take part in this match.

343
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:35,200
Jingjing,

344
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,239
you're too reckless this time.

345
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,599
Jingjing.

346
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,559
Ling,

347
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,200
I don't usually accept a stranger's

348
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
friend request on WeChat.

349
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,760
Don't worry.

350
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll find out

351
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,479
who's behind

352
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,479
all this.

353
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,799
No need for that.

354
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,080
It's my fault.

355
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,599
Don't be mad.

356
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,479
I'm not mad.

357
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,719
The culprit will suffer my wrath soon.

358
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,280
Try to get me the role

359
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,439
from Mr. Li.

360
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:12,920
Okay.

361
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
As for the game,

362
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,719
find someone reliable

363
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,680
to coach me.

364
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,479
This show

365
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,959
will begin shooting in a few days.

366
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,400
Keep the current schedule.

367
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,599
Don't add other things.

368
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,160
I was planning

369
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,599
to give you a 2-week break.

370
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,680
But now that the casual match

371
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,199
is in a month,

372
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,760
you plan to

373
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,199
spend this period to practice hard?

374
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,520
Look.

375
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,760
In the comments,

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,400
my fans voiced their support.

377
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:36,920
If I lose in the match
which will take place

378
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
in a month,

379
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,079
not only will I be mocked,

380
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,920
my fans too.

381
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,599
I see.

382
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:43,560
I'll arrange for it then.

383
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,479
It's my fault this time.

384
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,640
Thank you.

385
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, please.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,199
No need to

387
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,079
to thank me.

388
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,479
I still have one month.

389
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:58,560
I can do this.

390
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,280
No way is this

391
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,359
harder than sit-up.

392
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,239
Of course.

393
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,160
You can do this.

394
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,199
All right. It's 2AM now.

395
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,359
You still have shooting tomorrow.

396
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,040
Sleep early.

397
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:06,560
All right.

398
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,239
Jingjing.

399
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,599
Even though I agree that

400
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,520
sit-up is harder than gaming,

401
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,599
but your abs are nowhere to be seen

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,599
despite the weight loss.

403
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,400
Goodnight.

404
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,880
Really? You can't see it?

405
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,800
Congratulations, Qiao

406
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,239
for completing the shooting.

407
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,359
Yay!

408
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,400
Come, let's take a group photo.

409
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
Look at this camera.

410
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,680
3, 2, 1. Good.

411
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,839
Thank you.

412
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,160
Thanks, everyone. Bye.

413
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,119
Take care.

414
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,640
Good job.

415
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
Bye.

416
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,959
Since you've decided

417
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,199
to play in this casual match,

418
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:18,880
then we have to prepare thoroughly.

419
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Only one goal in mind:

420
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,160
don't let anyone know that

421
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,119
you're a novice.

422
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,640
Once you're back to Shanghai,

423
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,199
you'll need to start training.

424
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,880
Got it.

425
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:26,959
Take this.

426
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,920
You'll use this phone
for the casual match.

427
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,119
Use it

428
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,959
for your practice

429
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,199
so that you can get used to it.

430
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,520
Your account has been created.

431
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,000
No one will know it's you.

432
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
I've also found you

433
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
a professional coach.

434
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:51,920
Who?

435
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,920
A professional player?

436
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,920
I can't wait.

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,719
Here.

438
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,880
My husband.

439
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,119
Are you sure he's good at it?

440
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,800
Guo

441
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,319
is a King player, okay?

442
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:42,880
I decided to ask you to

443
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,280
endorse Honor of Kings

444
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,880
because

445
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
I was inspired by

446
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,800
how engrossed he was in the game.

447
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,920
He's a veteran,

448
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,160
more than qualified to be your coach.

449
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,439
Also,

450
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,599
with our current situation,

451
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,400
I don't dare to find
an outsider to coach you.

452
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,000
What if he or she
shares this with everyone?

453
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,599
Fine then.

454
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,880
Train hard.

455
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:02,160
If you have half of

456
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,560
what Guo has,

457
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,800
then your performance
should be satisfactory.

458
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,520
I still have work.

459
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,040
This meeting room

460
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:08,920
will be your classroom

461
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,880
from now onwards.

462
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,760
Start whenever.

463
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,359
Train hard too, Xiao Zhu

464
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,400
so that you can be her support.

465
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,040
All right.

466
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,119
I'll leave her to you, darling.

467
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,359
Go finish your thing.

468
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,400
Go.

469
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,599
I'll be in your care then.

470
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,920
No need to be so formal.

471
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
We're almost like a family now.

472
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
Ling has told me

473
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,199
about the general situation.

474
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:37,359
Don't worry.

475
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,239
This game is simple.

476
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,280
You can be good at

477
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,520
several heroes

478
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,359
in a month.

479
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,560
Calm yourself down.

480
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,160
Okay.

481
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,280
So let's start

482
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,439
from the basics.

483
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:47,839
Okay.

484
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,040
Let's go to the tutorial.

485
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,040
From the blue side's perspective,

486
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:29,000
this is mid,

487
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,479
this is top,

488
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,400
and this is bottom.

489
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,119
Since

490
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,239
you're new,

491
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,520
let's start with support.

492
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,199
Just follow the marksman.

493
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,199
Okay.

494
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,359
By the way,

495
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,239
Ling told me

496
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,359
about the match rules.

497
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,760
You'll have

498
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,880
two random players

499
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,199
and two pro players

500
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,239
as your teammates.

501
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,319
Honestly,

502
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,680
you can never outperform

503
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:57,479
a professional player anyway.

504
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,359
Professional players

505
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,959
will want to be the carries.

506
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,119
There are carries in this game?

507
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,280
Yes.

508
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,439
There are five positions

509
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,359
in total.

510
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,520
Mid, Jungler, Marksman,
Tank, and Support.

511
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:10,599
The first three

512
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,760
are the carries.

513
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,520
Can I be a carry then?

514
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,239
Do you want to win?

515
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes.

516
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,959
Then play support.

517
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,280
Do you know why?

518
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:26,719
First,

519
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,680
support is easier to pick up.

520
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:31,520
Secondly,
it's not the most pivotal role.

521
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,359
You can definitely be a support.

522
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,199
Let me teach you

523
00:23:36,479 --> 00:23:37,880
some common supportive

524
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,920
skills.

525
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,640
Look.

526
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,760
Let's start from Zhang Fei.

527
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,359
His kit

528
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,520
is quite simple.

529
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,119
Five Tiger Generals,

530
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,319
at your service.

531
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,319
Just like that.

532
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,160
Now, let's queue up and practice.

533
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:29,000
Just follow me, the Hou Yi.

534
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,040
Use your Skill 1 once you're out.

535
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:33,520
Okay.

536
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,839
Your Skill 2 is a shield.

537
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,479
Use it on me.

538
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,359
Good.

539
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,359
if you can use it at the right time,
it'd be even better.

540
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:44,560
Okay.

541
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,479
You're level 4 now.

542
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,520
You can use your ultimate skill.

543
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,520
Use it to blow him away.

544
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,319
Follow my march!

545
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,479
Thank you.

546
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,680
He's about to die.

547
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Why did you blow him away?

548
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,520
I just...wanted to see how it looks like.

549
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,319
It's okay.

550
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,079
Let's continue.

551
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Gao Jianli is after me now.

552
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,400
Hurry

553
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,599
and blow him away
with your ultimate skill.

554
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:10,160
Jesus!

555
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't have much HP left.

556
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,760
Why did you

557
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,839
blow him towards me?

558
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,439
It's okay.

559
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:17,079
Let's continue.

560
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,760
Don't sweat it.

561
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,040
You can do this.

562
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,040
Come.

563
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,199
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

564
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,000
This hero is not meant for you.

565
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,800
So,

566
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,400
let's use another hero.

567
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Let's use Sun Bin.

568
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:44,400
She's quite good.

569
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,760
Try Niumo.

570
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,319
Zhuang Zhou.

571
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,839
Today

572
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,560
is still a fruitful day.

573
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,839
We have found several heroes

574
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:09,079
that don't suit your play style.

575
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,119
Let's not give up

576
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,479
and do this again tomorrow.

577
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,000
We'll definitely find

578
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
your true calling.

579
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,680
Okay.

580
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,160
Yes.

581
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,079
How's the training?

582
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,520
Well,

583
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:50,000
full of surprises.

584
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,040
Oh, my.

585
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,959
You worked hard.

586
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,199
Your arms must be tired.

587
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,040
How's the practice?

588
00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:09,839
Not bad.

589
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,520
We've tried out

590
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,400
all supports.

591
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,439
Really?

592
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Did she find a hero

593
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,319
that she's good at then?

594
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,439
Cai Wenji.

595
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,880
Zhuang Zhou and Yao
are not bad too, right?

596
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,040
Wait,

597
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,640
even though

598
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,959
you're not at your best form yet,

599
00:27:32,199 --> 00:27:33,479
but the random players

600
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:34,719
selected

601
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:35,760
won't necessarily be in King either,

602
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,640
right?

603
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,160
So let's call off tomorrow.

604
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,160
Have a break.

605
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,359
I will revise

606
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,079
a new coaching plan

607
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,479
based on

608
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,880
Jingjing's capability.

609
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,079
Good?

610
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,839
She has to shoot
for an ad tomorrow anyway.

611
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,719
She won't be able to practice.

612
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,520
Jingjing,

613
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,719
go back now

614
00:27:52,719 --> 00:27:53,560
and sleep early.

615
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:55,359
I'll practice

616
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,520
on my phone tomorrow.

617
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,439
I'm not used to this phone.

618
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,800
Don't. Don't.

619
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,160
If people record your game again,

620
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,280
we'll be in deep trouble.

621
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:02,800
One,

622
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,239
I can disable spectating.

623
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,160
Two,

624
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,680
I can use my alt.

625
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:08,959
Disable spectating?

626
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,040
That's...

627
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,680
I've progressed a lot too, you know.

628
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,280
This

629
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,119
is progress.

630
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,520
Which account for the registration...?

631
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:00,719
Thank god I have an alt.

632
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,719
I knew no one

633
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:14,800
would use a weird nickname.

634
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Why won't you teach me math?

635
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,599
Let me create an alt.

636
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,040
All the best!

637
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,000
In the class group,

638
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,319
I did chat, I did go online.

639
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,959
Why didn't he accept my request?

640
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,560
Galaxy.

641
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,079
I'm a forum user from Space Fans.

642
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,599
That was quick.

643
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,880
What should I say?

644
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,520
I almost forgot that.

645
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,079
Yu Tu invites me?

646
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,439
(Yu Tu.)

647
00:33:12,719 --> 00:33:13,280
(You added her?)

648
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,319
(Who is she?)

649
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,000
(Wrong button.)

650
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,199
(A friend on QQ.)

651
00:33:19,439 --> 00:33:20,160
(She's new.)

652
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,479
(Unranked.)

653
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:24,520
Wrong invitation, indeed.

654
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,959
But I won't leave.

655
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,239
You still

656
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:28,280
cause me troubles after a decade.

657
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,520
I'll screw up your game

658
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,160
to make it fair.

659
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:32,839
(Let's start then.)

660
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,520
(Go!)

661
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,000
(What will you play?)

662
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,239
(I'm flex.)

663
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:42,680
You're new.

664
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:44,319
Let's start with support.

665
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:45,880
Just follow the marksman.

666
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:47,800
So you're a marksman.

667
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,640
Don't blame me if I screw you over.

668
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,400
I am Cai Wenji.

669
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,359
Every day, I look fabulous.

670
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
One day, I went to the valley

671
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,599
with my new skin.

672
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,800
I look left and right.

673
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,839
Oh my, what a jolly day!

674
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,280
Even if the marksman dies
for the 100th time,

675
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,120
I am not worried.

676
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,679
I did my best.

677
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,600
If you die then...

678
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,879
Are you ready?

679
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,239
I lost...

680
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,439
None shall resist

681
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,479
my bullet and my good looks.

682
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,679
Is

683
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
Yu Tu good at this game?

684
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,280
Another victory?

685
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,040
It's barely ten minutes!

686
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,600
Will it be too

687
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,080
shameless of me

688
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,280
to join their lobby back?

689
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,040
They invited me by mistake.

690
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,080
School's About to Start So Panicky.

691
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,479
He's a nice guy.

692
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,360
Marksman is good in this patch.

693
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,600
I will play marksman this round.

694
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,959
(Cai Wenji?)

695
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,399
(Sorry, I'm still new.)

696
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:52,159
(I'm noob.)

697
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,800
(Use voice chat. Let me guide you.)

698
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,239
Voice chat?

699
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,000
I finally knew why

700
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,399
Yu Tu, the marksmen main,

701
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:03,239
was willing

702
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,600
to give up the marksman position.

703
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,320
This Cai Wenji is a troll!

704
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:07,320
You're overthinking.

705
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
I just want to show you

706
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,919
how to play Zhuge Liang properly.

707
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,280
Oh no.

708
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,399
They won't invite me

709
00:36:21,399 --> 00:36:22,840
for the next round.

710
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,239
Eat this.

711
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,639
You've walked into my trap.

712
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,360
Unbelievable.

713
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,360
Yu Tu, you kill stealer!

714
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,159
Your Zhuge Liang is not bad, Yu Tu.

715
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,439
I have never seen you pick him.

716
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,560
Zhai Liang always picked mage

717
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,000
so he couldn't pick it.

718
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Easy.
