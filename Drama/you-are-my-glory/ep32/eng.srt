97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,079

the launching requirements,

119
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,079

when I woke up in the morning.

127
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,920
I set an alarm

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,040
and planned to send him off
in the morning.

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,079
I didn't expect him to cancel my alarm.

130
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,279

152
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes. It is.

Jingjing's answer

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,120
is really professional.

170
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,040
It's obvious that she's family to
an aerospace engineer.

171
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
She has been imbued
with the aerospace knowledge.

172
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,720
I am a curious person.

173
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,759
So, I asked a lot of questions.

174
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,839
They are probably at

175
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,879
the measurement and control hall now.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,319
But, don't ask me

177
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,639
what is the difference between
these two halls.

178
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,519
I don't know the answer.

179
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,759

from the space probe team,

182
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,079
only the chief engineer and
the deputy chief engineer will be here.

183
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,639
So, in a while,

184

185
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,559

187
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,519
they will also

188
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,440
announce their success here.

189
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,320
Of course, Professor Zhao
has more experience in this.

190
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
Right.

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,320
Back then,

192
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,200
I went to Jiuquan Launch Site.

193
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,799
It was more than ten years ago.

194
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
The facilities there

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
weren't as good as what Wenchang has.

196
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
Being an aerospace engineer

197
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,360
is not an easy job.

198
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,919
They stayed there for
a few months every time.

199
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,519
At that time, we didn't have
developed communication system.

200
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,600
We could only speak on the phone

201
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
no more than a few times in one month.

202
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,639
Yu Tu stayed in Hainan

203
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,080
for more than half a year too.

204
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

205
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,679
They are doing this

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,679
to contribute

207
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,519
to the national aerospace development.

208
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,399
Fortunately,

209
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,480
things have gotten better now.

210
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Otherwise,

211
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,399
I need to work harder

212
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,879
so that I can work together
with my wife,

213
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,879
and go on work trips together.

214
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't think I can take it

215
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
if I am only allowed to call her

216
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,159
a few times in a month.

217
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,080
Zhang,

218
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
does it mean that

219
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
we can't see the launch
of the rocket from here?

220
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
You can watch it from here.

221
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,480
You can either

222
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,559
watch it on the screen here,

223
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,639
or go downstairs

224
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,039
to watch it from the launch site.

225
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,559
Such a tough decision to make.

226
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,039
I get to see my wife here.

227
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,679
But, if I go downstairs,

228
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,440
I get to see the rocket launch live.

229
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,360
Of course, we have to leave them here,

230
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
and go watch the rocket launch.

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,360
Yes.

232
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,600
They're here.

233
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,320
They

234
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,679
must be really nervous now.

235
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Of course, they are nervous.

236
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,320
Even I felt nervous

237
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,480
when I saw the rocket on the way here.

238
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
This time,

239
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,519
they are receiving a lot of attention.

240
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,720
This is our country's first

241
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,039
Solar System Boundary Explorer.

242
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,080
It's receiving

243
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
a lot of global attention too.

244
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,919
Exactly.

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,879
Family members.

246
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,399
We are very sorry to inform you that,

247
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,639
due to some issues,

248
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,639
we might not be able to

249
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,279
watch the rocket launch here.

250
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,480
We will arrange for you

251
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,720
to go downstairs
to witness the rocket launch.

252
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
Is that okay?

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
Sure.

254
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,639
Okay. Thanks.

255
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,960
This way.

256
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,960
This is not a bad thing.

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,480
At least, we don't have to decide

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,759
whether to stay here,

259
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:25,200
or go downstairs.

260
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,480
Let's go to find a good spot.

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,039
Let's go.

262
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,080
Okay. Let's go.

263
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,879
Let's go.

264
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,399
This is good.

265
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,480
When I'm finally ready,

266
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
they may have already
built the moon base.

267
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,879
Then, the moon will be
my starting point,

268
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,759
as I conquer Mars

269
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:05,639
and escape the Solar System.

270
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,159
(Keep dreaming.)

271
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
(You don't need fuel)

272
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,360
(to dream.)

273
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,120
Peipei.

274
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,039
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

275
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,440
I don't know.

276
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,120
How about you?

277
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:17,960
I don't know either.

278
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,320
I have too many ideas.

279
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,000
But, I believe

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,799
Yu Tu will definitely become

281
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,480
an excellent aerospace engineer.

282
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,519
Why?

283
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,960
Because he likes it.

284
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,440
(We don't need another 40 years)

285
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,080

286

292

00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,097
Great.

382
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,496
Great.

383
00:18:49,014 --> 00:18:50,373
We have accomplished our mission.

384
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,494
Good luck with the space probe.

385
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:53,534
Thanks for your hard work.

386
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,174
The rocket was launched really nicely.

387
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:55,534
This has set off

388
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,014
to a good start.

389
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:58,093
I can finally

390
00:18:58,373 --> 00:18:59,494
have a good night's sleep

391
00:18:59,494 --> 00:19:00,974
tonight.

392
00:19:01,494 --> 00:19:02,494
Good luck!

393
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:11,717
I don't understand this.

394
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:13,758
So, have they succeeded?

395
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:16,118
Yes, they have successfully
launched the rocket.

396
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:17,477
But, Search for God hasn't yet.

397
00:19:22,397 --> 00:19:23,758
Nonetheless,

398
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:26,318
it has set off to a good start.

399
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,060
Deployment of nuclear reactor, normal.

400
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,089
Deployment of the antenna, normal.

401
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:05,530
Positioning of the space probe
has been completed.

402
00:20:05,534 --> 00:20:08,294
Great.

403
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,913
Our honorable leaders,

404
00:20:21,913 --> 00:20:22,793
experts,

405
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:24,313
and colleagues,

406
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
(The destination of our expedition
is the galaxy)

407
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:26,952
according to the bulletin

408
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:30,512
from Aerospace Control Center
in Beijing,

409
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:33,393
Long March 5 Launch Vehicle

410
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,593
is flying normally.

411
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,752
Search for God Space Probe

412
00:20:38,073 --> 00:20:40,873
has been positioned in the orbit.

413
00:20:41,512 --> 00:20:44,432
The nuclear reactor
has been deployed successfully.

414
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,353
I hereby

415
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,593
announce that

416
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:50,232
(China Haijiao Launch Center)
the launching of Search of God

417
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:52,032
is a complete success.

418
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:52,512
Great.

419
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,432
That's great.

420
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,232
Great.

421
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,100
(The destination of our expedition
is the galaxy)

422
00:21:01,353 --> 00:21:02,313
On behalf

423
00:21:02,992 --> 00:21:05,752
of Haijiao Launch Center,

424
00:21:06,712 --> 00:21:07,873
I wish to

425
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:10,712
express my sincerest congratulations

426
00:21:10,712 --> 00:21:12,712
to all the departments and researchers

427
00:21:12,712 --> 00:21:14,712
that are involved in this project.

428
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,952
The rocket launch event

429
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:18,952
will end here.

430
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:19,992
Thanks, everyone.

431
00:21:19,992 --> 00:21:23,833
Yes.

432
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,680
(Congratulations)

433
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,740
(on the successful launch
of Search for God)

434
00:22:03,752 --> 00:22:04,512
Do we look

435
00:22:04,512 --> 00:22:06,232
silly?

436
00:22:06,752 --> 00:22:07,952
We're too happy.

437
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,712
Precisely.

438
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,672
Everyone else has left.

439
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:14,793
We should get going too.

440
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:15,553
Wait a minute.

441
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:16,672
There will be an interview later.

442
00:22:16,672 --> 00:22:18,153
Let's stay for that interview.

443
00:22:26,593 --> 00:22:27,192
At this moment,

444
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:28,472
the hall is filled

445
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,833
with a totally jubilant atmosphere.

446
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,593
Everyone is celebrating

447
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:33,272
the successful launch of Search for God.

448
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:34,353
We are also very honored

449
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,153
to be able to interview

450
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:36,992
the deputy chief engineer
of Search for God.

451
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:38,192
It's Hu.

452
00:22:38,512 --> 00:22:39,353
Hu.

453
00:22:39,353 --> 00:22:40,353
Li, take a look.

454
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:40,833
It's Hu.

455
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,032
I'm overwhelmed.

456
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:42,752
After ten years of hard work,

457
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:44,393
Search for God

458
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:46,232
has finally
embarked on its expedition.

459
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,593
The rocket launch

460
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:48,672
was also flawless.

461
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,032
The navigation of the space probe
was highly accurate.

462
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:51,073
(The launch of Search for God)
This has ensured an ideal environment

463
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:52,113
(is a success)
for our space probe

464
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:53,633
to carry out its following job.

465
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,833
I notice that
you mentioned expedition.

466
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,073
You kept emphasizing this

467
00:22:58,073 --> 00:22:59,432
during the live-stream too.

468
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:00,833
So, Search for God's work

469
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,353
will only start

470
00:23:02,353 --> 00:23:03,393
after the launch, right?

471
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:03,992
Exactly.

472
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:04,793
For a Solar System Boundary Explorer,

473
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:06,472
a successful launch

474
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:07,752
is only the beginning

475
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:08,992
of Search for God's work.

476
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:10,593
It still has a long way to go.

477
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:12,393
We will have many challenges
in the future.

478
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:13,512
(Congratulations on the successful launch)
Search for God

479
00:23:13,512 --> 00:23:14,432
(of Search for God)
has the farthest destination

480
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,153
compared to our nation's
other space probes.

481
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,633
What's so special about it?

482
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,432
Search for God

483
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,313
is set to explore the boundary
of the Solar System.

484
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:21,952
Compared to

485
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:23,593
the exploration of the moon and Mars,

486
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,032
it has to go further.

487
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:26,353
Hence, it will be

488
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:27,512
in a more complex environment.

489
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:28,232
When

490
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,793
we were developing it,

491
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,672
we were faced with
more challenging technical issues.

492
00:23:32,313 --> 00:23:33,472
Has Search for God experienced

493
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,232
any technological breakthrough?

494
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:35,873
Can you

495
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:37,272
briefly tell us about it?

496
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:38,833
For example,

497
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:39,432
for the propulsion system

498
00:23:39,432 --> 00:23:41,192
of Search for God,

499
00:23:41,192 --> 00:23:42,232
we spent two years

500
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,752
researching key technologies

501
00:23:44,153 --> 00:23:44,873
and eventually developed

502
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,153
the nuclear reactor

503
00:23:46,153 --> 00:23:46,793
which later replaced

504
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,353
the conventional solar panel.

505
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,353
(The launch of Search for God is a success)
Thanks for your time.

506
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:51,952
Let us also wish that

507
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:52,752
Search for God

508
00:23:52,752 --> 00:23:53,913
can bring humankind's dream

509
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:55,752
to a further place.

510
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:57,992
Mr. Hu is much more handsome
than usual.

511
00:23:58,313 --> 00:23:59,232
This is probably the charm

512
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,712
that comes with his profession.

513
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:02,793
Jingjing.

514
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:03,313
Why didn't Mr. Yu

515
00:24:03,313 --> 00:24:04,712
take any interviews?

516
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,553
I guess the reporter only interviewed

517
00:24:07,553 --> 00:24:08,752
the person she found good-looking.

518
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:10,833
No one can beat Mr. Yu.

519
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:11,512
Exactly.

520
00:24:13,873 --> 00:24:15,192
Why don't

521
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:15,873
we wait for them,

522
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:16,833
so that we can leave together?

523
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,672
Sure.

524
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:17,992
When are they

525
00:24:17,992 --> 00:24:19,553
coming out?

526
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:20,672
I've no idea.

527
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,032
I'll have to wait for her anyway.

528
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,432
Can you sleep tonight?

529
00:24:23,432 --> 00:24:25,032
No, I can't.

530
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:25,432
We should stay here

531
00:24:25,432 --> 00:24:26,752
and keep each other company.

532
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:27,712
Exactly.

533
00:24:28,393 --> 00:24:29,113
Mr. Zhang,

534
00:24:29,113 --> 00:24:30,512
can we wait here?

535
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,353
Sure.

536
00:24:31,353 --> 00:24:32,073
But,

537
00:24:32,073 --> 00:24:33,232
please don't go anywhere else.

538
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:34,192
We won't.

539
00:24:34,192 --> 00:24:34,752
We won't.

540
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:35,992
Good.

541
00:24:41,512 --> 00:24:42,752
They're here.

542
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,313
They must be from
the launch vehicle team.

543
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:47,313
The space probe team will leave later.

544
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,073
My wife is here.

545
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:52,952
Guys, I'll get going.

546
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,512
Bye.

547
00:25:02,992 --> 00:25:03,672
Here.

548
00:25:03,672 --> 00:25:04,512
Here.

549
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,393
Bye.

550
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:08,393
Mr. Xiao.

551
00:25:08,952 --> 00:25:09,992
You...

552
00:25:10,353 --> 00:25:12,353
Why are you still here?

553
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:14,833
Jingjing.

554
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:16,512
This must be your idea, right?

555
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,353
Yes.

556
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:19,992
You and your husband are the same.

557
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:21,672
You are

558
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:22,793
not only creative,

559
00:25:22,793 --> 00:25:23,873
but also quick-witted.

560
00:25:25,712 --> 00:25:28,113
Yu Tu will take a while more.

561
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,153
But, the rocket launch

562
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,633
was flawless.

563
00:25:30,952 --> 00:25:31,873
So he won't stay too late.

564
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:32,873
I'll wait for him.

565
00:25:32,873 --> 00:25:33,793
Okay.

566
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:34,833
Then,

567
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:35,913
we'll get going.

568
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:36,833
Sure.

569
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,073
Okay. Bye.

570
00:25:38,073 --> 00:25:39,073
Bye, Mr. Xiao.

571
00:25:39,073 --> 00:25:40,032
Bye.

572
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,113
Bye, Mr. Xiao.

573
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:41,633
I will

574
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:42,512

575
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:43,113
I've to go.

576
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:44,833
Thanks for the hospitality.

577
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,073
My husband is here.

578
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:49,913
My husband is here too.

579
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,272
Bye!

580
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:55,153
My husband is here.

581
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,073

We'll get going. Bye.

586
00:26:04,992 --> 00:26:06,192
There are only both of us left.

587
00:26:10,032 --> 00:26:11,553
Hu, over here.

588
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:13,313
Your wife is there.

589
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:14,472
- Well done.
- You too.

590
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:15,313
Take a good rest.

591
00:26:15,353 --> 00:26:15,992
I've got to go.

592
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:16,793
Sure.

593
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:18,633
Over here.

594
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:29,432
Are you waiting for me?

595
00:26:31,672 --> 00:26:33,192
Who else?

596
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:34,353
Where's Yu Tu?

597
00:26:34,353 --> 00:26:35,432
Why is he not here yet?

598
00:26:35,432 --> 00:26:36,593
We left together.

599
00:26:36,593 --> 00:26:37,873
Someone stopped him on the way.

600
00:26:37,873 --> 00:26:39,113
I think he'll be here soon.

601
00:26:45,032 --> 00:26:45,793
We'll keep you company

602
00:26:45,793 --> 00:26:47,153
as you wait for him.

603
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,113
Please don't.

604
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:49,073
Don't interrupt

605
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:50,633
Mr. Yu and I.

606
00:26:58,593 --> 00:26:59,393
Hu,

607
00:26:59,393 --> 00:27:00,593
Yu Tu told me that

608
00:27:00,593 --> 00:27:01,353
you had done several drafts

609
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,593
of your apology letter.

610
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:04,353
Are you done yet?

611
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:11,553
You don't have to apologize.

612
00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:14,913
It was neither of our faults.

613
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,192
Give me some more time
to think about it.

614
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:21,073
We'll talk at home.

615
00:27:23,553 --> 00:27:24,272
Sure.

616
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,672
I think Yu Tu is here.

617
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:49,752
You go ahead.

618
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,633
Don't be the third wheel.

619
00:27:50,633 --> 00:27:51,712
Go.

620
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:53,232
Go.

621
00:28:30,232 --> 00:28:32,032
Is he going to call me?

622
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,793
He's so mean.

623
00:28:43,192 --> 00:28:44,512
He was not calling me.

624
00:28:53,913 --> 00:28:54,672
There will be a lot of challenges

625
00:28:54,672 --> 00:28:55,952
for Search for God in the future.

626
00:28:58,272 --> 00:28:59,593
But, up till now,

627
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:02,873
I've lived up to your expectations.

(Yu Tu)

631
00:29:31,393 --> 00:29:32,593
Did you see it?

632
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:36,472
Yes, I saw it.

633
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:40,073
Congratulations

634
00:29:40,073 --> 00:29:41,272
on the launch.

635
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:49,472
Jingjing,

636
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:52,113

the launch was a success,

637
00:29:52,113 --> 00:29:53,553
everyone else was applauding.

638
00:29:55,113 --> 00:29:55,793
At that time, I recalled

639
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:56,913
what you told me

640
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:58,512
a long time ago.

I finally can

645
00:30:11,192 --> 00:30:12,913
see more stars.

646
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:16,752
