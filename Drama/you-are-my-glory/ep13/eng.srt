14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,640
Hi,

15
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,159
everyone.

16
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:49,760
Welcome to

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,640
today's special live stream.

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,079
So,

19
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,079
what's so special about today?

20
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,640
Behold!

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
(Former pro player of Honor of Kings, Tai)
Hi everyone, I'm Tai.

22
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Welcome, Tai God!

23
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,000
Remember to spam "Awesome Tai God"

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(Awesome Tai God!)
on the screen for five minutes!

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,079
(I love you, Tai God!)
Don't. This is too flattering.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:02,680
So,

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,120
(Tai God, it's time to lose weight)
our special mission today is...

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,120
(When will Jingjing appear?)
We're here for the

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Honor of Kings Award Ceremony.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,719
(Where's Jingjing?)
Indeed.

31
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,159
Yes.

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:08,599
Come join us.

33
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,039
There is a huge turnout today

34
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,599
and our cosplayers

35
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,520
(Time to exercise, Tai God)
have started their performance.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,080
They are so pretty!

37
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,039
(When will Jingjing appear?)
The highlight of

38
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:15,840
today's ceremony

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,080
is none other than the casual match

40
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,199
where our endorser,

41
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,199
(Endorser: Qiao Jingjing)
Qiao Jingjing, will make an appearance.

42
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
(Qiao Jingjing: A fake gamer)
Speaking of which,

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
(Xiao Qiao is not in good shape.)
we've all heard the news

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,240
(She doesn't know how to play at all, isn't?)
that as the endorser of Honor of Kings,

45
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
(#Qiao Jingjing: A fake gamer#)
footage of her

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,039
horrendous gameplay was leaked.

47
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,319
This definitely raised some questions.

48
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,520
(When will Jingjing appear?)
Whether it's the truth or not,

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,599
(How good is Qiao Jingjing as a player?)
we shall see real soon.

50
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
(How good is Qiao Jingjing as a player?)
Remember to give a like for Jingjing

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,840
for she's brave enough

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,520
to come here to show
her player skill.

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,599
(When will Jingjing appear?)
However, I wonder

54
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:37,400
(Looking forward to Jingjing's performance!)
if the fans of Jingjing

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,120
(Looking forward to Jingjing's performance!)
can remain happy after the match.

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
(Trending No.12: Qiao Jingjing attends)
(Jingjing, you're the best!)

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,080
(Honor of Kings Casual Match)
The match hasn't even begun

58
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:43,879
and you're already ranked 12

59
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,639
on the trending list.

60
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,599
I'm getting anxious.

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,199
Ditch that sweater.

62
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,560
It's too long.

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
Look.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
It covers this part.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,000
This pair of jeans is no good too.

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
This is good.

67
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,240
You look cheerful and cute.

68
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,599
A pair of white shoes

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,759
will go well with it.

70
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,560
No.

71
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,599
Stick to heels.

72
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,199
Heels make your legs look longer.

73
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,639
Stop.

74
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,479
Letting it loose like this looks good.

75
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,080
It looks wavy. It's better.

76
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,319
But

77
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,120
if I don't tie my hair up,

78
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,560
it will

79
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,240
block my view later.

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,639
You're right.

81
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,919
Tie it up then.

82
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,039
However...

83
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:28,719
This spot here.

84
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,719
The spot between your hair
and your forehead.

85
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,199
Make sure it has volume.

86
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,199
Volume, okay?

87
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,840
Cute.

88
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,439
This outfit is great.

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
You know,

90
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,000
we can lose the match,

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
but we won't lose

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,439
in the face and legs department.

93
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,840
Don't jinx it, please.

94
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,560
Yes, yes. You'll win.

95
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,439
I just want to

96
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,120
help you to relax.

97
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,360
That said, I have a question.

98
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,919
I remember you were

99
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,840
King 30 stars.

100
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,439
But when I logged in

101
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,360
this morning,

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,719
your rank has dropped a lot.

103
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,719
Bad games lately?

104
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,800
Just drop it.

105
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,840
Mr. Yu spends

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,319
half of his time

107
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,120
forcing me to play alone

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,199
and another half forcing me

109
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,479
to get the Penta Kill.

110
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,800
Is he this strict?

111
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,199
My birthday is at the end of this month.

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,160
What's the hurry?

113
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,519
Don't let the nerves get to you.

114
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,439
Just do your best.

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,399
I have already

116
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,480
talked to the marketing accounts

117
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,800
that are close to us.

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
Even if you lose the match,

119
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,199
we can still

120
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,519
embellish it.

121
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,519
No one knows the outcome

122
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,319
when it comes to e-sports.

123
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,759
If you win, don't show off.

124
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:33,360
If you lose,

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,879
don't say something like
"it's an honorable match".

126
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,879
It's too over the top.

127
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
You're right.

128
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,279
I almost made this mistake.

129
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,920
I have to call the PR.

130
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,240
Tweak this part, please.

131
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Rabbit buff!

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
The award ceremony

133
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
will start at 6 p.m.

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
You still have one hour.

135
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,480
We have prepared

136
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,879
a private green room specifically

137
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,879
for Jingjing.

138
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,040
You can rest there.

139
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,199
No need for

140
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,439
the special treatment.

141
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,639
If possible,

142
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,480
we can share the same green room

143
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
with other athletes.

144
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,040
It's possible,

145
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,759
but they are

146
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,079
in a communal green room.

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,319
Are you sure it's okay?

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Of course.

149
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,000
That'd be great.

150
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,639
You can get to know

151
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,560
everyone too.

152
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,439
Come on, let me show you the way.

153
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,199
Okay.

154
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,120
Sweet talk

155
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,519
the athletes later.

156
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,360
Perhaps they will

157
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,439
go easy on you.

158
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,639
So that's what you have in mind.

159
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,120
Unfortunately, begging for mercy

160
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,800
does not exist

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,560
in our e-sports athletes' dictionary.

162
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,600
Our e-sports athletes?

163
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
She's in the mood already.

164
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,680
As you can see,

165
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,720
I have brought our endorser

166
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,639
here.

167
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
Seize this opportunity

168
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
to ask for photos or autographs.

169
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,399
Have a seat.

170
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,399
Sure, no need to stand up like this.

171
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,600
Have a seat.

172
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,160
Thank you.

173
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,279
Have a seat too, Mr. Zhao.

174
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,560
This place sure is crowded.

175
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,839
Ms. Qiao,

176
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:03,759
can you please

177
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,920
sign on these photos?

178
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,720
It's for the lucky draw

179
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,600
in the event later.

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
I've talked to Ms. Qiu regarding this.

181
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
Come, let me have a look.

182
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,079
By the way,

183
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,319
speak up if you want some.

184
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,319
- Count me in!
- Count me in!

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,160
No problem for the autograph.

186
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,680
However,

187
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm also a fan of several
professional players.

188
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,279
I want their autographs too.

189
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Ms. Qiao,

190
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,480
can I get an autograph?

191
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,079
Sure.

192
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,639
You know my ID?

193
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,120
Of course.

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,480
I watched your match

195
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,680
and live streams too.

196
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,120
You watched live streams too?

197
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,399
I'm the endorser.

198
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,160
Also, I have a match today.

199
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,279
I need to know what heroes they play.

200
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,720
That's called "know thy enemies".

201
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Now that we're here,

202
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,680
should we take a group photo?

203
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,399
- Sure.
- Great!

204
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,879
Please arrange for it, Sun.

205
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,199

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Look here, please.

209
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,639

212
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Makeup's done, I believe?

213
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,800
Prepare for the show entrance.

214
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,680
Gather outside.

215
00:06:59,680 --> 00:06:59,920
Let's go.

216
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,399
- Come.
- All the best!

217
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,040
Good luck!

218
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,680
Break a leg.

219
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,680
Good luck.

220
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,879
Good luck, everyone.

221
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:05,680

222
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
pick me later, please.

I'm Zhou Yin, from Heavenly Palace.

224
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,079
You're shameless. Let's go.

225
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:09,600
Thank you.

226
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,120
Pick me!

227
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
Good luck. Bye.

228
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,639
Oh, youth!

(World Champion Cup)

230
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,879
Good evening,

231
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,079

I'm the emcee, Ying Kai.

235
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,160
The Fall Split

236
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,920
ended last week.

237
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,800
Team Luo Shen

238
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,079
was the champion

239
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,040
and they took the
Silver Dragon Trophy with them.

240
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:38,879
However, honor

241
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,480
does not belong solely to the champion,

242
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,199
but also to those

243
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,199
who labored

244
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,480
for their e-sports dream.

245
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,759
In this year's ceremony,

246
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,399
we have created

247
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,240
12 awards

248
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,920

249
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,600
exceptionally well this year.

261
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,399
didn't do anything else.

262
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,800
(- Yes, I have.)
- No shooting,

263
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,160
no joining other social events.

- Great.

266
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,639
You have toiled hard, Ms. Jingjing.

267

Excuse me, Ms. Qiu.

271
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,600
I just got this message.

272
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
A friend of Mr. Gu

273

is here to watch the match.

274
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have to take care of him.

275

How about this? I'll let Li Li

276
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,919

is this your first time here?

Yes, it is.

327
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,240
Are you nervous

328
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,480
for the match then?

329
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm never nervous.

330
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,200
My teammates

331
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
might be more nervous than me.

332
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,559
Jingjing is never fazed by a huge crowd.

333
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,759
Of course!

334
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,360
I can tell they are getting nervous now.

335
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,919
In fact, we still don't know

336
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,320
who your teammates will be.

337
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,919
It's okay.

338
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,360
Allow me to explain the rules.

339
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,080
Your teammates

340
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,240
will be decided via lucky draw.

341
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,080
But before that,

342
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,559
please introduce yourself first.

343

I'd like to clarify that

365
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,679
this is not rigged.

366
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,440

367
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,240

Do I have to reveal all?

378
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Also, I didn't set them

379
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,120
to private.

380
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,039
It's fine!

381
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,000
All right then. Hi,

382
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,799
I'm Qiao Jingjing.

383
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,840
(Honor of Kings Endorser, King)
I'm the endorser of

384
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,080
Honor of Kings.

385
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm a

386
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,879
King 15 stars player.

387
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,120
15 stars?

388
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
That's quite high.

389
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,360
Well,

390
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:52,120
which hero

391
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
do you usually play?

392
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,039
And which position?

393
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
I heard that
whatever I say on this stage

394
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,919
will be banned.

395
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,080
So no need to know.

396
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
Just know that my pool is deep.

397
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,639
Can't fish info from her.

398
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,279
Our endorser sure is savvy.

399
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,120
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
Now that the introduction

400
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,120
(Award Ceremony)
is done.

401
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,759
Let's move on

402
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,039
to the team up part.

403
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,639
Well,

404
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,840
Jingjing

405
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
and our Mr. Streamer here

406
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,480
are both King players,

407
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,639
so they can't be on the same team.

408
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,320
Now,

409
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,519
staff, please.

410
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,759
Battle Bear.

411
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Congratulations.

412
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:32,720
Lucky Charm Tongtong.

413
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,480
That's me!

414
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,679
Nine Tomatoes.

415
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:37,919
Congratulations.

416
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,679
Thank you.

417
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,480
Jingjing, I'm a huge fan of you.

418
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,200
I signed up for you.

419
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,080
Thanks.

420
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,440
Now,

421
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,000
let's give your team a name.

422
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,039
What's your choice?

423
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,159
We're here to win

424
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:51,200
so we're called Star-reaching Team.

425
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,000
Star-reaching Team.
I love the confidence.

426
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,559
And you, Jingjing?

427
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,200
We've discussed and we believe that

428
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
gaming not only

429
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,360
requires talent

430
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,480
but also luck.

431
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,720
So we're called

432
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,679
Good Luck Team.

433
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,799
All right.

434
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,279
Good Luck Team?

435
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,600
This is an interesting name.

436
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,799
It's also a highly

437
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,360
requested song

438
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,480
in this stadium.

439
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,360
I can hear it

440
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,720
in my brain now.

441
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,960
♪Good Luck, we wish you good luck♪

442
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
And now,

443
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,840
the highly anticipated

444
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
teammates choosing session.

445
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,679
Both teams

446
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,039
are free to choose any two pro players
from the audience

447
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,240
as their teammates.

448
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Let's see

449
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,639
who the pro players are.

450
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,240
Please look at the big screen.

451
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,480
The pro players

452
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,000
sure look familiar.

453
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,080
E-sports athletes are here too.

454
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,919
Now, you have

455
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,240
three minutes to discuss

456
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,559
who you will pick.

457
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,360
It starts now.

458
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:53,799
Okay.

459
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't be so tensed.

460
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm not that bad as a player.

461
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,840
You decide then.

462
00:13:59,159 --> 00:13:59,919
I don't think

463
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,840
the rumor is true.

464
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,919
You're a good player.

465
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,360
I think...

466
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,759
Time's up.

467
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:09,879
Jingjing,

468
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,600
your first choice is...?

469
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,039
Our first teammate

470
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,919
is...

471
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,240
First choice.

472
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:17,720
Zhou Yin

473
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,840
from Heavenly Palace.

474
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,919
Zhou Yin from Heavenly Palace!

475
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,480
Zhou Yin, Heavenly Palace.

476
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
Welcome.

477
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,080
(Zhou Yin)

478
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
(Zhou Yin, Heavenly Palace Jungler)
Welcome, Zhou Yin.

479
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,759
Zhou Yin!

480
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,399
Welcome Zhou Yin.

481
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,519
Zhou Yin is definitely

482
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,039
a star player in the World Champion Cup.

483
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,720
He's quite good-looking too!

484
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,600
Jingjing,

485
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,360
did you pick him

486
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,399
because

487
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,320
he's handsome?

488
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,039
Of course not!

489
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,120
It's because

490
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,360
in backstage,

491
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,519
Zhou Yin said he really

492
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,279
wanted to play with me.

493
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,279
Really?

494
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:51,759
I bet

495
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,480
the athletes down there

496
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,519
must be regretting now.

497
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,840
Yes!

498
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,120
As expected from Zhou Yin,

499
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,720
the social butterfly
in the World Champion Cup.

500
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,440
It's a joke, of course.

501
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
I picked Zhou Yin

502
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,720
because he's a well-rounded player.

503
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,840
He can play every position

504
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,519
and he has a deep hero pool.

505
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,519
I think picking him

506
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,519
will never go wrong.

507
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,600
Jingjing sounds like a pro.

508
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,759
She knows about our athletes'
favorite position

509
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,679
and their hero pool.

510
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Of course.

511
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,000
Before I came here,

512
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,759
I made a list of the top three players
in every position.

513
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,279
Tell us more then.

514
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
I can't. I wouldn't want

515
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,480
to get on their bad side.

516
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Can't fish info from her again.

517
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,759
Now, time for the red side

518
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:30,399
to select two pro players.

519
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,120
Okay.

520
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,519
Our choice is

521
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,879
Pig Rider from WGM

522
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,600
and Heliu from Luo Shen.

523
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,206
(Pig Rider from WGM, Mid, top Mid player)

524
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,740
(Heliu from Luo Shen, Jungler,
top Jungler player)

525
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,279
Okay, welcome Pig Rider and Heliu.

526
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,120
Welcome.

527
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
Wine Among Flowers really knows

528
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,600
who to pick.

529
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,039
He picked the top two players

530
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,000
on this split's MVP list.

531
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,480
A Mid and a Jungler.

532
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,600
The blue side can feel

533
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,360
the pressure now.

534
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,799
Who will be your pick?

535
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,399
Our pick is

536
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,000
Snow from Heavenly Palace.

537
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,399
Okay.

538
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,279
(Snow from Heavenly Palace, Marksmen)
Snow, Heavenly Palace.

539
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,039
Snow!

540
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
Welcome.

541
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,600
I have a question

542
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,519
for you, Jingjing.

543
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,600
You only pick players

544
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,519
from Heavenly Palace.

545
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Are you their fan?

546
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,679
Of course I am,

547
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,399
but there's a strategy involved too.

548
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,600
Honor of Kings

549
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
is a game about teamwork.

550
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
The synergy between each teammate

551
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
is very important.

552
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
That's why I picked

553
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
two pro players from the same team

554
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,399
because I believe

555
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
their synergy

556
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,279
can amplify our performance.

557
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,519
Wonderful.

558
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,000
It seems like

559
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
you're well-prepared.

560
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,720
(That one is from me, not from Yu Tu.)

561
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
She's quite smart.

562
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,759
And now,

563
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,600
both teams

564
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
have completed their roster.

565
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,360
Please proceed

566
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
to the gaming booth

567
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
and prepare for the match.

568
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,519
Now, I'll let the casters

569
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,320
take over.

570
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,279
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
Welcome summoners, whether you're watching

571
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,159
(Honor of Kings World Champion Cup)
this online or are at the scene.

572
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,720
(Caster: Tian Yun, Li Jiu, Gemini)
Welcome to Honor of Kings World Champion Cup

573
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
(Caster: Tian Yun, Li Jiu, Gemini)
Award Ceremony.

574
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm Li Jiu.

575
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,679
Hi,

576
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm Tian Yun.

577
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,600
Hi, I'm Gemini.

578
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,839
We're honored to invite

579
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,680
four pro players to play

580
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,160
in today's casual match.

581
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,839
VIP guests, indeed.

582
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,839
They are

583
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,880
(Good Luck Team)
Zhou Yin, Snow,

584
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,119
(Star-reaching Team)
Pig Rider, and Heliu.

585
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:12,480
Of course,

586
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,400
the highlight of the day

587
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
is none other than our endorser.

588
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,160
The pressure is mounting.

589
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Actually, I have done

590
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,079
my homework too.

591
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,000
I've seen

592
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,680
from Ms. Qiao Jingjing's Weibo that

593
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,759
she really worked hard for today.

594
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,359
After the official account

595
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,880
announced the lucky draw winners,

596
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,640
I checked out

597
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,400
that streamer's video.

598
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,400
He's quite skilled

599
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,839
but

600
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:33,720
he has a shallow hero pool.

601
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,079
In 5v5,

602
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,319
he usually uses

603
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,680
Meng Ya, Marco Polo,

604
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,640
and Gongsun Li.

605
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,720
He picked Pig Rider and Heliu

606
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,359
(Pig Rider, top Mid player in MVP list)
because

607
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,720
(Heliu, top Jungler in MVP list)
he wants to play marksman.

608
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,000
My suggestion is

609
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,759
to ban

610
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,400
the marksmen he's good at

611
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,559
and first-pick

612
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,599
a strong marksman

613
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,519
to counter him.

614
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,839
That way, we'll have one less

615
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,839
King player to face.

616
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,599
Great.

617
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:55,920
What did Qiao Jingjing say?

618
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,519
My idol praised her just now.

619
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,599
I already think that she's smart

620
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,599
when she was picking her teammates.

621
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,680
If she wins this time,

622
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,240
I'll become her fan.

623
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,240
So,

624
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,319
can Qiao Jingjing

625
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,319
perform well

626
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,039
in this match?

627
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:08,559
Good luck!

628
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,599
Will others counter her

629
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,920
(and ban her hero?)

630
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,680
Good luck!

631
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
- We shall see.
- All the best!

632
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,599
Yes, it is indeed intriguing.

633
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,640
Targeting the normal players

634
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,920
is a good strategy

635
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,240
since most pro players

636
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,599
have a deep hero pool.

637
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,200
It'll be hard to counter them.

638
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,799
When it comes to a casual match,

639
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,319
our guests will usually

640
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,400
become the target

641
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,079
or receive

642
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,440
(some special treatment.

643
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,920
That's how a guest will be treated.

644
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,799
Indeed.

645
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,000
(Star-reaching Team)
Can't wait to see if Jingjing

646
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,640
(Good Luck Team)
will become the target

647
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,519
in today's match.

648
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,000
All right.

649
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,160
Now, the Pick and Ban phase

650
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,359
(World Champion Cup)
of the first round.

651
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:37,839
Yes.

652
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,599
Let's see which hero they will pick.

653
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,860
(Good Luck Team)

654
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,293
(Star-reaching Team VS Good Luck Team)

655
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,279
A target ban.

656
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:47,519
How so?

657
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,319
Wang Zhaojun was banned.

658
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:49,680
Indeed.

659
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,039
But what for?

660
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:51,839
It's unnecessary.

661
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,440
The blue side banned

662
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,480
Meng Ya

663
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,680
and Marco Polo.

664
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,680
Yes, target bans against

665
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,759
- Wine Among Flowers.
- Wine Among Flowers.

666
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,480
Indeed.

667
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,559
Cai Wenji, Wang Zhaojun.

668
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,880
That specific?

669
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,279
They didn't target ban
the two pro players

670
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,000
but rather the endorser.

671
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,680
They are focusing on my hero pool.

672
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,799
Oh, Jingjing did post

673
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,880
the match result of these two heroes

674
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,519
on her Weibo.

675
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:17,759
They overcomplicated it.

676
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,400
Jingjing was trained

677
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,200
under the strict Mr. Yu.

678
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,160
She has a deep hero pool too!

679
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,920
Seems like they have

680
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,759
a similar strategy too.

681
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,799
Just target someone

682
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,279
and ban his or her strongest heroes.

683
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,279
However, they miscalculated.

684
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,160
I posted the match result

685
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,359
of these two heroes on my whims.

686
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,119
They are not my strongest hero.

687
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:36,559
But I can only use Cai Wenji

688
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,039
as Support.

689
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,079
Use Bian Que and go mid.

690
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:39,920
I'll be the Support.

691
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,839
Let's play it safe.

692
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,680
Pick Bian Que.

693
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,079
Let them pick Gongsun Li.

694
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:44,759
I can play any marksmen.

695
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:45,640
I can win any lane.

696
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,400
Stay humble, please.

697
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,319
Their first-pick is Bian Que.

698
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,920
(Good Luck Team)
Based on Qiao Jingjing's hero pool,

699
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,759
it seems like

700
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,720
she'll play support this round.

701
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,279
Indeed.

702
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,440
(Star-reaching Team)
Lock in Gongsun Li then.

703
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
If Wine Among Flowers
doesn't pick Gongsun Li,

704
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
then he has no one else to use.

705
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
Zhang Fei is a great pick

706
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
to engage and to peel.

707
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,480
Now on the other side,

708
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,559
the marksman.

709
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,599
His signature hero, Sun Shangxiang.

710
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,160
Heliu's pick

711
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,839
will be pivotal then.

712
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,839
Indeed, Heliu and Pig Rider

713
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,759
haven't picked their heroes yet.

714
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,359
Yes.

715
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:10,519
Li Bai is picked.

716
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,279
He'll pick his hero later.
Li Bai has priority.

717
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,359
Jungle King indeed.

718
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:13,839
Yes.

719
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,640
In terms of aggression,

720
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,920
Donghuang Taiyi is not bad.

721
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,000
(Star-reaching Team)
Let's see the last Mid pick.

722
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,559
Pig Rider.

723
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:24,160
Pig Rider.

724
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,000
For Mid, the Queen of Mage.

725
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
Diao Chan.

726
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The team swapped their picks

727
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,720
and locked in their heroes.

728
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,279
Jingjing picked Donghuang Taiyi.

729
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,559
Jingjing has to make the choice then.

730
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:32,440
She can ult anyone.

731
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,240
No one in the team

732
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
can peel for Sun Shangxiang.

733
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Donghuang Taiyi is the only

734
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
teamfight initiator.

735
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
You have to ult the right person.

736
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,400
If you ult the wrong person,

737
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,160
you'll lose the fight.

738
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,319
In this case, Jingjing

739
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,079
will either make
or break the teamfight.

740
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:43,720
Indeed.

741
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,720
All right. Welcome to the casual match.

742
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,440
In the first round,

743
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,599
the blue side is Good Luck Team

744
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,680
and the red side is Star-reaching Team.

745
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
Jingjing picked Donghuang Taiyi

746
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,119
to showcase her skill.

747
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,599
(Good Luck Team)
(Welcome to Honor of Kings.)

748
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,920
(Enemy minions will arrive
in five seconds.)

749
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,559
(Please be ready.)

750
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,319
(Prepare to engage!)

751
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,240
(Good Luck Team)

752
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,686
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing)

753
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,000
I will harass their jungler.

754
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,720
(Good Luck Team: Zhou Yin)
All right. Be careful.

755
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,079
I'll come once I'm done
with the red buff.

756
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,039
Bian Que, help us once you

757
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:18,599
clear the minions.

758
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,400
Okay.

759
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,359
Jingjing learned Skill 1.

760
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,119
Our endorser

761
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,200
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing)
is halfway through the victory.

762
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,440
Yes.

763
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,599
A level 1 Donghuang Taiyi

764
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,599
is very strong.

765
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,359
Once he has three stacks,

766
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,880
he can invade the enemy jungle

767
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,359
and disrupt the jungler tempo.

768
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes, we can see that

769
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,160
she has all three stacks now

770
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
and is heading

771
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,039
towards the enemy blue buff.

772
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,359
Good map awareness.

773
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,519
Donghuang is here.

774
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,319
Hold on.

775
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,400
Li Bai is having a rough time.

776
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,200
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing
Star-reaching Team: Heliu)

777
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,440
Yes, a level 1 Li Bai can only retreat

778
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,119
when he sees Donghuang.

779
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,000
Blue buff has lost aggro.

780
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,920
Jingjing is chasing after Li Bai.

781
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,519
So aggressive.

782
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,000
(Good Luck Team: Zhou Yin)
Slow down.

783
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,000
He can't do anything about Donghuang.

784
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,640
Right, and now, Xuance...

785
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,880
(Good Luck Team: Zhou Yin, Jingjing...)
Back down a bit.

786
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,799
It's fine. Give it to them.

787
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,200
Really?

788
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,599
Can they fight back
around the blue buff camp?

789
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,680
Both teams are...

790
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,799
I got the blue buff.

791
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,359
Retreat.

792
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:56,519
Not bad, Donghuang.

793
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,480
Of course.

794
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,440
They covered
for Jingjing's retreat too.

795
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,720
What a huge lead.

796
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,119
Excellent map awareness
from Jingjing this time.

797
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,839
She invaded the enemy jungle

798
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,720
and helped her own jungler.

799
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,640
Three jungle buffs from the beginning.

800
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:10,319
Good Luck Team has a huge lead now.

801
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,039
Come. This way.

802
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,240
Good Luck Team is having a great game.

803
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,559
The match has started.

804
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,039
Sorry for making you miss the match.

805
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,039
Don't be!

806
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,039
You're Mr. Gu's friend.

807
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,400
You're my priority.

808
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,599
This match just passed the 10-minute mark.

809
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,720
It's a pivotal moment.

810
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,319
A teamfight is about to break out.

811
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:27,599
Whoever wins the next teamfight

812
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,319
can grab the Dark Tyrant

813
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,480
- and might even win the game...
- Yes.

814
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
Look at their position.

815
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,599
The red side can only retreat

816
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,480
and play in their jungle.

817
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,440
They want to take down the inner turret

818
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
but Jingjing has her flash and her ult.

819
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,680
It all depends on Jingjing's
Donghuang now.

820
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,480
(Honor of Kings)
If she can use her ult properly,

821
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,240
(World Champion Cup Award Ceremony)
then she can easily

822
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,440
win this round.

823
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,000
Everyone is gathering

824
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
near red team's inner turret.

825
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,759
They are ready.

826
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,480
Let's see.

827
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,140
(Good Luck Team: Jingjing)

828
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,359
Donghuang Taiyi flashed

829
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,359
and locked down Diao Chan!

830
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,160
Her teammates followed up.

831
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,480
Sun Shangxiang got the first kill.

832
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,599
Hua Mulan is down too.

833
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,680
Snow is still pumping out damage

834
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,359
and Li Bai is almost dead.

835
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,160
Zhang Fei won't be able to outrun this.

836
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,680
(Good Luck Team: Snow. Double Kill)
Beautiful!

837
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
(Double, Triple,)

838
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,200
(Quadra Kill!)

839
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,940
(Ace.)

840
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,200
Ace! Oh my god.

841
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,480
What a show-stopping ult from Donghuang.

842
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,759
Diao Chan was hit

843
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,000
and died like that.

844
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,599
So worth it.

845
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,359
Donghuang Taiyi is

846
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,160
Qiao Jingjing's hero?

847
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,799
Yes,

848
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,359
our endorser.

849
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,160
Her Donghuang is not bad.

850
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,039
I'm surprised.

851
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:30,440
Check the minions.

852
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,720
Prepare for an ambush.

853
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,839
They are hiding in one bush.

854
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:33,720
They are up for something.

855
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,319
Come on.

856
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:35,599
Wait.

857
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,640
Five seconds left on my flash.

858
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,640
Seems like Good Luck Team

859
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
wants to end this.

860
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,880
They are hiding in the mid bush

861
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,359
and are waiting for a fight.

862
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:42,680
Use this minion push.

863
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,400
Use Wolf Emblem, Donghuang.

864
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,759
Ult whoever.

865
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,400
Got it.

866
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:47,640
Jingjing

867
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,079
charged in

868
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,200
with her Wolf Emblem.

869
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,400
She's going to ult someone.

870
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,559
- She charged in.
- It landed!

871
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,119
She flash-ulted Gongsun Li.

872
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,519
I got him, I got him.

873
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,960
You want a big shot?

874
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,799
There you go.

875
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
One bullet, one kill.

876
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,039
They pushed in further.

877
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,319
Li Bai flanked from the side

878
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,079
and is targeting Sun Shangxiang.

879
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:10,759
No damage whatsoever.

880
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
Only Li Bai left this time.

881
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,319
The damage was shared.

882
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,559
Sun Shangxiang got one-shot.

883
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,240
Impressive.

884
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,319
Come on! Attack the tower.

885
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,119
They aced the enemy.

886
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:23,160
What a beautiful teamwork.

887
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,400
The engage from Donghuang Taiyi

888
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,240
and Sun Shuangxiang who never
missed her attack.

889
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,279
Bottom minions
have reached the highland

890
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,160
and the turret is down just like that.

891
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,559
They are on the nexus now.

892
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,359
From the engage to the teamwork,

893
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,640
everything was impeccable.

894
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,599
Now that the nexus is down,

895
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,400
let's congratulate Good Luck Team!

896
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,360
(Victory)

897
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,359
Jingjing!

898
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,119
Jingjing!

899
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,640
Jingjing!

900
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,640
Jingjing!

901
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,160
Good job.

902
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
Not bad.

903
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
(Good Luck Team)
Jingjing!

904
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,039
Jingjing tanked a lot of damage.

905
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:11,799
She did well.

906
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:12,440
(MVP: Good Luck Team, Snow)
Snow's Sun Shangxiang

907
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,640
is the MVP.

908
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,880
Jingjing won!

909
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,559
Jingjing was so good.

910
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,319
Finally,

911
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,680
we don't have to argue
with those haters.

912
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,880
So many people on the live stream

913
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,759
said that Jingjing was being carried,

914
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,400
that she's a support and she
couldn't win on her own.

915
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,440
Let them be.

916
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,559
Donghuang was being carried this round?

917
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,480
They need to check their eyes.

918
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,599
Just look at how much damage
she has soaked.

919
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,240
Also,

920
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
even if she was carried,

921
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,200
it just means that she is strategic
and shrewd enough

922
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,440
to pick the right players.

923
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Exactly!

924
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
Once again, congratulations
on Good Luck Team

925
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,480
for grabbing the first win.

926
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,440
Don't be discouraged, Star-reaching Team.

927
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,960
This is a casual match.

928
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,680
Fun is the priority.

929
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,240
And now,

930
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
there will be small changes

931
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,640
to our second round.

932
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,880
Staff,

933
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,640
come up here,

934
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,359
please.

935
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,160
There are a lot of

936
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,240
paper notes in this box.

937
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
Each note

938
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,960
contains a special permission.

939
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,799
Both teams can draw once

940
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,200
and are allowed to exercise whatever
is granted to them.

941
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,119
The winning team first.

942
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,640
What Good Luck Team obtained is...

943
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,240
"You can ban

944
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,559
one more hero next round."

945
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,480
Jingjing is quite lucky today.

946
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Now,

947
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:26,079
your turn.

948
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,799
What Star-reaching Team obtained is...

949
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,640
This is interesting.

950
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:34,599
"Star-reaching Team

951
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,160
can ban the MVP

952
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
from the previous round."

953
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,359
4v5 then?

954
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,160
It means you have to

955
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,400
swap the previous MVP out.

956
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:50,640
So I

957
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
have to return to my seat?

958
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,440
A round of applause for Snow!

959
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,559
Thank you for your
excellent performance just now.

960
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,440
Thank you. Bye.

961
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,519
Good luck then.

962
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,400
Well, that's what you get

963
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,920
for being

964
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,160
the MVP.

965
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,359
In this case,

966
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:08,920
Good Luck Team will have to

967
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,759
select another teammate.

968
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,640
Who will you pick, Jingjing?

969
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
Someone from Heavenly Palace too?

970
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,559
But Snow

971
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,839
is the best marksman player
on Heavenly Palace.

972
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
I remember the official account
once said that

973
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,160
we could pick a random person

974
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,079
from the audience as our teammate.

975
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,960
Can I pick a casual player then?

976
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,119
I...

977
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:25,640
(No problem.)

978
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
(Say yes.)

979
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,839
They did mention it, yes.

980
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
But are you sure?

981
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't know who you'll pick,

982
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,319
but are you sure he or she can

983
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,640
outperform a pro player?

984
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,640
I know who I'll pick

985
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
but I don't know
if he can outperform a pro player.

986
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,079
I want to pick him

987
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,079
because he has been

988
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,839
a great companion to me.

989
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,839
I want

990
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,519
to fight alongside him this time.

991
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,400
So your choice is...?

992
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
Can I consult my teammates first?

993
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,079
Sure.

994
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,160
Can I?

995
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,880
I'm fine with that.

996
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,240
I'll support you no matter what.

997
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,559
My choice is

998
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,640
Yu Tu.

999
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,079

1000

1001
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,079
Do you know who he is?

1002
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,640
Yu Tu.

1003
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,119
Who is he?

1004
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,799
Yu Tu?

He's so cute!

1008
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,880
Is he a celebrity too?

1009
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,920

How do you know it's him?

1012
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,880
Are you this superficial too?

1013
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,920
So, handsome fellow,
