00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,200
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,720
What kind of job do you want?

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,680
I heard

5
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,440
that DF in Beijing

6
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,720
gave you an offer.

7
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,879
DF has been doing well
in the past few years.

8
00:01:51,559 --> 00:01:52,839
I know a lot about them.

9
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,559
If you want,

10
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,360
you can inquire with me for free.

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Thanks.

12
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,440
I've already turned them down.

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,080
Is that so?

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,240
Look.

15
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,759
It's Qiao Jingjing.

16
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,039
If she thinks

17
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,160
about us now,

18
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,919
will she find us very laughable?

19
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,839
We had the best grades
in school back then.

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,600
Now, we can't catch up to her.

21
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:49,720
No.

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,679
You're quite confident.

23
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,839
My flight is in two hours.

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
I have to go.

25
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,360
I'll take you to the subway station.

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,800
I haven't taken the subway in years.

27
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,199
After getting off the plane,

28
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,279
I have to meet a client.

29
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,240
I won't squeeze in with the passengers
in the subway.

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,639
Hello.

31
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,199
May I ask if you are

32
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,399
the passenger with the mobile phone
ending in 9472?

33
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:36,759
Yes.

34
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,559
You know my intention, right?

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,279
You're only thinking about your ambition.

36
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,119
Are love and other things

37
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,559
so insignificant to you

38
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
and not even worth mentioning?

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,240
You don't need to mock me.

40
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,119
I'm not mocking you.

41
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm just expressing my sentiments.

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,559
You shouldn't delay people.

43
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,320
Why are you back?

44
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,119
Didn't you say

45
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:54,799
that we'll finish at 9pm?

46
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,600
(It hasn't even taken an hour yet.)

47
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,119
(Did it go too smoothly,)

48
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,160
(or did they not get along)

49
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,079
(and just parted ways?)

50
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,200
I just said it randomly.

51
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,519
If you're busy...

52
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,239
I'm not busy.

53
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:10,920
Let's continue.

54
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,760
(I think they've parted ways.)

55
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,799
After I left,

56
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:15,799
did you practice?

57
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,640
I did.

58
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:18,880
Let me see the result.

59
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,679
You're even checking my result?

60
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,320
Your output is quite good.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Of course.

62
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,040
I've improved a lot lately.

63
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,320
Go on.

64
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,359
I'll watch you play.

65
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,600
So Panicky is here too.

66
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,679
Should I ask him to join us?

67
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,079
Sure.

68
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,040
Why are we fighting 3v3?

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,160
How boring.

70
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm practicing a small-scale
team battle.

71
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,399
You're quite hard-working.

72
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,480
Cotton.

73
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,559
Do you want to consider having me
as your teacher?

74
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,839
Why?

75
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,760
Because Jade Rabbit

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,079
will have a girlfriend soon.

77
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,519
He's been leaving early
and coming home late.

78
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm not sure what he's been doing.

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,519
Later on, I heard from Slimebag

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,799
that something's going on with him.

81
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,720
But I can't tell you.

82
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,359
That means

83
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,959
you must hang out with me from now on.

84
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,440
He doesn't have time for you anymore.

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,200
Really?

86
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,760
Yes.

87
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,959
He's already leaving early,
coming home late,

88
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,959
and feeling restless?

89
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,079
Focus.

90
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,079
Cotton, why are you so quiet now?

91
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,480
- Focus.
- How am I not focused?

92
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,519
Stop typing, speak.

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,480
Xiao Zhu is bringing dinner over.

94
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:34,839
I'll get it.

95
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,559
Xiao Zhu.

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,480
The yogurt I told you to buy...

97
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,920
I saw that your light was on
when I passed by,

98
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,040
so...

99
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,519
Excuse me.

100
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,079
Don't you need to explain things to him?

101
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,959
We've already broken up two years ago.

102
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,959
What's there to explain?

103
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,480
And he's so pretentious.

104
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,039
Jingjing.

105
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,719
Just now, downstairs, why did I see...

106
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,119
Mr. Yu.

107
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,400
How can he come up?

108
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:41,960
Wasn't his biometrics for the elevator

109
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,200
already deleted?

110
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,559
But he still has the pin.

111
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,840
The pin was originally changed too,

112
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,840
but you kept forgetting it,

113
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:50,719
so I changed it back.

114
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:52,599
Then go to Property Management for me

115
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,320
to change it again.

116
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,400
Change it to 1316.

117
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,159
What's that?

118
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,159
It's my best result so far.

119
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,359
13:1:6.

120
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,280
Don't worry, I won't forget it.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,679
Isn't it a bit strange today?

122
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,679
What's the matter?

123
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,159
Our exes who have lost contact with us

124
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,520
for many years

125
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
appeared at the same time.

126
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,679
I was with him for over half a year.

127
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,159
One day, he suddenly told me

128
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,760
that his family

129
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,119
doesn't like people in my line of work.

130
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,880
He wanted me to retire
from the entertainment industry

131
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,200
before he tells his family about me.

132
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,440
So I told him,

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,320
"My family doesn't like those

134
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,280
doing business either.

135
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,719
It's very risky,

136
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:45,919
and it's easy to get bankrupt.

137
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,359
Resign first.

138
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,039
Otherwise, my family

139
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,000
won't approve of you either."

140
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,840
Mr. Su is actually very talented.

141
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
He has a good reputation.

142
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,479
You know him?

143
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I studied Finance in college.

144
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,000
I pay attention to news

145
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
in that field.

146
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:03,960
But you must not be aware

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,840
that he's very narcissistic.

148
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,559
What about you?

149
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,320
What about me?

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,119
You and Xia Qing.

151
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
Why did you break up?

152
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Peipei told me about it.

153
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,440
She said that you got together

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
in your junior year.

155
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,599
She often tells me stories

156
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,719
about her classmates.

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,280
If you can't tell me,

158
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,400
pretend that I didn't ask.

159
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:38,520
It's fine.

160
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,200
Because of work,

161
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,640
after my graduation,

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,880
I left Beijing

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,799
and took up my masters and doctorate
degrees in Aerospace Navigation.

164
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,599
So it was because you weren't staying
in the same place.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,919
But I was quite surprised back then

166
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,919
that you took Finance as a major.

167
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,799
I've always remembered

168
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:57,320
that your dream is the galaxy.

169
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
Why did you major in Finance?

170
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,359
My parents didn't approve

171
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,719
of the major I filled out back then.

172
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,679
But I thought

173
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,239
that I can do both.

174
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,799
I was a bit young and frivolous.

175
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,960
But you really did it.

176
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
You even got your doctorate degree.

177
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,119
You're the genius in our class indeed.

178
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,479
But why are you having

179
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,719
such a long vacation?

180
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,640
Isn't it very busy doing research?

181
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,599
Because

182
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,239
I'm planning to give up on the galaxy.

183
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,559
Yu Tu.

184
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,479
Chang'e 1 already launched.

185
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,159
Someone else

186
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,119
achieved your dream before you.

187
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,640
That's great.

188
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,799
When I go into the field,

189
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,719
perhaps the settlement in the moon
is already built.

190
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,320
Then I can use the moon
as my starting point

191
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,239
in conquering Mars

192
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,479
and fly out of the Solar System.

193
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,400
(Because)

194
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,320
(I'm planning to give up on the galaxy.)

195
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,919
When did you come home?

196
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,280
I wasn't aware.

197
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,520
I've been back a while now.

198
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,039
You were taking a call outside.

199
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,880
You met with Xia Qing?

200
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:38,880
How did you know?

201
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,520
How did I know?

202
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,760
Who am I?

203
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:43,119
How did it go?

204
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,440
I really wasn't the one who told her.

205
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,320
Xia Qing went to Hangzhou for a meeting

206
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
and met with Dragon King.

207
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Wasn't it very normal to talk about you?

208
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,000
You have so much free time.

209
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:55,880
You should go to work
in Shenzhen earlier.

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,239
Also,

211
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
stop speaking nonsense

212
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,359
in front of Cotton.

213
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,479
Did Cotton

214
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,080
tell on me?

215
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:07,479
I'll go into the game,

216
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,080
and deal with her.

217
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,119
Go ahead.

218
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,320
Forget it.

219
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,960
Cotton's game

220
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,320
has improved a lot lately.

221
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:22,119
And it's not easy to have

222
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,080
a girl in our team.

223
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,239
By the way,

224
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,960
Qu Ming called me earlier saying

225
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,679
that he wants to treat us
for a meal tomorrow.

226
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,479
It's in Lujiazui at 6:30pm.

227
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,640
Let's go together, okay?

228
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,239
Tomorrow, I...

229
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,119
Don't.

230
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,440
Don't keep acting this way.

231
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,440
That stingy guy

232
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,919
is finally treating us to a meal,

233
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,200
and it's my send-off party.

234
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,440
Show me some respect, okay?

235
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Let me tell you.

236
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,320
Our classmates in Shanghai University

237
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,159
are all going.

238
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:43,719
Think about it carefully.

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,799
Hi, sir.

240
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,760
Do you have a reservation?

241
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,039
It's under Mr. Qu.

242
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,479
All right.

243
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,559
Okay, please follow me.

244
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,840
How many times did I tell you?

245
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:18,080
You just wouldn't buy it.

246
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
Now, you've lost money.

247
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:21,359
That was silly, right?

248
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,840
You lost the advantage, right?

249
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,479
Yu Tu.

250
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,359
Hello.

251
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,320
The great talent

252
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,200
who has a double major is here.

253
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,119
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

254
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,000
Welcome.

255
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,119
Everyone's here.

256
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,280
We're not late, right?

257
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:39,719
You are.

258
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,799
You're both late.

259
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,799
You're late.

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,239
Why did you arrive together?

261
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,799
Lujiazui isn't big.

262
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,640
We met along the way.

263
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,320
You happened to meet.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,679
Guys.

265
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
I'm so happy

266
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,400
that Yu Tu can come today.

267
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,960
I thought you were ignoring us.

268
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,799
Back in school,

269
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:56,960
if you weren't at the library,

270
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,200
you were hanging out with people
from other departments, right?

271
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,320
You wouldn't hang out with us.

272
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,799
Those who weren't aware

273
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,719
would think that he was from
the Aeronautics Department.

274
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,320
No.

275
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:05,599
In the sports team,

276
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:06,599
Yu Tu was our department's main force.

277
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,080
Right.

278
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,799
Which sports team?

279
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:10,400
Basketball or soccer? Tell us.

280
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,200
Basketball.

281
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,000
That's nonsense.

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,159
I was the Basketball Team's captain.

283
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,200
Wouldn't I know that?

284
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,200
I was the center position
in the team before.

285
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,840
Right?

286
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,479
Yu Tu.

287
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,440
After all these years,

288
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,840
why is Qu Ming still so fond
of teasing you?

289
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,359
You've already broken up with Xia Qing.

290
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:22,599
There's no reason for him
to do that anymore.

291
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,359
Qu Ming.

292
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,799
Didn't you say that Xia Qing
is coming too?

293
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,599
Why isn't she here yet?

294
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,760
Right.

295
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,880
Let me call her.

296
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,559
She should be on her way.

297
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,760
Wait.

298
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Emma.

299
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,400
Why aren't you here yet? Tell me.

300
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:42,760
The restaurant

301
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,039
is so near to your hotel.

302
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,559
It's fine.

303
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:52,479
Do your work first.

304
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,000
It's okay.

305
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,159
Let's meet next time, okay?

306
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,239
All right.

307
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,000
Bye.

308
00:16:59,239 --> 00:16:59,840
What's the matter?

309
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,559
The beautiful Ms. Xia isn't coming?

310
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,799
She has urgent matters
to attend to in Beijing.

311
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,439
She just arrived at the airport.

312
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,719
Why didn't

313
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,280
she inform you?

314
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:08,959
No.

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,119
She was about to call me.

316
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,479
That's too bad.

317
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,119
We haven't seen each other for so long.

318
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:14,839
Yes.

319
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,959
Xia Qing is apologizing to us

320
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,000
in our chat group.

321
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:18,959
I originally agreed

322
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,359
to meet you guys today.

323
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,079
I had urgent matters to attend to
yesterday and went back to Beijing.

324
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,160
I forgot to inform you.

325
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,599
Qu Ming, didn't you say

326
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,280
that Xia Qing just went
to Beijing today?

327
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,119
What's going on?

328
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,599
Let's order.

329
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,719
Right, let's order.

330
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,760
You guys were so chaotic earlier.

331
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,599
I heard her wrong.

332
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,199
Right.

333
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:34,839
Don't mind her.

334
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,800
Let's order.

335
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:36,560
Waiter.

336
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,439
He has another motive.

337
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,479
Why did he organize a reunion

338
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,239
as a send-off party for me?

339
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:44,239
What the heck?

340
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,079
He just wanted to meet Xia Qing.

341
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,199
He couldn't get her to meet him,

342
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,479
but he got to meet you.

343
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,119
Isn't he afraid of making himself
look like a dork?

344
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,280
Lafite 1990.

345
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,719
That's a good year.

346
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,640
Let's drink to our heart's content.

347
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,280
Right.

348
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
By the way, Yu Tu,

349
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:04,959
that day,

350
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,520
I met someone from the class
next to ours.

351
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,560
He said

352
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,160
that you went to apply in their company?

353
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,680
What was the name again?

354
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,560
I forgot the Chinese name.

355
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,680
Anyway,

356
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,760
it's the state-owned company

357
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,520
under Ren Wang.

358
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,119
Doesn't Yu Tu work

359
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,160
in the Aerospace Research Institute?

360
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,599
Right.

361
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,280
So, Yu Tu,

362
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,920
are you planning to switch jobs?

363
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,319
Let me remind you.

364
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:28,199
If you switch jobs now,

365
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,880
it's like you'll be starting over.

366
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Guess the salary.

367
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
It will be exactly the same
as a fresh graduate.

368
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,560
Why are you even worse than me?

369
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,800
If Mr. Yu

370
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,680
sees my results tomorrow,

371
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,839
he'll surely lecture me.

372
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,400
Hey.

373
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,839
Hey, Jingjing.

374
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,599
You told me to buy a salad.

375
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,040
Guess who I met.

376
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,239
The Chief Coach of 80 Heroes,

377
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,239
Mr. Yu.

378
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,599
You know?

379
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,239
I know that he's going to dinner there,

380
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,599
so I remembered that place's salad.

381
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,359
Come back after buying salad.

382
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,359
Don't go to Edward.

383
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:22,520
He won't accept payment again.

384
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,599
I know.

385
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,319
I'm just buying salad.

386
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,280
Why would I go to the owner?

387
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:27,560
I'm just sitting here on the side.

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,560
Mr. Yu is sitting right in front of me.

389
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,479
Don't disturb him.

390
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,040
I know.

391
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:33,680
However,

392
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:36,160
I see someone

393
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,599
who's very unfriendly to him.

394
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,479
He keeps mocking him.

395
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,640
He's so bad.

396
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,880
I'm so furious.

397
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,119
It's fine if you have some difficulties.

398
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:47,959
You can find former classmates like us.

399
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:50,160
We'll make some introductions for you.

400
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,920
He works in a confidential unit.

401
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:57,719
There's a confidentiality period
requirement if he resigns.

402
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,400
Do you understand that?

403
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,640
If you don't, don't speak nonsense.

404
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,560
Since Xia Qing

405
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
won't come to meet you,

406
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,199
don't aim at him.

407
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,880
Don't speak nonsense.

408
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,920
Will you only live until 30?

409
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,719
What does that mean?

410
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,520
Why are you in such a hurry?

411
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,439
We have a long way to go.

412
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,880
Let's see what happens after a while.

413
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:24,880
I forgot.

414
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,119
You're a great scientist.

415
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,400
Of course you're looking down

416
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,839
on people like us in Finance.

417
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,439
First, don't include the others.

418
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:36,839
Qu Ming.

419
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,959
Don't slander Yu Tu.

420
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,560
He doesn't

421
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,400
look down on us.

422
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,000
Those in the field of research

423
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,280
aren't better

424
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,119
than those in Finance,

425
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,160
and vice versa.

426
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,040
But people

427
00:20:48,479 --> 00:20:49,760
can be narrow or open-minded.

428
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,719
What's the matter?

429
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,520
- Let's not talk about that.
- Stop.

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Aren't we

431
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,439
here today

432
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:56,000
for Zhai Liang's send-off party?

433
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:56,800
Right.

434
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:57,319
So

435
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,040
let's not forget the star of the night.

436
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,599
Right.

437
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,920
No, don't give me a send-off.

438
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,000
Don't say that.

439
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,119
I'm not the star of the night.

440
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,800
I understand

441
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,040
Qu Ming's intention today.

442
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,719
It has nothing to do with me.

443
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:08,959
A reunion?

444
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,040
A send-off party for me?

445
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,719
He has another motive.

446
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,719
When I just resigned,

447
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,920
my annual salary was just a million.

448
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,920
The fund I was managing

449
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,000
was just in the nation's top ten.

450
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,079
I didn't feel

451
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,119
like I was so great.

452
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,839
Everyone's a junior
in front of big shots.

453
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,319
Don't be arrogant.

454
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:28,520
Don't show off.

455
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,439
But some people

456
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,839
just earned a few bucks

457
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and forgot who he is already.

458
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:33,719
He's arrogant now.

459
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,160
No, Zhai Liang.

460
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,280
That's enough.

461
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
Zhai Liang, stop it too.

462
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,000
Zhai Liang.

463
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,959
When was your annual salary one million?

464
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:40,640
You didn't

465
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,199
even buy us a drink.

466
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:42,719
Right.

467
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,479
You're such a bad friend.

468
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,359
You're a bad friend.

469
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,000
Before leaving,

470
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,119
you must make it up to us.

471
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,119
Fine.

472
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,560
Let's drink to our hearts' content
at home.

473
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,000
1989 Lafite.

474
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,079
Our wine is here.

475
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,719
Mr. Yu.

476
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,839
I brought over

477
00:21:56,839 --> 00:21:57,560
the wine that you

478
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
and Ms. Qiao stored here.

479
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:05,760
This

480
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,280
is our owner's compliments

481
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,160
to Mr. Yu.

482
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,239
Please enjoy.

483
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,079
Sir.

484
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,760
Your wine will arrive in a while.

485
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,000
Yu Tu, you've been here before?

486
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,599
Romanee-Conti.

487
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,920
Seriously?

488
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,520
Yes, look.

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,040
Nice, Yu Tu.

490
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,680
Nice.

491
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,199
Let me see.

492
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:32,640
I wasn't expecting this from you.

493
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,199
This wine costs at least...

494
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,359
I have to go.

495
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,160
You guys enjoy.

496
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,439
Let's meet another time.

497
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,160
He took the wine too.

498
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,199
Right.

499
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,680
Qu Ming.

500
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,880
Eat, it's free.

501
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,680
Eat up, it's free.

502
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,520
Eat.

503
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,640
Let's eat.

504
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,959
Xiao Zhu, you forgot something again?

505
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,800
Why did you come back?

506
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,400
You brought the wine too?

507
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,239
I couldn't bear to let them drink it,

508
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,640
so I brought it back.

509
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,199
I knew where you were going,

510
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,640
so I remembered that restaurant's salad.

511
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,760
I told Xiao Zhu to buy some there.

512
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,760
Then...

513
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,880
Do you think I'm too nosy?

514
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:47,839
Am I the type

515
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:48,920
who's unable to distinguish between good
and bad?

516
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,479
I think so too.

517
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,199
How was it then?

518
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,560
Do you feel glad and happy?

519
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,640
Like having a successful rocket launch.

520
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,239
To celebrate the rocket launch,

521
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:02,439
do you want to have a drink?

522
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,959
Even if it's just a few hundred bucks,

523
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,280
we can't waste it.

524
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,719
A few hundred bucks?

525
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,479
Right.

526
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,959
You think I'm stupid?

527
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,000
Will I treat people I don't know

528
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
to such an expensive bottle of wine?

529
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,839
I

530
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,040
know the restaurant's owner.

531
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,160
I filmed there before.

532
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:16,800
That

533
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,119
was an empty bottle

534
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:19,119
that I used during shooting.

535
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Are we going to drink it or not?

536
00:24:21,719 --> 00:24:22,479
Anyway,

537
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,319
I won't be playing games today.

538
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,479
My left thumb

539
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,640
already has a bunion.

540
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,239
I'll get some glasses.

541
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
It's a bit silly to sit here.

542
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,760
Let's sit where the French windows are.

543
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,920
Yu Tu, come with me.

544
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:52,760
Hurry.

545
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Help me move those things

546
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,439
over there.

547
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:34,839
Candles.

548
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,000
Then some fruits.

549
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,640
Even if we have limited resources,

550
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,760
these would do.

551
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:13,719
This way please, Mr. Yu.

552
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,520
Twenty minutes.

553
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,319
What?

554
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,400
Thank you for letting me drink

555
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,079
Romanee-Conti that only costs
a few hundred bucks.

556
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,199
Thank you for teaching me
how to play games.

557
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:06,880
Wait.

558
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,439
Let me check something.

559
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,439
Good thing the calorie count
isn't too high.

560
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,839
Bottoms up for me

561
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,680
for this glass then.

562
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,640
The rest are yours.

563
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,079
Okay.

564
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,040
Red wine is a bit sour and bitter.

565
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,880
Rice wine still tastes better.

566
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,079
The kind that's made

567
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:36,920
back in my hometown.

568
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,160
My mom would make it yearly.

569
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,920
Does your family know how to make that?

570
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:40,199
Yes.

571
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,520
But it's too sweet.

572
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,280
But it tastes good.

573
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,319
The calorie count must be very high too.

574
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,239
That's out of line.

575
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,280
It's just a friendly reminder.

576
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,199
Here.

577
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,640
So, Yu Tu,

578
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,400
are you planning to switch jobs?

579
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,599
If you switch jobs now,

580
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,280
it's like you'll be starting over.

581
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,319
Guess the salary.

582
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,319
It will be exactly the same
as a fresh graduate.

583
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,359
I've always remembered

584
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,719
that your dream is the galaxy.

585
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,119
Why did you major in Finance?

586
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,959
Dreams and sentiments don't earn money.

587
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,560
If you live your life this way,

588
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,079
don't you feel apologetic
towards your high IQ?

589
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,359
Today,

590
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,479
while you were out for dinner,

591
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:09,560
I organized my own team.

592
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,079
My team mates were all bad.

593
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,959
I chose Wang Zhaojun in one round,

594
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:15,239
and my team mate

595
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,160
chose Ying Zheng and Daji.

596
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:18,000
We were up against mages.

597
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,599
You know what?

598
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,040
I charged forward back then.

599
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,880
Who is Ms. Qiao?

600
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,079
Who is Ms. Qiao?

601
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:15,040
Who is Ms. Qiao?

602
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:16,160
Who is Ms. Qiao?

603
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:17,000
Who is Ms. Qiao?

604
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,000
Who is Ms. Qiao?

605
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,160
Who is it?

606
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,880
My former classmate.

607
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,839
We're just getting to know each other.
