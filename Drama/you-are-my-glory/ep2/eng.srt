1
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:33,120
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,159
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,120
Yu Tu, you're such a kill stealer.

4
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,760
Yu Tu, you handle Zhuge Liang
quite well.

5
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,879
Why have I not seen
you playing this character before?

6
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,639
Zhai Liang fights
to be the Mage every time.

7
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:00,879
He's good enough for that.

8
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,720
This is normal.

9
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:05,440
Do you really have to do this?

10
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,440
I think,

11
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:10,800
from now on,

12
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,240
the Mage belongs to Yu Tu.

13
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,399
Zhai Liang, don't fight for it anymore.

14
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,080
I disagree.

15
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,080
Zhai Liang is a bad Marksmen.

16
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,720
At least, he's a mediocre Mage.

17
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:25,160
Go away.

18
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,279
I'm still farming.

19
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,039
Cai Wenji,

20
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,279
when you enter the bush later,

21
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,320
give me a good View.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,720
I'm going to take my time farming.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Which bush?

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:36,800
A girl?

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,800
She's a girl?

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,240
Could Yu Tu

27
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,000
have recognized my voice?

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
Miss.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes.

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,240
40% of the players of this game

31
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,440
are female.

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,399
I've memorized...

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
I've seen the data before.

34
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,559
But, Yu Tu.

35
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,800
the ladies repellent,

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,639
invited you here.

37
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Yu Tu,

38
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,440
do you really not know this lady?

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,759
I hope he has forgotten about me.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,279
Isn't she the one on QQ?

41
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:05,679
You add a stranger on your QQ?

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,520
That...

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,559
The bush you were talking about.

44
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,720
Is it the bush up there?

45
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,880
Yes, it's the one.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why should I hide there?

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,839
You can see
if our enemy is surrounding us.

48
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,520
If you see them, give us a heads up.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,199
Okay.

50
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,080
As expected,
he didn't recognize my voice.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,559
Cai Wenji, what are you doing?

52
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,039
Cai Wenji.

53
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,199
You'd better follow the Mage.

54
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,600
I'll farm on my own for now.

55
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:55,520
Yu Tu,

56
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,759
the one who invited her
should be responsible for her too.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,759
Sure.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,559
A terrible Marksmen like you

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,199
isn't worth being protected.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,200
Only when you have the situation
well in hand,

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,480
can you gain a decisive victory
a thousand miles away.

62
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,399
This is the God's will.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,399
Go, go, go.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,920
We won another round.

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,760
Zhuge Liang got 18 kills.

66
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,559
I played quite well too.

67
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,600
Look at how I used Cai Wenji

68
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,079
and got two kills.

69
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,679
Qiao Jingjing,

70
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,160
why are you still awake?

71
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,519
How can you be so brazen?

72
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,679
I'm going to sleep now.

73
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,200
Jingjing.

74
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,160
Jingjing.

75
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,480
Jingjing.

76
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,239
Purchase all the heroes

77
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:07,959
and skins for me.

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,720
Okay.

79
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:09,760
Wait a minute.

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,519
Forget it. Buy only the nice ones.

81
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Sure.

82
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:15,920
Okay. Nice.

83
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
Nice.

84
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,040
That's great.

85
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,760
Nice.

86
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,160
Okay.

87
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,040
Jingjing, let's take a break

88
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,799
and get ready for the next scene.

89
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:24,839
Okay.

90
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,480
Have you bought it already?

91
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,119
Yes, I have.

92
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,959
I've bought all the nice skins.

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,279
I can guarantee that,
from now on,

94
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,559
you'll be the most handsome one
in the valley.

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,160
Even if you die in the Valley of Kings,

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,279
you'll die
in your most beautiful costumes.

97
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:41,959
That's right.

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,040
By the way, Jingjing.

99
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,279
Three persons

100
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:46,920
have become your friends.

101
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,920
It's only been one night,

102
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:49,839
and so many people

103
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,640
have requested to be your friends.

104
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,320
Each one of them will get two skins.

105
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,000
Then, they'll feel embarrassed

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,839
if they don't invite me.

107
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,119
Not you.

108
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,519
Do you not want me to stay?

109
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,839
It's okay.

110
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,000
Go spend time with your mom.

111
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,640
Okay.

112
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:13,119
I'm leaving.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,959
Take a good rest.

114
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Sleep early.

115
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,519
The skin tactic is a success.

116
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,559
Miss,

117
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,480
you gave me two skins.

118
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,480
Don't get too excited.

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,160
I received it too!

120
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
Yo, yo!

121
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,480
I got it too.

122
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,880
Heroes, please invite me.

123
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,799
Of course.

124
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,480
I have never received skins

125
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,079
from anyone before,

126
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,720
let alone from a girl.

127
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,799
Miss, don't worry.

128
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,239
Dragon King will lead you.

129
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,279
Let's start.

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,920
Yu Tu.

131
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,359
Why didn't you put on

132
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,760
the skin she gave you?

133
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:02,040
I didn't get any.

134
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:05,720
Oops.

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,959
Yu Tu.

136
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,679
I didn't expect you

137
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,359
to get to the bottom of a girl's list.

138
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:16,640
Yu Tu, are you betraying me?

139
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,640
Be smart and retreat.

140
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,320
Don't worry.

141
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,480
I've gotten the blue buff.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,559
We won't lose anything

143
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,760
this round.

144
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,920
You're still as annoying as always.

145
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,519
Yu Tu,

146
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,480
I invited a friend to join us.

147
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Together with the four of us,

148
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,359
we'll do five-rows tactics.
Are you joining us?

149
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:34,679
Sure.

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,280
Miss, after this round,

151
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,400
we'll play the ranking match.

152
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,719
We'll see you tomorrow.

153
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,679
Can't I join you?

154
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,919
You won't get any ranking.

155
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,799
You don't have a rank yet, right?

156
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,840
Yes.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,599
I have not played
a ranking match before.

158
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,599
I got left behind again.

159
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,559
I bought six skins

160
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,359
for nothing.

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Does she know that

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,919
if she doesn't exit the room

163
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,799
after the game,

164
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,200
we can hear her speak?

165
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:16,000
Why don't you lead her?

166
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,719
I'll invite another person.

167
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,239
After all, you never like playing
the ranking match.

168
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,239
I'm not the one who received her skin.

169
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:23,960
What about this?

170
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,359
If you win a match, then I'll...

171
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:29,559
No.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,960
If you win two matches,

173
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:33,559
I'll handle all the chores today.

174
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,880
Yu Tu actually leads me on his own.

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,640
He's too handsome.

176
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,000
Look at this.

177
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:50,280
You're such a brute.

178
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,960
I just got my four stars,

179
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,960
and you have won a dozen of matches.

180
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
You'll handle the household chores
for a week.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Qiao Jingjing,

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,280
what's wrong with you?

183
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,080
You're turning 30 years old soon,

184
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,799
yet

185
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,159
you adore a person

186
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,840
just because

187
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,080
he's good at playing games.

188
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,440
He might be bald,

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,640
or obese.

190
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
What is there to get excited about?

191
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,239
But, he's really handsome when he plays.

192
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:02,039
How's it going?

193
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,000
Has she made a lot of progress
in the past two days?

194
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,039
Of course.

195
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,719
Really?

196
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,359
But, frankly,

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,520
Jingjing doesn't have much talent

198
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,000
in playing games.

199
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,559
But, she has extraordinary willpower.

200
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,239
It's true.

201
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:17,599
No matter how badly she's defeated,

202
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,000
she only needs
to have a good night sleep,

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,760
and she'll regain all her enthusiasm
on the next day.

204
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,880
To be fair,

205
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:26,719
not everyone

206
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,760
can be a celebrity.

207
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:29,080
You need to have

208
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,479
the tenacity.

209
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:31,599
That's enough.

210
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,159
Cut straight to the chase.
How's the performance?

211
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,119
It's improved a lot.

212
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,200
When she's at home...

213
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, my God.

214
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:45,840
What's wrong?

215
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,559
I've got to go.

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,599
What time is it?

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,640
Why are you leaving

218
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,559
earlier and earlier?

219
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:52,640
Practice a little more, please.

220
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,039
I'm going back to train my abs.

221
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,000
Jingjing.

222
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you going back

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
to play

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
with the friends you made the other day?

225
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,119
Then,

226
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:06,280
why didn't you tell Miss Ling?

227
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:09,520
It's more impressive

228
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,880
if I can turn into a peerless master

229
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,119
overnight.

230
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,119
Why did he go offline so soon?

231
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,400
Yu Tu.

232
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,640
Yu Tu.

233
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,760
Sorry, sorry.

234
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,719
It took me a long time

235
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,000
to deal with the customer

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
before I finally sent him away.

237
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,239
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,760
Here.

239
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,000
Let me take a good look at you.

240
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:57,479
Nice.

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,640
You're still so handsome.

242
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:00,599
You're not bald yet.

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,520
It seems like you people
who do scientific researches

244
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,719
only work as hard as us

245
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
who are in the financial industry.

246
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:06,599
Am I right?

247
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,400
Come. Have a seat.

248
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Don't just stand there.

249
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,239
Why are you drinking plain water?

250
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,799
I have some nice tea.

251
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,880
I'll make tea for you.

252
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,400
Wait a minute.

253
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,280
Guess who I met at Wuhan

254
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,239
two days ago.

255
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,239
Sandbag

256
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,919
told me that

257
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,719
you are going to resign

258
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:26,359
from the institute.

259
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,159
Is it true?

260
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,000
That's my plan.

261
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,280
But, nothing's final yet.

262
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,479
I'm quite surprised.

263
00:14:34,119 --> 00:14:35,200
Back then,

264
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,039
you were determined to join
the Aerospace Research Institute.

265
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,760
You have been working there
for so many years.

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,440
Why are you resigning now?

267
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:43,760
Due to personal issues.

268
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,479
Sure.

269
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,080
Then, I won't press on.

270
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,159
But, often,

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
you need to experience it yourself

272
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,640
before you know if it really suits you.

273
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,840
After

274
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,760
you truly understand it,

275
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,520
you'll realize that

276
00:14:58,719 --> 00:14:59,359
a lot of things

277
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:00,520
are different

278
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,440
from what you expect.

279
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,000
I guess

280
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,119
you already know

281
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:09,960
why I want to meet you today.

282
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,840
I want to let you know that

283
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,400
if you eventually decide

284
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
to resign from the institute,

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,960
you're welcome to join us.

286
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,119
Hey.

287
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,760
Hey.

288
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:46,599
Yu Tu,

289
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,239
have you met Ren Wang?

290
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,080
I just met him.

291
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,119
When Ren Wang visited Wuhan
a few days ago,

292
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,280
I bought him a meal.

293
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I accidentally let it slip.

294
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,679
Will you blame me for being nosy?

295
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:56,960
Of course, not.

296
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:58,840
I've been sending out resumes anyway.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,479
Zhai Liang told me that

298
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,080
you received

299
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,640
a letter of offer from DF Capital.

300
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,239
Yes.

301
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,520
But, they want me to

302
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,440
work at the headquarters in Beijing.

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
That's great.

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,599
Because you haven't set foot

305
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,679
in this industry

306
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:10,520
ever since you graduated
from university,

307
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,000
I thought it'd be difficult for you

308
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
to land a good job.

309
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,719
Apparently, I underestimated you.

310
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,599
Let me tell you.

311
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,880
Both investment banking and
venture capital financing

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,760
have their pros and cons.

313
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,280
Think twice about it.

314
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,280
Don't worry. I know what to do.

315
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,960
Okay. I'm going home then.

316
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,320
See you in the valley tonight.

317
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,039
You have been a bit invested recently.

318
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,719
Why?

319
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,520
Is a humble white-collar worker like me

320
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,960
not allowed

321
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,119
to have my own hobby?

322
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:34,520
Besides,

323
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,919
ever since Zhai Liang

324
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,239
brought you in,

325
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,359
I'm getting more and more pumped up.

326
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,000
I didn't expect you

327
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,880
to play so well.

328
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,599
You are

329
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:43,479
quite a good teammate.

330
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:45,640
I was tricked by Zhai Liang.

331
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,559
You and Zhai Liang
work really well together.

332
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,320
You share the same opinion
on your teammates too.

333
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,559
He's just trash.

334
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,679
I'm hanging up.

335
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:53,440
See you tonight.

336
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,400
Yu Tu,

337
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,840
look at our high school chatroom.

338
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,640
Someone uploaded a post

339
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,919
about you and Qiao Jingjing.

340
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,479
He's not online yet.

341
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,439
Hey, Peipei.

342
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:41,479
You know what.

343
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,920
They have started

344
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:43,680
spreading rumors

345
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,560
in our high school chatroom.

346
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,280
Everyone

347
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,400
is scolding the bastard
who spread the rumors.

348
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Guess what happened next.

349
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,280
What happened?

350
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,839
Yu Tu spoke.

351
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,760
You definitely haven't expected this.

352
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Let me tell you.

353
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,959
Besides

354
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,479
scolding the guy who spread rumors,

355
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,280
there were also a few others

356
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,119
who left insensitive remarks.

357
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,199
Eventually, Yu Tu spoke.

358
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,599
He said that he had never said
anything like that,

359
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,959
giving all of them
a slap in their faces.

360
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,359
Immediately, those guys went quiet.

361
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,400
Isn't he great?

362
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,439
Yu Tu.

363
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,520
Are you free now?

364
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I'd like to ask you something.

365
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,959
Sure. Go ahead.

366
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,920
Do you need a girlfriend?

367
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,400
If you need one,

368
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,319
what do you think about me?

369
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:29,800
Sorry.

370
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,599
I don't need a girlfriend
for the time being.

371
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:34,959
Why?

372
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,239
Are you worried that
it will affect your studies?

373
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,760
You do sports

374
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,400
and read novels every day,

375
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,680
but your studies
have never been affected.

376
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,079
That's not the reason.

377
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,040
Then, why?

378
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,400
There's nothing wrong with me.

379
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:47,400
Sorry.

380
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,160
Give me a minute.

381
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,199
You have to tell me why, right?

382
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,479
Sorry.

383
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:02,959
I want someone

384
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,359
who will work hard together with me.

385
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,479
Take a screenshot of the conversation

386
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:20,479
and send it to me.

387
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,479
I'll do it now.

388
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,119
Wait.

389
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,800
I haven't said anything
like that before.

390
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,119
If any of you

391
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,239
is still in touch with Qiao Jingjing,

392
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:32,719
send my apologies to her.

393
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,040
If there's anything
that requires further explanation,

394
00:19:35,479 --> 00:19:36,239
I'll cooperate.

395
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,920
Apologize to me?

396
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,359
How will you apologize to me?

397
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:41,920
Will you provide an explanation too?

398
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:45,319
How?

399
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,239
Are you going to post it on Weibo?

400
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,280
You know nothing about
the entertainment industry.

401
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:50,719
If you have time to spare,

402
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,959
why don't you play with me?

403
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,239
Why waste your time in the chatroom?

404
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,719
I've moved

405
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,920
all the remaining items here.

406
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,760
I have also terminated the rental.

407
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,280
I'll stay here

408
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,599
for a while.

409
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,079
Your house is quite far

410
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,040
from the town.

411
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,239
The traffic was smooth
the last time I came here.

412
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,839
This time,
I was stuck in a traffic jam,

413
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,959
and it took me one and a half hours.

414
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,280
It's near to my workplace.

415
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,760
I visit the town

416
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,520
not more than a few times in a year.

417
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
If you're going to work at Lujiazui,

418
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,920
are you going to sell this house?

419
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,040
We'll see how it goes.

420
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:32,719
When are you

421
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:33,560
going to Shenzhen?

422
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,560
I will officially start working
after the New Year.

423
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,119
Don't you want to go home?

424
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,040
Later.

425
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,239
For now,

426
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,439
I'll enjoy my free time here.

427
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,800
If I go home,

428
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,560
they will definitely
pressure me to get married.

429
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,079
They will arrange blind dates for me.

430
00:21:48,439 --> 00:21:49,599
Also, I haven't told them

431
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,640
about my resignation.

432
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,839
They would be furious
if they find out.

433
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:55,040
Didn't you go home a few days ago?

434
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,719
How did you

435
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:57,439
break the news to your parents?

436
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,319
I haven't told them anything.

437
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:02,040
I told you
to only stay for a couple of days.

438
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:08,920
Why?

439
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,839
Why are you hesitating?

440
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,079
A job that pays you
a million yuan a year

441
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,560
and a taxing job
that pays you only a quarter of that.

442
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,439
Yet, you can't make up your mind?

443
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,520
Is it that difficult?

444
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,560
No one pays me a million yuan a year.

445
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,359
That's not true.

446
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,439
When you got your degree,

447
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,959
you received so many letters of offer.

448
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,640
If you had accepted
either one of those offers,

449
00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:32,920
you'd now be earning
millions of yuan annually.

450
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,599
You're silly to have chosen
to work in an aerospace company.

451
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,760
Even if you've earned yourself a Ph.D.,

452
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,599
and been burning yourself out,

453
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:40,880
you're still earning so little.

454
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
If you haven't done the research,

455
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,800
and earned yourself some prize money,

456
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,599
how could you afford

457
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:46,520
paying your mortgage loan?

458
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,920
Living your life like this.

459
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,000
You've put your intelligence to waste.

460
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,520
At least...

461
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,680
At the very least,

462
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,839
you wouldn't have broken up
with Xia Qing.

463
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,880
Let the bygones be bygones.

464
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,359
You will regret it sooner or later.

465
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:04,280
Where can you find

466
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,760
such a beautiful and smart wife

467
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
in the future?

468
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:10,640
Worry about yourself.

469
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,560
Pfft!

470
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,560
You are lucky you look good.

471
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,920
You can't live on

472
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,239
your dreams and sentiment.

473
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,839
I have different goals.

474
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,319
I worked hard to earn my degrees.

475
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,560
Now, I want to make
as much money as I can,

476
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
and live the best life I can afford.

477
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:35,560
In today's society,

478
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:38,800
a celebrity and a live-stream seller

479
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:41,000
can earn up to millions of yuan
every minute.

480
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,280
Look at yourself.

481
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,760
You've launched satellites into orbit.

482
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,520
You can ask around.

483
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,680
No one knows who you are.

484
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,479
You sold your soul for your company,

485
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:50,000
but is only making so little.

486
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,280
These days

487
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,239
are probably

488
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:06,000
the idlest days in my life.

489
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,479
I only play games at home.

490
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:11,800
How about this?

491
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,359
You should visit Beijing

492
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,719
and meet up with your old friends.

493
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,680
I heard that

494
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Xia Qing is still single now.

495
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,239
Perhaps,

496
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:24,520
both of you

497
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,599
will rekindle your romance.

498
00:24:28,439 --> 00:24:30,000
You've been single for so long.

499
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,239
Is it because...

500
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,000
No.

501
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,800
I'll never understand you.

502
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:06,839
For the past two years,

503
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,920
you've never taken a day off.

504
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,239
Let's talk

505
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,640
only after you clear your annual leave.

506
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:20,839
After that,

507
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,719
only shall you make a decision.

508
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,800
I agree.

509
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,319
It's so difficult to handle Zhuge Liang.

510
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,000
How did Yu Tu do it?

511
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,319
He comes and goes as he pleases.

512
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,959
Why is he still not inviting me?

513
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
Did my hefty investment

514
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,280
go down the drain?

515
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,400
Have you not seen

516
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,479
the skin I sent to you?

517
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,599
You don't need to send me skin.

518
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,599
Hey.

519
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,280
Hello, Jingjing.

520
00:27:30,479 --> 00:27:31,760
You left in such a hurry.

521
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,800
I forgot to tell you that

522
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,920
we will have

523
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,800
a family activity tomorrow.

524
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:35,479
You don't have to practice at the studio

525
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,920
tomorrow.

526
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:38,319
Oh.

527
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,319
Okay.

528
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,280
Then, I'll practice on my own.

529
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,479
Do a good job.

530
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:42,880
Guo said that
you have made significant progress.

531
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,760
That's all.

532
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,479
Yes.

533
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,560
Can you be my coach?

534
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,040
Yu Tu is so good at playing games.

535
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,839
If he can coach me,

536
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,119
I can definitely
make greater progress.

537
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,800
But, how can I persuade him

538
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,400
to be my coach,

539
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,640
when I'm basically a stranger to him?

540
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,439
Back then,

541
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,719
he even rejected

542
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,680
a beautiful girl like me.

543
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:48,040
Xiao Zhu,

544
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,400
tell Dandan to draw me a plan.

545
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,400
My company is organizing

546
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,839
an Honor of Kings' tournament.

547
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,319
I want a nice victory

548
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:11,719
so that it'll help me
in my career later.

549
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,520
Don't your company organize any event?

550
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,760
Does a recital contest count?

551
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,000
Where does he

552
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,599
actually work at?

553
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,520
Doesn't he have a degree in finance?

554
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,119
Do investment banks these days

555
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,280
organize recital contests?

556
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,800
That's so unique.

557
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,599
I've signed up for the contest.

558
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,359
But, I don't know how to play,

559
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,959
and I can't let my colleagues
find out that

560
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:41,119
I actually know nothing.

561
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:44,640
I think it's better

562
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
if you can approach someone else.

563
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,040
I might quit this game

564
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
at any time.

565
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,560
Why?

566
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,280
I'm on leave.

567
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,839
But, my vacation will end
at any time.

568
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,439
Besides,

569
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:05,839
I only started playing not long ago.

570
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,280
And you're playing so well already.

571
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,239
It seems hopeful.

572
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,839
Can you guide me

573
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,079
when we play?

574
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,719
You can point out my mistakes,

575
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,560
and how I should fix them.

576
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,160
Can you do that?

577
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,439
If you quit,

578
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,400
I'll find someone else.

579
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,680
Jade Rabbit,

580
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,839
please.
