55

(You brought him onto the stage.)

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,199
(I didn't know that
he's going back to the institute.)

57
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,360
(His involvement in show biz
will distract him.)

58
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,680
(He needs to stay a low profile
since he's going to stay in the institute.)

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,120
(Understood.
I'll get to it immediately.)

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,759
(Didn't Mr. Yu tell you)

61
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,560
(that he's going back to the institute?)

62
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,280
Why wasn't So Panicky there?

63
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Sometimes, he speaks before he thinks.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
I gave it a thought,

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,080
and decided that

66
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,560
it was better to keep this from him.

67
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,919
When you were on stage,

68
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,479
you said that
you were an aerospace engineer.

69
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,039
So, have you already decided

70
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,279
to return to the institute?

71
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,319
Yes.

72
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,560
When did you make the decision?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,639
When I was on my way to Xi'an.

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,279
So, when are you going back?

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,000
Tomorrow.

76
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,360

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,839
Jingjing.

78
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:12,399
I may not be able to
give you the birthday present.

79
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,519
I may not have time
to play games anymore.

80
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,439
So...

81
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,639
I might never be able to
give you the Penta Kill.

82
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,199
Drop me at the subway station.

83
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,839
It's more convenient for me
to go home from here.

84
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,879
Ms. Ling invited us to supper

85
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,480
as a celebration.

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,720
I think I'll pass.

87
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,360
I have to work tomorrow.

88
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,120

Then, I switched to another app,

148
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,320
and took a glance at the WeChat.

149
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,320
Yu Tu

150
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,639
did something big

151
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,000
behind our back.

152
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,519
There's a great fuss
in our university chatroom.

153
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,120
What's going on?

154
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:47,960
He joined

155
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,159
a match of Honor of Kings.

156
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,360
Not only that,
he did it with Qiao Jingjing.

157
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,879
(He's Qiao Jingjing's classsmate
in high school.)

158
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,920
(I want to play Honor of Kings
with Qiao Jingjing.)

159
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,600
(Yu Tu joined a match
of Honor of Kings.)

160
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,840
But...

161
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,759
Isn't this what it's supposed to be?

162
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,759
Right?

163
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,320
Yes.

164
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,519
Brothers,

165
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,240
it's not convenient
for us to talk in the chatroom.

166
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:22,960
I've created another chatroom.

167
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
Listen

168
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,840
to Qiao Jingjing's voice.

169
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
Do you find her voice familiar?

170
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,700
(Let me give him a call.)

171
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,960
I called Yu Tu.

172
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,600
He didn't pick up.

173
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,679
Maybe I should call again later.

174
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,480
That's enough.

175
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,639
Obviously, something is wrong.

176
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,679
Hurry up.

177
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:46,120
Attack the nexus.

178
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,000
He's back.

179
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,639
You actually played
the match of Honor of Kings

180
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,639
with Qiao Jingjing.

181
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,840
What was going on?

182
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,799
And the more I listen to her voice,

183
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,960
the more I find it familiar.

184
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:07,600
Is she

185
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,759
the ordinary girl

186
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,480
we see every day?

187
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
Isn't this what it's supposed to be?

188
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:16,639
Right?

189
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:19,759
Yes.

190
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,360
We'll never see her again.

Are you here

196
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,639
to tender your resignation?

197
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,519
I'm here to work.

198
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,840
Really?

199
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,799
You're not leaving anymore?

200
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:50,759
Yes.

201
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:52,919
I need to tell Hu and the rest.

202
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,960
Our highly-skilled worker

203
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,080
is back again.

(Yu Tu,)

205
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,639
(come to my office.)

206
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:07,880
You wouldn't listen to me regardless.

207
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,599
But, you received a call from Hu,

208
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,759
and you went to Xi'an.

209
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,160
And, you even came back willingly.

210
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,079
Which one of us

211
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,400
is your teacher?

212
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,279
This has nothing to do with Mr. Hu.

213
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,119
When I was at Xi'an,

214
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,519
I deliberated it over.

215
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,839
Hu said that

216
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,720
you extended your holiday.

217
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,000
Didn't you do that

218
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,839
because you were undecided?

219
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,279
No.

220
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,640
There was something

221
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,160
I needed to handle.

222
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,039
Have a seat.

223
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,559
Yu Tu.

224
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
Don't take

225
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,880
what I said to heart.

226
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,640
I gave it a thought.

227
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,519
The environment you live in

228
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,640
is different from that of ours.

229
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,200
Back then,
it was definitely hard for us.

230
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,759
But, every industry
had its own challenges.

231
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,680
When everyone had it the same,

232
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,960
we wouldn't get disappointed so easily.

233
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
But, it's different now.

234
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,599
The cost of living has increased.

235
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,160
Economic inequality
has also become more significant.

236
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,880
How can we remain the same mindset?

237
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,240
What I told you that day

238
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,440
was detached from reality.

239
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
For that,

240
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:46,200
I want to apologize to you.

241
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,119
Sir...

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,960
Even though

243
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,319
you're back,

244
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:56,720
but if you still have doubts,

245
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,559
you won't be able to do anything well.

246
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Let me ask you one more time.

247
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,839
Have you thought it through?

248
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,880
I'll give my best.

249
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,359
Great.

250
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,119
That's great.

251
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:15,079
Our aerospace team

252
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,559
is getting younger and younger.

253
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,759
A few years ago,

254
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,519
at Beijing,

255
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,680
a 35-year-old guy

256
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,559
got promoted as the chief engineer.

257
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,799
I hope that

258
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,319
you'll work towards
accomplishing such an achievement as well.

259
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,599
Why did Guan Zai
fall ill all of a sudden?

260
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is he all right?

261
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,920
He said he was all right.

262
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:39,480
He asked me to tell the colleagues

263
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,279
not to pay him a visit.

264
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,000
That is just

265
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,079
how he is.

266
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,759
But,

267
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,119
you have to fill in for him.

268
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,039
Sure.

269
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,079
Get back to work.

270
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:54,359
Oh, yes.

271
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,559
The girl I saw the other day...

272
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,039
My wife told me that

273
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,279
she is a celebrity.

274
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
She's a nice girl.

275
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,680
What she said

276
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,400
made sense.

277
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,839
It's time for you

278
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,480
to think about your marriage.

279
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,400
She looks like a nice girl.

280
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,200
You should be more proactive.

281
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,920
Sir,

282
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,359
I have nothing to offer.

283
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,039
You are a capable man.

284
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,759
I don't understand.

285
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,359
You're a prospective chief engineer,

286
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,119
graduated from a prestigious school.

287
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,240
Why do you think

288
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,559
you're not good enough for a celebrity?

289
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,839
Is it because of money?

290
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,079
Let me put it this way.

291
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,640
Even if you earn
tens of millions annually,

292
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,960
I'm afraid that

293
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,839
you won't be richer than her too.

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,119
The aerospace industry

295
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,680
is a very romantic industry.

296
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,920
Do you still not understand?

297
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,480
Why is there

298
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,119
someone like you?

299
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:17,839
Get back to work.

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,279
The more I see you, the angrier I get.

301
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,799
Stop right there.

302
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,319
I forgot about the important thing
because of how mad I was.

303
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,839
We are done improving

304
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,039
the exploration rover.

305
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,680

at the assembly department.

306
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,759
On my way,

307
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,759
I'll go with you to take a look at it.

308
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,240
Mr. Zhang.

309

So,

327
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,319
we've decided to let Yu Tu
lead this project.

328

Sure.

334
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,200
Have you prepared

335

the documents and data

336
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,119

(TC-1 Design Plan 4.0)

373
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,100
(Sender, Guan Zai)

374
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:40,799
Here.

375
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,799
We'll have a meeting before work.

376
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,559
The experiment items today

377
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,759
are the speed,

378
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,839
the turning,

379
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,880
and the mobility
under extreme conditions.

380
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,160
Discuss these items.

381
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,660
(CATC)

382
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,480
The fake soil is normal.

383
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,839
This meets the requirement
of the experiment.

384
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,359
The linear motion experiment starts now.

385
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,510
(KS-2 Exploration Rover)

386
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,480
First drive cycle on flat ground.

387
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,039
(XS-2 Site)
First round, complete.

388
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,440
First drive cycle on flat ground.

389
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
Second round, complete.

390
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,400
After all, experiments are quite boring.

391
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,000
I'd rather be bored.

392
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
I don't need more excitement.

393
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,279
I don't want to start all over again.

394
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,720
Third drive cycle on flat ground.

395
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,559
Fifth round,

396
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
complete.

397
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,200
Now prepare for the slope-climbing test.

398
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,160
All requirements
for the slope-climbing test are met.

399
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,559
The experiment starts now.

400
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,359
Stop!

401
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,759
Why is it lagging?

402
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,720
I see abnormalities
on the telemetry too.

403
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,640
Why is the telemetry data such a mess?

404
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,279
Let's reproduce it.

405
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,640
Repeat

406
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,519
the previous drive cycle.

407
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,119
Stop it.

408
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,559
Everyone.

409
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,920
I looked into the data
of the slope-climbing test.

410
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,920
There shouldn't have been an issue.

411
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,400
All of you

412
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:24,880
should make sure that

413
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:25,960
your standalone devices
were working well.

414
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,880
Make sure that

415
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,519
there was no issue
with the communication system.

416
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:47,734
The telemetry shows that

417
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,079
all the indications were well received.

418
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,079
We also confirm that
there were no issues

419
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,000
with the integrated electronics.

420
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:51,920
It accurately sent

421
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,400
the indications to the mobile device.

422
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:54,960
There should be no problem

423
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,279
with the mobile device too.

424
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,240
We had been doing tests

425
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,160
on flat ground, linear motion,

426
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,559
and turning for the whole day.

427
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:00,400
There was

428
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,279
no lagging at all.

429
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,240
Send the test reports

430
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,720
and the blueprints to me.

431
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,079
Let's work harder

432
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,920
and make a thorough inspection.

433
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,400
We'll call it a day.

434
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,960
When we feel more refreshed tomorrow,

435
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,200
we'll continue the discussion.

436
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,359
Hopefully,

437
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,839
we can find out the problems tomorrow.

438
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,519
Otherwise, I won't get to celebrate

439
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
my girlfriend's birthday again.

440
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,319
Mr. Yu.

441
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:05,599
Are you not leaving yet?

442
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,680
I live somewhere nearby.

443
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,720
I'll stay for a while.

444
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,599
All right. Take care.

445
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,340
(Hall effect sensor module study)

446
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,119
Let's welcome

447
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,519
our birthday girl, Jingjing!

448
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,119
Jingjing.

449
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,079
Jingjing.

450
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,759
Jingjing

451
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,440
wears a really sweet outfit today.

452
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,319
I know I'm going to meet you today.

453
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:49,680
So, I decided to dress cutely.

454
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:50,920
This makes me look cuter too.

455
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,720
Jingjing is the cutest!

456
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,480
You're the cutest
and the most adorable girl.

457
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,079
Today,

458
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,640
we've prepared a mysterious gift

459
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,599
for Jingjing.

460
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,480
But, I have my own principles
of receiving gifts.

461
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,000
Yes, we know.

462
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,880
Jingjing doesn't want us
to spend money.

463
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,039
First, let's ask Jingjing a question.

464
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,759
Have you received anything special

465
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,799
for your birthday?

466
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,240
I haven't received

467
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,359
any special gifts.

468
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,200
But, I believe

469
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:12,960
what you are going to give me

470
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,200
will be the most special gifts.

471
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,640
If you bring everything
onto the stage,

472
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,480
I might not be able
to carry them on my own.

473
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,279
What do you want

474
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,920
for your birthday?

475
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,000
Then, I won't be shy.

476
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,440
Don't be shy.

477
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,079
Give me a Penta Kill.

478
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,920
So far, I haven't gotten a Penta Kill.

479
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,519
But, I want it from you.

480
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,640
I don't want it from anyone else.

481
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,279
You don't have to imitate
their playing styles.

482
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,480
I prefer to play with you.
