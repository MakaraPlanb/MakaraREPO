1
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,000
=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,959
Hey.

4
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:47,760
Jingjing.

5
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,000
I told you via WeChat

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,239
that Mr. Li changed his itinerary.

7
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,440
He's going back to Beijing tonight.

8
00:01:51,839 --> 00:01:52,360
We'll meet him

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,680
this afternoon instead.

10
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,839
Did you see it?

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,239
I didn't check WeChat.

12
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,000
What time are we meeting him?

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,959
3:30pm.

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,239
The make-up artist, stylist, and I

15
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,400
are already downstairs.

16
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
We'll come up now.

17
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,879
You brought the make-up artist

18
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:03,720
and stylist too?

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,599
We don't have much time.

20
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,919
It's faster if they help you.

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,919
This afternoon,

22
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,599
we happened to be at the office

23
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,440
discussing some work,

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,000
so I brought them over.

25
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,399
I forgot.

26
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,119
Is Mr. Yu

27
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,520
with you?

28
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,759
Of course he is.

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,639
You knew, and you brought
so many people over.

30
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,679
Figure something out.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,479
We're in the elevator already.

32
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,039
Tell them

33
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,839
that I'm here to fix appliances.

34
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,360
Aren't you too handsome for that?

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,759
Yes.

36
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,839
Right.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,119
What if

38
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,520
you close the door

39
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,639
after you leave?

40
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:40,960
Well...

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,119
The make-up artist and stylist

42
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:42,839
are from a team

43
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,160
we outsourced.

44
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,399
So...

45
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,240
Actually,

46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,320
Ms. Ling has long wanted to meet you.

47
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,039
Go.

48
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,839
Okay.

49
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:01,399
I'm coming.

50
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
We're coming in.

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,559
Come in.

52
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,279
Should we do it

53
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,440
in the living room?

54
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,919
Don't, let's do it...
Let's do it at the balcony.

55
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,279
The natural lighting would be better.

56
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,520
Okay, go in first,

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,160
and set things up.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,839
Okay.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,520
Where did you hide Mr. Yu?

60
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm very curious now.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,039
Exactly how handsome is he?

62
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,199
Xiao Zhu is full of compliments for him.

63
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:35,080
This is what we'll do.

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,039
I'll go and say hi in secret.

65
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,479
Don't... Don't do it in secret.

66
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,839
He'll feel shy.

67
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,320
Come on.

68
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,639
We're going to be late.

69
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:06,880
I'll get going.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Wait for me to come back.

71
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,600
Okay.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Slowly.

73
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,480
Ms. Sha said

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,359
that they asked Duan Wu

75
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,839
and his manager to come along.

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,359
Don't be nervous later.

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,920
Mr. Li doesn't usually give out scripts.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
He just wants to chat.

79
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
A big-shot director

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,239
has his own way of checking out people.

81
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,160
I heard about that.

82
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,559
If he's willing to meet you,

83
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,279
it means he feels

84
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,399
that you have something in you

85
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,760
that's suitable for the role.

86
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,679
Anyway,

87
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,920
just act natural.

88
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:50,720
Ling.

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,640
Ms. Sha.

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,799
Here, let me introduce you.

91
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,000
This is Jingjing.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,320
This is Ms. Sha.

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,079
She's the big-shot producer
and administrator

94
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,959
that Mr. Li always works with.

95
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,279
Hi, Ms. Sha.

96
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,559
Jingjing is more beautiful in person

97
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:01,799
than on-screen.

98
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:02,799
Being beautiful is secondary.

99
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:04,200
The important thing is that she acts well.

100
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,119
Is that so?

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,119
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

102
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,359
Duan Wu and his manager just arrived.

103
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,359
- Let's go.
- Come on.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,959
What are you busy with lately?

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
I just finished a reality show.

106
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,239
I was out in the sun for 12 days.

107
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,720
Look, I've gotten a tan.

108
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,799
That makes you look more real.

109
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:18,959
It's all right.

110
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,839
I think it looks quite natural too.

111
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:20,239
Right.

112
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:20,760
Director.

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,160
Jingjing and her manager are here.

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,279
Hi, Director.

115
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,279
Welcome.

116
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,320
We meet again, Director.

117
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,920
Hello.

118
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,679
Hello.

119
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,119
Jingjing met with Director before?

120
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:29,440
I think

121
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:30,880
it was one or two years ago.

122
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,200
We met

123
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,720
at a film festival.

124
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,000
Right.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,480
Am I right?

126
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:34,920
Ms. Qiao.

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,160
We haven't met for two years already.

128
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,519
You know each other?

129
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:40,079
We guested together
at a variety show before.

130
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,440
But I just made my debut back then.

131
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,559
I didn't know anything.

132
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,959
Good thing Ms. Qiao took care of me.

133
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,200
No.

134
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,600
You're being too kind, Mr. Duan.

135
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,239
Come on, sit down.

136
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,640
Sit down.

137
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,119
I

138
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,200
have some urgent matters to attend to.

139
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,959
I must go to Beijing tonight.

140
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,640
So at the last minute,

141
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,079
I gathered everyone here.

142
00:05:58,359 --> 00:05:59,640
You don't mind, right?

143
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
No.

144
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,559
I don't feel enough pressure
if there are too few of us.

145
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,839
Don't feel pressured.

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,200
Let's just have a casual chat.

147
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,160
Come on, have some tea.

148
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
Have some tea.

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,119
Thank you.

150
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:07,839
Here, Jingjing.

151
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,519
Okay.

152
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,079
Try Director's tea.

153
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,160
I'm back!

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,359
Where are you?

155
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,480
Guarding the house.

156
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,880
Guarding the house?

157
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,559
I don't see you!

158
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:48,839
She feels at ease

159
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,079
to leave me all alone here.

160
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,839
I must keep
this movie's materials confidential

161
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,440
until the last moment.

162
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,959
I'm sure

163
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,119
that it's completely different

164
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,160
from all the movies I've filmed.

165
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,279
Perhaps

166
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,839
it's even cooler

167
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:04,799
and

168
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,920
more imaginative.

169
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,200
Mr. Li.

170
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,000
When I entered your home just now,

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
I saw

172
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,040
the two game machines by the wall.

173
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,160
I was wondering if your movie

174
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,799
could be related to a game.

175
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,279
Based on what you said,

176
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,279
I think that's even more likely.

177
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,559
Duan, you're so perceptive.

178
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,160
No wonder they say online

179
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,359
that the temporary title

180
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,760
of your movie is called "Authenticity".

181
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,440
I can understand it now.

182
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
Game and reality.

183
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,399
Authentic and fake.

184
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,679
It's not

185
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,559
a simple representation.

186
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,079
The structure is more complicated.

187
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,160
For example...

188
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,040
Stop fishing for information from me.

189
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,440
I might let things slip.

190
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,160
Director, you're so secretive.

191
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,160
Then we'll stop making blind guesses.

192
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,600
We're looking forward to be surprised.

193
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,760
Okay.

194
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,480
Yu Tu.

195
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Let me tell you some good news.

196
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,079
You got the role?

197
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,640
I think so.

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,559
But the most important thing

199
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,040
is that Mr. Li said

200
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm too thin.

201
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,399
You're still in my house, right?

202
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,559
Come downstairs.

203
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:25,559
Let's have a free dinner.

204
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,359
It's Ms. Ling's husband's birthday.

205
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,399
She went ahead.

206
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll bring you to her house
for a free dinner

207
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
to give her a surprise.

208
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Are you sure

209
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,719
that it will be a surprise?

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
What's the matter?

211
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,559
When I think

212
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,440
that I'll get to eat food
that my wife cooked,

213
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,000
I...

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
I feel so happy.

215
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,559
What does that mean?

216
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,599
Are you saying that I'm busy with work,

217
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,640
and I have no time for our household?

218
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,359
No.

219
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,760
That's definitely not what I meant.

220
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm taking care of the household.

221
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,840
Cut the crap.

222
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Try

223
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,559
how my soup tastes.

224
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,359
Be careful, it's hot.

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,719
What do you think?

226
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
You can open a restaurant now.

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,559
Go and open the door.

228
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,679
The cake I ordered has arrived.

229
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,799
I'm coming.

230
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm coming.

231
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,919
Mr. Guo, happy birthday.

232
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,919
We're here for dinner.

233
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,760
Guo.

234
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,719
You're so well-informed.

235
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:28,799
This is for Huihui.

236
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:29,960
You don't need to buy anything.

237
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,919
No.

238
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,239
Leave.

239
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,080
Today,

240
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,919
you can't be our third wheel.

241
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,080
This is our quality time together.

242
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,200
Our daughter is here.

243
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,440
What the heck?

244
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,559
We're just having a simple dinner.

245
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,280
If you don't mind, come in.

246
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,760
Come in.

247
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
Come inside.

248
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,599
Xiao Zhu, come in.

249
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,599
Sit anywhere you like.

250
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:50,640
I'll pour you some tea.

251
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,239
This is the legendary

252
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,840
Chief Coach of 80 Heroes,

253
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,760
Mr. Yu, right?

254
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,559
Hi, Ms. Ling.

255
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,719
Just call me Yu Tu.

256
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,000
Come on, come inside.

257
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,400
I came here empty-handed.

258
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,320
I'm sorry.

259
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Why are you being so shy?

260
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,640
You don't need to prepare anything.

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,960
Just come here.

262
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,559
Before, Jingjing

263
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:13,200
wouldn't let me go to meet you.

264
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,640
Sit down.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,880
He's so handsome.

266
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
Come on, sit down.

267
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,919
Come on.

268
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,479
Well...

269
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,760
It's been a while

270
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,159
since I received jewelry
for my birthday.

271
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,840
I feel so moved.

272
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,599
Ms. Qiao.

273
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,479
It's my birthday.

274
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,719
What are you saying?

275
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,520
It's your birthday,

276
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,799
and I bought a gift for your wife.

277
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,359
Am I not helping you save money?

278
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,239
So it's like a gift for you.

279
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,599
If you don't like it,

280
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:54,280
go to the store

281
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,400
and exchange it
for something you can use.

282
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,719
Yes, you can exchange it.

283
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,359
What are you talking about?

284
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,039
How can I exchange this?

285
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:01,239
If I do, I must

286
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,520
add more money and exchange it
for something more expensive for you.

287
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,960
I must personally put it in you.

288
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
That's enough, cut it out.

289
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,159
Go and get Huihui.

290
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,200
Tell her that Jingjing is here. Hurry.

291
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,080
Yes, she'll definitely be so happy.

292
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:11,320
Thank you.

293
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,200
Give me another gift
on my lunar calendar birthday.

294
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,799
What are you looking at?

295
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,280
What do you mean?

296
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,599
Mr. Yu.

297
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,440
Well...

298
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:26,760
I want to talk to you.

299
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
Do you think

300
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
you have an interest

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,599
to join the entertainment circle?

302
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,679
I don't have any talent in that area.

303
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,719
Move.

304
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,559
Why do you need talent?

305
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,520
Your face is your talent.

306
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,080
Your IQ is so high.

307
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,719
Your comprehension must be very strong.

308
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:45,440
How would you know
that you don't have

309
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,239
any talent in acting if you don't try?

310
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:48,799
Our circle

311
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,679
lacks your age group

312
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,799
and your kind of aura the most.

313
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,520
Let me tell you.

314
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,080
It's not too late to make
your debut now.

315
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,119
I'm very confident

316
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,200
that in half a year,

317
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,359
I can surely make you famous.

318
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm sorry.

319
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,919
No.

320
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,320
Don't be sorry first.

321
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,400
Think about it carefully.

322
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,919
- Huihui, look who's here.
- Here she comes.

323
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:05,880
- Huihui.
- Come on.

324
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,159
Look who's here.

325
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:07,880
Huihui, come on.

326
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,679
Come here.

327
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,960
Hurry, Jingjing is here.

328
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,880
Come on, give her a hug.

329
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,840
Do you miss me?

330
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,520
Yes.

331
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,479
You do?

332
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:16,280
Good girl.

333
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,400
Think about it carefully again,

334
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:17,840
really.

335
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,119
You don't need to answer me today.

336
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,640
Go home, and think about it carefully.

337
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,359
You can do it.

338
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
There's no need to think about it.

339
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,679
Mr. Guo.

340
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,679
Look. It's your birthday,

341
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,760
and your wife is staring
at a handsome guy.

342
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,479
Aren't you sad?

343
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,679
Aren't you mad?

344
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,400
I'm not sad.

345
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm not mad.

346
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,239
She stares at handsome guys daily.

347
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,039
What are you talking about?

348
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,760
Jingjing.

349
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,000
Don't try to sow discord between us.

350
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,880
I'm working, okay?

351
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,559
Besides,

352
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,760
I haven't even commented about you.

353
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
You didn't even call to say
that you're coming.

354
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,640
We didn't make enough food.

355
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,239
It doesn't matter.

356
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:46,320
It's not a big deal.

357
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,960
Then we can order hot pot.

358
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,799
I want to have hot pot.

359
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,559
Right, there's no problem no matter
how many people come.

360
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,440
All right then.

361
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Xiao Zhu, make a call.

362
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,440
Call Dandan and the others over

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,359
to join in the fun.

364
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:54,919
All right.

365
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,719
Right.

366
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:56,719
I'll call the people in the office.

367
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,359
Call everyone who can come.

368
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,719
We're having hot pot.

369
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,559
Excuse me, don't burn yourself.

370
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,440
It smells so good.

371
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,799
This is rare. Look.

372
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,719
Here comes the braised ribbonfish.

373
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:12,320
Thank you, Ms. Ling.

374
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:12,799
Thank you.

375
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,760
Eat more.

376
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,080
Who's that?

377
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,520
Mind your images.

378
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,840
It's fine, Ms. Ling.

379
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,479
Since junior to senior high,

380
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,320
Mr. Yu

381
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
has already faced
this kind of situation.

382
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,599
He's used to it.

383
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,320
Junior high?

384
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,760
We went to the same junior high.

385
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,679
Our schools merged.

386
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,559
You were in Class 1, I was in Class 9.

387
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:50,400
Jingjing.

388
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,960
Does your school

389
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,719
divide you into sections
according to grades?

390
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,919
I think you've watched
too many idol dramas.

391
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,000
When I was in junior high,

392
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
I got very good grades.

393
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Otherwise, how can I get
into the same senior high

394
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
as Mr. Yu?

395
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,760
Right.

396
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,159
It's just that in senior high,

397
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,119
I was suppressed by annoying people
with this kind of IQ

398
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:05,919
like Mr. Yu.

399
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,119
Eat less.

400
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,080
You might get fat.

401
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,520
It's fine, let her eat.

402
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,960
Mr. Li requested it.

403
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Did Jingjing get the role?

404
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Pretty much.

405
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,679
We're just waiting to sign the contract.

406
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,479
That's great.

407
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:24,599
But let me tell you.

408
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,239
Today,

409
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,679
when we went to meet Director,

410
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,559
we encountered a very weird thing.

411
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:29,320
What happened?

412
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,119
What was it?

413
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,640
Well,

414
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,080
Duan Wu's manager

415
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,559
were giving us a hard time face-to-face.

416
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,159
After being in the entertainment circle
for so many years,

417
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,479
I've never encountered such a thing.

418
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:40,479
Wait, what happened?

419
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,679
Stop fishing for information.

420
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,000
I might let things slip.

421
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,679
Then we'll stop making blind guesses.

422
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,960
We're looking forward to be surprised.

423
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,880
Okay.

424
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
But speaking of games,

425
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,119
among us,

426
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:56,719
Jingjing should be
the best player, right?

427
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,640
Honor of Kings, which Jingjing endorses,

428
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,000
is the national game.

429
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,359
We all love playing it.

430
00:15:01,719 --> 00:15:03,359
We just couldn't get our levels up.

431
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,039
When will you have the time to lead me?

432
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,520
What is your rank?

433
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,359
Platinum.

434
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,599
My rank is higher than yours.

435
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:15,520
If I'll lead you,

436
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,799
it might increase the difficulty.

437
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,719
Give me your mobile phone.

438
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,840
I'll help you play one game.

439
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,239
Sure.

440
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,559
Wasn't she intentionally giving you
a hard time?

441
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,520
I know, right?

442
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,039
What did

443
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,320
she mean by that?

444
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Don't they want to work with us anymore?

445
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,520
Duan Wu just became popular last year,

446
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,719
and he's so arrogant already this year.

447
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,039
That has nothing to do with him.

448
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,440
Later on,

449
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,760
he explained it to me via WeChat.

450
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,640
He said that their company

451
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,960
wants to replace his manager.

452
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,280
I think she heard some news about it,

453
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,280
so

454
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,119
she did that on purpose.

455
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:48,239
She was trying to give both of us
a hard time.

456
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:48,799
I'm sure that Mr. Li

457
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,119
didn't have a good impression
of Duan Wu.

458
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,559
So that's the reason.

459
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,599
What did you do then?

460
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:56,320
I got her phone,

461
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,960
and won

462
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,080
Most Valuable Player.

463
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:01,760
- Well done.
- What do you think, Mr. Yu?

464
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,080
I didn't embarrass you, right?

465
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,000
Good job.

466
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,640
Jingjing, you're so good right now?

467
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,239
Her rank

468
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,520
is just Platinum.

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Look at how pleased she is.

470
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Right.

471
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,280
Eat up.

472
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,280
Jingjing.

473
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm considered

474
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,799
as the one who initiated you
into this game.

475
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,679
Right?

476
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,760
How can you easily

477
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,719
switch... switch to another teacher?

478
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,359
He's jealous.

479
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,320
Mr. Yu.

480
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,200
Do you want

481
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,400
to have a one-on-one game?

482
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,320
A solo?

483
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,919
Do a solo game!

484
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,640
- Solo!
- Solo!

485
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,599
You can't go easy on him

486
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:42,799
just because it's his birthday.

487
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,840
Well... Let's eat first.

488
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,280
We'll play.

489
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,799
You guys eat.

490
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,799
We'll play while eating.

491
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,479
Let's have a one-on-one game.

492
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:50,280
Come on.

493
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
Hurry.

494
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:37,719
Recite a 14-line sonnet.

495
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,880
Give me a goal.

496
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,199
Full attack.

497
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,119
Nice.

498
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,119
My hero won't do.

499
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,400
I'll use another one.
Let's play one more round.

500
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,000
Sure.

501
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,839
Hey, you're playing again?

502
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,359
Come on, hurry.

503
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,560
Yes, he's good.

504
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,040
He can do it.

505
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,560
Mr. Guo, you can do it.

506
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,479
All the best.

507
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:08,680
Why do I feel

508
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,880
like Mr. Guo is going to lose again?

509
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,400
Touch wood.

510
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,160
This... This is what we'll do.

511
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:13,959
Let's use the same hero.

512
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,839
Last round.

513
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,599
Sure.

514
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,680
Come on.

515
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,319
Mr. Guo, I'll give you some motivation.

516
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,800
All the best.

517
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
He lost again.

518
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,920
Forget it.

519
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,760
I know

520
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,239
what happened.

521
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:46,000
I didn't have lunch today.

522
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,959
Right.

523
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,880
I feel dizzy, so...

524
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,520
Come on.

525
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,479
We understand.

526
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,839
Have some beef.

527
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,920
Eat more.

528
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,599
This is cooked, right?

529
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,239
Here, have some beef.

530
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:54,680
Besides,

531
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
well...

532
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,079
Friendship is the priority,
competition comes second.

533
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,319
Right.

534
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,319
Here, Mr. Yu.

535
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,959
This beef of friendship smells so good.

536
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,599
Don't say that.

537
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
Don't be so naughty.

538
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,239
All right.

539
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,079
Mr. Yu.

540
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,719
You're the only one

541
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:10,959
who can deal with her now.

542
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,560
She's jealous.

543
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,520
You insist on letting everyone
be jealous of me.

544
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,160
Here, Mr. Guo.

545
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,119
Happy birthday.

546
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,319
Come on.

547
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,199
- Mr. Guo, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

548
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,239
Happy birthday.

549
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,880
Happy birthday.

550
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Happy birthday.

551
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,959
My goodness.

552
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:30,959
This is

553
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:31,560
too exaggerated.

554
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,280
Do you want it?

555
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,479
What's the matter?

556
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:36,040
It must be five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

557
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,520
Right, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

558
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,199
Listen, don't be so arrogant.

559
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:40,000
Right.

560
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,719
I'm so furious.

561
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,280
That's indeed the case.

562
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
Come on.

563
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,079
But you don't need

564
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,520
to consider my opinion too much.

565
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,359
I haven't paid attention to it
for many years already.

566
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,119
I've only checked the situation lately.

567
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,520
No.

568
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,000
I think what you said made sense.

569
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,160
I should definitely
reduce holdings accordingly.

570
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,640
Mr. Yu.

571
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:56,040
Look,

572
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,800
you're handsome and talented.

573
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,359
When you just arrived,

574
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,599
I.. I really thought

575
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,239
that you're
from the entertainment circle.

576
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:04,760
After we played games later on,

577
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,280
you're

578
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,920
definitely a professional.

579
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:12,520
I'm curious. What...

580
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,040
What exactly is your job?

581
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,680
Next month,

582
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll go to work at an investment bank.

583
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,199
An investment bank?

584
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
No wonder.

585
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,479
You're incredible.

586
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:31,040
Not everyone

587
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,800
can work in an investment bank.

588
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,040
Guo.

589
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,520
Come here.

590
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm having such bad luck.

591
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,959
Does anyone want this?

592
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,359
When was your luck good?

593
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:40,760
She can't survive without me.

594
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,719
Hurry.

595
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,560
Just sit here.

596
00:20:43,479 --> 00:20:44,520
Okay, I'm coming.

597
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,839
I need one more card.

598
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
One more card. I need one more card.

599
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,079
Does anyone want this card?

600
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,160
No, we don't want it.

601
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,800
It's so refreshing here.

602
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,040
Yes.

603
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,319
Are you really planning to work
at an investment bank?

604
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,280
Actually, in senior high,

605
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,839
I've always admired you.

606
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,520
Because you've always gotten
a perfect score

607
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,599
in Math and Physics.

608
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,400
Back then, I thought

609
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:03,680
that you'll

610
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,760
probably become

611
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,319
a very incredible scientist.

612
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:08,199
That way,

613
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,040
I'll probably feel very honored too

614
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,760
as your classmate.

615
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,640
I'll probably disappoint you.

616
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,479
No.

617
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,119
It's good to work
in an investment bank too.

618
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:24,959
I think

619
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,920
that no matter what you do,

620
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,079
you'll be very incredible.

621
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,000
Someone once said

622
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,760
that I'm very selfish.

623
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:48,959
I'm capable

624
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:49,719
of giving my family

625
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,000
a better life,

626
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:52,359
yet I'm being selfish

627
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,000
by letting my family sacrifice

628
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,839
for my so-called dream.

629
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,520
Then you should tell that person,

630
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,439
"I'm sorry.

631
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,560
This is the only thing I'm capable of."

632
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:13,479
Think about it.

633
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,000
If you can't do everything well

634
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,800
like you do now,

635
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,319
and you can only do one thing well,

636
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:19,599
based on people's standards,

637
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,959
you're actually
very outstanding already, right?

638
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,680
Will anyone say that you're selfish?

639
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,079
I'm sure the person said
that you're selfish

640
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:26,400
because you have too many types

641
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,239
of outstanding capabilities.

642
00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:29,280
How can he blame you

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
because you're outstanding?

644
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,239
I think I have good logic.

645
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,040
Am I wrong?

646
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,119
Right.

647
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,719
You're so smart.

648
00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:43,680
Everything you say is right.

649
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:44,920
Of course.

650
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,319
I didn't expect us

651
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,640
to talk about these things one day.

652
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,199
Yes.

653
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Compared to this, what's even weirder

654
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,280
is that I taught you
how to play games one day.

655
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,199
Weren't you tricked into it?

656
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,800
By the way,

657
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:08,920
why is it

658
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,400
80 Heroes Chief Coach?

659
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,359
Doesn't Honor of Kings

660
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:12,760
have over 100 heroes?

661
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,560
Do you have OCD?

662
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,000
You insist on letting me explain.

663
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,439
Because I'm not worthy of learning

664
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,599
from the remaining 20 heroes.

665
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,520
For example, Li Bai, Wan'er,

666
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang.

667
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,119
I won't count them anymore.

668
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,599
It hurts my pride to count them
one by one.

669
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,359
Right.

670
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:31,959
Ms. Qiao.

671
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,199
You just

672
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,800
don't have time to learn from them.

673
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,839
Of course.

674
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,640
That's the reason.

675
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
You said that you'll be working
at the investment bank next month.

676
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,199
When exactly is it?

677
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,680
Around the middle of the month.

678
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,839
Then you can keep teaching me

679
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:51,119
until the competition.

680
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,439
Sure.

681
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,920
We're friends now, right?

682
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,599
Of course.

683
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:06,079
Weight Gain Ace Plan begins.

684
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,520
Our goal is

685
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,719
to reach Ace rank within ten days.

686
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,439
Within 30 days,

687
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,199
gain five pounds

688
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,000
in weight.

689
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,439
Don't be so agitated.

690
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,560
My plan

691
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,719
just has a minor problem.

692
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,040
I executed it too fully.

693
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,199
I think you're the one who's too full.

694
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:38,439
Didn't you say

695
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,280
that you'll increase
your weight gradually

696
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,079
in 30 days?

697
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,000
Why did you gain five pounds

698
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,280
in one week?

699
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,439
Can I control

700
00:26:44,439 --> 00:26:46,040
my weight?

701
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,319
Doesn't it have a mind

702
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,199
of its own?

703
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,479
Control yourself, okay?

704
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,319
Don't gain 15 pounds

705
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,560
in 30 days.

706
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,599
That blogger

707
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,719
will bash you again later on.

708
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,400
Don't worry.

709
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,599
I checked using an alternate account.

710
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,800
Someone took a photo of her
on the streets.

711
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,959
She gained at least ten pounds.

712
00:26:58,959 --> 00:26:59,599
Her face is so big.

713
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,599
She even dares to comment about me?

714
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,920
Your weight gain plan

715
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,199
is a success.

716
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,959
What about the plan
to raise your ranking?

717
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,160
It's even more successful.

718
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm already in Diamond 1 rank.

719
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,439
I'll reach Ace rank soon.

720
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,079
That's fast.

721
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,880
Mr. Yu is leading you, right?

722
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,599
How is that possible?

723
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,760
I've been playing alone.

724
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,439
Mr. Yu is so cold.

725
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,199
I encountered
cheating teammates consecutively,

726
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,599
lost ten times in a row,
and he wouldn't lead me.

727
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,959
Tonight,

728
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,839
after my last big meal,

729
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,760
I'll start to control myself.

730
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,520
I'm hanging up.

731
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,560
No, I...

732
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:31,719
That brat.

733
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,319
When playing alone,

734
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:35,920
you'll encounter

735
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,359
all sorts of situations and teammates.

736
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:39,079
It's beneficial in training
your personal capability.

737
00:27:39,479 --> 00:27:40,400
And during the competition,

738
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,040
you'll have two teammates
whom you don't know.

739
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,000
You don't know their competence.

740
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,160
So

741
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,119
you must plan for the worst.

742
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,280
Also,

743
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,719
you were the one who cheated others
in the previous round,

744
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,079
not the other way around.

745
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,760
For two team battles,

746
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,239
your started the team battle when
your teammates hadn't caught up yet.

747
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:57,920
You were too impatient.

748
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
I recorded them.

749
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,040
Take a look.

750
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,560
Wait.

751
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,880
I'll weigh myself again.

752
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,560
The figure earlier was
before I had breakfast.

753
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,560
(After having lunch,)

754
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,400
(I'm already 99 pounds.)

755
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,640
(Even if it would usually go down)

756
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,160
(in the morning,)

757
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,959
(if I continue)

758
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,119
(having a big meal tonight,)

759
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:30,520
(perhaps)

760
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,400
(I'll have an inflated weight
of 97 pounds.)

761
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,719
(Should I still eat)

762
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:35,599
(at the place we reserved then?)

763
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:50,400
(I haven't gone out for a meal
in a long time.)

764
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
(But as a female celebrity,)

765
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,839
(how can I weigh 97 pounds?)

766
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,000
Earlier,

767
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,160
I was a bit too strict.

768
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,959
This is what we'll do.

769
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,479
Before 5:30pm,

770
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:07,479
if I can reach Ace rank,

771
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:07,839
let's still

772
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:08,959
go out to eat.

773
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:09,839
But starting tomorrow,

774
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,160
we can't do that anymore.

775
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:21,880
Come and watch the video
from the last round.

776
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,439
Hurry.

777
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,199
Your future child

778
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,280
will surely be very pitiful.

779
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,239
Hurry up.

780
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,439
How would I know

781
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:41,680
where they are then?

782
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,160
Last time, I told you

783
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:49,479
some jungle battle concepts

784
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,160
and key positions.

785
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,040
I forget when I'm playing.

786
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,680
After being caught a few more times,

787
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:58,959
you'll remember.

788
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,839
Go on watching.

789
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,119
Do you understand now?

790
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,400
Yes.

791
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:09,640
How can you find

792
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,800
so many problems?

793
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:11,719
When you're in the competition,

794
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:13,079
thousands of viewers

795
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,160
will be watching more carefully
than I am.

796
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:16,640
Okay.

797
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll begin then.

798
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,359
You still need four stars
to reach Ace rank.

799
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,839
You still have one and a half hour

800
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,199
before 5:30pm.

801
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,079
Basically, winning is the only option.

802
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,880
You can't lose.

803
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,880
Begin, I'll watch.

804
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
Tianmei.

805
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,560
Consider that I am

806
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,040
your endorser.

807
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,119
The enemy's army will arrive
on the battlefield in five seconds.

808
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,160
Please get ready.

809
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:49,040
Why is someone away
from the keyboard now?

810
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm incredible in jungle battles.

811
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,000
I can't believe I got five already.

812
00:30:59,119 --> 00:30:59,959
Go on playing.

813
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,119
Look.

814
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm the Most Valuable Player.

815
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,719
Thirty-three percent exhaustion.

816
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,920
Don't be too proud.

817
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,640
There's one more round.

818
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,239
I think their Mid and Jungle players

819
00:31:22,239 --> 00:31:23,239
are fighting.

820
00:31:23,239 --> 00:31:24,520
They just stood there for me to kill.

821
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:35,839
What happened?

822
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:38,000
Isn't it supposed to be difficult
to advance to the next rank?

823
00:31:41,719 --> 00:31:42,800
It seems like Tianmei

824
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,719
wants their endorser to eat more.

825
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,959
Where are we eating?

826
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,439
Why is there such a long line?

827
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,719
I remember that this restaurant

828
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,079
wasn't that popular before.

829
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:13,959
I think they got

830
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,160
on the Michelin guide a while ago.

831
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,439
But we made reservations

832
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:17,280
We don't need to wait.

833
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,079
Jingjing.

834
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:18,680
Mr. Yu.

835
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,560
Go inside first.

836
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,760
I'll return some stuff to the brand.

837
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
I'll come to find you later.

838
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:22,719
Okay.

839
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,119
You go ahead.

840
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,800
That's what I was thinking too,

841
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,920
so that you won't get photographed
because of me.

842
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,280
Hello.

843
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,359
Reservation for Ms. Zhu.

844
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,280
Please come inside.

845
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,000
Thank you.

846
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,719
This is the room Ms. Zhu booked.

847
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,199
Let's order a few more dishes.

848
00:33:14,199 --> 00:33:14,880
If we can't finish them,

849
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,040
you can bring takeout to So Panicky.

850
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:16,839
I want to try

851
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:17,959
a few dishes.

852
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,640
Jingjing.

853
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,199
I want to ask a favor.
