doesn't reach

31
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,719
the performance requirement.

32
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:04,960

(What's wrong?)

37
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,879
(There was a scene earlier.)

38
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,959
(My acting was falling short)

39
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,360
(so we had to redo it so many times.)

40
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,040
(I haven't had so many NGs in a while.)

41
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,279
(It was so embarrassing.)

42
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,319
(So did it pass it eventually?)

43
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,560
(I did.)

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,879
(But it was a little disheartening.)

45
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
(Cheer me up.)

(Are you brushing me off?)

(Perhaps setbacks)

(are too common for me.)

00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,279
(I've got used to it.)

54
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,360

and complicated.)

(Let's do our best.)

63
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,519
So this is

64
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,000
how it feels like to have a soul mate.

65
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,360
How thoughtful of me...

66
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,399
to cheer up my discouraged boyfriend.

67
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,399
(I have a question, Ms. Qiao.)

68
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
(Did that scene you mentioned
involve kissing?)

69
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,000
A discouraged boyfriend?

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,240
How silly of me.

Okay, let's begin.

77
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,040
Who's singing?

78
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,720
A co-worker who came along.

79
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,240
His name is Dameng.

80
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,120
I can tell

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,279
he's in high spirits.

82
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,040
We learned a lot from our trip here.

83
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Did you solve the problems

84
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,199
you had earlier?

85
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,839
It's not that easy.

86
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,720
However,

87
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,879
the chances of realizing the goal
have increased drastically.

88
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,240
Congratulations.

89
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,480
What about you?

90
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Did the filming go well?

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,319
I got compliments

92
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,959
from the screenwriter who visited us.

93
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,560
When are you coming back to Shanghai?

94
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,680
Tomorrow.

95
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,000
After that,

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,399
things will get busy for a while.

97
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,360
I get it.

99
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,439
to my messages

100
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,639
after two hours.

101
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,399
Someone went missing for two months.

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,959

103

Your co-worker is so funny!

105
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,639
He is.

106
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,759
He saw our chat

107
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,720
the other day.

108
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,680
I told him it was a WeChat program.

109

110
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,480
Later on,

111
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,319
he asked me

112
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,519
how to download the program.

113
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,840
He wanted to try it out too.

114
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,519
The EQ of male scientists

115
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,480
is dragged down by his intellect.

116

that made him believe

121
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960

122

as a lively

125
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:51,000
and gorgeous lady?

126
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
Did I sound like a bot?

127
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,279
Which conversation

128
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,480
did he see?

129

191
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,080
The next scene is very important.

192
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,440
So get ready for it.

193
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Ms. Qiao.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,679
A minute, please.

195
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,200
I need to discuss this with you.

196
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,480
The truth is,

197
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,240
you have an event

198
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
in Shanghai this Saturday night.

199
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,399
You applied for leave

200
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,679
and agreed to film on Sunday night.

201
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,240
Yes.

202
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,039
But

203
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,559
there have been some complications
at the set.

204
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,120
We can't film on Friday.

205
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,240
Perhaps

206
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,320
we could use

207
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,240
the next two days

208
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,399
to finish the scene.

209
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,360
Then you could go

210
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:04,960
on Friday afternoon.

211
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,559
You won't have to rush
to get on a flight

212
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,399
on Saturday morning.

213
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,720
Sure, I have no problem with it.

214
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,159
Very well.

215
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,679
I'll get the new notice ready.

216
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,279
Okay, thanks.

217
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you.

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,799
Don't mention it.

219
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,440
Have some water.

220
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,639
I'll pass. I need my phone.

221
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,639
(Ding.)

222
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,159
(A kind reminder from your WeChat bot.)

223
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,440
(Top up 68 yuan to enjoy)

224
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,919
(a huge promotion pack.)

225
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,000
(Oh?)

226
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,759
(Aren't you going to top up?)

227
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,960
(I want to try the other program.)

228
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,480
(The first game top-up
is usually six yuan.)

229
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,440
(Don't you think)

230
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
(you're a little too greedy?)

231
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
(But I would consider the offer)

232
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
(if I could check the content
of the promotion pack.)

233
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:57,600
(A blind date event)

234
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,799
(for the next three days.)

235
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,120
(You must top up to participate.)

236
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,519
(I'll be back in Shanghai)

237
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,559
(for a promo event.)

238
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,600
(The director gave me a day off.)

239
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,500
(520 yuan, please accept)

240
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,940
(520 yuan, accepted)

241
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,420
(Yu Tu)

242
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,559
Hello?

243
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,639
When?

244
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll pick you up.

245
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,399
The event tomorrow starts at 6.30 PM.

246
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,480
But Ms. Ling

247
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,039
arranged a slot for a magazine interview

248
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,840
after the makeup session.

249
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,600
You must start making up
in the hotel at noon.

250
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,879
I shouldn't have told her
I would be back today.

251
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,120
Hold on.

252
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,039
Let me check if he really

253
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,120
is my blind date.

254
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
I don't want to get the wrong guy.

255
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,360
And your conclusion?

256
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,679
The guy looks better in person.

257
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,639
It's you.

258
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,240
Let's go.

259
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,840
Wait.

260
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,960
I need to check on you too.

261
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,840
Well?

262
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,320
Do you trust the lady's selfie now?

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
You're in public.

264
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,240
Please restrain yourselves.

265
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,559
Get in the car.

266
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
I'll leave you be.

267
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,799
I can get a taxi.

268
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,519
Jingjing didn't ask me to leave.

269
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,639
I have work to see to.

270
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,919
When did I ever ask you to leave?

271
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,679
Never.

272
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,279
You just didn't let me go with you.

273
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,240
I should get going.

274
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,960
See you.

275
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:30,799
Let's go.

276
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
We're going to be rich!

277
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,200
This is juicy!

278
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,080
We missed our target,
but we got Qiao Jingjing!

279
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,360
Make sure you post it on April 1st.

280
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,600
It will go trending for days!

281
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,799
Was that man her boyfriend?

282
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,679
They were too intimate.

283
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:55,960
Of course!

284
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,080
They got rid of the assistant.

285
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,240
They are all alone now.

286
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
The guy looked dashing.

287
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
There was no way he could be a staff!

288
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,000
I bet he's rich too.

289
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
A Benz SUV.

290
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,319
These female celebrities

291
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,200
are unbelievable.

292
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,480
Come on, we should follow them!

293
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,240
Sure, let's go!

294
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,759
The traffic isn't moving at all.

295
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,519
It takes two hours to reach Lujiazui.

296
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,200
It's the peak hour.

297
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Maybe there was an accident ahead.

298
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,799
(Road Map)

299
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,839
Ms. Qiao.

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,079
I have a suggestion.

301
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,880
Well,

302
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,920
the way to your home is jammed.

303
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,039
Could we go somewhere else?

304
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,240
We'll reach in 20 minutes.

305
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,480
Tianyu City?

306
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,000
That's where I live.

307
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
You are despicable.

308
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,920
You're bringing me home

309
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,599
on your first blind date?

310
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,680
I wouldn't be the first.

311
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,079
I used to know

312
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,160
a beautiful girl

313
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,039
who asked me to go to her house

314
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,759
after only a few matches with me.

315
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:40,839
So did you go to her place?

316
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,720
If you did, you'd be a bad guy.

317
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,839
I can't date you.

318
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,400
No.

319
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,079
Liar.

320
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,319
Your words can't be trusted

321
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,440
from now on.

322
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
How can you prove

323
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,359
I went to her place?

324
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,960
Do you know the girl?

325
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:05,880
I...

326
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,759
The car at the front moved.

327
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,519
Get moving.

328
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,799
Where to?

329
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,319
Calculating the route.

330
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,799
The destination is 20 km away.

331
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,440
It will take around 20 minutes.

332
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
I must have pressed it accidentally.

333
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,240
Forget it, we'll go there instead.

334
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,839
The traffic is jammed,

335
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,319
but my heart is burning.

336
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,839
I can already smell the headline.

337
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,799
A juicy scoop.

338
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:54,079
Don't get your hopes up.

339
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,799
What if

340
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,039
they go home after dinner?

341
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,119
You are too naive.

342
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,079
You've never been in love.

343
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,839
Judging by their intimate interaction,

344
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,079
a lunch won't be enough.

345
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,039
They are certainly getting a hotel room.

346
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,599
Maybe they are going home.

347
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,279
Qiao Jingjing's home is in Lujiazui.

348
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,279
Something is amiss.

349
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,240
They got on the outer ring.

350
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,079
Aren't they going to Lujiazui?

351
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:17,799
Forget that.

352
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,519
Follow them.

353
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,599
National Aerospace Research Institute?

354
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,000
This is your workplace.

355
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,720
Yes.

356
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
(National Aerospace Research Institute)

357
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,559
You're driving too fast.

358
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,519
There's nothing to see here.

359
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,319
My house is next to it.

360
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,319
We'll pass by it often.

361
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,119
I didn't know you lived

362
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,279
so close to the institute.

363
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,400
It's only across the road.

364
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,599
It was

365
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:59,160
one of the commercial houses
by the institute.

366
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,880
I took up a loan some years ago

367
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,279
and bought it from a co-worker.

368
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,920
That should make
a workaholic's life easier.

369
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,759
We're checking out your house

370
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:31,720
right after the blind date.

371
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,000
This is a little too old-fashioned.

372
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,799
I have a more serious

373
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,720
question for you.

374
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,359
We just finished the blind date,

375
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,839
but I already...

376
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,359
What are they doing in the car?

377
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,319
What else could it be?

378
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,480
We can't see anything.

379
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,279
I don't think that's
Qiao Jingjing's house.

380
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,759
Is it the man's house?

381
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,559
It could be.

382
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
The car...

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,680
I remember it now.

384
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,519
The car belongs to Qiao Jingjing.

385
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,480
I've seen it before.

386
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,440
When they get off the car,

387
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,640
find out where they live.

388
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,160
We could get to see
the inside of the house.

389
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,119
I'll take point.

390
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:38,079
Okay.

391
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,319
They got off the car! Now!

392
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
The man is quite tall.

393
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,319
He looks handsome from the side.

394
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,119
He has long legs.

395
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,480
Is he a new celebrity?

396
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,119
No celebrity would live here.

397
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,319
It's too far from the city.

398
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,119
They could

399
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,519
at least rent a house near Huaihai Road.

400
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,960
Dou, they got off the car.

401
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay.

402
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,279
The slippers.

403
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
They are cute.

404
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,839
Did you plan this?

405
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,359
I bought it after Lunar New Year.

406
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,720
Was that early enough?

407
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,559
Not bad.

408
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,640
But I did it better.

409
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,359
I bought

410
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,400
an air purifier.

411
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,440
It's like a library in here.

412
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,160
Could I have a look around?

413
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,200
That question was redundant.

414
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,480
It's good manners.

415
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,279
You graduated years ago.

416
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,559
But the learning never stopped.

417
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,119
The field

418
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:27,440
of aerospace is systematic engineering.

419
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,359
It involved different
elements of science.

420
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,160
The more I learn

421
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
in the main department,

422
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,680
the better I can communicate

423
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,640
with the subsystem engineers.

424
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:37,960
I don't really get it,

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,680
but it sounded

426
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,880
very complex and incredible.

427
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,799
I get it now.

428
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,559
Have some water.

429
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:52,160
Is this the Jade Rabbit?

430
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,319
Yes.

431
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,759
It's a 1: 30 model.

432
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,079
It's so small and detailed.

433
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,319
It moves!

434
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,880
You can even hold it.

435
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,200
It's adorable.

436
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,839
I have more in my room.

437
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Would you like a tour?

438
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,880
I'm a reserved person.

439
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,599
I can't walk around

440
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:31,960
in my blind date's house.

441
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,240
Where are we going?

442
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,400
Check out my room.

443
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,519
It's so tidy and clean in here.

444
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,960
I thought all single men's houses

445
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,200
are messy.

446
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,559
My girlfriend was away for months.

447
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,839
It did feel like a single life for me.

448
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,799
Sorry.

449
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,920
I mean, you live here by yourself.

450
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,960
There are tonnes of books here.

451
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,000
I feel a little embarrassed.

452
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,920
Your house is full of books.

453
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,720
But mine is full of clothing.

454
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,240
Your job requires it.

455
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,079
Indeed.

456
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,319
I bought them

457
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,480
because I need them for my work.

458
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,799
I didn't buy them to look pretty.

459
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,440
What are you looking for?

460
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,400
A doll.

461
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,359
Maybe it's not in this room.

462
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,319
Come with me.

463
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm not a child anymore.

464
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't need your toy.

465
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,000
Zhai Liang used to live here.

466
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,200
This is the guest bedroom.

467
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,079
Is this rocket merchandise?

468
00:26:59,079 --> 00:26:59,839
Long March 5.

469
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
Someone gave me at the cosmodrome.

470
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,359
It looks interesting.

471
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:05,960
It's so cute,

472
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,599
how could you lock it up in here?

473
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,400
Its master is here now.

474
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Set it aside.

475
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,480
Let's have dinner.

476
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,279
I had mine on the flight.

477
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,359
I'll pass.

478
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,960
Are you cooking?

479
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,960
At least try it out.

480
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,200
Is this

481
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
the breakfast from the photo
you sent me?

482
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,119
Yes.

483
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:48,839
I want a bite.

484
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,160
I regret not trying

485
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,440
your cooking in the past.

486
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,759
But now,

487
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,319
I'm glad I didn't try it.

488
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,799
Why is the noodle so stiff?

489
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,160
I think it's good.

490
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,400
You must have a strong digestive system.

491
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,279
Enjoy.

492
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,440
I'll play a few matches.

493
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,240
There is

494
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,640
a new hero in Honor of Kings.

495
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,519
I should help promoting it.

496
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,100
(Flying Snowflake sent you an invite)
(Rejected)

497
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,360
(Reject)

498
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:50,880
(Sorry, I'm not free now.)
(Send)

499
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,540
(Chen Xue)

500
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:58,799
Hello?

501
00:28:59,359 --> 00:28:59,759
Qiao Jingjing.

502
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,400
Why do you keep

503
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,319
turning me down?

504
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,799
I know you weren't at the set.

505
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,839
Hurry up!

506
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,920
We need one more teammate.

507
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,559
No, that's not fair for me.

508
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,079
My ranking drops when I play with you.

509
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
Are you even my friend?

510
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,039
I'm only four stars away

511
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,079
from the Ace rank.

512
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,039
Hurry up. I'll send you an invite.

513
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
Was that your friend's invite?

514
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,720
Yeah.

515
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,680
I had some free time lately

516
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,079
so I played with my WeChat account.

517
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,960
It was Chen Xue.

518
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,400
She's my good friend,

519
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,519
and also an actor.

520
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,599
I keep getting her invites.

521
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,640
She always let me down.

522
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,279
Did you stop me

523
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,039
from watching

524
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,680
her ex-boyfriend's movie?

525
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,000
Yes, that's her!

526
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,480
She said she was four stars away

527
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,240
from getting Ace rank.

528
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,880
She wants me in her five-stacking.

529
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,359
I can't carry her at all.

530
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,160
Go online.

531
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,519
I'll play for you.

532
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,079
It's been a while.

533
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,559
I want to try out the new hero.

534
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,160
Four stars...

535
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,079
That should take about an hour.

536
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,559
Of course you can do it.

537
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,680
You can pretend you were me

538
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
and flex on her.

539
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:05,599
But don't

540
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,160
make it too easy for her.

541
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,440
(Send me a red pocket,)

542
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,839
(I'll get you to Ace rank tonight.)

543
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,319
Come on, the game is starting.

544
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,599
What are the skills?

545
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,079
Are you learning it right away?

546
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,200
You know how brilliant I am.

547
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,260
(You have been slain.)

548
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,460
(Defeat)

549
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,599
Perhaps you're not

550
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,839
familiar with the new hero.

551
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:00,799
You'll do fine after a few matches.

552
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,920
Let me try again.

553
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,900
(Defeat)

554
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,880
It is almost impossible to carry her.

555
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,680
Try carrying them

556
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,359
with another hero.

557
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,960
Don't worry. I got the hang of it.

558
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,380
(Defeat)

559
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,039
Qiao Jingjing, use the voice chat.

560
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,759
Stop feeding the enemy

561
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:41,519
with the new hero.

562
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,319
I didn't pay 200 yuan

563
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,680
just to lose three stars.

564
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,160
It's...

565
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,839
It's because

566
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:47,759
the hero is too weak

567
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,759
to keep up with your skills.

568
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:49,640
We could try

569
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,519
a different hero.

570
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,079
I took

571
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,440
200 yuan from Chen Xue.

572
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,960
Okay.

573
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,279
What's wrong with me?

574
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,140
(Victory)

575
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,440
She finally got the rank.

576
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,319
It's time to run away.

577
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,200
This is not

578
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,480
worth the 200 yuan.

579
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,799
It's already so late.

580
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:37,880
I must leave now.

581
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,000
Ms. Ling arranged an interview

582
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,960
for tomorrow afternoon.

583
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,279
I must rest well tonight.

584
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,559
It's almost midnight.

585
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:48,640
It takes roughly

586
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,880
an hour to reach your home.

587
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,720
That means

588
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,240
you'll only be home at 1 AM.

589
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,599
You have events and interviews tomorrow.

590
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,960
Jingjing.

591
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,240
You should stay here for the night.

592
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,559
You want me to stay?

593
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,440
I'll use the guest bedroom.

594
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,039
I used to live at your place

595
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,799
for convenience.

596
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,319
This is the best solution.

597
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,319
Yes, the best solution.

598
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,240
It's Chen Xue's fault.

599
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,200
I thought it would take

600
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,759
only an hour to carry her.

601
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,119
I'll clean up the room for you.

602
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,960
Wait.

603
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:35,920
What's wrong??

604
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll play for you.

605
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,960
It's been a while.

606
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,160
I want to try out the new hero.

607
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:45,759
Four stars...

608
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,599
That should take about an hour.

609
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,640
Did I just fall for your scheme?

610
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,640
You lost the first three rounds
on purpose.

611
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
You were buying time.

612
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,200
Every match took over 20 minutes.

613
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,200
Not to mention you were stalling during

614
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,519
the last three matches you won.

615
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,640
It took you over three hours

616
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,079
to carry my friend to Ace rank.

617
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,880
But it took you far less time

618
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,400
to carry me through ranked matches.

619
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,039
You...

620
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,119
You're so sneaky!

621
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,880
Don't be paranoid.

622
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,079
I wasn't familiar with the new hero.

623
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,679
I was a little rust for not playing
in a long time.

624
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,719
Is this true?

625
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,360
It is.

626
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,719
Solo queue with the new hero.

627
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,519
Win a match with it.

628
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,440
Get at least 15 kills,

629
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,360
then I won't go home.

630
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,000
That's...

631
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,679
a little too challenging.

632
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,960
I only had three matches with it.

633
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,480
I lost all three matches.

634
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,639
It's only Diamond rank.

635
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,159
Fine. Forget it.

636
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,039
Send me home.

637
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:44,920
I don't mind staying up.

638
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,119
I'll give it a try.

639
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,180
(Shine Bright: MVP)

640
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:30,280
The fourth time is the charm.

641
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:32,880
Send me home.

642
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,519
Don't go back on your words.

643
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,639
I'm not.

644
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,639
I said I wouldn't go home,

645
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,960
I never said I would stay here.

646
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm staying in a hotel.

647
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,559
The event organizers

648
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:49,840
always book a room for me.

649
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:53,880
Well? Mr. Yu?

650
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,239
You're not the only sneaky one around.

651
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
I miscalculated.

652
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,519
All right, I need to go.

653
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,639
I have a few days off.

654
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
I could go to the event with you.

655
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,519
Don't you have work tomorrow?

656
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,159
I thought you worked overtime
on weekends.

657
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,480
So I had been very busy

658
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,880
for the past few days.

659
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,159
I barely had any rest.

660
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,480
Driving you home

661
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,639
takes at least an hour.

662
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,039
By the time I'm home,

663
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,760
it will already be 2 AM.

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,199
Then in the morning,

665
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,800
I have to go to your place.

666
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,239
You said you wanted to get ready

667
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,800
because I couldn't be trusted.

668
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,079
It seems like

669
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,679
I should get ready as well.

670
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,599
Are you hungry?

671
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,119
We could grab some food.

672
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,280
I'm not eating your noodles.
