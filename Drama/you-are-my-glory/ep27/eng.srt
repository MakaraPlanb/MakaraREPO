00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,170
♪You crossed the sea of ​​stars
and came with light♪

2
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,170
♪My heart is like the dust, and I
couldn't bear to stain the hemline♪

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,490
♪To love in a different way,
the fireworks are in the stars' good graces♪

4
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,610
♪I turn around and realize that
my heart is empty♪

5
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,610
♪I miss the overflowing galaxy
surging into the sea♪

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,410

♪Looking at you,
the light in your eyes dimmed♪

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,650
♪I laughed at myself
and that I deserve it ♪

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:27,650

=You Are My Glory=

13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 27=

14
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,439
Remember to take good care of yourself.

15
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,400
I don't want you to go

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,239
but you have to work, don't you?

17
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
Well, we have internet now...

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,360
(I am back!)

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,039
(Guys, I have explosive news.)

20
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,080
(It's about a funny story)

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,120
(between two A-listers.)

22
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,240
(I'm in the showbiz.)

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
(We have a project at the moment)

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,639
(with two female leads, A and B.)

25
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,000
(They never like each other)

26
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,280
(but they have to work together
because our director is famous.)

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,479
(Earlier on,)

28
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,680
(B's boyfriend came to visit her.)

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
(He brought a huge team with him.)

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,560
(Like people for barbecue, for hotpot,)

31
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:29,960
(and for wok food.)

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,439
(Even a mobile bar! Can you imagine?)

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,159
(And today,)

34
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,840
(A's boyfriend came to visit her too.)

35
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,000
(Very low profile.)

36
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,840
(He came with an old jeep.)

37
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,639
(There's no food or drinks whatsoever.)

38
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:40,879
(However!)

39
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,360
(Allow me to emphasize this)

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,319
(with 80 thousand exclamation marks.)

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,479
(He gave us internet signals.)

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,039
(Like I said previously,)

43
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,280
(where we're shooting is so remote that
the reception is horrible.)

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,520
(You can't even have a call properly,)

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
(let alone surf the internet.)

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,199
(A's boyfriend brought a thing.)

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,479
(I can't understand what it is anyway.)

48
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,639
(After a while,)

49
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,199
(our signal bar became full!)

50
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,599
(I heard their team)

51
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,319
(shed grateful tears.)

52
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:03,879
Let me stop them.

53
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:04,479
Go.

54
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,080
Hurry.

55
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,080
Jingjing!

56
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,360
Jingjing!

57
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,639
The director asked me to bring you food

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,159
for your trip back.

59
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,840
Thanks, Mr. Director.

60
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,400
But I have to refuse.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,879
Jingjing already took care of it.

62
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,000
Jingjing's food is her food.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,719
This is from us.

64
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,599
It's just a token of gratitude.

65
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:22,159
Take it.

66
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,159
When people come to visit,

67
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,479
they bring food and drinks.

68
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,599
When my boyfriend comes to visit,

69
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,479
he takes away food and drinks.

70
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,879
If this gets out...

71
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,240
Just take it, please.

72
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,719
You flatter me.

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,639
Just keep it.

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,800
All right then.

75
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,599
Thank you.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,240
Safe travel!

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,879
(And when he's about to leave,)

78
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,759
(the director even gave him food
for his journey.)

79
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,879
(LOL!)

80
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,159
(You know what this shows?)

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,080
(Knowledge is power.)

82
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,719
(OP, you made it way too obvious.)

83
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,080
(It's Qiao Jingjing and Zhou Xiaoqi.)

84
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,560
(I laughed for three minutes.
What a plot development!)

85
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,439
(Zhou Xiaoqi must be fuming now.)

86
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,080
(Is Qiao Jingjing's boyfriend that guy
from Aerospace Research Institute?)

87
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,520
(He is a gem.)

88
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,159
(ROFL!)

89
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,879
(People usually come
with food and drinks.)

90
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,840
(He came with internet signals.)

91
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,199
(Personally,)

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,080
(I can live without barbecue
and hotpot,)

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,319
(but I can't live
without internet signals.)

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
Drive safe.

95
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:22,800
See you!

96
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,000
Jingjing.

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm on standby now.

98
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,040
And you?

99
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,480
I'm on the bus now.

100
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,560
Bus?

101
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,519
Yes.

102
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,800
The company organized a few buses

103
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,759
to different destinations
to send us home.

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,839
You have
an amazing logistics department.

105
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,279
By the way, you're talking to me now,

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,639
will your colleagues beside you

107
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,560
think it's weird?

108
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm at the last row.

109
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,199
My colleague is asleep beside me.

110
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
I just want to check on the signal
from your side.

111
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,879
I put my phone on low volume too.

112
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
The signal is good here.

113
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,000
It's buggy this afternoon

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,199
because everyone was using the net

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,480
but now, it's better.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,319
What are you looking at?

117
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,079
That's all

118
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,720
for today's live broadcast.

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,199
I believe you now know

120
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,680
how to put on makeup in ancient style.

121
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,519
Sweet dreams!

122
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,399
Good night!

123
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
You follow celebrity's live broadcasts?

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,920
About makeup?

125
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,439
Never stop learning.

126
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,160
(I don't think your colleague
believes it.)

127
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,319
(He does.)

128
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,839
(Is he that guy from earlier on)

129
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,680
(who believed
I was a WeChat Mini Program?)

130
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,399
(Yes.)

131
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,199
(I shall inquire you about
makeup tips once I get home.)

132
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,120
(I missed a few tricks)

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,560
(just now.)

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
(Sure.)

135
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,319
(When you're back,)

136
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,399
(it'll be autumn in Shanghai.)

137
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,040
(When you're back,
it'll be autumn in Shanghai.)

138
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,600
(I'm starting to miss you again.)

139
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,500
(CATC)

140
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,987
(Professional, Meticulous)

141
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,240
Is this the engine you keep

142
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,120
talking about?

143
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,799
Thanks to this,

144
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,480
we got the fund from the institute.

145
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Yes.

146
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
It's hard to explain

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
some of the data to you on the phone.

148
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,480
Here.

149
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,399
The data is here.

150
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,200
Have a look.

151
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,120
3,800s for specific impulse.

152
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,679
In total, 100,000 newton-second.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
I didn't expect this from
Northwestern Polytechnical University.

154
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,679
It is of excellent quality.

155
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,919
We will be more likely

156
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,320
to succeed if we bid with it.

157
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
However, it only looks good

158
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
on paper.

159
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,399
Can we test it in real life?

160
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
We have done

161
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,200
the experiment many times already.

162
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:29,958
Here.

163
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,000
Check this out.

164
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,559
Okay.

165
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,200
This is the experiment regarding

166
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,000
the calibration of

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,120
the propeller's igniter in a vacuum.

168
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,240
We can replay

169
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,200
the relevant data.

170
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Is there a problem?

171
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,026
No.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Not at all.

173
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:56,106
During these two years,

174
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:57,605
you perform better

175
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,520
than expected.

176
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,321
Let's not pat ourselves on the back.

177
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,559
You should get off work now.

178
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,519
We'll

179
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,679
discuss in detail tomorrow

180
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,559
the communication problem
of the deep space probe.

181
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,159
You make a very good

182
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,240
get-off-work alarm.

183
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,720
I promised your wife

184
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,679
to look after you.

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,919
No overtime for you these two years.

186
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,240
I will leave with you today.

187
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,720
You, a workaholic,

188
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,080
will get off work together with me?

189
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:31,879
Your Dear Princess

190
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:32,919
must be in Shanghai now.

191
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,360
She finished shooting.

192
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,240
Someone won't be lonely any longer.

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,000
When you're free,

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,759
bring your Dear Princess

195
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,759
to dine with us.

196
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,000
My wife misses her a lot.

197
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,639
Sure.

198
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:45,919
She should be free this time.

199
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,080
Just a reminder.

200
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,240
She doesn't like
to be called a princess.

201
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:54,919
If you do that,

202
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,240
she'll be mad.

203
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,679
I'm not afraid of her.

204
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,759
She'll be mad at me!

205
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,480
Don't assume you're safe.

206
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,159
She will complain

207
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,159
to your wife too.

208
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,039
How old are you two again?

209
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't miss him at all.

210
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,000
Come on.

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,519
Don't lie.

212
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,320
Mr. Yu can't

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,559
skip work to see you.

214
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,320
But I bet he sure wants to!

215
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,519
Highly doubt it.

216
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,080
His best friend is now

217
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,600
back in the office.

218
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,919
I bet he's having
the time of his life now.

219
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,120
Why would he miss me?

220
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,039
So,

221
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,879
where should we go then?

222
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,559
To his place.

223
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,519
I worked overnight to finish shooting.

224
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,399
I'm exhausted.

225
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,440
I also have an early flight tomorrow.

226
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,480
I want somewhere close to the airport

227
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,320
so that I can catch some sleep.

228
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,600
No need to explain so much.

229
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,639
I totally understand.

230
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,240
Traffic matters.

231
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,039
When you're in a relationship,

232
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
you look all sweet and caring.

233
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,960
Because she likes it.

234
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
We'll see in the future.

235
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:25,879
Are you saying that

236
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,960
you'll get married first,

237
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,600
then show your true self?

238
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
That's called lying.

239
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,600
You're exaggerating.

240
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
She's a celebrity.

241
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,799
She spends in total one month

242
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,000
and ten days in Shanghai this year.

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,879
Who's lying to who now?

244
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:41,879
It's open to debate.

245
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,679
More kisses, please.

246
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,000
Let me get changed,

247
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and I'll be with you.

248
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
I didn't sleep well yesterday

249
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,919
so I want to catch some sleep.

250
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,720
What are you staring at?

251
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,039
I haven't seen you take off your clothes
for a long time.

252
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,600
Didn't you say

253
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,720
you wanted to catch some sleep?

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,840
You're a busy guy.

255
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,159
Where does the muscle come from?

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,720
Working in a lab is hard labor.

257
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,360
How long is your break?

258
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
I'll leave when you

259
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,639
leave for work tomorrow.

260
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,279
Didn't you say

261
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,799
your break would be
more than two months long?

262
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,120
The shooting has been extended.

263
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,720
And then, I suddenly have several jobs

264
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,080
that I can't say no to.

265
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,200
Ms. Ling.

266
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,120
It's me.

267
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,679
My body clock is a mess now.

268
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,160
You woke up.

269
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:22,759
I made you dinner.

270
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,279
How do you know
I want to have rice porridge?

271
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,759
You're not eating?

272
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,400
I ate already.

273
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,319
(Why is he so cold?)

274
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,200
(Usually,)

275
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,759
(if I have to leave the next day,)

276
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,799
(he will spend as much time
as possible with me,)

277
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,799
(or prepare to spend as much time
as possible with me.)

278
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,920
(Is he mad?)

279
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:10,799
(Seriously?)

280
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,640
(He stood me up before too.)

281
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,200
Is it because

282
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
I'm too disheveled?

283
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,039
I brushed my teeth and washed my face.

284
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,799
You can go now.

285
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,599
I already did them
in the bathroom outside.

286
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,680
Are you going to sleep now then?

287
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:03,559
I was working overtime earlier on.

288
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,680
I want to sleep early.

289
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,079
You should sleep early too

290
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:14,640
and fix your body clock.

291
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,279
(Is he really mad at me?)

292
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,839
When you were sleeping,

293
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,960
Ms. Ling called you.

294
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,240
I answered it.

295
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,480
I believe you owe me an explanation.

296
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,440
I...

297
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,480
You know,

298
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,240
there's something called couple pranks.

299
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,200
Also,

300
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,839
it's not a lie.

301
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,319
I said I had to leave in the morning

302
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,680
but I didn't say
I wouldn't come back at night.

303
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,440
I had a really busy day.

304
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,000
I wanted to

305
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,960
get something

306
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,599
from Lujiazui

307
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,480
to decorate this place

308
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
and give you a surprise.

309
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,240
I...

310
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:45,359
Whatever.

311
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,920
I don't want to nag you.

312
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,519
I'm sorry.

313
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:00,519
I really wanted to

314
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,960
give you a surprise.

315
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,440
Was I surprised then?

316
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,720
Yu Tu!

317
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
No, you weren't surprised.

318
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,319
How long is your break?

319
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,079
Two months.

320
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,599
Are you telling the truth?

321
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,319
Yes.

322
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,440
When you came back,

323
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,319
did you notice

324
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,440
some changes in the house?

325
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,559
No.

326
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
When I came back,
I went to sleep straight away.

327
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,400
I redid

328
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,559
the storeroom.

329
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,119
I'll show you tomorrow morning.

330
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,519
I want to see it now.

331
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,599
When you told me
you had a two-month break,

332
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:10,759
I thought

333
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,799
you'd most probably

334
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,799
live with me here.

335
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,559
But knowing my dear Jingjing,

336
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,880
who likes to dress up,

337
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,720
I need a space

338
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,000
for your clothes and shoes.

339
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,920
So you made your storeroom

340
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,039
into a wardrobe.

341
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,039
The control panel is here.

342
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,880
I shouldn't have

343
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
toyed with your feelings.

344
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,400
Thank you for this gift.

345
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,119
This is not a gift.

346
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,839
At most, this is...

347
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,960
Love nest building.

348
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,319
Don't sleep during the day.

349
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,559
Fix your sleep schedule.

350
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,640
But you

351
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,920
won't let me sleep properly at night.

352
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:18,440
You're not wrong.

353
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,680
Catch

354
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,079
some sleep during the day then.

355
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,480
Is this how it is then?

356
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,960
You want to sacrifice my body clock

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,359
for the sake of your happiness?

358
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,680
Are you sure it's just mine?

359
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,119
You're late.

360
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,880
Go now!

361
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,960
(Jingjing, Ling and Xiao Zhu's chatting group)

362
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,000
(Mr. Yu redid his place)

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,960
(for me.)

364
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,960
(Do you girls want to see it?)

365
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,147
(Chen Xue)

366
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,160
(My boyfriend redid)

367
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,279
(his place for me.)

368
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,519
(Do you want to see it?)

369
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,759
(Jingjing, Ling and Xiao Zhu's chatting group)
(Sure, I need to bring you the clothes too.)

370
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,680
(I already packed them up.)

371
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,039
(Great, I need to talk to you too.)

372
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,880
(Go away!
I have tons of shooting to do.)

373
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:45,180
(Recycling Bins)

374
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,200
Miss Qiao.

375
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,279
I'm still in the area.

376
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,079
Don't you think you're a bit too clingy?

377
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,039
Yes, I am.

378
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,799
I miss you already.

379
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,599
Hurry up and come back.

380
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,359
The Chinese aerospace needs me.

381
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,920
Please bear with it

382
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:10,519
for another few hours.

383
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,079
Then,

384
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,640
ten hours maximum.

385
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,240
That's long.

386
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,279
However,

387
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I can't stand without you for this long.

388
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
I won't work overtime today.

389
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,519
Come on.

390
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,920
It's my first day back in Shanghai.

391
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,880
No overtime?

392
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:25,880
Don't lie to me.

393
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,079
I know you too well.

394
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,359
What colors do you like?

395
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:30,880
Blue? Green?

396
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,200
Or perhaps a warm palette?

397
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,440
I have enough clothes.

398
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,200
And green is...

399
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:37,400
unorthodox at best.

400
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,440
I didn't say it was for clothes.

401
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,440
Also, if I ever buy clothes for you,

402
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I won't consult your opinion.

403
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,680
You're overthinking this.

404
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,599
You're right.

405
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,519
The interior design of your house
is so sharp.

406
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:49,400
And so,

407
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,039
I want to

408
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,920
buy some pillows

409
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,720
or vases

410
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,759
to decorate it a bit.

411
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
You'll build the nest

412
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,000
and I'll decorate it.

413
00:25:57,519 --> 00:25:58,240
My house?

414
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,079
Our house.

415
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,759
Whatever floats your boat.

416
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,519
I do have pillows.

417
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,799
They are

418
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,759
in the guest room.

419
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,599
Go have a look.

420
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,319
So...

421
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,839
Wait for me to come home.

422
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,200
Okay.

423
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,880
I'll wait for you.

424
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,119
And now,

425
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,599
I'm in front of my office.

426
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,279
Don't flatter yourself, please.

427
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,480
I just want to know

428
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,519
why you put all your

429
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:40,960
trophies

430
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,279
and certificates in boxes.

431
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,119
Most of them are from

432
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,240
when you were still a student.

433
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,640
You brought them to Shanghai?

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,559
My mom sent them to Shanghai.

435
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,799
They are old.

436
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,079
No need to display them.

437
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,440
What if we have guests

438
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:52,279
and they think

439
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,720
they're our kid's?

440
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:55,039
You

441
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,960
have quite the imagination.

442
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,200
Also,

443
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,240
if we have kids,
we can't show them that.

444
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,359
I don't want to stress my kids.

445
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
How do you know?

446
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,519
What if our kid

447
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,519
is smarter than you?

448
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:10,119
He might even surpass you.

449
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,359
We have to work hard then.

450
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,240
Curb your imagination.

451
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,720
So, I will

452
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
randomly pick

453
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,119
a certificate you got
after you started working

454
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,680
and put it next to

455
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,839
my Best Actress trophy.

456
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,000
I'm honored.

457
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,480
All right. Go work.

458
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:26,240
I promise that

459
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,000
I won't call you again today

460
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,920
to bother you.

461
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,000
Bye!

462
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,360
(CATC)

463
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:43,759
Yu Tu.

464
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,240
Come to my office.

465
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,200
I need your input

466
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,720
for something.

467
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,079
Jingjing!

468
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:15,839
Jingjing!

469
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,920
Open the door, please!

470
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,759
Hurry!

471
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,400
Welcome!

472
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,359
Stop playing games.

473
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:22,759
Where should I put this?

474
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,759
It's heavy.

475
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,680
By the entrance.

476
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,319
The wardrobe

477
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,119
is too small for these boxes.

478
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,440
We have two more boxes.

479
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,119
I'll take care of them.

480
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,960
I'll go now.

481
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:32,799
Okay.

482
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,519
Last time when I came here,

483
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,720
Mr. Yu's collection of books

484
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,799
scared me.

485
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,480
I was wondering.

486
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,759
Mr. Yu has so many

487
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,720
books here.

488
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,920
When you guys are together,

489
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,599
is he also buried in books

490
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,480
and he just neglects you?

491
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,160
Don't you look down on him.

492
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,319
He has to write his thesis,
find references

493
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:56,880
etc.

494
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
He uses his computer too.

495
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,920
You're saying that

496
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,119
he looks at his computer

497
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:01,880
and not you.

498
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,319
Stop nitpicking!

499
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,519
Will he be back for lunch?

500
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
No.

501
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,880
He works

502
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,400
from 8 AM to 4:30 PM.

503
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,720
His lunch break is very short.

504
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,759
It's not worth the effort.

505
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,119
So if you work in the aerospace,

506
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,240
without overtime,

507
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,440
you finish your work quite early.

508
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
But Mr. Yu only gets

509
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,279
a few days without overtime per year.

510
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,200
That's rough.

511
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,880
Where should I put this?

512
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
Here, beside them.

513
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,680
I'll put it here.

514
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,119
Thank you.

515
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,680
If there's nothing else,
I'll leave then.

516
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
Thank you.

517
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,319
Okay. Thank you.

518
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:37,720
Anyway, Mr. Yu already

519
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,079
has a lot of books.

520
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,559
You asked Xiao Zhu to pack up
so many clothes.

521
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:41,680
There's not enough space.

522
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,119
Check out

523
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,000
the wardrobe Mr. Yu made for me.

524
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:50,880
I'll have a look then.

525
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,440
So pretty!

526
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,119
A black closet with a glass door.

527
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,759
I love it.

528
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,880
The appearance doesn't matter.

529
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,240
It's its function that counts.

530
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,160
Mr. Yu worried that it was not big enough

531
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,799
for my clothes,

532
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,839
so he made me a

533
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,319
double layer rotating closet.

534
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,387
Check it out.

535
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,360
(Unlock)

536
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,519
(Open)

537
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,319
This is interesting.

538
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,480
But isn't this the same

539
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,960
as your closet in Lujiazui?

540
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,920
It's not the same!

541
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,720
The one Jingjing has is heavy

542
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,079
and noisy.

543
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,680
This one is so quiet.

544
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,640
Also,

545
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,799
it's quite fast.

546
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,680
Now that you mentioned it,
I see it now.

547
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:34,480
Where did Mr. Yu

548
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,400
order this from?

549
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,839
Give me the number

550
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:37,640
so that I can modify

551
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,680
my own closet too.

552
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,039
The closet itself is made to order.

553
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,839
I can give you the number.

554
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,839
However, there's no number

555
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,720
for the rotating system.

556
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,359
Mr. Yu installed it himself.

557
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,039
For real?

558
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,319
He knows how to
design a system like that?

559
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,519
It's

560
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,599
not that difficult.

561
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,319
He and his team

562
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,799
design spacecraft.

563
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,079
He wanted to buy a closet like this

564
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,599
but when he checked the market,

565
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,759
closets with this kind of function

566
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,079
were so expensive

567
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,519
and heavy.

568
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,240
So, he came back

569
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
and drew a blueprint.

570
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,839
To be able to design this alone

571
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:04,200
is impressive.

572
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,119
But to design it

573
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,960
because the current product
is too expensive

574
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
and telling you that

575
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,319
as if it were like a child's play,

576
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:13,000
I have no words for Mr. Yu.

577
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,160
Aren't you supposed

578
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,720
to praise me instead?

579
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,920
He did this

580
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,240
because of me.

581
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,880
Yes, yes.

582
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,319
You even brought your coats.

583
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,079
Are you going to

584
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,160
stay here these two months?

585
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,640
Yes.

586
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:33,480
It's more convenient for his work.

587
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't go out anyway.

588
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,240
I don't mind living anywhere.

589
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Honestly,

590
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,519
Mr. Yu's place

591
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,359
is quite cozy.

592
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,000
It's not huge

593
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
but the layout is good.

594
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,519
So spacious.

595
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,039
If he doesn't marry you,

596
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:44,960
then it will be big enough.

597
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,160
It will be big enough for us two, okay?

598
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,720
How much does this house cost?

599
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:51,960
It's beyond the Outer Ring Expressway.

600
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,400
40 to 50 thousand yuan perhaps?

601
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,039
He bought it early.

602
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,720
It was around 20 thousand yuan.

603
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,400
He borrowed some money from his parents

604
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,720
but he has now paid them back.

605
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,440
He took a mortgage loan?

606
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,720
Back then, he just started working.

607
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,240
He had no money.

608
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,359
He still has 20-something years
for his mortgage.

609
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,079
Every month,
he pays around ten thousand yuan.

610
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,279
However, he eats at this office canteen

611
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,599
and he doesn't need to commute.

612
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,440
Other than books,
he doesn't spend his money.

613
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,079
As long as he's healthy,

614
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:15,720
there's not much

615
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,799
financial pressure.

616
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,319
Why are you staring at me like this?

617
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,680
I've just gotten a bit sentimental.

618
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,839
You used to splurge on jewelry

619
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,640
and luxurious goods

620
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,960
as if they

621
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,920
cost nothing.

622
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,839
And today,

623
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,279
you're folding clothes

624
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,279
while telling me

625
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:33,720
he pays

626
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,400
around ten thousand yuan per month
for his loan.

627
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,039
You know what?

628
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,680
I did the laundry this morning too.

629
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,480
Somehow,

630
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,079
I feel

631
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,400
reassured.

632
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,839
You're getting old.

633
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:49,799
Even my mom

634
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,480
isn't as sentimental as you.

635
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,799
Hang this up.

636
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,880
I hate you.
