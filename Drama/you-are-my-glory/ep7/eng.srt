=You Are My Glory=

2
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,120
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,600
Come here.

4
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,039
Over here.

5
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Pay the bill if you are late.

6
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Yup.

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Am I late?

8
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,639
We are all singletons.

9
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,959
Why bother?

10
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:03,479
Yeah.

11
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:04,080
Come, come.

12
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,519
Shall we toast?

13
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,760
Here.

14
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,999
Cheers.

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,559
We're having last year's batch
for this year?

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,000
What a shame.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Next year,

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
we'll have this year's batch.

19
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,519
Yu Tu, since you started investing,

20
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,760
you've been so indulgent,

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,400
yet you can still be

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,799
as simple as us.

23
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,199
You're like

24
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,720
the odd one out.

25
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,519
Maybe we'll have another Guan.

26
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,239
What's with Guan?

27
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:37,879
Shen Jing's divorcing him.

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,799
No way!

29
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
They're such lovebuds.

30
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,680
She gave up a high-paying job

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,760
in America

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,520
just to be with him.

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Yes way.

34
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,520
His model task is already arduous.

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,279
Since Yu Tu pulled out,

36
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,400
he had to do it all by himself.

37
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,120
He's been working overtime

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
and hardly had time to see anyone.

39
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Of course Jing would be mad.

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
What about the others?

41
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,680
Didn't they hire two new hands

42
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
before I took leave, right?

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
What's the point of having new hands?

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
No one does it better than you.

45
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:02,800
Besides, you know

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,960
how fussy Guan is.

47
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,199
One screw-up or two,

48
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,320
and he'll dismiss you.

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Stop it, you guys.

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,240
Mr. Guan

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
even showed me off

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,320
a lovely breakfast.

53
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Yeah, Dameng.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,559
You are the sheer envy

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,999
of bachelors.

56
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,600
Can you at least aim first?

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,040
Let me see.

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,999
Okay, let's dig in.

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
Just this one.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,320
Yu Tu.

61
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,040
I recently read a paper

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,040
that gave me some inspiration.

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
I want to discuss it with you.

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Remember to keep it secret.

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,439
Don't divulge our technology.

66
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
We only talked
about foreign technology.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,400
What's wrong?

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,120
What can we talk about instead?

69
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,800
The house prices in Lujiazui

70
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,639
are outrageous.

71
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,520
You dare to say that

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
about the house prices in Lujiazui?

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
They're getting outrageous.

74
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
I can't afford them.

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
Okay, let's chow down.

76
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,960
Now that we're here,

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,719
let's karaoke.

78
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,279
Yeah.

79
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,200
Count me out.

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,279
I don't know any new songs.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,839
You still have me.

82
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,080
So you're out.

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Why me?

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,279
You guys go ahead.

85
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,240
I'm not coming.

86
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:44,400
Yu Tu.

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
Are you really going to leave?

88
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,240
Pretty much.

89
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:03,520
No matter what,

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,680
I wish you a bright future.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
All the best.

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,319
Alright.

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Let's toast.

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,120
Best wishes.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
After this...

96
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,120
you'll treat us to dinner.

97
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,120
Yeah.

98
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,999
Shall we?

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:29,759
Sure.

100
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay.

101
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:30,920
Come on.

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,640
Bottoms up.

103
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,840
(The door is about to close.)

104
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,519
(Passengers to Space City,)

105
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,639
(please board quickly.)

106
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,840
Even Mr. Yu has a date.

107
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
While I'm all alone,

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,120
playing games here.

109
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,559
Must be my closest fans.

110
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Hello?

111
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,160
(Are you playing Wang Zhaojun again?)

112
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,399
Are you spying on me?

113
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,879
(I just took a look.)

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,199
(Wanna hang out with me?)

115
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,480
Where are you?

116
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
You're back.

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,399
Is your rendezvous

118
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,280
also nearby?

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,800
Pretty much.

120
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,160
They went to karaoke,

121
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,920
but I'm not interested.

122
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,600
Then where are we going?

123
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,959
To the movies.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
How about this movie?

125
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,840
Are you doing this on purpose?

126
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Everyone knows

127
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,480
I'm in bad terms with the female lead.

128
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,800
I don't know much about your circle.

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,759
What about this?

130
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
This movie is pretty good.

131
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,360
But let me tell you

132
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,959
that this male lead

133
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,120
just broke up with his girlfriend,

134
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,600
who happens to be my bestie.

135
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,240
No matter how good the movie is,

136
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,879
I can't betray my bestie.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,480
You choose,

138
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,920
There is an animated film.

139
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,319
It looks like a rerun.

140
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,199
Only the seats by the aisle are left.

141
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,399
Put your finger here.

142
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,639
We have to go quickly.

143
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:22,959
It's in 15 minutes.

144
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,720
Let's split up.

145
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,959
Don't look back.

146
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:54,920
Someone's following us.

147
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,519
Hurry up.

148
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,879
(You get the ticket and go in first.)

149
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
(Looks like I'll have
to buy two tickets in one go.)

150
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
(How will you get in?)

151
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,480
(I'll tell you
after you get our tickets.)

152
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
(I hope no one else takes his ticket.)

153
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,440
(I feel like)

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,279
(being in a spy movie
rather than watching one.)

155
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,679
Excuse me.

156
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,519
Is this seat taken?

157
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,399
I got a ticket from the counter.

158
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,480
No.

159
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,720
(Sometimes, I can't help but wonder)

160
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,200
(what if that didn't happen to us.)

161
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,200
(Did he just tease me?)

162
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,919
(I didn't even tease him back.)

163
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
(I'm embarrassing myself)

164
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
(in my entertainment circles.)

165
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,039
(Maybe I didn't see it right.)

166
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
(What's wrong with music?)

167
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,279
(Nonsense! Music brought us misfortune.)

168
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,679
(You are never to play music again.)

169
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,639
(But please...)

170
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,320
(Miguel,)

171
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,560
(listen to your grandma.)

172
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,159
(No more music.)

173
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,639
(Please let me play once.)

174
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,840
(This is final.)

175
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,279
(Aren't you afraid
you'll end up like him?)

176
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,440
(No one remembers him,)

177
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,720
(and he doesn't have a place
on the altar.)

178
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,639
(I don't care)

179
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,159
(about being on a silly altar!)

180
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,679
(No!)

181
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,320
(Mama!)

182
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,600
When I volunteered,

183
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,720
my parents didn't approve.

184
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,720
So I decided to leave the Galaxy.

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,759
(What a coincidence.)

186
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,360
(Doesn't Yu Tu feel bad)

187
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,999
(watching this?)

188
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,639
I will send you home.

189
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,360
The movie just now,

190
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,799
I haven't watched it before,

191
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,720
so I didn't know the plot.

192
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,320
It was nice.

193
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,720
The protagonist

194
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,600
is a fortunate dreamer.

195
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,240
You said you wanted to give up.

196
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
Why?

197
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,879
Is it because of your family?

198
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:34,600
But I remember

199
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,240
that your uncle
also works in aerospace.

200
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,879
Why would your parents object?

201
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
You know, Peipei, she...

202
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,240
I know.

203
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,679
She's the top gossiper
in her circle.

204
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:02,200
Do your parents still disapprove?

205
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,240
When I went postgraduate,

206
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
they approved.

207
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,720
Then why?

208
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,960
A while ago...

209
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,159
my parents came to Shanghai

210
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,679
without informing me.

211
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,440
Rather, my aunt called me

212
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,639
asking about my mom,

213
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,999
saying, "Is it benign?"

214
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,120
That's when I knew
they were in hospital.

215
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,960
When I went to see them,

216
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,120
they stayed in a budget hotel

217
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,440
for one night,

218
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,999
In their room,

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,480
I only saw some cookies
and instant noodles.

220
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,519
How's your mother now?

221
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,639
She's fine.

222
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,240
It was a false alarm.

223
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,039
But I can't help but wonder.

224
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,440
If anything happens to her,

225
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,720
will I be able give her

226
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,080
the best medical treatment,

227
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,240
or have the time

228
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,080
to be with them and care for them?

229
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,840
I won't.

230
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,999
I should be able to,

231
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,600
but I won't.

232
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,320
What are you going to do next?

233
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
Invest, maybe.

234
00:16:47,999 --> 00:16:49,360
Having abandoned it for so long,

235
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,840
I have to start it all over again.

236
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,639
I've been conceited
since I was a kid.

237
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,440
Till when I hit 30,

238
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,120
I've accomplished nothing.

239
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,039
Let's go.

240
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,919
It's late.

241
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:46,800
Son,

242
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,239
we really didn't mean
to hide it from you.

243
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,520
When we called you,

244
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,879
your phone was off.

245
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,760
Then, when you called back later,

246
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,360
well...

247
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,439
the tension was all gone.

248
00:18:58,439 --> 00:18:59,120
We just wanted

249
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,000
to tell you after the results are out.

250
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,800
Besides,

251
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,679
you had a task at hand,

252
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,520
didn't you?

253
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,280
Listen.

254
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,080
You're also anxious, right?

255
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,520
Since your father
is right here with me,

256
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,399
what's there to worry about?

257
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,439
Right?

258
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,879
The doctor said, I was fine.

259
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,080
We are not going anywhere.

260
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,040
It's pretty good here.

261
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,760
Besides,

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,840
your place is too far away,
it's inconvenient.

263
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,760
The doctor said I'm fine,

264
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,600
we'll head home tomorrow.

265
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,239
She's right.

266
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:37,879
Don't worry,
I'm really okay.

267
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:45,679
(80 yuan per night,)

268
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,760
(upfront.)

269
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,320
Thanks.

270
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,399
(I still have)

271
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,479
(an examinatin report
to pick up tomorrow.)

272
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,879
(Leave Yu Tu alone.)

273
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,479
(He's busy with his work.)

274
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:07,840
(If he can't take leave)

275
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,560
(to be with us,)

276
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,199
(I can't take it.)

277
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:14,280
(I didn't ask him to come.)

278
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,159
(Why don't you believe me?)

279
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,439
(Say,)

280
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,040
(why do we need
a high achiever of a son?)

281
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,959
(At times like this, I think)

282
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,199
(that he ought to find a job)

283
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:26,760
(in our little hometown,)

284
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,239
(or dabble in finance.)

285
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
(At least he'll have more free time.)

286
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,879
(You may not be a high achiever,)

287
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,199
(but our son is doing so well.)

288
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,639
(We should support him.)

289
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,879
(Yeah, yeah.)

290
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,600
(Good thing I'm okay now.)

291
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,840
(If not, we'll have to fork out)

292
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,239
(what's left of our savings.)

293
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,239
(Once he gets married and has kids,)

294
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,719
(we won't have to spend a penny.)

295
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,000
(You give him downpayment
to buy a house,)

296
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,840
(and he'll return half of it.)

297
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,760
(I estimate)

298
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
(that we don't have much left.)

299
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,399
(Something came across my mind,)

300
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:25,399
(a quote that describes you well.)

301
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:28,800
(What is it?)

302
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,239
(But you are already)

303
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,320
(the rabbit who has seen)

304
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,280
(the most stars.)

305
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:44,360
(From Jade Rabbit's Weibo?)

306
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:48,399
(Yeah.)

307
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,159
(You're making my head spin.)

308
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,080
(How could you say)

309
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
(you accomplished nothing?)

310
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,879
Even if you want to give up

311
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:08,840
your previous career

312
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,919
and start over,

313
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,280
but your past accomplishments

314
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,360
are still there.

315
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,000
Although I don't know

316
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,120
what you actually did,

317
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
it must be very valuable.

318
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,439
(So even if you're not)

319
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,760
(doing this anymore,)

320
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,479
(you don't have to deny
the past, right?)

321
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,879
(At least you strived)

322
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:26,199
(for your ideals.)

323
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,479
(It's better to compromise
than never try.)

324
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,840
(To me, at least it's not a mistake.)

325
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,879
(Do your best, Rabbit God.)

326
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,439
Thanks.

327
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,280
(You should go to bed.)

328
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,159
(The qualifiers are tomorrow.)

329
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:04,679
(Good night.)

330
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
(But you are already)

331
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,760
(the rabbit who has seen)

332
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,879
(the most stars.)

333
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:05,919
Hey.

334
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:06,800
Jingjing.

335
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,919
I'll tell you two things.

336
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:08,600
First, Mr. Li has returned

337
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,760
from abroad.

338
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,159
He's asking us to meet him

339
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,919
at 3 pm tomorrow.

340
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
He invited us himself?

341
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,520
(Not really.)

342
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
We've kept in touch

343
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,879
from time to time

344
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,120
over the time he was away,

345
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,600
but I don't seem like

346
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
I've all caught up.

347
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,479
Don't worry about that.

348
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,760
There's one more thing

349
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,000
that's particularly serious.

350
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,879
On Singles Day,

351
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:29,120
you went to the movies, didn't you?

352
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,000
They caught me?

353
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,000
(Why are you so surprised?)

354
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,159
(What's so surprising)

355
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,560
(that you'd be seen)

356
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,679
(at the movies?)

357
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:39,919
(I think)

358
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,080
(you should be finding love now.)

359
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
(A gorgeous girl like you,)

360
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,399
(going to the movies alone
on Singles Day?)

361
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:46,879
Listen.

362
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:47,919
As your agent,

363
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,360
I feel ashamed about that.

364
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,840
Singles' Day is not Valentine's Day.

365
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:52,879
And you're actually

366
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,199
encouraging me to find love?

367
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:55,600
The world is different now.

368
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,320
Not the same as before.

369
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,000
Can't you see

370
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,280
your fans are roasting you?

371
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,520
("Why is Qiao Jingjing...)

372
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,120
(...still single?")

373
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,000
Fine, I guess this is it.

374
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,199
You're going to see Mr. Li

375
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,280
at 3 pm tomorrow,

376
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,959
so get ready for that.

377
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,600
There's nothing special

378
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,919
about Mr. Li's movies.

379
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,080
Why do I have to prepare myself

380
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,719
just for him?

381
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,239
I have watched all his previous works.

382
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:19,239
Good, that's good enough.

383
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,639
When the time comes,
we should be pragmatic.

384
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,600
(Bye.)

385
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:30,360
Hang on a sec.

386
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
Not bad.

387
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,239
It's pretty spy-ish.

388
00:25:55,959 --> 00:25:56,600
(I think)

389
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,679
(you should be finding love now.)

390
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,919
(Going to the movies alone
on Singles Day?)

391
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:01,639
(Listen.)

392
00:26:01,639 --> 00:26:02,679
(As your agent,)

393
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,080
(I feel ashamed about that.)

394
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,959
Maybe I could use a lover.

395
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,679
But only if

396
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,439
he's as handsome as Baili Shouyue.

397
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,280
What was I thinking?

398
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,560
Only I can be

399
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,679
Baili Shouyue.

400
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:51,479
(It's peaceful at the Great Wall today.)

401
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,000
Did you let me win on purpose?

402
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,879
I don't believe it.

403
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,399
Then what are you asking?

404
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,159
When did I let you?

405
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,199
If you can't hit me with a single shot,

406
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
then I've failed.

407
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,000
You're right.

408
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,560
You taught me

409
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,679
how to play Baili Shouyue.

410
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,840
I'm going to beat you this time.

411
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:40,959
It must be

412
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,120
the computer assigned to me
by the system

413
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,439
that won't operate my army.

414
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:45,120
Don't blame the computer.

415
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:46,520
You were going to lose

416
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,360
only because

417
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,639
you keep chasing me

418
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,120
without building up or pushing towers.

419
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,959
I'm practicing, okay?

420
00:27:56,639 --> 00:27:57,320
Oh,

421
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,120
Snow's about to go live now.

422
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,320
Let's go check it out.

423
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,520
Ouch.

424
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,320
The livecast has really gone viral.

425
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,719
If I weren't an actor today,

426
00:28:14,719 --> 00:28:16,199
I'd like to be a host

427
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:18,199
who sings, play games,
or something like that.

428
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,080
You, play games?

429
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,719
Of course.

430
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
I didn't play well

431
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,320
because I was

432
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,360
so busy acting.

433
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
If I really want to be

434
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,520
a professional host,

435
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,800
I will definitely practice hard.

436
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
I can't just sing,

437
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,560
or it'll be monotonous.

438
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,560
I can also teach everyone

439
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,280
how to make up and make out,

440
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,840
and also yoga.

441
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,600
Come to think of it,

442
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm so versatile.

443
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,080
I could be famous.

444
00:28:47,639 --> 00:28:49,879
Zhou Yin hasn't started
his livecast either.

445
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,439
You have an understanding

446
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,360
of pro players now.

447
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,639
Since you took me

448
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,159
to a pro game,

449
00:28:55,239 --> 00:28:55,760
I have become a fan

450
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,120
of quite a few of them.

451
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,000
Zhou Yin and Snow.

452
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,840
They're all good-looking.

453
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,959
Don't mock me, okay?

454
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,560
They are all good-looking

455
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,840
because they played well.

456
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,280
It's starting.

457
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:13,959
(Sun Shangxiang.)

458
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
(It's Sun Shangxiang, right?)

459
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,639
Don't you guys get bored?

460
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,320
Actually you can also play e-sports.

461
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,080
You'll surely be more viral than them.

462
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,959
E-sports

463
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,000
has a high age requirement.

464
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,360
How old do you think they are?

465
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,840
Twenty-something?

466
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,800
The one you're watching is 18.

467
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,280
He's 11 years younger than me?

468
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,760
You mean, 12?

469
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm 29.

470
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,040
My birthday's next month.

471
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,840
(I've been trying his
Lightning Blade technique lately.)

472
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,639
It's rigorous.

473
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,600
But sloppy.

474
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,199
(His stamina should be
better than before,)

475
00:29:58,199 --> 00:30:00,120
(but the same can't be said
of his firepower.)

476
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
The opponent is too weak.

477
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,280
But the game is good.

478
00:30:05,199 --> 00:30:06,800
The semi-finals will be in a few days.

479
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,199
Why don't we go and watch it live?

480
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:09,800
This venue

481
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,959
doesn't seem to be very big.

482
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:12,439
Aren't you afraid they'll see you?

483
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:16,280
You're right.

484
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,080
How about this?

485
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:22,560
Let's make a guess.

486
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,280
Will Snow use Sun Shangxiang

487
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,719
next round?

488
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:25,879
If he does, we'll go.

489
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,280
If not, we're not going. Okay?

490
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,520
It must've short-circuited.

491
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,280
Last time you tricked me
into fixing the purifier.

492
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,159
You said, you had
a full set of tools at home.

493
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,360
Right?

494
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,040
Where is it?

495
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,919
(On the shelf in the storage room.)

496
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,120
(Must be the black plastic box)

497
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
(on the fourth rack.)

498
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,679
Found it.

499
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,040
It hurts when you tricked me.

500
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,919
Let alone

501
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,320
when you're gaming.

502
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,719
Practice.

503
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:30,239
I'm an expert at that.

504
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,520
You really know how to fix this.

505
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,000
Why don't you try it?

506
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:46,439
(Mr. Li has rescheduled)

507
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,959
(the meeting to this afternoon.)

508
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:48,560
(I will pick you up.)

509
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,159
(I brought you
a makeup artist and stylist.)

510
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,399
(Get ready.)

511
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,479
Careful.

512
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,199
It may be a problem
with the power board.

513
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
Do you want to replace this board?

514
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,399
That'd be expensive.

515
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:31,679
Might as well fix it.

516
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,159
You aerospace people

517
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,320
are also into this?

518
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,120
This is one of the fundamentals.

519
00:32:39,399 --> 00:32:40,919
Aerospace is a systems engineering.

520
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,520
You should know
a bit of every aspect.

521
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,560
Doing the welding alone

522
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,199
makes me a first-rate worker.

523
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,439
(Either you're a genius)

524
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:49,600
(or just narcissistic
as you were in high school.)

525
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,399
Hello?

526
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,159
(Jingjing.)

527
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:58,199
(I texted you on WeChat)

528
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,520
(that Mr. Li changed his plans.)

529
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,800
(He'll return to Beijing
in the evening.)

530
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,679
(So we'll meet)

531
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,040
(today afternoon instead.)

532
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:04,120
Have you read it?

533
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,639
No, I haven't.

534
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:06,399
What time is it again?

535
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,479
(Half past three.)

536
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,800
(Me, my makeup artist and stylist)

537
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,040
(are right outside.)

538
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,919
(We're coming right up.)
