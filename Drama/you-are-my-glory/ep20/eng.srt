17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,039

Do you regret it?

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,800
Because I was so stupid,

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,439

do anything stupid?

26
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
Of late,

27
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,439
I've been writing till late every day.

But I never felt tired.

29
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,120
I got smug.

30
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,599
My expectations ran high.

31
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,360

Jingjing,

33
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
to think like this,

34
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,560
has my IQ level

35
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,120
fallen into a negative?

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,240

37
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,680
are because of you.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,719
I couldn't think of another way.

39
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,800
It's not because I only regretted

40
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,759
after reading the chat history.

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
I've regretted it a long time ago.

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
I just dared not admit it.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,639
Then, I went on a business trip.

44
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,000
I spent over a month in the desert.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,960

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,599
I spent too little time struggling.

48
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,319

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,200
West wind.

190
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,279
It's your turn.

191
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Here.

192
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,240
Bingo!

193
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,559
You again!

194
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,639
West wind.

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,919
No, no.

196
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,159
Come on.

197
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,039
Don't you...

198
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,120
Is that another discard?

199
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,320
Don't discard this!

200
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,200
Isn't that...

201
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,120
you are waiting for the tile?

202
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,519
- Why?
- Discard this.

203
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,679
Hurry up!

204
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,360
Let me...

205
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:05,960
This one.

206
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,240
One character.

207
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,960
Good.

208
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,600
Another character.

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,360
(I am home.)

210
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:17,120
Draw a tile.

211
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,360
What?

212
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,000
Dad, come on.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,320
Come on, come on.

214
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
Take it from her. Go ahead.

215
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,279
What a squanderer she is.

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
For me, it's a nine.

217
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,279
You quit?

218
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
(It took him half an hour to get home.)

219
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,360
(I wonder)

220
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
(if he still lives there,)

221
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,519
(in the old town.)

222
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,020
(42 minutes, 3.8 km)

223
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,639
Jingjing!

224
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,799
New Year is not a time
to spend on your phone.

225
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,799
Let's play another round.

226
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,840
Play what?

227
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,919
A round of mahjong, of course.

228
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,080
Just for a little while.

229
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,519
We don't mind you playing badly.

230
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:01,919
Come on, Jingjing.

231
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,360
Just a little while.

232
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,519
Come on.

233
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,279
Let's go.

234
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,080
Okay, but just once.

235
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,000
Clear the table!

236
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,639
Hurry up, Jingjing.

237
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,580
(I'm home.)

238
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,720
I'm coming.

239
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,799
Come on, let's play.

240
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,460
(Qiao Jingjing)

241
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,639
I knew there's someone at the door.

242
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,000
Why don't you come in?

243
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,440
I told you not to wait for me.

244
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,799
It's New Year's Day.

245
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,919
We'd be worried sick

246
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,000
if you were not home by now.

247
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,360
Where did you go?

248
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,200
Are you alright?

249
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,720
I am.

250
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,279
Mom.

251
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,720
Really, I'm fine.

252
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,759
Time for bed now.

253
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,399
He's asleep.

254
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,519
So should you.

255
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,240
Wake up.

256
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,440
What?

257
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,600
Yu Tu is home.

258
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,279
Is he?

259
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,519
Then I'm going to bed.

260
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,679
Oh no, you don't.

261
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,120
What?

262
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,480
We have to talk.

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,679
Yeah, what is it?

264
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,279
Last time, he came to tell me

265
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,799
that he liked a girl.

266
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,759
She's kind of pretty,

267
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,279
but she's no caretaker.

268
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,279
I thought,

269
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,079
there aren't many young women

270
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,400
who can take care
of their partners nowadays.

271
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,079
Yeah.

272
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,680
Caring women like you

273
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,079
are increasingly rare.

274
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:19,519
Don't interrupt.

275
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:20,559
This is serious.

276
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,200
Look at our son.

277
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,119
He hardly confides in us.

278
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,119
I think,

279
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,759
he surely really likes her.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,799
He doesn't give a damn

281
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,240
if she can take care of him.

282
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,920
Right?

283
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,000
The thing is,

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,359
what's gotten into him today.

285
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,039
I feel a little down seeing him.

286
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,039
What's making you down?

287
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,519
You should've seen him,

288
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,680
looking all preoccupied

289
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,640
when he got here.

290
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,319
I have no idea

291
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,240
what she did

292
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,680
to him.

293
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:46,720
Ever since he was a kid,

294
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,079
our Yu Tu

295
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,119
had heaps of girls

296
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,680
going after him.

297
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,160
He didn't have to hit on one.

298
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,119
She had him go out all New Year's Day,

299
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:54,880
and he spent the day out

300
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,759
till so late.

301
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,359
Do you know what this means?

302
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,640
It's insensibility.

303
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,160
It's fine if she's no caretaker,

304
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,599
but if she's insensible,

305
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,000
how will they get along in the future?

306
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,920
You dozed off again.

307
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,039
No, I'm listening.

308
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:06,799
What did you listen to?

309
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,920
Don't bluff me!

310
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,799
Yu Tu's girlfriend, right?

311
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,720
What do you know?

312
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,759
Hey, you.

313
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,119
Don't waste your breath, okay?

314
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm his mother.

315
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
It has to concern me.

316
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,319
What if she were not fond of him to begin with?

317
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,039
Our relatives are coming over tomorrow.

318
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,519
I have to get some rest.

319
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,400
Stupid old man.

320
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,559
You're his father, okay?

321
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
Big brother!

322
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,599
You're early.

323
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,440
Come on in.

324
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,000
Sister-in-law.

325
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,200
You've brought so many gifts.

326
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,599
Happy Lunar New Year, Aunty!

327
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,000
Happy New Year.

328
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,119
Yu Tu,

329
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,079
have you wished them?

330
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,519
Uncle.

331
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,200
Happy New Year.

332
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,759
Happy New Year.

333
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,519
Here, have some.

334
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,440
Thank you.

335
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:53,519
It's okay. I can do it myself.

336
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,680
How's it going?

337
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,160
Great.

338
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,039
(Are you awake?)

339
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,460
(Yu Tu)

340
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,079
(There's a)

341
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,559
(popular tofu store
in my neighborhood.)

342
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,599
(Would you like some?)

343
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,839
Jingjing.

344
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,480
Are you awake?

345
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,559
We're going to grandma's

346
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,839
in a moment.

347
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,279
Yes!

348
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,400
Sit down.

349
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:15,480
Put it here.

350
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,279
What a sumptuous breakfast today.

351
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,279
There's so much.

352
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,519
Have some greens.

353
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,720
Come on, let's have a toast.

354
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
Sure!

355
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,039
Cheers.

356
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:25,400
Happy New Year!

357
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,599
Wait up, will you?

358
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:27,640
This one's delicious.

359
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,920
It comes in many flavors.

360
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,839
Yu Tu,

361
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:30,880
you want the original

362
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,279
or white peach oats?

363
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,079
This one.

364
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,839
It's best to dine at home, you know.

365
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,599
Yeah.

366
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,200
Come.

367
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,759
Please, enjoy.

368
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:37,240
Tell me if I'm

369
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,440
getting better at this.

370
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,319
Try this.

371
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,799
Sister-in-law, you are good at
cooking this dish.

372
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,839
It's well fried.

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,519
Would you like some more?

374
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,440
Here, take more.

375
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,000
Here, try this.

376
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,000
Eat more.

377
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,720
You too.

378
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,279
Don't just greet.

379
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,519
Eat up.

380
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,000
Okay.

381
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,119
Don't just drink.

382
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,119
Eat. It's so well-cooked.

383
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,640
Yu Tu,

384
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,559
are you in love?

385
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,319
You've been checking the phone all morning.

386
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,079
Look at you.

387
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:07,519
Looks like she gives you the cold shoulder.

388
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,400
You're so uncool.

389
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,319
You waste our genes.

390
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:12,920
Now,

391
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,559
if I send a text to a girl,

392
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,799
it only takes seconds
for her to reply to me.

393
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,920
You don't believe me?

394
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,519
I'll show you.

395
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,279
Here.

396
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,079
Here, here.

397
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,000
Come on, cheers.

398
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,880
Sister-in-law.

399
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,039
Have a great year ahead.

400
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,279
Thanks.

401
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,599
It's just a warm-up.

402
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,520
(Mi: Looks delicious. Yiyi: So sumptuous)
(Nana: Where are you)

403
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,759
Aunty.

404
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:40,799
How did Liu do

405
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,960
in his exams?

406
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,720
Don't mention it.

407
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,599
His English and literature

408
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,680
are still so-so.

409
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,960
As for science

410
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,319
and math,

411
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,759
he's shown no improvement.

412
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:52,519
If you're free,

413
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,759
you should help him
with his studies.

414
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,480
Aunty.

415
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,599
You see,

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,240
when it comes to math,

417
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
you must practice
with a lot of questions.

418
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:00,839
Exactly.

419
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:01,839
More quizzes for you.

420
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,400
I was too lenient with you.

421
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,559
Not to worry, Aunty.

422
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,240
Science runs deep in our family.

423
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,519
Work on more questions,

424
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,960
and it'll surely rise up.

425
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:10,680
Exactly!

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,559
Yeah.

427
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Listen to your cousin.

428
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,079
Liu.

429
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,400
Don't waste our genes.

430
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,519
Keep it up.

431
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,000
Alright.

432
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
You can do better, Liu.

433
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,039
Keep it up!

434
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,839
Do your best, Liu.

435
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,860
(Yu Tu)

436
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,599
Jingjing,

437
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,359
it's for you.

438
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,519
Hello?

439
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,799
Hi there.

440
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,680
My sister is digging bamboo shoots.

441
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,599
Just hang in there,

442
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,440
I'll give her the phone.

443
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,519
Alright, thanks.

444
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,599
Who is it?

445
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,839
Hello?

446
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,839
It's me.

447
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,319
Yu Tu.

448
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,559
You are digging bamboo shoots?

449
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,000
You've gone to the mountains?

450
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,559
I was about to ask you

451
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,720
if you cared for a stroll

452
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,799
with me this afternoon.

453
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,839
Yixing has changed a lot
in the past two years.

454
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,680
The Dongjiu Lakeside is beautiful.

455
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,640
I'm at my grandma's in Hufu.

456
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,119
Tomorrow, I'll be at my grandpa's
in the mountains.

457
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:24,880
My schedule's full.

458
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,079
Okay then.

459
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,720
Have fun.

460
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:33,920
On the fourth day,

461
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,079
I will send you back to Shanghai.

462
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,079
We'll catch up then.

463
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,400
Bye.

464
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:04,799
Jingjing.

465
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,920
As an actress,

466
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,519
you even pretended to be unknown
when picking up the phone

467
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,279
You already knew who called,

468
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,920
yet you had to ask me about it.

469
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,440
You even made me answer it.

470
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,920
He persisted on ringing me up,

471
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,319
so I had you pick it up instead.

472
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,240
Couldn't you say I was not here?

473
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,400
Hurry up and dig.

474
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,920
I want fried winter bamboo shoots
with pickles for dinner tonight.

475
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,799
Dig up!

476
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:24,640
Stop fooling around.

477
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,559
I think there are some here.

478
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:32,799
You're the big sister. Anything you say.

479
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,200
Mom.

480
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,079
I'm going for a walk.

481
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:44,960
Where do you go?

482
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:45,960
A scenic spot.

483
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,720
Yu Tu, I'm coming with you!

484
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,480
Get home early, okay?

485
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:54,640
Whose turn is it?

486
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,880
(The girl whose photo you posted,)

487
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,279
(have you found her a partner?)

488
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,400
No, thanks.

489
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,920
Another six-dots.

490
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,839
Make that two six-dots.

491
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,200
(Not yet.)

492
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,640
(I haven't even seen her mother lately.)

493
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,079
(I haven't had time to tell you.)

494
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,039
(Stop recommending her to others for now.)

495
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,279
(Tomorrow night,
you'll recommend her to Yu Tu)

496
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,400
(over the dinner table.)

497
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,559
Yu Tu,

498
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,240
we've been walking all afternoon.

499
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,680
Can we take a break?

500
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,567
(10.05 km)

501
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,480
It's already over 15,000 steps!

502
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,319
That's it.

503
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,079
I'm stopping here.

504
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,200
I knew it.

505
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,319
I might as well stay at home

506
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,880
and chat with my girls.

507
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,220
(Qiao Jingjing)

508
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,880
But no one chats with me.

509
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,759
How about I teach you a few tricks

510
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,839
for tuition fees?

511
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,599
Let's go home.

512
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:25,799
Can't you even take a break?

513
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,680
Wait for me!

514
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,880
We're on our way.

515
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,240
We'll be in Taihua

516
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,319
in about half an hour.

517
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,079
Yes,

518
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:39,920
we'll spend the night.

519
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,359
Jingjing misses you too.

520
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:45,279
Okay,

521
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:45,960
bye.

522
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,880
(Taihua)

523
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,359
Surprised to see me, grandma?

524
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,759
My granddaughter's so big now!

525
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,079
Did you sleep well?

526
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,920
All right,

527
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,839
let's get us some breakfast.

528
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:06,440
Sure.

529
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,240
I made it just for you.

530
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:08,559
Don't eat too much.

531
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,200
Once your aunt gets here
in a moment,

532
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,839
then we'll really dig in.

533
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,359
Okay.

534
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,480
I made you your favorites.

535
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,079
That's enough, grandma.

536
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,160
Have some more.

537
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
Ignore your mother and eat more.

538
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
My granddaughter loves zongzi so much,

539
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,880
Let me peel it for you.

540
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:26,799
(Yu Tu: When will you return to Yixing?)

541
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,799
(Yu Tu: When will you return to Yixing?)
Careful, it's hot.

542
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,400
(Yu Tu: When will you return to Yixing?)
I'm fine.

543
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,119
This is your favorite.

544
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,920
It's made of purple rice.

545
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,000
Mom?

546
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,480
Why did you prepare
so many dishes again?

547
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,880
I have to hurry back in the afternoon.

548
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,640
Says who?

549
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,480
You won't leave before dinner.

550
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,119
It's not like you visit us often.

551
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:46,920
You people

552
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,680
are always

553
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,519
on the go.

554
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,880
I have a date this afternoon.

555
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,759
A mahjong date.

556
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,480
You know what?

557
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,400
How about you and dad

558
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,839
come with us to our place?

559
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,400
No!

560
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,079
I am carsick.

561
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,799
You and your mahjong all day long.

562
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:02,160
You know what?

563
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,519
It's up to my granddaughter

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,279
when you may go.

565
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,079
Jingjing,

566
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,440
tell him.

567
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,880
Of course,

568
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,359
we may leave only after dinner.

569
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,519
See?

570
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,039
I have to keep my grandparents company.

571
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
You are so old,

572
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,680
yet you lack Jingjing's sensibilities.

573
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,039
Jingjing.

574
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,440
I'll take you to harvest
bamboo shoots later.

575
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,240
Your maternal grandma's shoots

576
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,119
aren't as sweet as ours.

577
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,160
We're not going back there.

578
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,720
See how clever our granddaughter is.

579
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,079
You've got us a bumper harvest.

580
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,359
That's a lot of shoots.

581
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,119
Okay, Jingjing.

582
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,400
Your sister

583
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,240
has arrived at our house.

584
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,039
They're waiting for us.

585
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,839
See, your daughter harvested
all of these.

586
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,160
You know what?

587
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,240
Let's split them

588
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,119
into fair portions

589
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,599
so our guests won't scrap over them.

590
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,720
You're right.

591
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,160
You know what?

592
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,480
Keep some for dad

593
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,319
to dry them.

594
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,000
What?

595
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,799
Drying the winter bamboo shoots?

596
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,079
It's not worth it.

597
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,200
Take them away

598
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:08,359
and distribute them.

599
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,559
Tell them,

600
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:11,519
my granddaughter harvested these shoots.

601
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,759
To eat them is a blessing.

602
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,640
Yeah.

603
00:31:14,119 --> 00:31:15,000
What are you doing here?

604
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,559
Get down to work.

605
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:16,640
Hurry up.

606
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,400
Help us to pack these shoots.

607
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:18,519
Yeah.

608
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,119
Jingjing.

609
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,680
You must eat well.

610
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,400
You get me?

611
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,359
Yes, grandma.

612
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,359
Get some good rest.

613
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:28,400
It's so heavy.

614
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,680
Drop by often when you're free.

615
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
Take care, grandma.

616
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Dad, mom, let's go.

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,839
Bye.

618
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:42,920
Go to bed early.

619
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,079
- Bye, grandpa.
- Remember

620
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,319
to call us once you get there.

621
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:45,839
Okay.

622
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,279
Hurry along now.

623
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,720
Easy there.

624
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,680
Grandpa, grandma, go in now.

625
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,200
It's freezing out here.

626
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Drive slowly.

627
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,039
Mom, go in.

628
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,000
Drive slowly.

629
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,920
Okay.

630
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,200
(Jingjing, I'm back in Yixing.)

631
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,319
(See you soon.)

632
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:11,039
(I'm on my way back.)

633
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,240
(Perhaps you can arrive a little later.)

634
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:30,759
It's your turn.

635
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,759
Hurry up.

636
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,880
Nope.

637
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,519
A pair of jacks.

638
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,160
Pair of two.

639
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,920
Uncle's back.

640
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,720
Welcome back, Uncle!

641
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,920
Look at me.

642
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,400
What time is it now?

643
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,240
How's the game?

644
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,119
Jingjing!

645
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,000
What the hell?

646
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,359
My MVP!

647
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,319
So nice!

648
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,960
It's really troublesome

649
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,920
that my in-laws stay in another place.

650
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,240
Luckily you're in Changzhou.

651
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,279
Otherwise,

652
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
I wouldn't be able

653
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
to hang out with you today.

654
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,839
That'd be

655
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,039
a huge loss for me.

656
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,279
Thanks a lot!

657
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,440
You're so nice, Jingjing.

658
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,839
As a token of gratitude,

659
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,839
let's go hang out somewhere.

660
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,920
Drink's on me.

661
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,200
No, thanks.

662
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,960
It's seven o'clock.

663
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,480
It's only seven o'clock.

664
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,559
That's still early, right?

665
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:28,599
Come on.

666
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,559
We can go to Dongjiu.

667
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,160
It's been two years,

668
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,480
and Dongjiu has spruced up a lot.

669
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:34,759
Dongjiu?

670
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,799
(I was about to ask you)

671
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,599
(if you cared for a stroll)

672
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,559
(with me this afternoon.)

673
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,119
(Yixing has changed a lot
in the past two years.)

674
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,599
(The Dongjiu Lakeside is beautiful.)

675
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,480
There are so many,

676
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,240
very romantic,

677
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,440
feel-good cafés over there.

678
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,799
They come with private rooms.

679
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,759
Okay then,

680
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,559
let's go.

681
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,880
Let's take a lot of photos,

682
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,839
enough to make a WeChat Moment.

683
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:52,119
Alright,

684
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,839
let's go!

685
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,680
Jingjing.

686
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,759
Let me drive.

687
00:33:59,279 --> 00:33:59,920
Okay.

688
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,480
Jingjing,

689
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,760
Why on earth

690
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
did you leave your driver's license

691
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,000
at the back?

692
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,400
Give it to me!

693
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,599
Give it to me!

694
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,360
(Yu Tu)

695
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,079
