(Invitation, Jade Rabbit)

15
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Are you still mad?

16
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,319
You haven't replied to my message.

17
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,838
So I came to ask

18
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,679
if you still need my guidance.

19
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,838
I said something wrong the other day.

20
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,679
Please tell Mr. Zhang that I'm sorry.

21
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,558
I did.

22
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:30,679
A few days ago,

23
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,838
Mrs. Wang texted me and asked

24
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,240
if my classmate, Jingjing

25
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,360
is the celebrity, Qiao Jingjing.

26
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,960
When I wasn't there,

27
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,159
you did well in the games.

28
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,038
How did you know?

29
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,159
I saw your stats.

30
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,639
So...

31
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:56,080
Do you still need me?

32
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,159
Those strange-looking machine parts

33
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,479
that you bought

34
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,439
are already here.

35
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,599
My address was written on it

36
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,278
but the phone number was yours.

37
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,879
Good thing that the management
helped to collect it.

38
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you just going to
leave them at my place?

39
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,119
Of course not.

40
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,678
Come up and eat something.

41
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
You prepared food for me?

42
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,519
I'll come again tomorrow.

43
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,559
I took the night train.

44
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,119
I stink so bad.

45
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,358
You took a night train

46
00:04:44,238 --> 00:04:46,040
and you still came here for the games?

47
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,399
I'm glad I brought a power bank.

48
00:04:48,838 --> 00:04:50,079
Or it's going to run out of battery.

49
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:55,639
I'll ask my chauffeur to send you home.

50
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,040
You can't refuse.

51
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,040
I wouldn't want you

52
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,000
to suffocate the people in the subway.

53
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:06,959
All right.

54
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:23,278
You have to keep your word.

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,199
For this whole year,

56
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,559
you will stay in Shanghai.

57
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,600
No more business trips.

58
00:05:27,838 --> 00:05:29,559
If you don't keep your promise again,

59
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,838
I will teach you a lesson.

60
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,838
You always go back on your word.

61
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,238
We talked about it last year.

62
00:05:36,238 --> 00:05:38,040
You worked overtime
and went on business trips

63
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,319
for way too many times.

64
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,759
I have been keeping records.

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,160
You are going to cook all of these?

66
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,358
Isn't this too much?

67
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,439
Of course I'm cooking them.

68
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,119
You were always outstation.

69
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,319
You barely have any good food.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,199
Come here.

71
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:50,959
Give me a hand.

72
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,879
Okay.

73
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,399
When our son is back

74
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,399
and see these dishes,

75
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,600
he's going to be so happy.

76
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,199
He's going to ask

77
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,600
if it's a special occasion today.

78
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:13,399
Guan Zai.

79
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,238
How about you cook some dishes, too?

80
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,040
Never mind.

81
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:21,358
You'd better not

82
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:22,959
waste these ingredients.

83
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,879
Shen Jing.

84
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
I have something to tell you.

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,959
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,838
We...

87
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,358
I...

88
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,798
I have a problem.

89
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,720
But I don't think

90
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,600
it's anything serious.

91
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,920
It will

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,238
get better eventually.

93
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,278
I'm sure of it.

94
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:13,798
Don't worry.

95
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,980
(Tianyu City)

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,678
Mr. Yu.

97
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:40,319
You live quite far away.

98
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,040
I've been driving for an hour.

99
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,559
If you take the train as usual

100
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,759
to meet Ms. Qiao,

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,079
it's going to take you two hours.

102
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:48,119
Not really.

103
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:49,600
About one hour and a half.

104
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,678
So it takes you three hours
for a round trip.

105
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,959
Mr. Wang.

106
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,920
Don't tell her this.

107
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:58,838
Sure.

108
00:07:58,838 --> 00:07:59,639
Don't worry.

109
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,119
When did you come back?

110
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,279
I didn't know.

111
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:32,918
Just a while ago.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,440
You didn't tell me that you're back.

113
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,320
Or I'll make you one of these, too.

114
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,479
It's fine.

115
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,399
Why did you pack your stuff again?

116
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,399
You're leaving again?

117
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,279
I'll be staying

118
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,558
somewhere else for now.

119
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,239
Please continue

120
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:53,399
to look after the house.

121
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,558
Your work is not done yet?

122
00:09:57,158 --> 00:09:58,519
I thought you resigned.

123
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,239
They are still using you

124
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,599
before you go?

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,719
Hello?

126
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,479
Yu.

127
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:30,158
It's me, Shen Jing.

128
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,080
I know.

129
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,558
Guan Zai and I

130
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:40,840
are at the hospital.

131
00:10:42,798 --> 00:10:44,158
Thank you for what you did

132
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:45,759
in Xi'an.

133
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:50,080
Thank you

134
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,479
for taking care of him for so long.

135
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:53,200
I should be.

136
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
I was going to call you.

137
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,038
I'll be with him at night.

138
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,840
I'll cut to the chase then.

139
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,119
I probably

140
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,038
still need your help.

141
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,678
We don't have any relatives

142
00:11:09,918 --> 00:11:11,158
in Shanghai.

143
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,798
During the day,

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,918
my kid

145
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,080
will stay in my friend's house.

146
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,840
But at night,

147
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
I'll have to pick him up.

148
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,359
No problem.

149
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,879
I'll pack my stuff

150
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,798
and get there right away.

151
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,678
No rush.

152
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,119
I just have to go there

153
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,640
and pick him up at 7 PM.

154
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,719
Okay.

155
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:33,119
What's his room number?

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,239
I'll send it to you.

157
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:38,558
All right.

158
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,000
What's wrong?

159
00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:47,519
Your colleague is sick?

160
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Do you still have one?

161
00:11:58,678 --> 00:11:59,678
I'm starving.

162
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,840
I just had one bite.

163
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,279
I'll go and make another one.

164
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,780
(In-patient Department)

165
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,840
Shen Jing.

166
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,759
I'm sorry for troubling you again.

167
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,558
How is Guan Zai?

168
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:02,719
He did a checkup this afternoon

169
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,519
so he's not feeling well.

170
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:06,399
He just fell asleep.

171
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,719
Inside the thermos

172
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,200
is the porridge I bought for him

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,359
from the hospital cafeteria.

174
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,038
He hasn't eaten it.

175
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,599
When he woke up,

176
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:16,840
try and ask if he feels like eating it.

177
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,639
Okay.

178
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,678
These are the toiletries

179
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:22,279
that I bought
at the grocery store downstairs.

180
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:24,279
See if you need anything else.

181
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:24,840
Okay.

182
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,558
It's enough.

183
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
I brought some myself.

184
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,279
I'll go and pick up my son.

185
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,399
I'll come here
before the doctor makes rounds.

186
00:13:37,798 --> 00:13:38,599
I'll see you off.

187
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:39,558
It's fine.

188
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:40,320
It's okay.

189
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:52,840
I think they are making rounds

190
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,279
at 8 in the morning.

191
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,759
I will come and take over

192
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:56,798
before 8 AM.

193
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,359
Guan Zai's brother is a photographer.

194
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,519
His work is more flexible.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,119
But the day before yesterday,

196
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,239
he went overseas

197
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,239
for work.

198
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,119
He can only come back

199
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:08,279
after his work is done.

200
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,599
Mr. Hu

201
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,119
introduced us to a doctor.

202
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,359
We contacted him.

203
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,479
But it's not within his specialty.

204
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,558
Still, he helped to reach

205
00:14:20,038 --> 00:14:21,320
the doctor we are seeing now.

206
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,678
Please thank Mr. Hu for me.

207
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,879
Mr. Hu has work in Taiyuan.

208
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,759
He'll come here
right after he's done.

209
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,599
All right.

210
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,918
He actually doesn't need to.

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,678
Oh, right.

212
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,479
Did he take leave

213
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:37,599
from the research institute?

214
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,399
Mr. Hu told them.

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,759
But

216
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,399
not many people know for now.

217
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,678
Guan Zai

218
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,639
doesn't want too many visitors.

219
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,158
That's right.

220
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,279
Right.

221
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:49,918
We shouldn't trouble them so much.

222
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:52,960
Tomorrow morning,

223
00:14:53,038 --> 00:14:54,639
he has a few checkups to do.

224
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,038
The results are only out

225
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:59,519
on Friday or Saturday.

226
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,558
So...

227
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I'm fine.

228
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,759
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,840
You should head back.

230
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,558
I'm going to sit here

231
00:15:18,359 --> 00:15:19,678
for a while.

232
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,798
I asked the doctor from Xi'an

233
00:15:46,558 --> 00:15:47,840
and did some research.

234
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:50,440
The recovery rate is high.

235
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,798
Besides, Guan Zai is still young.

236
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,399
He's very likely

237
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,759
to recover.

238
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,399
I know.

239
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,119
I...

240
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:11,879
I have to think of a reason

241
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,200
to tell my son

242
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,359
why is his father not home again.

243
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,759
If I say he went on a business trip,

244
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,558
he'll definitely buy it.

245
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,359
After all,

246
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,759
he never keeps his word.

247
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,519
He always lied to me.

248
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,358
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

249
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:25,719
I feel much better.

250
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,039
Do you feel like eating?

251
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,199
Drink some water?

252
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,519
Here.

253
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,318
Where's Shen Jing?

254
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,680
She went to pick up your son.

255
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,160
She is probably home now.

256
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,920
She didn't cry, did she?

257
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,838
Where is my phone?

258
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,959
(Are you home?)

259
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,559
(I just woke up.)

260
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,118
I have a maths question here.

261
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:24,799
I'll send you the question.

262
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,519
Think of a few more solutions.

263
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:33,279
Your son's schoolwork?

264
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:34,439
Yes.

265
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:37,640
I can't think straight now.

266
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,439
I can only think of three solutions.

267
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,680
After you're done,

268
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,279
I'll take a picture and send him.

269
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,439
If he found out that

270
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,680
it's not your handwriting,

271
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:22,039
your fatherly image will crumble.

272
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,598
I say,

273
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,199
you should come here less often.

274
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,719
Tomorrow,

275
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:33,598
I'll ask Shen Jing

276
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,199
to hire a caregiver.

277
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,039
I can manage on my own.

278
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,838
It's not easy
to find a reliable caregiver.

279
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,239
Stop making it difficult for her.

280
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,439
Honestly,

281
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,000
the recovery rate is high.

282
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
You have to keep reminding her.

283
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:52,920
She gets anxious easily.

284
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,039
But she listens to people.

285
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,880
She'll believe it

286
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
if you keep telling her that.

287
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,479
She will feel less anxious.

288
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:23,180
(In-patient Department, Emergency)

289
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,118
Careful, it's hot.

290
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:34,880
Yu.

291
00:21:35,318 --> 00:21:36,479
I made porridge this morning.

292
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:37,838
If you don't mind,

293
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,759
you can have some.

294
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,078
I just brought this bowl here.

295
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,118
Thank you.

296
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,279
Stop being so courteous.

297
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,078
Or Guan Zai and I

298
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,680
are going to feel so bad.

299
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,838
It's hot.

300
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:02,680
What time did you wake up?

301
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,239
You don't have to bring me any food.

302
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,838
The hospital provides meals.

303
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,318
I was making breakfast for our son

304
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,318
so I cooked up some dishes, too.

305
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,559
Yu is here to take care of you at night.

306
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,680
I have enough time.

307
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,039
Don't worry.

308
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:20,318
Come here.

309
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,039
All right, all right.

310
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,759
We'll see

311
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,559
how is the hospital meal today.

312
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,719
Then, we'll decide.

313
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,519
All right?

314
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,519
You look much better than yesterday.

315
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm glad you have the appetite.

316
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:50,279
Yesterday night,

317
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,680
I went home and looked up your illness.

318
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,439
This illness of yours

319
00:22:53,598 --> 00:22:55,160
sounds terrifying.

320
00:22:56,318 --> 00:22:58,078
But the recovery rate
is considerably high.

321
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,039
You need to be confident.

322
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,239
Really?

323
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,680
You looked it up online?

324
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:08,959
Yes, I did.

325
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:10,719
I even asked the doctor.

326
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,598
He said the same thing, too.

327
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,078
It's because

328
00:23:14,078 --> 00:23:15,000
you are still young

329
00:23:15,838 --> 00:23:17,318
and you have no other illness.

330
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:18,439
So please, listen

331
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,118
to the doctor and follow the treatment.

332
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,959
I'll assume that

333
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,118
you are taking a break
to stay home with me.

334
00:23:24,598 --> 00:23:25,039
Otherwise,

335
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,078
you spend almost

336
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,318
half of the year outside working.

337
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,118
Now you can't.

338
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

339
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:34,078
I feel assured now.

340
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,559
Yu.

341
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:41,959
The porridge

342
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:42,920
won't last you long.

343
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,439
Here.

344
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:45,920
I bought two meat buns.

345
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:47,559
They are from the stall
in my neighbourhood.

346
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,680
It's really good.

347
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,519
Try it.

348
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll bring it with me.

349
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:03,880
Here you go.

350
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,500
(Chinese Buns)

351
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,479
Look.

352
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,719
I lost ten stars.

353
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,220
(Match History)

354
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:39,719
And you are feeling proud?

355
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,279
There will be wins and losses.

356
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,318
Besides, in five of the losses,

357
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:43,479
I was still the MVP.

358
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,318
(Welcome back, Yu...)

359
00:24:48,318 --> 00:24:49,479
What's with this round?

360
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,000
Shouyue.

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,479
60% damage output.

362
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,880
(He's so strict.)

363
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,519
That's the problem of the support.

364
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:00,680
Look.

365
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,078
The mid kept wandering off
somewhere else.

366
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,400
Our middle tower
was destroyed soon after.

367
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,400
And in this round,

368
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,160
the jungler

369
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,598
was unpredictable.

370
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:07,279
I couldn't catch up at all.

371
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:07,799
Their marksman

372
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:08,959
helped him to farm.

373
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:12,000
Do we go solo

374
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,199
or duo queue?

375
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,719
I'll carry you.

376
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:15,959
Did something good happen

377
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,000
during your work trip?

378
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,799
I can't believe you are willing
to carry me.

379
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:18,640
That's kind of you.

380
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,799
Where did you go for your work trip?

381
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,598
It was so sudden.

382
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,400
Did something serious happen?

383
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,759
Xi'an.

384
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:28,559
I can't tell you the rest.

385
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:29,598
It's confidential.

386
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,799
You can't even tell your family?

387
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,439
I don't mean me.

388
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,799
I can't.

389
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,318
That's boring.

390
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,239
We'll run out of topic to say.

391
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,719
Probably.

392
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,759
Let's begin.

393
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,719
I'll have breakfast first.

394
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,759
You bought me meat buns?

395
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,358
I'm raising the temperature
for the floor heating.

396
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,199
Why are you idling in the base?

397
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,759
I didn't mean to abandon you.

398
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,680
Trust.

399
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:04,880
I know.

400
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,006
(Victory)

401
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,759
Your gaming style

402
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,199
has changed after you came back.

403
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,318
You are being aggressive.

404
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:13,959
You're not using your usual hero, too.

405
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,680
I'm changing my style.

406
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,920
Get used to it.

407
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:39,519
We reached ten consecutive wins

408
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:41,039
faster than yesterday.

409
00:27:43,838 --> 00:27:45,279
You carry on.

410
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:46,838
I'll go and fix the projector.

411
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,507
(My 10th consecutive win)

412
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:58,160
(Look.)

413
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,239
(These are the stars
that I earned for you.)

414
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,559
(Try playing on your own.)

415
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,598
(Don't worry about losing them.)

416
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,479
How long do you need to fix it?

417
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,959
Soon.

418
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,000
If it's still not fixed,

419
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,838
let's sneak into the place

420
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,640
to watch the final match.

421
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,039
Do you actually want to go?

422
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,680
That depends on your performance.

423
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,039
Don't drag me down.

424
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:45,160
I'm queuing up solo.

425
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,680
I'm getting stunned again.

426
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,640
Help...

427
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:05,680
Try harder.

428
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,880
(That Luna)

429
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,479
(ran out of mana.)

430
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:11,400
(Luna, you're so weak.)

431
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:12,439
(Let's start the next round.)

432
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:13,598
(Hurry up.)

433
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,118
Teach that Su Lie a lesson.

434
00:29:15,118 --> 00:29:16,318
He keeps laughing at me.

435
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,880
We don't have enough money.

436
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,279
We can't defeat him now.

437
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,920
But we can tease him.

438
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:49,913
(Hand-picked Cotton)

439
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,640
Did he think

440
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,920
he can kill you?

441
00:29:52,199 --> 00:29:52,799
But

442
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,479
we teased him instead.

443
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:03,279
(Money is important.)

444
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,959
(Don't waste your time)

445
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:06,199
(on unnecessary stuff.)

446
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,239
(If it was before,)

447
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:11,078
(he wouldn't have entertained
these requests.)

448
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,799
(He might even give me a lecture.)

449
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,318
(He seems different
after the work trip.)

450
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,479
Yu Tu,

451
00:30:24,838 --> 00:30:26,239
can I use your phone

452
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,078
to play these few days?

453
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,279
I have to use

454
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,640
a phone model meant for
competitive gaming.

455
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,838
Your phone

456
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:34,838
is the same model.

457
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,838
I'm thinking

458
00:30:35,838 --> 00:30:36,318
if I can

459
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:37,519
get some practice.

460
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:45,880
The passcode is 0424.

461
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:47,358
Go and get it from the living room.
