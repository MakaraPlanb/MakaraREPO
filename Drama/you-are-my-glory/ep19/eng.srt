=Episode 19=

14
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,359
It's all you, Mr. Zhang.

15
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,760
You're exaggerating.

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,959
It's not bad.

17
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:51,760
Just like your previous work.

18
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,400
Thanks to you, Jingjing.

19
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
You performed well.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,319
That's why the sales are high.

21
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:55,640
No, no.

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Congratulations, Jingjing.

23
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,319
Thank you.

24
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,239
So humble.

25
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
Excuse me, gentlemen.

26
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,639
For you, Ms. Qiao.

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,120
It's delicious.

28
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,479
Try it.

29
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:31,759
Thank you.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,319
Ms. Wang.

31
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,680
Long time no see.

32
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
What brought

33
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
you here, Mr. Su?

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,879
Last time I checked

35
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,120
﻿your Moments, you were still in the UK.

36
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,080
I've been abroad due to my work.

37
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,360
I just came back today.

38
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,800
And I made meeting you

39
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
my top priority once I came back.

40
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:50,719
I wonder

41
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,840
who's the important one then.

42
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,000
Definitely not me.

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,479
All right. I'll leave you two alone.

44
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,280
It's been a long time.

45
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:06,680
How are you?

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,000
Not bad.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,960
I can imagine.

48
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,479
You're all over

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,919
the social media.

50
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,280
I highly doubt it.

51
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,439
Perhaps because I

52
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,919
always click on your news that

53
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,599
the algorithm recommends your content to me.

54
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,840
Thank you for supporting me then,
Mr. Su.

55
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,479
So who I saw

56
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
last time in your place

57
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,120
is your high school classmate.

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,560
Can't believe you follow

59
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,520
the gossips, Mr. Su.

60
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,039
As I said,

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,879
it's the algorithm.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,759
But no, not this time.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,759
During the casual match

64
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,960
that you took part in,

65
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,120
I was at the scene.

66
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:52,919
In the VIP room upstairs.

67
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,000
I see.

68
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:01,639
He played really well.

69
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,159
A Tsinghua graduate.

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,400
Was he

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
a lady-killer too

72
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,280
back in high school?

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,240
Was he part of the reasons

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,279
why you broke up

75
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,560
with me so decisively?

76
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,680
Who would have known that

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,000
Mr. Su lacks confidence in himself.

78
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,399
That's because you never

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,680
looked at me the way you looked at him.

80
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,240
We shouldn't

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,959
dwell on this anymore.

82
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,199
You're right.

83
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,639
After all,

84
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,720
we have to move on.

85
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:46,839
Mr. Su.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,079
I'll leave you be then, Mr. Su.

87
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,279
I'll join my friend.

88
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,199
Hold on.

89
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,240
One more thing.

90
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,879
I just wanted to

91
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,279
thank you for your help, Mr. Su.

92
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
If you're occupied,

93
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
I'll gladly take my leave.

94
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,879
You're welcome.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,920
It was just a small matter.

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,360
I have always wanted

97
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,560
to tell you this

98
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,879
but I never had the chance to.

99
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
The reason I went to your house last time

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,199
was

101
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,639
to apologize.

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,399
That gameplay footage of yours

103
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,079
was leaked by my ex-girlfriend.

104
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:29,680
Of course,

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,959
that's why she's

106
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,519
an

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,199
ex-girlfriend now.

108
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,959
You are in my WeChat

109
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,720
and both of you recorded my gameplay

110
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,040
before posting it online.

111
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,199
Not both of us.

112
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,199
Just me.

113
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,560
I enjoyed watching you

114
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,319
play game.

115
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,600
So I recorded it.

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,199
I didn't know

117
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,000
how she had found out

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,879
copied it
before posting it online.

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,680
I was careless.

120
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,639
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,279
Mr. Su, someone like you

122
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,360
never locked your own phone?

123
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,399
It was my fault.

124
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,480
An oversight.

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,240
My bad.

126
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,079
I should have blocked you.

127
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,959
I bet your girlfriend

128
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,839
must be upset now.

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,720
Do let your girlfriend know that,

130
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,360
thanks to her,

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,959
my endorsement contract was renewed

132
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,680
for three more years.

133
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,160
Ex-girlfriend.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,920
I'm single now.

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
You performed really well.

136
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm impressed.

137
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,079
You flatter me.

138
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,680
If I may, would you

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,959
give me the honor

140
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,040
to bring you out

141
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,519
for a dinner?
Just to make things right.

142
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,839
No need.

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,519
Everything is already over.

144
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,959
If there's nothing else for me, Mr. Su,

145
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,879
I'll join my friend now.

146
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,439
Wait.

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,279
You mentioned that you were still

148
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,800
single in the match.

149
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,399
Is it true?

150
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,519
If it is,

151
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,040
then,

152
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,120
are you willing to

153
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,040
start a new relationship?

154
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,120
A new relationship

155
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,800
with someone you've known.

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,759
I have a question for you,

157
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,439
Mr. Su.

158
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,519
Go ahead.

159
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,480
You said your girlfriend

160
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,920
had posted my video online.

161
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,759
Do you really feel sorry for me?

162
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,000
Why do I feel like

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,279
you're enjoying it?

164
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Because someone wanted your attention
so badly that

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,519
she did this.

166
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
Maybe the word "enjoy" is not proper.

167
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,399
It's more like you want to see

168
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,360
how I will deal with the situation.

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,360
You said you had gone to
my house that day

170
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,439
to apologize.

171
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:31,839
But that was

172
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,560
half a month

173
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,279
after the incident.

174
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,279
It was more like you were nearby

175
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,079
and on a whim,

176
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,160
you came to apologize.

177
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,439
Also,

178
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,279
I won the match.

179
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,560
What if I had lost?

180
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,160
What if I had lost so badly that

181
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,879
everyone was mocking me.

182
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,439
Would you still be here

183
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,480
telling me all this?

184
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:50,800
Also,

185
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,800
I need to

186
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,839
clarify something.

187
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,480
I took our relationship

188
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,319
seriously.

189
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,680
The break-up

190
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
had nothing to do with someone else.

191
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,600
Have you already forgotten

192
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,959
why we broke up?

193
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,079
I have always been curious

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
about one thing.

195
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
When you asked me

196
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,759
to give my career up,

197
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
were you truly ready

198
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
to spend the rest of your life with me?

199
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,120
I doubt it.

200
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:19,920
You said those words so nonchalantly.

201
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,639
That was when I realized that

202
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:23,800
you'd never ever

203
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,360
viewed me as your equal.

204
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,800
Even until now.

205
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
You're always on your high horse.

206
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,919
I can't deal with it.

207
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,320
Mr. Su,

208
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,840
we belong in different worlds.

209
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,759
Did Su Ye bother you again?

210
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,320
Listen to me.

211
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
Do not ever

212
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,399
believe his sweet promises.

213
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,320
He

214
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
has a cute face

215
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,399
but his personality

216
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,279
doesn't hold a candle to Mr. Yu's.

217
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Have you

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,879
talked to Mr. Yu lately?

219
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,000
You guys

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,480
confiscated my phone most of the time.

221
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,600
What do you think?

222
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,480
You're right.

223
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,519
You didn't even have the time

224
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,240
to sleep.

225
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,440
Won't you be back

226
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,799
in Shanghai within the next two days?

227
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,080
When you're free,

228
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,759
invite him out for a dinner.

229
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,519
He couldn't attend the celebratory
dinner last time.

230
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,679
We still owe him one.

231
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,840
Wait, no.

232
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,679
Tomorrow is the reunion dinner.

233
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
He might have been in his hometown already.

234
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Maybe after the Spring Festival?

235
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,639
Wait, no!

236
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,159
Mr. Yu and you are from
the same town, right?

237
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,559
You can invite him out
back in your hometown.

238
00:09:58,759 --> 00:09:59,600
Aren't you going back

239
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,039
straight away

240
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,159
after your performance on the
first day of the lunar new year?

241
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,519
So this is why

242
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,600
you called me for
in the middle of the night?

243
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,360
Of course not.

244
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,919
I need to brief you

245
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,919
about the event
on the first day of the lunar new year.

246
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,840
Where is she?

247
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,840
Xiao Zhu!

248
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,440
I was checking the mail.

249
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,600
We have a lot of letters.

250
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,519
Okay.

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,919
They're all bank reconciliations.

252
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Jingjing.

253
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,759
Someone wrote a letter to you.

254
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,240
Several letters to you.

255
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,879
Look.

256
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,660
(Ms. Qiao, Zhongshan South Street,
Huangpu District, Shanghai, China)

257
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,020
(Yu)

258
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:18,519
(Jingjing.)

259
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,559
(I hope all is well.)

260
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,720
(I went back to Yixing
earlier this month)

261
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,080
(and I found our chat history)

262
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,360
(on my old computer.)

263
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,480
(You asked me a lot of questions)

264
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,840
(but I replied to you)

265
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,159
(rudely.)

266
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,279
(And now,)

267
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,960
(I know my answers)

268
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,759
(are long overdue,
but can I give them to you now?)

269
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,080
(Your first question was about)

270
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,399
(the escape velocity)

271
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,639
(required for a spacecraft.)

272
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,519
(Can I come to ask you)

273
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,759
(when I have questions in the future?)

274
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,480
(I'm just a beginner.)

275
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,679
(I've only just started.)

276
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:57,639
(Sure.)

277
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,840
What should I ask?

278
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,320
Chang'e...

279
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,120
Chang'e...

280
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,039
(One question.)

281
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,720
(How fast should a space probe travel)

282
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,200
(to escape the Earth's gravity?)

283
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,360
(The answer is on Baidu.)

284
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,279
(You guys were discussing
the technological difference)

285
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,879
(between the Chinese
and the USA aerospace technology.)

286
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,559
(Is the gap that huge?)

287
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,519
(The discussion in the forum
is so lively!)

288
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,960
(Do you think we can)

289
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,440
(migrate to Mars one day?)

290
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,000
Ignored again...

291
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,500
(Note: Yu Tu)

292
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,279
When will you ever

293
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,600
talk to me?

294
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
(Your first question was about)

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,639
(the escape velocity)

296
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,200
(required for a spacecraft.)

297
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,679
(If I remember correctly,)

298
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,039
(The three cosmic velocities)

299
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:20,960
(are)

300
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,639
(within the syllabus
of high school physics.)

301
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:24,360
(Did you not pay attention)

302
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,519
(during class?)

303
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,033
(First cosmic velocity...
Out of the Solar System.)

304
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,240
(I drew a simple graph)

305
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,000
(Escape Earth's gravity)
(to help you understand it.)

306
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:32,759
(These are)

307
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:34,600
(the definitions of the
three cosmic velocities)

308
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,559
(as well as their principles.)

309
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,639
(You asked this question)

310
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,919
(due to Chang'e 1.)

311
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,559
(It's different)

312
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,200
(because the Moon is the Earth's satellite.)

313
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:46,480
(It is affected)

314
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,720
(by the Earth's gravity.)

315
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,840
(The velocity required)

316
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,879
(for a probe)

317
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,080
(to reach the Moon)

318
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,039
(is lower than
the second cosmic velocity.)

319
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,440
(Take Chang'e 1 for example,)

320
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:58,879
(as the)

321
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,519
(payload capacity
of a rocket back then was limited,)

322
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,799
(Chang'e 1 first entered)

323
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,399
(the Earth's elliptic orbit.)

324
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,360
(It then adjusted its velocity
several times)

325
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,320
(through its own force)

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,279
(before)

327
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,679
(entering the lunar transfer orbit)

328
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,353
(at the speed of)

329
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,639
(10.58km/s.)

330
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,227
(Yu Tu)

331
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,200
(Today's letter)

332
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
(is a bit boring.)

333
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:18,279
(I don't know if
you'll finish reading it.)

334
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,279
(However, the letter tomorrow)

335
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,480
(will be more fun.)

336
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,600
(Take care.)

337
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,000
(Yu Tu)

338
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,679
(Jingjing.)

339
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,320
(I hope all is well.)

340
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,600
(Blizzard in the south today)

341
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,799
(so I decided to walk back home.)

342
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,080
(I thought)

343
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:42,840
(about your question on the way.)

344
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,519
(The gap between our
and the US aerospace)

345
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,559
(is too vast a subject.)

346
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:50,759
(I might need)

347
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,399
(a lot of letters to explain it to you.)

348
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,080
(In this letter, let's talk about)

349
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,159
(the modern history of aerospace.)

350
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,879
(To be frank,)

351
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,360
(in terms of aerospace,)

352
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:00,919
(we are still)

353
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,200
(quite far from)

354
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,879
(the world's best.)

355
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,879
(Sometimes when we talk about this)

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,120
(among my colleagues,)

357
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
(some feel down.)

358
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,639
(They said there was at least a 30- or 40-year gap.)

359
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,120
(However,)

360
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,559
(that)

361
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,480
(doesn't mean
we need 30 or 40 years more.)

362
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,679
(It's part of the reasons
why my colleagues)

363
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,679
(and I)

364
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,399
(work so hard.)

365
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,240
(I've talked)

366
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,679
(about the comparison
between human spaceflight)

367
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,519
(and the rocket.)

368
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,360
(Tomorrow, we can talk about)

369
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,559
(deep space probes.)

370
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,000
(It's my forté.)

371
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,080
(The Voyager)

372
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
(and the Jade Rabbit)

373
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,840
(have a romantic backstory.)

374
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,120
(That said,
based on the post delivery speed,)

375
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,799
(you'll most likely receive it
after the lunar new year.)

376
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,960
(Jingjing.)

377
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,320
(Will you return to Yixing)

378
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,559
(during the lunar new year?)

381
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,480
Jingjing,

382
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,720
what do you want to do

383
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,000
after graduation?

384
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,480
Are you sending out your CV?

385
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,440
Not yet.

386
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,160
Someone is asking me to star in a film.

387
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,599
A film?

388
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
That's great!

389
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,759
Do it!

391
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,319

We need to go back early
to prepare for it.

472
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,359
Then I should have gone back today

473
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,200
to have the reunion dinner
with you guys.

474
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,920

489
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,079
A husband?

490
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,759
She is not in a hurry.

491
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,680

492
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Don't stress her out.

494
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,319
eat more.

498
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:46,920
Stop giving me food, mom.

499
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920

500
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,799

501
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
But it's tomorrow night, isn't it?

502
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,079
Just don't eat so much during the day.

503
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,039
Come.

504
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,039
Look at you.

505
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,880
Say something nice at least.

506
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,079
Don't eat so much?

510
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,319
is becoming superstitious.

511
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,240
Look at his logic.

512
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,319
How is it superstitious?

513
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:06,599
Your favorite.

514
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,160
For you.

515
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,240

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,640
Pack your stuff then.

570
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,039
But you always forget this and that...

571
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,720
Mr. Wang,

572
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:45,920
no need to be our chauffeur.

573
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,599
I'll drive.

574
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,000
You have a driver's license?

575
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,079
Of course.

576
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,799
Sometimes, my work requires me

577
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,920
to visit some

578
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,480
extreme environments

579
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,519
like the desert or the snowfield.

580
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,240
Been there, done that.

581
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,640
Highway is just a piece of cake.

582
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,119
Don't worry.

583
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,240
My driver's license.

584
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,260
(Driver's License)

585
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:54,599
Jingjing.

586
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,680
Can you help me with the navigation?

587
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,400
You don't even know the way.

588
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,559
Why be the driver then?

589
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,720
Why are you here?

590
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,599
You don't need to visit your parents?

591
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,799
I came from Yixing this morning.

592
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
If there had been no reunion dinner yesterday,

593
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,759
I would have been here since yesterday.

594
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,200
Jingjing.

595
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,240
Your reply scared me.

596
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,119
I'll take a nap.

597
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,160
Okay.

598

(Driver's License, Yu Tu)

599
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,599
I need to fill the car up.

600
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,079
I'll go to the toilet.

601
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,160
Okay.

602
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,559
It's late night.

603
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:54,720
I worry about you.

604
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,000
Okay.

605
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,680
