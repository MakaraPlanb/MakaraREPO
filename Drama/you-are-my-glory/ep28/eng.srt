13
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
=Episode 28=

14
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,799
My age is catching up to me.

15
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,519
I only organized the clothes,

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,799
and now my back is aching so badly.

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,480
You've worked hard.

18
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:01,799
Thanks.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,879
I fully support

20
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,280
Ms. Qiao Jingjing's decision
to stay here.

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,480
If you live in Lujiazui,

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,480
then I'm no longer your guest.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,639
You won't  show me
such great hospitality.

24
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,520
You don't have to take care of me
for the coming two months.

25
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,560
You can

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,159
travel with your mom.

27
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,240
I'll claim the expenses on your behalf.

28
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,439
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,000
Two months?

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you mean?

31
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:20,759
You're not going to do anything

32
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,680
for the coming two months?

33
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,439
No. Do you remember

34
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:23,879
the variety show I told you about?

35
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,199
Have you thought it over?

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,280
It won't take you more than 20 days.

37
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,520
I won't do it.

38
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,439
I gave Mr. Yu my words.

39
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,240
Two months.

40
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,199
No less.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,719
So, this is how one acts

42
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,919
when they are in love.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,879
That was a joke.

44
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,120
It has nothing to do with Mr. Yu.

45
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,879
Look.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,159
Have I ever rejected any good offer

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,240
for the past two years?

48
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,039
I won't sacrifice my career

49
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,080
for love.

50
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,199
But, from now on,

51
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,360
I'll not take up as many offers

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,560
other than acting jobs.

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,680
And you said this had nothing to do
with Mr. Yu.

54
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,039
It's true.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,680
To be honest, he affected me.

56
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,319
After all, I'm an actress.

57
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,039
Variety shows and commercials

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,680
can only bring me short-lived fame

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,400
and attention.

60
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,439
Over time,

61
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,639
all of these will fade away.

62
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,800
Ultimately,

63
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,599
people will only care about

64
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,000
the roles I've played,

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,800
and the work I've produced.

66
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,639
I have always known

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,520
these.

68
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,360
But, I thought I was still young,

69
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
and was able to cope.

70
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,319
There were regrets too.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,800
My age is catching up to me.

72
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,240
I don't want to
have a race against time,

73
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,280
and rush into creating a new image.

74
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,639
Being in this field,

75
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,479
if we ever panic,

76
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
it'll show through our works.

77
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,039
Then, our reputation will
be more or less affected too.

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
Of course, I'll still get cast.

79
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,439
But, they will be the same boring

80
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,800
female lead roles

81
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,879
that is no difference
among one another.

82
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
I don't want to end up like that.

83
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,199
That will be meaningless,

84
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,680
and I will lose my value.

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,080
Mr. Yu is an ambitious man.

86
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,159
I am, too.

87
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,520
Mr. Yu will keep increasing

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,719
his value.

89
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,000
Hence, I don't want
my career to go downhill.

90
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,039
From now on,

91
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,000
I will keep myself in good shape,

92
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,000
so that I can put more effort

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,120
into producing good works.

94
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,319
Of course,

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
this will also make my fame last.

96
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
I think

97
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,319
you're just trying to justify

98
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,160
your leave application.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,959
This is for recuperation.

100
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,680
All right. Let me think about it.

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,399
Let's eat.

102
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,040
You should reduce your rice intake.

103
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,519
I ordered this for you.

104
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,240
Today is my day off.

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,600
Just one more bite.

106
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,519
Remember.

107
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,519
There's no need for soy sauce.

108
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,439
No need for soy sauce. All right.

109
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,360
Do you always cook at home?

110
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,879
I'm preparing the food.

111
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,160
He'll cook it later.

112
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,800
Mr. Yu has completely no talent

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,120
in cooking.

114
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,319
This has thoroughly brought down

115
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,680
his self-esteem.

116
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,079
Guan Zai is nothing better.

117
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,959
I think he's back.

118
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
He's not working overtime.

119
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,439
We agreed on this.

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
On my first day here,

121
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,639
he didn't work overtime.

122
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,720
He has to put his family first.

123
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,639
Thanks. I've got to go.

124
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,079
I called Shen Jing

125
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,560
to ask her for the recipe for
crab roe chicken wings.

126
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,600
I suddenly crave it.

127
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
But, let's agree on this first.

128
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,959
I'll prepare the materials,

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,839
and you will cook them.

130
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,720
My fans will be sad

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,839
if I get burned.

132
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,279
She also wanted to know

133
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,680
when we would

134
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,759
pay her a visit.

135
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,879
If it's not too troublesome,

136
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,839
she will make braised stinky tofu

137
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,399
which I like and Guan Zai hates.

138
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,399
We should go over now.

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,519
Leave my face out of the frame.

140
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,279
It doesn't matter
even if you're in the frame.

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,560
You're so pretty.

142
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,480
Besides, I won't show this to others.

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,560
This is only a cooking tutorial

144
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
for Yu Tu.

145
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,160
You want him to cook this?

146
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,600
Didn't you say that he was a bad cook?

147
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,720
I'm a worse cook.

148
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,360
Look at how self-righteous you are.

149
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,560
He makes some dishes

150
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,839
quite well.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,519
But, there are also dishes

152
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,639
that he's terrible with.

153
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,120
And, braised tofu is one of them.

154
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,439
Every time he tried to make it,

155
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:12,920
it turned out either crushed,

156
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,199
or burnt.

157
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,920
He didn't control the heat properly.

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,920
Here.

159
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,240
Blow on it.

160
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
This might be a little hot.

161
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,319
Be careful.

162
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,560
How is it?

163
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,600
It's delicious.

164
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,519
Really?

165
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,800
That's great.

166
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,360
Over here, Shen Jing.

167
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,680
Say this to the camera.

168
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,399
This is a simple dish.

169
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,199
Yu Tu, you'll be a fool
if you can't master this.

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,959
That means Guan Zai has
always been a fool.

171
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,600
This is a simple dish.

172
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,920
Yu Tu,

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:46,959
Jingjing said

174
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,000
you'd be a fool
if you couldn't master this.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,519
There are so many dishes.

176
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,879
Try this.

177
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,639
This is delicious.

178
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,199
You're taking credit for
someone else's work.

179
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,480
You weren't the cook.

180
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,560
I made this.

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,399
I just learned how to make this.

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,399
Really?

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
I have to give it a try then.

184
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,680
Your cooking skills are lacking.

185
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,720
You need to practice more.

186
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,199
I knew you'd say that.

187
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,519
Shen Jing.

188
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,160
He said that
your cooking skills were lacking.

189
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,480
Don't try to fool me.

190
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,920
Shen Jing made this.

191
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,560
I only added some vinegar

192
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,639
before we served it.

193
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,319
That's why.

194
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,399
This is what affects its quality.

195
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,000
You added the vinegar.

196
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,519
That's gilding the lily.

197
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,800
You made the tofu tough.

198
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,439
Shen Jing, thanks for the food.

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,879
You're welcome.

200
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,000
Both of you

201
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,319
should keep eating.

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,439
I don't think the tofu is tough.

203
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,920
It tastes better
after she added the vinegar.

204
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,160
Right?

205
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:46,800
I knew that

206
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,600
this would suit the kids' palate

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
better.

208
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
She bought you over

209
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,560
with just a few autographs.

210
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,600
Many of my classmates

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
are Aunt Jingjing's fans.

212
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,360
They are envious of me
after they've found out

213
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,079
that I know Aunt Jingjing personally.

214
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,920
They also asked me

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,480
if the rumor about

216
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,560
Aunt Jingjing's boyfriend

217
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,480
was true.

218
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,560
You didn't tell them anything, right?

219
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Of course not.

220
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,439
But, there was

221
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,360
a very smart girl.

222
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,199
She asked me in secret,

223
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,040
if I knew Aunt Jingjing

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,240
because

225
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,279
dad and Aunt Jingjing's boyfriend

226
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,319
were colleagues.

227
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,800
It's not a surprise that she knows
your dad is an aerospace engineer.

228
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
How did she find out that

229
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,480
Jingjing's boyfriend

230
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,480
is an aerospace engineer too?

231
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,839
She told me there was an online post
that explained all these.

232
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,080
Someone took a photo of
Aunt Jingjing and Uncle Yu

233
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,759
somewhere near dad's office.

234
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,399
Some time ago,

235
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,679
they participated in a match together.

236
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,320
She also said that

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
their photographs had never become
the top search.

238
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,320
So, it must be true.

239
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,399
You are acting like adults.

240
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,919
You know more than I do.

241
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:45,960
Only a few of them in our department

242
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,279
know about your relationship.

243
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,840
I guess only you and Mr. Zhang
know about this.

244
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,399
No one has asked me about it before.

245
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,720
Judging from
how often Yu Tu works overtime,

246
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,679
no one will suspect that
you have a girlfriend.

247
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,559
It's only natural that the others
haven't found out about it yet.

248
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,279
Don't blame it on Yu Tu.

249
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,559
She

250
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,759
is always away.

251
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,360
What else can he do
if he doesn't work overtime?

252
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,320
I didn't spend half a year

253
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,080
at the launch site.

254
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,960
Shen Jing,

255
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,320
was Guan Zai like this too?

256
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:13,519
Stop right there.

257
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,440
We are

258
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,360
at a disadvantage.

259
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,279
Let's eat.

260
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,159
Let's eat.

261
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,200
Jingjing is on

262
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
such a long hiatus.

263
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,399
And, she'll be staying in
Tianyu City the whole time.

264
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,360
I think this won't stay secret for long.

265
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:29,759
We aren't trying to hide it.

266
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,799
We'll be celebrating
Guan Zai's homecoming this weekend.

267
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,120
I plan to bring Jingjing along.

268
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,360
Sure.

269
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,159
You can't do that.

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,960
She will steal the limelight.

271
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:39,600
No. You can't do that.

272
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,519
You should do it some other time.

273
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,000
Shen Jing, he's bullying me again.

274
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,120
Ignore him.

275
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,639
Eat up.

276
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Eat.

277
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,919
I have to scold you.

278
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,159
Why do you always argue with Jingjing?

279
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,759
How old are you?

280
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,960
You should be more considerate of her.

281
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,039
She's not a young girl either.

282
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
Sorry. It's my fault.

283
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,399
I did that deliberately.

284
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,679
You may not remember this.

285
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,000
When

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,440
I got my medical report,

287
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,360
one of the readings is not optimal.

288
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,399
You cried behind my back,

289
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,440
not wanting me to find out about it.

290
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,159
How could I not know about that?

291
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
So, I did it on purpose

292
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
to distract you,

293
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,960
and to cheer you up.

294
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,240
Qiao Jingjing

295
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,519
was as quick-witted as Yu Tu.

296
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,000
She saw what happened at a glance.

297
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,679
But somehow,

298
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,919
it has become a habit.

299
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,679
Is Yu Tu still struggling

300
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,519
to accept it?

301
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,679
He looked distracted just now.

302
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,840
He will get through this.

303
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,399
He is a big-hearted man.

304
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
(I visited the office)

305
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,120
(a while ago.)

306
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,320
I went through all the reports.

307
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,679
I see a significant improvement

308
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,080
in the overall design proposal

309
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,080
compared to that of two years ago.

310
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,440
Yu Tu.

311
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,440
You did very well.

312
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
You far exceeded my expectation.

313
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,679
Then, why did you have to leave?

314
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,919
You were the one who led us
at the beginning of the project.

315
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,000
You named it Search for God.

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,799
I've been waiting for your return,

317
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,000
so that you can keep leading us.

318
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,639
Search for God

319
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,039
doesn't need me anymore.

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,639
My presence

321
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,240
will not contribute
to the success of the model.

322
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,240
To be fair,

323
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,399
you know my health status.

324
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,559
I can no longer take up
any demanding job.

325
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,039
Before the auction,

326
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,080
there must be a period

327
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,799
when we have to work day and night.

328
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,039
It doesn't make sense

329
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:22,960
for the leader

330
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
to go home earlier than everyone else.

331
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,559
No one will mind.

332
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,799
I mind.

333
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,360
I'd better

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,039
handle other jobs,

335
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,200
so that I don't have to overtire myself
for the time being.

336
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,679
You've got no idea about this.

337
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,120
My mind hasn't been resting

338
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,000
for the past two years,
even though I've been sick.

339
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
I have a lot of ideas.

340
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll take this opportunity

341
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,960
to organize them.

342
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,799
When I'm done,
you'll definitely be impressed.

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,919
Whenever Search for God needs me,

344
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:52,840
I'll be right there,

345
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
but only as a consultant.

346
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,240
Is something

347
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,200
bothering you?

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,440
Does it have something to do
with Guan Zai?

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
Jingjing.

350
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,080
I don't feel well.

351
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,399
What happened?

352
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,879
Did Guan Zai bully you?

353
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,399
I'll revenge you.

354
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,646
Then Shen Jing won't
take your side anymore.

355
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,759
I told you

356
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,399
I was assigned to Guan Zai's group

357
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,279
when I first enrolled at the institute.

358
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:19,639
He guided me

359
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,120
in the development of a few models,

360
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
including the current prototype.

361
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,840
A few years ago, he fell ill.

362
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,360
So, he entrusted the project to me.

363
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,879
Now that he has recovered,

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,720
I thought we would get to
work together again.

365
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,279
But he requested

366
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,200
to leave the Search for God project.

367
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,120
Why?

368
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,120
He said

369
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,600
it was no longer challenging for him.

370
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,759
His health is one of the factors too.

371
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,559
So, you're sad because

372
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,840
you won't get to work

373
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,559
with Guan Zai anymore, right?

374
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
If I were in his shoes,

375
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,360
I'd probably do the same too.

376
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,279
But, this is such a regret.

377
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,039
We should've been able to
accomplish this together.

378
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,000
Many of my colleagues

379
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,159
are working hard alongside me.

380
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
But, it's different

381
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,320
when Guan Zai's around.

382
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,960
I remember you once told me about

383
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:47,759
the meaning behind
your deep space expedition.

384
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,159
You want to explore the origins
of the Earth and humankind.

385
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,320
You want to prove the existence
of other beings.

386
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,679
You want to find a new source of energy

387
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,000
and even a new home planet,

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,799
to increase the likelihood of
the survival of human civilization.

389
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,960
Am I right?

390
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,120
You're right.

391
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,879
So, whatever happens in the future,

392
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,039
or whatever Guan Zai will be doing,

393
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,960
you will always be working
toward the same goal.

394
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,440
Although you no longer work together,

395
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,440
you'll always move forward
alongside each other.

396
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,240
Just like

397
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,480
you and I.

398
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,440
Although we are working
in different industries,

399
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
we are moving forward
alongside each other too,

400
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,559
right?

401
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,480
Yes.

402
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,679
So, it shouldn't be a regret.

403
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
Feeling like that won't help anyway.

404
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
Guan Zai will not change his mind.

405
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,679
You're always arguing with Guan Zai.

406
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,480
Yet, you know him very well.

407
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,919
Let's go home.

408
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,599
Jingjing,

409
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,920
I thought

410
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,759
I could take a break

411
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,599
when Guan Zai was back.

412
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,680
But, it seems like

413
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,039
I have to work even harder now.

414
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
This is such a coincidence.

415
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,759
Today, I told Ms. Ling

416
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,920
that I would work harder

417
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,359
to become a better actress.

418
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,799
Didn't you already win

419
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,759
the best actress award last year?

420
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,119
That shouldn't stop me
from improving myself.

421
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,559
You won't stop at one star,

422
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,200
right?

423
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,319
I want to win more awards.

424
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,079
I've aspired to improve myself

425
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,240
since I saw how many trophies you have.

426
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,119
What if someone gets curious about

427
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,079
Mr. Yu's next-of-kin,

428
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,759
and later finds out that

429
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,839
she's just a pretty woman
with no other achievements.

430
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,559
That's so embarrassing.

431
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,319
Jingjing,

432
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,440
you're getting better and better

433
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,079
at praising yourself.

434
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,960
All right.

435
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,599
(I agree with you.)

436
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,400
(I will think about)

437
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,759
(how to manage your prospective jobs.)

438
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,039
(You have been dating)

439
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,599
(Mr. Yu for two years,)

440
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,960
(but you haven't spent much time
with each other.)

441
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,000
(As the saying goes,)

442
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
(it's easy to fall in love,
but it's difficult to stay together.)

443
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,640
(You'll only know
if you are suited for one another)

444
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,799
(after you stay together.)

445
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,000
(Initially, I was worried about you.)

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,960
(But now, I'm not worried anymore.)

447
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
(You're now a grown-up.)

448
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,599
(I've never thought about it.)

449
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,920
(After hearing what you said,)

450
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,480
(I've now realized this issue.)

451
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,119
Yu Tu.

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
I have a question.

453
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,480
What is it?

454
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,279
This time, we will be staying together

455
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,960
for a longer time.

456
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,519
What if we suddenly realize that

457
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,599
we are not suited for each other?

458
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,079
When I was teaching you how to play,

459
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,000
we spent a lot of time together too.

460
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
From 9 AM to 9 PM.

461
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
Every day, I had to wake up at 6 AM,

462
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
and was only back home at 11 PM.

463
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,119
Do you not remember

464
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,720
how you took up all my time?

465
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,960
It was different back then.

466
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,680
Of course, it was.

467
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,559
We were only together during the day.

468
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,640
Now that I have a job,

469
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,920
we will spend more time together
at night.

470
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,759
Jingjing,

471
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
we don't have time to fight

472
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,200
at night.

473
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,799
I can't accept this cruel fact.

474
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:15,279
What's wrong?

475
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:16,720
I've got no idea.

476
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,240
It's too early for a fit now.

477
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,480
It's you!

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,400
Yu Tu, guess what.

479
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,160
He is seeing someone.

480
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,319
I told him that

481
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,640
we should visit
the famous restaurant together

482
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,160
if we get off work early.

483
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,240
Then, he told me

484
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,720
he would be visiting the place
with his girlfriend.

485
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,039
I never expected that

486
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,960
Hu would be the first person

487
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,799
in our office

488
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,279
to get attached.

489
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,359
The first person?

490
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
Who says that he's the first one?

491
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,759
I'll treat everyone to a meal
this coming weekend.

492
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,839
Guan Zai is back.

493
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,759
Let's celebrate his homecoming.

494
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,480
That's great.

495
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,440
I'll also take this chance

496
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,720
to introduce my girlfriend

497
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,400
to you.

498
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,279
Girlfriend?

499
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,319
I'm still single.

500
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,240
But not long ago,

501
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,119
a senior confessed his feelings to me.

502
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,599
I'm still considering.

503
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,640
I'm done for.

504
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:20,960
Meng.

505
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,240
Good luck.

506
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:25,920
Meng.

507
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,039
You are the best.

508
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,640
You have to be there.

509
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,440
Jingjing, it's time to go.

510
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,359
Give me another 10 minutes.

511
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,279
I'm almost done.

512
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,799
You are the prettiest
when your face is bare.

513
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,319
That's impossible.

514
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:09,160
The household chores have been
keeping me busy.

515
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,599
I've aged quite a bit.

516
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,039
I am the one

517
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,000
who sweeps, mops, and does the dishes.

518
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,039
I prepare the food, cook,

519
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,359
do the laundry
and clean the other areas.

520
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,799
We do the cooking together.

521
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,680
How did you get into Tsinghua?

522
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,720
You can run an experiment,

523
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,480
earn a Penta Kill,

524
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,519
but you can't cook.

525
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
This proves that cooking

526
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
belongs to the arts field.

527
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,240
So, you should work harder.

528
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,720
I can survive by eating only greens.

529
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,440
Can you?

530
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,799
It's a quarter past five now.

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,880
Coming.

532
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,759
How do I look?

533
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,200
Don't I look very natural

534
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,359
as though I wasn't wearing any make-up?

535
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,400
This is a beguiling make-up.

536
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,400
This requires a lot of effort,

537
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,519
and you kept rushing me.

538
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,319
I am against the light.

539
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:00,279
Come closer.

540
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:05,799
When you lied to me
and brought me to your place

541
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,559
to fix the purifier,

542
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
you were wearing

543
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
similar make-up too.

544
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,640
No.

545
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,160
I only applied 5 catty of face powder.

546
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
Didn't that make you 100 catty then?

547
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,799
Didn't Ms. Ling scold you for that?

548
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
At that time, I weighed
less than 95 catty.

549
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,279
But, I like it.

550
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,319
You ruined my lipstick.

551
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,480
I'm running late.

552
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,599
The color of the lipstick
is too bright,

553
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:33,880
and makes the make-up look
less beguiling.

554
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,480
Is it?

555
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,920
Well.

556
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
Then, kiss me some more.

557
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,640
This is table number two.

558
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
Is this okay?

559
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,119
Sure. Thanks.

560
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,839
Indeed,

561
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,599
the single man always arrives first.

562
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,079
Yu Tu,

563
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,319
where are you?

564
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:13,039
What is taking you

565
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,200
so long?

566
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm stuck in a traffic jam.

567
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:17,880
I'll be there in another 15 minutes.

568
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,480
Sure.

569
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,440
There's no rush.

570
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:21,519
Guan is not here yet either.

571
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:22,720
Oh, yes.

572
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,400
I asked the staff here.

573
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
There is a minimum spending

574
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,440
applied to the private room.

575
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
I saw a few empty tables
in the main hall.

576
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Let's do it in the main hall then.

577
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,480
Table number two.

578
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,160
Take the private room.

579
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,160
There's no need

580
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,240
for such formality.

581
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,119
Although you're paying the bill,

582
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,680
we can't spend unnecessarily too, right?

583
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,079
I'm doing this

584
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
because my girlfriend
is a delicate girl.

585
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:45,279
All right.

586
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,759
It's not nice to say that

587
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,200
in front of her, right?

588
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm only telling the truth.

589
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,119
Okay. I've got to go.

590
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,480
Drive safe.

591
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:07,839
You're driving too fast.
iI'm getting carsick.

592
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,640
You're driving too slow now.

593
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:24,640
It's making me sick too.

594
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,119
All right. You are not a delicate girl.

595
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,880
No.

596
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,240
When did you all

597
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,079
get attached?

598
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:56,000
Why didn't you inform me?

599
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,599
I didn't know

600
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,799
if the relationship would work.

601
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
So, I kept this from you.

602
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Hu announced it

603
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
immediately after the relationship
was determined.

604
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,400
He was exhilarated.

605
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,519
Hu has been

606
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,160
working with Yu Tu

607
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,160
for such a long time.

608
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,400
Why is he still not as quick-witted

609
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,640
as Yu Tu?

610
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,480
Perhaps, the lady likes Hu

611
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,759
for his innocence.

612
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,400
Understood.

613
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,599
He should date a person of his own kind.

614
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,160
To tame a hyper-intelligent person
like Yu Tu,

615
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,119
we need a quirky person

616
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,799
like Qiao Jingjing.

617
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,920
No.

618
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,240
When did Yu Tu

619
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,079
get himself a girlfriend?

620
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,200
I think it was

621
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,720
when he got the WeChat Mini Program

622
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,400
from you.

623
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,440
That was a long time ago.

624
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:47,839
But,

625
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,519
how did you know

626
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,279
about this incident?

627
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,599
You were complaining about it non-stop.

628
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,279
Have you forgotten about it?

629
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,920
But, I didn't tell Guan about it.

630
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,160
Your IQ should be

631
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,759
as high as your EQ.

632
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,039
You should learn from Yu Tu.

633
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,359
He doesn't have a high EQ either.

634
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,200
He called his girlfriend delicate

635
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,519
in front of her,

636
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,640
and said that she insisted on
taking the private room.

637
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,640
You

638
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,720
are indeed a single man.

639
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,599
That's just flirting.

640
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,119
Guan, I...

641
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:15,559
Don't listen to Yu Tu.

642
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,839
He was just showing off.

643
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,079
I hope you understand.

644
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,079
It really isn't appropriate

645
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,480
for his girlfriend
to stay in the main hall.

646
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,799
Why?

647
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,200
I saw

648
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,319
an online post.

649
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:31,519
But, I was too shy to ask.

650
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,559
Wait a minute.

651
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,839
What does this have to do
with anything online?

652
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,799
There was a post...

653
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,319
Ms. Qiao,

654
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,400
this is the room.

655
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,119
Sorry, we're late.

656
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,319
Hi.

657
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,180
(Group Chat)
(Ha, ha, ha.)

658
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,119
(Guan, please delete the photo.)

659
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:07,920
(I'll get on my knees.)

660
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,680
(It's too hideous.
Please delete it.)

661
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,559
(I'll buy you 10 days' worth
of breakfast and lunch.)

662
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,839
(It's all Yu Tu's fault.)

663
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,200
(Yu Tu, show yourself.)

664
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,160
(Guan, please delete the photo.
I'll get on my knees.)

665
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,920
(I didn't take the photo.)

666
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,519
(You really showed yourself.)

667
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,720
(I didn't want to say anything)

668
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,880
(during the meal.)

669
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,279
(Do you call yourself a good friend?)

670
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,519
(You kept this from us for so long.)

671
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,680
(Are you from the State Secrecy Bureau?)

672
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:36,559
(Wait.)

673
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,200
(You were high school classmates.)

674
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,519
(Have you been dating each other
for more than 10 years?)

675
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
(That's possible.)

676
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,599
(Until today, I've learned that)

677
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,359
(Yu Tu is such a scheming person.)

678
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,720
Look at what

679
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,319
your colleagues think of you now.

680
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,599
You shouldn't deceive them ever again.

681
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,160
But, if we had gotten together

682
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
back in high school,

683
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,400
how would it have turned out?

684
00:28:58,519 --> 00:28:59,119
Forget it.

685
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,160
It'd be better that
we didn't get together then.

686
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,680
Otherwise,

687
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,240
I wouldn't have

688
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,400
become who I am now.

689
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,400
I wouldn't have turned out to be as pretty

690
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
and interesting as I am now either.

691
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,799
Forget about it.

692
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,759
Although

693
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,960
we got together 10 years later,

694
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,000
you have

695
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,839
a pretty and adorable girlfriend now.

696
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,319
Aren't you happy about that?

697
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
Can you prove it with action?

698
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,240
(Why are you not replying?)

699
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,920
(Where did you go?)

700
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,279

the answer anymore.)
