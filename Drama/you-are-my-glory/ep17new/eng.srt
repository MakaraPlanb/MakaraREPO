=Episode 17=

14
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,460
(One day before New Year, Xi'an)

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm really feeling the vibe
of New Year in Xi'an.

16
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:04,879
Look, it's so beautiful.

17
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,800
Tomorrow,

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,560
in Chongqing,

19
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,879
there will be another road show.

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,159
On New Year's Day
the day after tomorrow,

21
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
your movie will officially be released.

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,960
We'll be flying to Beijing
to attend the premiere.

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
Afterwards, you have
two other road shows

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,439
in Wuhan

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,360
and Nanjing.

26
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,800
Nanjing is close to Shanghai.

27
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,400
Do you want to go back and rest a bit?

28
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,520
After getting busy
with your next schedule,

29
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,800
you won't have time to go back anymore.

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
What activities are scheduled next?

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,840
A few interviews,

32
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,120
a magazine shoot,

33
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:32,520
and a shoot for an advertisement.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,719
Before Spring Festival, the platform

35
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
has a few awarding ceremonies

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,719
that you must attend,

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,840
but they're all in Beijing.

38
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,319
I won't go back to Shanghai then.

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,280
I'll fly directly to Beijing.

40
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,120
Okay.

41
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,879
We have time
for the Spring Festival Gala

42
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,000
on the first day of the lunar new year.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,039
Let's attend then.

44
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,400
Is the schedule for filming
on the set of Mr. Li's movie confirmed?

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,639
The fifth day of the lunar new year

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,639
is the time for the table read and test shoot.

47
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,800
And the eighth day of the lunar new year
is when you will officially start shooting.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,039
If there is some work

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,599
that can be done
before going to the film set,

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
let's do them.

51
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,800
I don't want to keep taking leaves
while filming.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,879
Okay.

53
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:02,680
By the way,

54
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,919
there's an event in April

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,080
that I think you'll be interested in.

56
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,039
What is it?

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,120
April 24th

58
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,120
is Space Day.

59
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,960
It's probably
because you posted something

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,639
about the aerospace tech air purifier
for civilian use

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,840
so the organizer invited you

62
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,000
to join their gala.

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
If you come back

64
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,919
after I leave,

65
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,199
I won't be here to give you

66
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:40,919
a passionate welcome anymore.

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,479
Don't miss me.

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,479
I'm going on a business trip
for a month soon.

69
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,759
I don't have time to think of you.

70
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,840
Can you show me some respect?

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,479
I may not know what exactly happened

72
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,719
between you and Cotton,

73
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,439
but who are you?

74
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,759
You're our idol.

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,319
You shouldn't live this way.

76
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,240
Come on.

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,840
I'll see you off.

78
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,300
(Paiods Hotel)

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,399
- It must have been hard on you.
- Thank you.

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,360
Bye.

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,360
What do you think
about the Space Day Gala?

82
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,639
I must give them a reply.

83
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,240
Sure, why not?

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,519
I'm honored to be invited.

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,199
Okay.

86
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,480
I'll say yes to them then.

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,240
I think this is quite good.

88
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
It's quite positive for your image.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,079
Besides,

90
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,160
you might see Mr. Yu there.

91
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Mr. Yu is so talented.

92
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,160
Perhaps he'll be a special guest
or something.

93
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,759
Maybe.

94
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,639
At the celebration party last time,

95
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,759
Mr. Yu didn't attend.

96
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
If you have time later on,

97
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,560
treat Mr. Yu to a meal.

98
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,279
We'll see.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,439
My luggage.

100
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:18,839
Here.

101
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:19,759
Good night.

102
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,800
Get some rest.

103
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,519

Yu Tu.

131
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,759
Why are you home?

132
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,320
Dear.

133
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
Hurry, our son is home.

134
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
Dad.

135
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
Didn't you just come back in October?

136
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,399
Why are you back again?

137
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,720
I'll go on a business trip
for a month soon.

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm not sure how the signal is there,

139
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,279
so I came home for a visit.

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
For New Year's Eve this year,

141
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:22,759
will you be able to make it home?

142
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,039
Yes.

143
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,399
That's good. Great.

144
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:26,360
That's great.

145
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:27,519
I'll go and buy some cooked food.

146
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,759
Why?

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,799
Our son is back.

148
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,919
He must eat freshly-cooked food.

149
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,919
Buy his favorites.

150
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,600
Shrimp, fish,

151
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,519
and chicken. Buy them all.

152
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,360
Okay, I got it.

153
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,200
Come on.

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,320
Let me take a look at you.

155
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,720
Why have you grown thinner again?

156
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,639
Weren't you eating properly?

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,639
I've been eating quite well.

158
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,679
You brat.

159
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,080
Here you go.

160
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,320
Stir-fried shredded potatoes.

161
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,799
Here.

162
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,639
Drink some yogurt.

163
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,519
Youngsters nowadays like to drink this.

164
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,799
It helps with digestion.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Here.

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,639
Thank you, Mom.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Dad.

168
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,360
How is Mom's health lately?

169
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,399
It's quite good.

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,159
Last time,

171
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,840
she got

172
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,720
a bit scared.

173
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,519
But it was a good thing too.

174
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,639
Now, she's more health-conscious.

175
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,159
Less salt, less oil, less sugar.

176
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,600
I have no choice.

177
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,759
I can only buy

178
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,960
some pork head meat outside

179
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,919
to nourish myself a bit.

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,360
Where did you get personal money
to buy that?

181
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,720
I've been saving it
for dozens of years.

182
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,399
Of course there's no problem.

183
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,480
You've been hiding personal money
for dozens of years?

184
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,120
Our son is back.

185
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
I'm just bluffing in front of him.

186
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,320
Don't take it seriously.

187
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,039
Save it.

188
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,320
Come on, come out.

189
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,720
Come on.

190
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm washing the dishes.

191
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,159
Can't our son wash them?

192
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:01,919
Mom.

193
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,840
I can wash them.

194
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,879
Dad's going out.

Teach me Math.

201
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,360
I'll buy you fried chicken.

202
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,240
Yu Tu.

203
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,919

204
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,639
Isn't that your book from senior high?

205
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,440
Why do you think about

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,159
reading it now?

207
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,519
It's nothing.

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,559
Why are my books
from senior high still here?

209
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,399
They must have been

210
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,639
left behind when I was sorting them.

211
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,919
There are so many of them.

212
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,159
Mom.

213
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
Where's my old computer?

214
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,279
I thought you wouldn't use it anymore,

215
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,480
so I placed it downstairs

216
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
in that small storage room.

217
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,080
This computer is already so old.

218
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,159
Why do you think

219
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,240
about taking it out today?

220
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,879
When we replaced our television before,

221
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,279
I should have let those people

222
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,080
take it away too.

223
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,360
It's just taking up space anyway,

224
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,279
but it won't sell for much either.

225
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,039
Mom, let's keep it.

226
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:49,919
Okay, we'll keep it.

00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,919

(I saw your QQ account)

235
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,679
(in the aerospace forum,)

236
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,559

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,399
(Your discussion is so interesting.)

239
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,559
(Do you think we can really)

240
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,519
(go to the moon?)

241
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,039
(It's just a matter of time and desire.)

242
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,240
(In the future,)

243
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480

244
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,039
(Actually, I'm just a beginner.)

245
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,519
(I've just started
taking an interest in this.)

246
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,360
(Sure.)

247
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:24,440
(Thank you.)

248
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,240
(I have a question.)

249
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,080
(How fast should the probe be)

250
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
(in order to break away
from the Earth's gravity?)

251
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,759
(You can search for that on Baidu.)

252
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:47,399
(Oh, okay.)

253
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,159
I'm doomed.

254
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,679
He must have figured out

255
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,960
that I don't know anything.

256
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,879
(I understand now.)

257
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,360
(But I think it's not quite the same)

258
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,600
(on the moon, right?)

259
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,960
(Because the moon
is the Earth's satellite.)

260
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:12,240
(Hello.)

261
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,720
(Last time,
I asked if I could consult you)

262
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,039
(about some questions.
Can I still do that?)

263
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:17,320
(I saw your forum discussion)

264
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,919

and USA's aerospace technology.)

265
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,399
(Is the gap between us)

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,799
(really that huge?)

267
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,159
He's not replying again.

268
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,879
(Are you there?)

269
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,360
(Could it be that you've deleted me?)

270
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,840
When will you take the initiative

271
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,039
to talk to me?

272
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,440
(The group chat discussion is
so lively.)

273
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,159
(Do you think mankind can really)

274
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,279
(migrate to Mars?)

275
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
(We have a new member.)

276
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,440
(I think so.)

277
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,279
(And it's a girl.)

278
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:04,519
(Hello.)

279
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,279
(It's really a girl.)

280
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,919
(Did someone invite her?)

281
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,919
(No.)

282
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,840
(I saw your group ID
on the aerospace forum,)

283
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,320
(so I joined.)

284
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,960

285

287
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,279
(You're so young.)

288
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,519
(You must still be in senior high.)

289
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
(Senior high students nowadays
are incredible.)

290
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,279
(We have a senior high student
in our group too.)

291
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,159
(He has a lot of knowledge.)

292
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,240
(Is he that incredible?)

293
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,320
(I don't know anything.)

294
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,559
(I'm just a bit curious.)

295
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,679
(It's fine. You're welcome here.)

296
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,240
(He hasn't joined us lately.)

297
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,759
(I'll introduce you two
when he joins us.)

298
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,120
(Galaxy, you're here.)

299
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,120
(In the afternoon, you missed)

300
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,919
(someone of your age.)

301
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,919
(I were here.)

302
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,519
(But what you were talking about
was so professional.)

303
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,399
(I didn't dare to speak.)

304
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,960
(But he's really incredible.)

305
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:43,960
(He knows a lot of things.)

306
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,320
(Is anyone here)

307
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,080
(who can help me?)

308
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,080
(I have a physics problem
that I can't answer.)

309
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,279
(So that's how it's done.)

310
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:52,440
(Thank you, Mr. Fish Head.)

311
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,320
(You're so incredible.)

312
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,679
(Mr. Fish Head.)

313
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,960
(My teacher said)

314
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,279
(that your solution from yesterday
was wrong.)

315
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,160
(I can't join you anymore.)

316
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,000
(Why? Your parents won't allow it?)

317
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,359
(No.)

318
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,759
(I must study hard now.)

319
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,359
(After getting into
my target university,)

320
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,400
(I'll come to join you again.)

321
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,079
(Which one is your target?)

322
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,480
(Tsinghua.)

323
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,680

by its cover, girl.)

(You have a high ambition.)

326
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:38,640
(Actually,
I don't have a high ambition.)

327
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,960
(But lately,)

328
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,279
(I confessed my feelings
to the person I like.)

329
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,359
(I think he feels like my grades
aren't good enough,)

330
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,359
(so I want to get)

331
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,440
(into the same university as him.)

332
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,759
(Perhaps he'll like me then.)

333

(I am very beautiful.)

337
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,559

that my grades)

(aren't good enough.)

341
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,200

342
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,920

that you wanted to give up?

376
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,960
Is it because of your family?

377
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,960
But I remember that your uncle

378
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,759
is also working in aerospace.

379
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,359

"He'll probably become

00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,880
Yu, hurry up.

398
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:44,759
We're going out for a walk.

399
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:45,839
Why do you have a thermos with you?

400
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,759
Zhang called me just now

401
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,519
to play mahjong with him.

402
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,000
Mahjong... You just
keep playing mahjong.

403
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:50,960
Our son is home,

404
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
and you're still playing mahjong.

405
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,319
I've already spent a few hours

406
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,279
with him.

407
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:56,960
Fine.

408
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,400
Come back before 9 p.m.

409
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,119
I will.

410
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,160
Take good care of your mom.

411
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
You keep playing mahjong.

412
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,359
Your son is home?

413
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,319
Yes, he just arrived at lunch time.

414
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,640
Yu Tu

415
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
is becoming more and more handsome.

416
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,440
Does he have a girlfriend now?

417
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
He's too busy with work
to think about that.

418
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,519
No matter how busy he is,

419
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,720
he can't delay marriage.

420
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,079
That's the disadvantage

421
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,359
of working far away.

422
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,759
The parents can't interfere
in his business.

423
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
If he worked here,

424
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,440
his kids would already be in school.

425
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,039
Right.

426
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,920
Let me see

427
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
if there's anyone in Shanghai

428
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,039
that I can help introduce to you later.

429
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,240
Don't forget.

430
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,119
Bye.

431
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,039
Come on.

432
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:35,960
That lady just likes
to worry about people.

433
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,680
Tell me.

434
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:41,440
In the afternoon,

435
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,920
was something bothering you?

436
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,400
Before I came home last time,

437
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,640
I had tendered my resignation,

438
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,880
but I have still gone back there now.

439
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,880
I think

440
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,119
that you're like your uncle the most.

441
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,720
You've always admired him
since you were little.

442
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,279
You kept boasting
to your friends saying,

443
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,160
"My uncle is

444
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,440
in charge of rocket launches."

445
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,720
Among my siblings,

446
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,119
your uncle is the smartest.

447
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,839
But he also has the hardest time.

448
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,559
He's all alone in the northwest of China.

449
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
He can't take care
of his family at all.

450
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,559
One time,

451
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,519
your grandpa was sick

452
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,680
and almost didn't make it.

453
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,799
We couldn't contact him
no matter how hard we tried.

454
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,599
Back then,

455
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,720
communications weren't as advanced

456
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,680
as it is now.

457
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:23,920
Later on, we were finally

458
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,240
able to save your grandpa.

459
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:26,880
We got into contact with your uncle.

460
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,039
We wanted him to come home,

461
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,279
but he spoke haltingly for a while,

462
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,759
and said that he couldn't.

463
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,279
He said

464
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,720
that since your grandpa was fine now,

465
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
his current mission
was also very important.

466
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,000
He could only come home
after completing his mission.

467
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,920
And he ended up

468
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,559
coming home only after one month.

469
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,480
All of his siblings

470
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,440
were mad at him

471
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,240
and treated him coldly.

472
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,640
Back then,

473
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,480
your grandaunt

474
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,559
came to visit him,

475
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,160
and pointed at him and scolded him

476
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,279
for being unfilial.

477
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,359
Your uncle just listened

478
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,200
and didn't say a word.

479
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,359
You were still so little back then.

480
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
You suddenly said,

481
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,599
"Grandaunt,

482
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:01,640
isn't your son

483
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,200
working in the USA?"

484
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:04,920
Your grandaunt

485
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,200
loved hearing that the most.

486
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,319
She said, "Right.

487
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,640
Yu Tu,

488
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,920
study hard too,

489
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,279
and go to the USA in the future."

490
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,559
Then you said,

491
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,480
"Grandaunt,

492
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,079
your son

493
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,160
hasn't visited you for so many years.

494
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,480
Why don't you scold him
for being unfilial?"

495
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,839
Back then, I thought,

496
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:24,640
"Hey.

497
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,240
They both

498
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,720
can't be with their parents.

499
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
If you live abroad,

500
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,240
people envy you.

501
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
If you're in the northwest of China,

502
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
and silently making your contribution,

503
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,039
people would say that it's not worth it,

504
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,240
and even consider you unfilial.

505
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,400
Does that make sense?"

506
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:37,720
All of us adults

507
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
couldn't figure it out.

508
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,559
We were no better
than a ten-year-old child like you.

509
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:42,880
I've been smart since I was little.

510
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,319
Of course.

511
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,039
You're my son.

512
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,759
Son.

513
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,000
You know

514
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:53,240
about life's truths.

515
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
But when it comes to yourself,

516
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,880
you're confused.

517
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,519
Actually, the thing I regret the most

518
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:01,240
in my life

519
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,400
is forcing you to choose Finance

520
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,720
as your major

521
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
for your college application.

522
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,920
What was I thinking back then?

523
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,880
I thought,

524
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,200
"My son has such high grades.

525
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,319
He must go

526
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,599
into the most popular major.

527
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,440
Otherwise, his grades would be wasted."

528
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,079
Later on,

529
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,839
I found out

530
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,799
that you secretly studied two majors.

531
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,480
I regretted it so much.

532
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
Because of me,

533
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,519
you wasted so much effort.

534
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:29,119
It's all my fault.

535
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,319
Son.

536
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,920
Be honest with me.

537
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,359
Were you planning to resign

538
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:36,799
because of my illness

539
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,160
last time?

540
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,960
Mom.

541
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,960
You're so silly.

542
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,319
You were overthinking.

543
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
No matter what you do in the future,

544
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,519
don't think

545
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,240
about us.

546
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,960
Just think about yourself.

547
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,279
Son.

548
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm really proud of you.

549
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,279
You're already doing very well.

550
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:02,839
Your dad and I

551
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,200
are envied by people so much.

552
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:07,480
Promise me.

553
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,839
There's really no need

554
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,279
to be the best in everything.

555
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,000
Son.

556
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
You must consider getting married too.

557
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,400
Otherwise, those ladies

558
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
would keep asking me,

559
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,400
"When will Yu Tu

560
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,640
get married?"

561
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,200
Her qualifications don't need
to be too good.

562
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,559
She doesn't need to be very beautiful.

563
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,119
It's best if she knows
how to take care of people.

564
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,920
Mom.

565
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,319
I think I like the opposite of that.

566
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:12,647
(Dunhuang)

567
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,240
I'm sorry.

568
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,680
My flight got delayed.

569
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,799
I've already gotten off the plane.

570
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay.

571
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,119
I'll be right there.

572
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,260
(Dunhuang)

573
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,279
Hello.

574
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,599
I'm Yu Tu from Base 158.

575
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,200
Hello.

576
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,119
The van for your institute

577
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:33,720
is already full.

578
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,599
Didn't you fly here together?

579
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
I flew here from another place.

580
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,119
Take the last van then.

581
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:38,960
Just wait for a few more colleagues

582
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,799
from the Chinese Academy of Sciences,

583
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,440
and you can leave.

584
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,400
Thank you.

585
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,119
You're welcome.

586
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,319
Hi.

587
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,160
Hi.

588
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,880
We're from the Chinese Academy
of Sciences. What about you?

589
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,359
Mr. Zhou?

590
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:58,920
How...

591
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,599
How did you know?

592
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,559
We had a teleconference before.

593
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,799
I'm Yu Tu from Base 158.

594
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,759
I heard from the people

595
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,839
who joined
the Field Experiment Team before

596
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,359
that food in the base is very good.

597
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,559
They even hired

598
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,319
a ramen master.

599
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,559
After hearing that,

600
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,039
I've been so looking forward to it.

601
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,480
Why do you always

602
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,000
keep thinking about food?

603
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,279
I'm from the north.

604
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,880
We love noodles.

605
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,799
Mr. Yu.

606
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:25,839
You're from the south, aren't you?

607
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:26,839
Will that be different
from what you're used to?

608
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,039
No.

609
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,200
It's fine as long as I get full.

610
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,359
Mr. Yu is handsome.

611
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,039
When he speaks,

612
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,279
he sounds like a guy
in the technology field indeed.

613
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,000
