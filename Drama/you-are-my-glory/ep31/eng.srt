14
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,420
(After five years)

15
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:54,400
I won't divorce my husband.

16
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,959
We just made a mistake.

17
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,519
We were drunk.

18
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,799
Can't you just forget it?

19
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:05,799
If you expose this,

20
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,359
how will it be beneficial to you?

21
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,240
Do you want

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,439
our reputations ruined?

23
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,560
You're crazy!

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,120
Cut.

25
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
Good take.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Let's eat.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,120
Okay, time to eat.

28
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,560
- Thank you, Director.
- Thank you, Director.

29
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,039
Thank you, Director.

30
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,479
Let's shoot this scene after eating.

31
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,319
Okay.

32
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:33,879
All right.

33
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,639
Let's do this scene after eating.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,639
- Jingjing, thank you.
- It's fine.

35
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,840
Thank you for today, Director.

36
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,479
So,

37
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,280
do you feel in character for this role?

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,879
It's all right.

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
The male lead just isn't as handsome
as my husband.

40
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,360
I don't feel quite immersed in it.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,039
Immersed?

42
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,560
For a drama about adultery,

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,639
you want to be immersed in it?

44
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,599
Do you dare

45
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,919
to tell your husband that?

46
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,439
He's so funny.

48
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,080
After confirming this film,

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,719
he didn't go to the base yet, right?

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
So he made time

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,199
to read the entire script.

52
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:15,960
Did Mr. Yu

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,080
provide any comments?

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,840
He provided a lot.

55
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,479
He said,

56
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,560
"Jingjing.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,319
Don't you have

58
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:21,960
experiential,

59
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,759
methodist,

60
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,800
and expressionist acting styles?

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,039
Which one do you belong to?"

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,159
He's quite professional.

63
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,120
Hey,

64
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Mr. Yu

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,479
has been on a business trip
for many months already, hasn't he?

66
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,520
It's quite a long time.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,879
It's really hard

68
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,719
to be the family

69
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,759
of aerospace workers.

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,400
It's all right.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
He's in the base,

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
so I can film in peace.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Filming will wrap up soon.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,759
If Mr. Yu

75
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,439
doesn't return from the base yet,

76
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,039
do you want to accept another film?

77
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
I read a nice script.

78
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,199
Take a look.

79
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,039
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,759
How old am I?

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,759
I can really answer that?

82
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,919
Tell me.

83
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,080
Thirty...

84
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,879
All right, stop.

85
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,000
Just say 30s.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,839
The details aren't important.

87
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,720
This is my question.

88
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,560
I

89
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
am in my 30s.

90
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,480
I've been married for five years.

91
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,839
Why are you letting me read

92
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,199
a script about a college girl?

93
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:25,959
No.

94
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,839
That's just the first few episodes.

95
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,000
You'll be working afterwards.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Then

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,399
she's just in her 20s.

98
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,959
And I've already filmed

99
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,120
this kind of drama about career.

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
It's not challenging.

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,040
Can't you accept

102
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
more challenging roles?

103
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,120
For example,

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
scientific researcher and the like.

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,439
Do

106
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,439
you

107
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,920
know yourself?

108
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,079
You don't look like a scientific
researcher at all.

109
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,720
Are you kidding me?

110
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,600
My husband...

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,399
Stop.

112
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,480
I know that your husband

113
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,360
is the youngest chief engineer

114
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,959
of the aerospace system.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
You don't need

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
to keep finding opportunities
to brag about that.

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,519
But that

118
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,879
has nothing to do with you

119
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,680
looking like
a scientific researcher at all.

120
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,800
It's useless even if you remain silent.

121
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,279
Do you think any investor

122
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,399
will ask you to portray that role?

123
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,800
Even if someone

124
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,360
asks you to do that,

125
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,399
that would also be because
of your popularity.

126
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,240
The script surely wouldn't be reliable.

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,079
We've been married for so long.

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,079
Why wasn't I influenced

129
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,879
by Mr. Yu's scientific
researcher aura at all?

130
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,120
Because we're always apart
from each other.

131
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,079
This won't do.

132
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,680
What if I don't accept any films

133
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,639
in the next half of the year?

134
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,759
You said this yourself.

135
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,839
Your family won't affect your career.

136
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,720
You'll accept
two film-shooting projects a year.

137
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,360
Am I right?

138
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,399
Then

139
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,079
let's check the script.

140
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,519
Don't accept it if it doesn't suit me.

141
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,000
Forget about this one.

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,839
Okay.

143
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,160
I'll check out others for you.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
In the next half of the year,

145
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,480
if you're not planning
on accepting any films,

146
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,000
do you and Mr. Yu

147
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,279
consider having a baby?

148
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
We're considering it.

149
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,879
He wants a daughter.

150
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,720
Really?

151
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,680
Hey.

152
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,319
I was just talking about you
with Ms. Ling.

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,399
What were you saying about me?

154
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,720
She said you want a daughter.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,560
I told her that when reading the script,
you asked me

156
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
why the supporting male lead

157
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,720
is set to be 25 years old.

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,519
Wait.

159
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,360
Mr. Yu.

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm sorry.

161
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,720
When I accept films for her
in the future,

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,439
I'll take note of that.

163
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,920
Don't worry.

164
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,800
I was just kidding around with Jingjing.

165
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
Mr. Yu.

166
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,839
Don't worry.

167
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,120
The supporting male lead isn't
as handsome as you.

168
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,879
But he's only 25.

169
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,480
Qiao Jingjing.

170
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,560
Okay, wait.

171
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,839
I was kidding.

172
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,120
Have you eaten?

173
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,319
Yes.

174
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,079
By the way,

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,319
at the canteen earlier,

176
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,600
something funny happened.

177
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
(Experimental Mission Special ID
Mission 08-05, Yu Tu)

178
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,839
I heard two girls in front of me

179
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,000
in the line

180
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,120
from another office

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,279
talking about me.

182
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:11,800
You have fans now?

183
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,959
Are you boasting in front of me?

184
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,920
Why would I boast to you

185
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
about having fans?

186
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,920
I heard a girl say

187
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,759
that she's disillusioned about me.

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,920
What did you do

189
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,680
to make her disillusioned?

190
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,079
This was what she said.

191
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
"Outside the conference room,

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,519
I ran into Mr. Yu.

193
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,079
I didn't expect

194
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,560
that someone so academic

195
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,639
would have a female celebrity

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,839
as his phone's home screen photo.

197
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,639
Good thing she doesn't interact much
with me.

198
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:35,759
Otherwise, she'll notice

199
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,600
that I change this female
celebrity's photo

200
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,680
once a week.

201
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,399
I think these two girls

202
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,319
were very serious

203
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,240
in their studies before.

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,040
They don't pay attention
to celebrity gossip at all.

205
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
What happened later?

206
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,319
Did you explain it to them?

207
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,839
I didn't want to bother.

208
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,279
However,

209
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:51,720
I thought

210
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,360
that my image couldn't be damaged.

211
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,439
After eating, I happened

212
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,439
to run into them by the door.

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,120
So, I told them,

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,639
"My phone's home screen photo

215
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,800
is my wife."

216
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:03,680
Mr. Yu.

217
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,120
Why are you so childish?

218
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,279
But I don't think

219
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,759
they believed me.

220
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,040
So,

221
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,279
do you want to help me prove it?

222
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,519
How do you want me to prove it?

223
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,439
Make a post on Weibo?

224
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,199
That's not necessary.

225
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,079
Perhaps

226
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,040
you can visit me at work

227
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,680
and watch the rocket launch.

228
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,279
Isn't filming wrapping up soon?

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,120
I...

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,040
I can really go there?

231
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,399
In the past few months,

232
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,440
the base has been holding

233
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,799
aerospace worker

234
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,639
family visitation activities.

235
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,480
I applied every time.

236
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,799
For the fifth time,

237
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,399
I finally won.

238
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
Can I go?

239
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,080
Can I visit you

240
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,960
at the launch center?

241
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:44,919
Mrs. Yu.

242
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,840
Welcome to the Haijiao Launch Center

243
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,240
to visit the 38-year-old me.

244
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:13,100
(China Aerospace)

245
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,527
(Yu Tu)

246
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
(I'm in Hainan already.)

247
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
(I just got off the plane.)

248
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,053
(Aerospace Workers
Family Visitation Group)

249
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,039
(I'm in Hainan already.)

250
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,840
(I'm sorry.)

251
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,720
(I arrived two days late)

252
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,559
(because of work.)

253
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,759
(It's not late.)

254
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,200
(My niece even called me this morning)

255
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,519
(to ask if I got your autograph yet.)

256
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,840
(But you missed)

257
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,519
(the rocket transport yesterday.)

258
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,519
(Too bad.)

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,840
(Hi, Ms. Qiao.)

260
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,480
(I'm Zhang)

261
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,559
(who's in charge of the family
visitation activity)

262
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,159
(this time.)

263
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,039
(You really don't need us)

264
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,279
(to pick you up at the airport?)

265
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,679
(There's no need.)

266
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,399
(Just please pick me up)

267
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,840
(at the gate of the base.)

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,120
Will Mr. Yu come out to pick you up

269
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,639
at the gate of the base later?

270
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,519
Forget it.

271
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:15,919
He hasn't even replied to
my messages yet.

272
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,240
I think his phone is not with him again.

273
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,440
Mr. Yu must be very busy

274
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
and nervous now.

275
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,240
After all, the entire nation

276
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,399
is following this.

277
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,120
By the way,

278
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,080
a while ago,

279
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,799
a marketing account mentioned

280
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,200
that the chief engineer
of Search for God

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,120
is your husband.

282
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,360
Why didn't I know that?

283
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,960
It was suppressed before it went viral.

284
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:34,759
You have no idea

285
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,200
how supportive your fans are.

286
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,360
They said that you two

287
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,720
have always kept it low-key.

288
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,480
They hope

289
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,639
that there won't be gossip
just to increase exposure

290
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,799
in such a crucial time.

291
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,600
Non-fans also scolded it.

292
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,399
Later on, this account

293
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,559
deleted the post.

294
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,759
They're very supportive indeed.

295
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,120
Did Mr. Yu reply to you?

296
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,320
(It's good that you arrived two days late.)

297
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:56,053
(It's boring here. It's like we're
just here to help with laundry.)

298
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,559
No.

299
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,879
A family member in the chat group

300
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,480
is the wife of Hu, Yu Tu's colleague.

301
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,440
I met her before.

302
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,879
She was speaking a bit strangely.

303
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,480
Could it be because

304
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,399
her husband is too busy

305
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,120
to spend time with her?

306
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,279
That's why she's mad?

307
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,000
I think you must be

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
prepared as well.

309
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,919
I don't think Mr. Yu has time

310
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,679
to spend with you either.

311
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,559
I came to watch the launch.

312
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,039
I'll just visit Mr. Yu at the same time.

313
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,320
Is he nicer to look at than the rocket?

314
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,200
Mr. Yu came out to pick you up.

315
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,080
Why are you here?

316
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
Aren't you busy today?

317
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I happened to have some time.

318
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,600
Xiao Zhu.

319
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,519
Thank you.

320
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,519
I am

321
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,120
Jingjing's road manager now.

322
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,159
It's part of my job.

323
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,279
And after a few days,

324
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,159
I'll be going to Sanya.

325
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,039
It's on the way.

326
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
Jingjing will be reimbursing me.

327
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
I must bring her here.

328
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:05,960
You speak

329
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,360
as if I didn't reimburse you before.

330
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,519
Long live, Jingjing!

331
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,600
May you two always be together.

332
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,039
Xiao Zhu, you're becoming
more and more lively.

333
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,919
I'll go ahead then.

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,679
Bye, go inside.

335
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,759
Here.

336
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,080
Take care.

337
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:18,080
Bye.

338
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,720
Ms. Qiao.

339
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm Zhang from the chat group.

340
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,600
I'm in charge

341
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,240
of the family visitation activities
this time.

342
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,120
Hello.

343
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,240
I need to check

344
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,399
your national ID.

345
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
And this is

346
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,279
the registration record of visitors.

347
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:35,879
I'll do it.

348
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,159
Here.

349
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,039
Thank you.

350
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,440
Since Mr. Yu came to pick you up,

351
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,799
I'll go ahead later.

352
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:48,759
Thank you.

353
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,519
Thank you for taking the trouble.

354
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,559
Ms. Qiao.

355
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,080
Actually, I've watched

356
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,200
your dramas

357
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,159
since I was a child.

358
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,840
Thank you.

359
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,200
Thank you

360
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,279
for your support since you were little.

361
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,600
No worry.

362
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,200
Okay.

363
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,679
I'll bring her to the hotel at the base.

364
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:06,240
Okay.

365
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,639
Zhang is so silly.

366
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,120
How can he find a girlfriend
in the future?

367
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,879
But someone so annoying like you

368
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:19,600
could even find one.

369
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I don't think it would be hard for him.

370
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,399
Girlfriend?

371
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,879
Are you looking down on me?

372
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:25,879
I have a wife already.

373
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,799
You're so outstanding.

374
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,559
Why did you get such a car

375
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,480
to pick me up?

376
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,000
I just borrowed what I could.

377
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,639
Come on.

378
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,759
Get in the car.

379
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:39,600
Okay.

380
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,840
This is for you to block the sun.

381
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,559
You must be the guy
with the strongest

382
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,360
learning ability in this world.

383
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,080
I have no choice.

384
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
Drive, my tour guide.

385
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,000
You're such

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,879
a bad tour guide.

387
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,120
You're not introducing the place to me.

388
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,000
The Haijiao Launch Center

389
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,960
is one of the four major launch centers
in our country.

390
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,399
It's also the only launch center
with a low latitude.

391
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,320
I've already read that online.

392
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,120
The canteen's food is very delicious.

393
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,600
What else?

394
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,679
This is

395
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,039
where I'll send Search for God to space.

396
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,559
From now on, this will be

397
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,919
my most favorite launch center.

398
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,159
Is that the service structure up ahead?

399
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,519
That's Long March 5's service structure.

400
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,840
What are those two

401
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,720
very high white structures over there?

402
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,360
One is the rocket assembly test plant.

403
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,039
The shorter one

404
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
is for satellite assembly.

405
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you work

406
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,919
in the satellite assembly plant?

407
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,440
Yes, until the satellite is transported

408
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,159
to the rocket assembly.

409
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,080
I know.

410
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,799
You keep

411
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:54,799
testing it.

412
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,840
You transport the rocket assembly

413
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,080
to the rocket fairing.

414
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,799
Am I right?

415
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,000
You must be the female actress

416
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,000
with the most knowledge of aerospace
in this world.

417
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,279
Thank you for the compliment.

418
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,720
My husband taught me.

419
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,960
Do you have security cameras here?

420
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,279
Why did you suddenly stop the car?

421
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,639
What are you doing?

422
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,399
You asked if there are security cameras.

423
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,240
Isn't this what you meant?

424
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,840
Maybe a little bit.

425
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,480
Why did you get that so quickly?

426
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,000
So do you have security cameras or not?

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
Of course we do.

428
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,360
This is a confidential unit.

429
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,279
It's a confidential unit anyway.

430
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,559
This is the room key.

431
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,879
This hotel is mainly

432
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,960
for staff.

433
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,399
There are limited rooms
with king-sized beds.

434
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,559
That was why

435
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,840
I gave it to my colleague.

436
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,320
Wait here and rest for a while.

437
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I have to attend a meeting.

438
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,360
At night,

439
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,559
I'll move the bed.

440
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,440
For what?

441
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,720
Won't that be too obvious?

442
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,119
There's housekeeping service here,
right?

443
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,400
If they come in tomorrow morning

444
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,480
and see two beds together,

445
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,519
that would be awkward.

446
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,960
Won't it be more awkward

447
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,359
if the beds aren't together?

448
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
It would be awkward for you.

449
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
It's all right for me.

450
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,680
Let's move it now then.

451
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,759
There's still time.

452
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
Don't.

453
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,200
Don't move it.

454
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm so slim.

455
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,000
One bed is enough.

456
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:32,920
Come.

457
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,119
I think this will do.

458
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Stand up.

459
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,200
Professor Zhao is inviting me
to a gathering.

460
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,400
Where?

461
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,519
She messaged me the address.

462
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,060
(China Aerospace)

463
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,160
Mr. Yu, you even personally
brought her here.

464
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,359
Come.

465
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,839
Let me introduce you.

466
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,720
This is Mr. Yu,

467
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
Office 158's Chief Engineer.

468
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
Hi, Mr. Yu.

469
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:06,480
I don't need

470
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,880
to introduce her, right?

471
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,119
She just arrived today.
They don't know her.

472
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,319
Jingjing.

473
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,440
This is Professor Zhao,

474
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,039
the wife of our model's chief scientist,

475
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:15,240
Mr. Xiao.

476
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,440
Hi, Professor Zhao.

477
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,519
We've messaged each other on WeChat.

478
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,279
I'll attend my meeting then.

479
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,160
Professor, I'll leave her to you.

480
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
Don't worry.

481
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,160
Go.

482
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,279
- Bye.
- Bye.

483
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,240
Come.

484
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,720
Come, have a seat.

485
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,000
We are

486
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,240
complete now.

487
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,640
Do you want

488
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,960
to introduce yourselves?

489
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll go first.

490
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,039
Mr. Yu.

491
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
What time is it already?

492
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,359
Why are you still eating bread here?

493
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,400
Leave the probe to us.

494
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,680
We're not that busy anymore.

495
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,960
I picked up my wife.

496
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,039
I haven't eaten yet.

497
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,960
The big shot celebrity is here.

498
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,440
My wife loves watching

499
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,640
your wife's dramas.

500
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,279
Is that so?

501
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,160
Come on.

502
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,799
Okay, let's go.

503
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,319
Most of the work at the launch area

504
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,160
is already done.

505
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,319
Let's have a special
coordination meeting today.

506
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,920
Regarding transport

507
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,920
the probe,

508
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,759
and the base, what else

509
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,799
do we need to coordinate?

510
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:17,240
Mr. Yu.

511
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,200
You go first.

512
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:20,960
Work at the launch area

513
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,559
is going very smoothly this time.

514
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:22,759
However,

515
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
there's something

516
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:24,839
that I want to discuss more

517
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,759
with transport.

518
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,119
This time,

519
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,319
our mission is deep space exploration.

520
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,039
The power supply's lifespan
is very crucial.

521
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,319
Now,

522
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,640
power is supplied

523
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
through the transport's umbilical cable.

524
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,680
Fifteen minutes before the launch,

525
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,920
we'll disconnect the cable
and switch to internal power.

526
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,799
Should we verify

527
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:40,960
the launch procedure

528
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,119
one more time?

529
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,519
Let's have another meeting tomorrow

530
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
specifically for the launch procedure.

531
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,240
We'll reconfirm the steps

532
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,039
when switching to internal power.

533
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,119
Regarding the probe's power supply,

534
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,720
Mr. Yu is really obsessed
with the details.

535
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,799
Don't we want

536
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,880
to go farther?

537
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,240
On land,

538
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,759
let's just take the landlord's surplus.

539
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,200
All right.

540
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:02,240
Base personnel

541
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
will join that meeting too.

542
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:05,200
Let's tabularize

543
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
the pre-launch procedures

544
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:08,039
and get three parties' confirmation
and signature

545
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,160
to ensure that nothing is missed.

546
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
Our plan

547
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,759
is to launch at 7:10 pm

548
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:12,920
on the 27th.

549
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,240
Meteorological Bureau,

550
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:15,839
please report to us

551
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,200
the weather conditions
during that period.

552
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,240
Based on the analysis of the
Meteorological Bureau's headquarters,

553
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,119
on the 27th,

554
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
during the launch window

555
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,200
between 7:10 pm to 7:30 pm,

556
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
(Visibility)
visibility will be greater than 20km.

557
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:26,960
The ground temperature will be
29 degrees Celsius.

558
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
(Ground Temperature, Humidity)
The humidity will be 39 percent.

559
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,799
(Wind Speed)
Wind speed will be 2 meters per second.

560
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,039
Total cloud cover will be less than
20 percent.

561
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,079
Within the 40km range

562
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,400
of the launch area,

563
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,720
ten hours before the launch

564
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,720
and one hour after the launch,

565
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,680
there won't be any thunderstorms

566
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,599
or precipitation.

567
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,000
The weather conditions are good.

568
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,319
They satisfy the launch conditions.

569
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,200
How many meetings have you had?

570
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,079
It's so late already.

571
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,880
There weren't that many meetings,

572
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,079
but they lasted quite long.

573
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,440
It's reversed.

574
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,640
I'll do it myself.

575
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't become a hindrance instead.

576
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,240
Come on.

577
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,440
What did you do in the afternoon?

578
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,759
Did you just stay
in the Long March Station?

579
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,519
They showed me

580
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,279
around the base,

581
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,160
like where to eat,

582
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,599
where to launder the clothes, etc.

583
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Look at you.

584
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,000
You didn't do your job.

585
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,119
At this phase,

586
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,599
the workload

587
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,279
on the probe's side

588
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,839
is actually a lot less already.

589
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,480
However,

590
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,559
there are still

591
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:09,799
many review work and meetings.

592
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:11,680
To be honest,

593
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,359
I still don't feel at ease until now.

594
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm afraid of not handling
an aspect well.

595
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,079
I keep tracking each segment.

596
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,200
Jingjing.

597
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,960
I can't spend much time with you.

598
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,400
I was kidding.

599
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,720
I don't need you to spend time with me.

600
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,880
I've been exhausted from filming daily.

601
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,519
I'm planning to catch up

602
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,720
on my sleep in the next few days.

603
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:36,319
Then I'll travel around

604
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,440
with Professor Zhao

605
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,680
and the others.

606
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
They're bored here anyway.

607
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,240
And I haven't travelled to Hainan

608
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,720
for many years already.

609
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,680
Look at you.

610
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,319
Once you arrived,

611
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,640
you become the tour group's leader.

612
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,920
Of course.

613
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,640
My husband is the chief engineer.

614
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,599
I must do my part.

615
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,119
Ms. Qiao.

616
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,799
You're taking us out?

617
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,640
Yes.

618
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,480
It's so boring to stay in the base.

619
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,799
Hainan is so beautiful.

620
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,160
We must walk around.

621
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,759
And perhaps

622
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,680
the Wenchang chicken outside

623
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,599
might taste different

624
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,680
from the ones in the canteen.

625
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,319
Right, good idea.

626
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:20,400
During this period of time,
my wife

627
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,000
is so busy that I don't see her at all.

628
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
There's really nothing

629
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,319
for us to do at the base.

630
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,119
My husband is the same.

631
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,920
He's as busy as a bee.

632
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,480
Why didn't it occur to us

633
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,119
to go outside before?

634
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:30,920
Right.

635
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,960
Yes.

636
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,599
If you don't have

637
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,920
any objections,

638
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,279
let's have fun starting today.

639
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,039
Sure.

640
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't think we can do it today.

641
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,119
We need to contact our rides and stuff.

642
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,759
Actually, I've already contacted

643
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,039
the tour guide and travel agency.

644
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,440
I was just waiting for you guys
to say yes.

645
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,680
Ms. Qiao.

646
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,200
You're making it so formal?

647
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,240
You even got a tour guide.

648
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,000
Am I right?

649
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Of course.

650
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,880
I'll be

651
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,079
the tour group's leader then.

652
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,119
Thank you for the taking the trouble.

653
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:53,960
It's no trouble.

654
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,160
I want to have fun too.

655
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:56,920
Besides, my husband

656
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,240
doesn't have time for me.

657
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,039
Later on,

658
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,119
we must split

659
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:02,960
the costs.

660
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,839
- Right.
- Yes.

661
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:04,799
There's not much cost.

662
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,279
Don't worry about that.

663
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,000
This travel agency

664
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,039
works with us.

665
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:09,799
I can just make a post on Weibo.

666
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,799
That's so nice.

667
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,839
Let's take more photos.

668
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,599
Yes.

669
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,279
Right.

670
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,279
You can take photos

671
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,759
as mementos.

672
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:18,079
Yes.

673
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,200
Go ahead. I'm not joining.

674
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,400
Why?

675
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
What's the matter?

676
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,079
Come on.

677
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,000
I already gave

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
the agency our headcount.

679
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,319
It will be embarrassing for me

680
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:35,720
if one of you is missing.

681
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,079
Just think that you're accompanying me.

682
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,559
Come on.

683
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,240
Let's go.

684
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:42,119
Come on.

685
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,480
- Go.
- Let's go together.

686
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,200
Come on.

687
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,759
Li.

688
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,440
Let's go.

689
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,200
This is great.

690
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,240
Let's have fun then.

691
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,160
Come on.

692
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,240
This is great!

693
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,960
Our main work

694
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,359
is to check the probe's
power-on self test.

695
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,720
Nothing is too trivial.

696
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,319
Let's go through every detail.

697
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,799
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

698
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:15,759
Okay, come on.

699
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,119
I'll take a photo for you.

700
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,640
Make us look nicer.

701
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,519
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

702
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,279
Mr. Yu.

703
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,720
Come here.

704
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,240
Sit here.

705
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,759
We're all eating noodles?

706
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:34,680
What are you eating? Noodles?

707
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,440
Mr. Zhang.

708
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,799
You're here for noodles again?

709
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:41,039
This chef's noodles are amazing.

710
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,160
If I don't eat them for three days,

711
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,119
I crave for them.

712
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,319
Every time I come to the base,

713
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,160
I always gain

714
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,640
a few pounds.

715
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,880
Mr. Yu.

716
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,799
You eat

717
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,640
so voraciously.

718
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,240
Doesn't

719
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,119
your wife mind?

720
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:04,440
Who says that I eat voraciously?

721
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,640
I have a meeting later.

722
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,279
I have to eat faster.

723
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:07,200
My wife

724
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,039
doesn't mind at all.

725
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,160
She doesn't eat much.

726
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,920
When I eat fast,

727
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,759
it makes her crave food less.

728
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,839
Mr. Yu's marriage

729
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,920
is a legend

730
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,279
in the aerospace system.

731
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,599
He married a big shot celebrity.

732
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:20,839
Mr. Yu.

733
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,720
How did you pursue her

734
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,839
back then?

735
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,119
She was my senior high classmate.

736
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,000
We met again ten years after graduation.

737
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,200
We were both single,

738
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,079
so we just made do with each other.

739
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,839
You all understood that, right?

740
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,559
Those doing system design

741
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,000
must be good at bluffing.

742
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,799
That's a false accusation.

743
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,640
That was the standard answer

744
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,480
my wife told my colleagues
a few years ago.

745
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,000
I just memorized it.

746
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,359
Mr. Yu's wife

747
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,960
is quite nice.

748
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,880
She's just a bit mischievous.

749
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,799
Since she arrived,

750
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,160
my wife Professor Zhao

751
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,319
never complains about
being bored anymore.

752
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,319
She's always out there

753
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,839
having fun.

754
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,000
But when she returns at night,

755
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,759
she'd want me

756
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,359
to look at the photos with her.

757
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,279
Speaking of photos,

758
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,160
I have a minor comment.

759
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:09,799
Should we

760
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,799
inform Ms. Qiao?

761
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,519
For example,

762
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,200
in the same place,

763
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,519
why must she take ten consecutive photos

764
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:19,519
for my wife?

765
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,079
I...

766
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:21,960
I can't see clearly.

767
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,680
I really can't tell

768
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,880
which one looks better.

769
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,400
Am I right?

770
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,559
I mean, ten photos.

771
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,279
Speaking of which,

772
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,519
Mr. Yu,

773
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
I have a minor comment too.

774
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,960
Whenever I go home before,

775
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,680
my wife cooks soup for me

776
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,359
using the rice cooker.

777
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
Once your wife arrived,

778
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
she only brought supper

779
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
from outside.

780
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,440
Now,

781
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,920
she doesn't even bother anymore.

782
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,960
She said that Mr. Yu's wife is so thin.

783
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,319
She's frustrated.

784
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,160
She wants to go on a diet.

785
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,960
In the future,

786
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
she won't make supper anymore.

787
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:51,559
Your wife

788
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:53,240
even made supper for you daily?

789
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,039
Of course.

790
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,880
Before your wife came,

791
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,160
the last one

792
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,319
was braised pork knuckles.

793
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,400
That's so nice, Mr. Zhang.

794
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,480
After my wife and I

795
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,079
got together,

796
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,039
I never eat supper anymore.

797
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,880
Then I'm luckier than you.

798
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
You can't say that.

799
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:11,880
My wife

800
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,160
has a lot of good points.

801
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,359
She's very likable.

802
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,279
Listen to him.

803
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,079
However,

804
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,079
I'll inform her immediately

805
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,400
about your comments.

806
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,160
Here.

807
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,839
Thank you.

808
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,599
This one's nice.

809
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,039
This one looks really delicious.

810
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,440
This is a local speciality.

811
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,200
Wenchang chicken.

812
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,039
Try it.

813
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:37,119
Come on.

814
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:37,920
It's quite good.

815
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,599
(Where are you?)

816
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:43,880
(Aerospace Fisherman's Wharf)

817
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,067
(Yu Tu)

818
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,920
This is quite fun.

819
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,680
The shrimp is nice.

820
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:51,680
Hey.

821
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,680
Why did you go so far away?

822
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,839
There's something

823
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,920
that I must seriously discuss with you.

824
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,160
My colleague is complaining

825
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,799
that you lured his family away.

826
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,240
Is that true?

827
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:04,480
No way.

828
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,960
Are you sure that he wasn't
complimenting me?

829
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:07,559
It wasn't a compliment.

830
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,960
It was a complaint.

831
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,200
That's impossible.

832
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,799
Who is that insensible person?

833
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,359
Only if we're having fun

834
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,359
can you

835
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,559
work without any worries.

836
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,039
Am I right?

837
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:17,960
Otherwise, you'll surely worry

838
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
that you have no time to spend with us.

839
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
You'd feel so stressed.

840
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,200
I'm working so hard

841
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,799
to take everyone out to have fun,

842
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,279
and someone's complaining?

843
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:24,720
This won't do.

844
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,200
Let's put each other on speaker.

845
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,480
She has something to tell you.

846
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,880
Here.

847
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,720
My friends

848
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,680
in the tour group.

849
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,920
A mysterious family member

850
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,559
is complaining

851
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,599
that I've lured you away.

852
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,039
Come on.

853
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:36,720
Let's hear

854
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,559
whose family that person is from.

855
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,839
That's not true.

856
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,440
Jingjing

857
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,559
is taking such good care of us.

858
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,319
You're all busy with work,

859
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,440
and we have nothing to do.

860
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,000
Good thing Jingjing

861
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,039
is bringing us around.

862
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,680
Yes.

863
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,240
That's right.

864
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,960
We've been so happy

865
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,599
in the past couple of days, am I right?

866
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,240
Otherwise,

867
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,559
we'd just watch television
at the hotel daily.

868
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,200
Right.

869
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,319
I'm sure it's not my wife.

870
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,200
My wife

871
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,559
just wired 2,000 Yuan to me yesterday

872
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,759
to buy everyone a meal.

873
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,079
All right.

874
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,480
No one is complaining anymore.

875
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,519
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

876
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,680
Enjoy.

877
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
Okay, I got it.

878
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,000
You...

879
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,160
You're welcome.

880
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,519
You don't need to thank me.

881
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,160
This married couple

882
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,640
is mischievous fellows.

883
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,240
That's how they call them
in Shanghainese, mischievous fellows.

884
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,200
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

885
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,559
You're exhausted?

886
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,240
We walked quite a lot today.

887
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,160
I'll do it.

888
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,799
Where are you going tomorrow?

889
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,039
We won't go out tomorrow.

890
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,839
The launch will be the day after tomorrow,
the 27th.

891
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,720
We're staying at the base
in the next couple of days

892
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,039
to give you our love.

893
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,119
Then I can provide

894
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,160
an explanation to my colleagues.

895
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,799
Okay, they're not sore anymore.

896
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,079
Get some rest.

897
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Do you feel nervous?

898
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,599
Yes.

899
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,000
The nation invested billions.

900
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,119
Over 10,000 people invested

901
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,039
ten years of their youth.

902
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:18,839
You'll surely succeed.

903
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Jingjing.

904
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:28,079
After the launch on the 27th,

905
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,119
early morning on the 28th,

906
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,440
I need to fly

907
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,000
to the Aerospace Control Center in Beijing.

908
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,720
That will take a few months again.

909
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,759
I know.

910
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,960
It's not your first time at the base.

911
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,039
I've prepared myself already.

912
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,279
That's why I was thinking

913
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,400
if I should go to Beijing

914
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,079
to spend time with you.

915
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,480
Yes.

916
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,400
All right then.

917
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,279
Since you

918
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,839
want it so much,

919
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:58,319
I'll fulfill your wish

920
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,240
and agree.

921
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,319
I have a lot of work

922
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,160
in Beijing too.

923
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:08,599
By the way, Yu Tu,

924
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,759
I want to ask you something.

925
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,559
What is it?

926
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,400
In the past few days,

927
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,599
everyone's been having fun.

928
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,799
(Only Li)

929
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,680
(seemed unhappy.)

930
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,880
(I don't know
what's the matter with her.)

931
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:21,839
(Did something happen)

932
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:23,279
(between her and Hu?)

933
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
(Li got sick)

934
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,640
(and hospitalized last month.)

935
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,559
(Hu wasn't able to go home.)

936
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,160
We were

937
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,720
so busy during those days.

938
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,799
What should I do then?

939
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,279
But it seems like nothing I say

940
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,680
would be appropriate.

941
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,640
There's no need.

942
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,880
It's hard to be the family

943
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,160
of an aerospace worker indeed.

944
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,240
If Li thinks

945
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,160
that it takes too much sacrifice
to be with Hu,

946
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,480
