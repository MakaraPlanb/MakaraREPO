Here used to

16
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,680
have your photos all the time.

17
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,199
What competitions you entered,

18
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,680
what awards you got etc.

19
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,199
Do you still remember

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
what I said to you

21
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,360
at Ms. Ling's house?

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:17,639
I said,

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,080
you'll be

24
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,560
an amazing aerospace engineer
in the future.

25
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:21,919
When that happens,

26
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:23,080
as your classmate,

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,319
I will feel very proud.

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,919
I remember.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,599
But actually, it's not like that.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,639
It's not as your classmate.

31
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,080
Then, what is it?

32
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:40,759
Actually...

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,199
ever since last time,

34
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:42,800
I have

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
some weird imaginations.

36
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,879
I'll tell you, but don't laugh at me.

37
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,240
I imagined that after a long time,

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
during the school festival,

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
you'll get invited back to school

40
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,960
as a very reputable

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,439
aerospace engineer.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,159
And then...

43
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,479
I'll be by your side.

44
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,319
So Mr. Yu,

45
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,400
you have to work hard.

46
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,120
I have high expectations of you.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,240
Jingjing.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,199
I feel that sometimes

49
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,439
you're a bit blind when it comes to me.

50
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,360
Back in high school,

51
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,960
I used to think that
I was very smart too.

52
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,680
Only when I went out, I realized that

53
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,280
it's a vast world out there

54
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,800
and how insignificant I am.

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,199
I wasn't as much of a genius

56
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:43,960
as I thought I was.

57
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:45,879
My IQ is also far from

58
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,599
being in the first tier.

59
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:46,960
The...

60
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,000
The first tier you mean is...

61
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,120

64
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,039
It's okay. You can continue.

65
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,719
But I'll work hard.

66
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:11,479
I think I can.

67
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,959
I realized you might gravitate
towards BDS.

68
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,839
What's BDS?

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,439
Baidu-search it yourself.

70
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,560

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,279

103
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,480
a secret from my parents
for the time being,

104
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,160
are you okay with that?

105
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,560
Otherwise, it's pretty troublesome

106
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,319
to keep getting asked about it.

107
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,120
How long

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
is 'for the time being'?

109
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,920
Until someone spills it?

110
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,079
I think this way

111
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,360
they might get surprised.

112
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,839
Our parents might not think the same...

113
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,079
When I send you back
to Shanghai tomorrow,

114
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,399
what identity should I adopt then?

115
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,560
Ex-classmate.

116
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,040
Would your parents believe it?

117
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,439
But if you just appear plainly

118
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,399
out of no where,

119
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,759
they'll definitely suspect something.

120
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:00,680
Then,

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,000
let me make up a story first.

122
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,399
Let me think.

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll say that...

124
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,079
I'll say that the driver can't come
tomorrow,

125
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,759
so I'll

126
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:15,959
drive back to Shanghai myself.

127
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
You have a driver's license?

128
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,199
Of course, I have.

129
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,360
I know how to drive.

130
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,199
Don't interrupt me.

131
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,040
Nonetheless, my parents

132
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,959
will definitely object

133
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,519
to the idea of me driving back
to Shanghai on my own.

134
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,600
And then, just so happens,

135
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,680
I come across a message
in our high school chatroom

136
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
that someone is going back
to Shanghai

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,279
and can bring me along.

138
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,519
After laying out the backstories,

139
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:39,920
my parents

140
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,160
definitely won't suspect
anything anymore.

141
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,560
What do you think?

142
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,160
What's that face?

143
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,560
Nothing.

144
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,519
I just suddenly remembered
about the time

145
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,519
you tricked me into
repairing the purifier.

146
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,680
Not only

147
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,839
is our Ms. Qiao an actor,

148
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,560
you even know

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,680
how to make up stories on the spot.

150
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:02,839
As someone

151
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,399
who will be spending

152
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,560
the longest time with you
for the rest of your life,

153
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,120
I think

154
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,399
I need to prepare myself mentally.

155
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,800
You look very reluctant.

156
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,879
Why would I?

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Then, I need to work hard.

158
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,399
Can't have you get ready for nothing.

159
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,519
Don't work too hard.

160
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,079
Are you getting scared?

161
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,120
Not to that extent.

162
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,800
You give it a try.

163
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,320
Hello!

164
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,879

167
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,200
and he's still not back home yet.

168
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,720
(Have you sent Peipei back home?)

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,759
(Are you home yet?)

170
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,440

175
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,799

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,799
(Your class had)

177
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,120
(such a good-looking classmate etc.)

178
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,799

181
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,879
(How about Yu Tu?)

182
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,159
(Yu Tu is not back yet?)

183
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,320
(That can't be.)

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,399
(From my house to his,)

185
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,039
(it should only take the cab)

186
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,000
(a few minutes.)

187
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,879
(Let me ask him.)

188
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,780
(WeChat: One unread message.)

189
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,039
(I'll call you in a short while.)

190
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,919
(I'm reporting to my mom now.)

191
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,039
Reporting?

192
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,440
(Okay.)

193
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:51,399
(I'm done reporting.)

194
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,907
(Yu Tu)

195
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,600
(Jingjing.)

196
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,840
(Are you asleep?)

197
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,000
(Goodnight.)

198
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,960
(Good morning.)

199
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,020
(Yu Tu)

200
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,519
You woke me up.

201
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,039
You haven't got up yet?

202
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,559
Back then, I'd be at your house at 9 AM.

203
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,320
It's Lunar New Year.

204
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,519
Can't I just sleep in a while longer?

205
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:03,720
My bad.

206
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
I know it now.

207
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,919
What did you mean when you said that

208
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,039
you were reporting to your mom
last night?

209
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,559
It was just my mom asking me

210
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
why am I going to Shanghai
on the first day of Lunar New Year,

211
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
and who I met last night.

212
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,240
But...

213
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Someone decided to keep this
from our parents.

214
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,720
So, I could only say that

215
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,279
it was a pretty girl.

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,279
And I didn't get the girl.

217
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,120
You seemed to have built

218
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,600
a rather bad image of me.

219
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:34,919
Like someone

220
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,720
who neither approves nor rejects.

221
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,679
Your mom would definitely

222
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,399
have a bad impression of me.

223
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,200
I didn't consider things thoroughly.

224
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,639
How about this?

225
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,000
Next time, we can tell her that

226
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,120
I didn't get the girl whom I met
last night

227
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,080
and on the first day of New Year.

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,279
Ms. Qiao

229
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,480
is my new love interest.

230
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,399
That'll only make me look bad.

231
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,919
I'm joking.

232
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:00,840
Don't worry about this.

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,519
I'm not worried.

234
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,519
Elderlies like me.

235
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,279
She'll like me when she sees me.

236
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,639
Are you still sleepy?

237
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,200
Do you want to continue your sleep?

238
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,799
Later, I'll need to

239
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,039
go downstairs to clear the snow.

240
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,919
Clear the snow?

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,759
Yeah.

242
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,840
Our area is a bit older.

243
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,360
It's not under any property management.

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,720
I'll just clear a bit
from the road outside

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
so that it's easier to walk.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,039
Okay then.

247
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,720
I'll sleep a bit more.

248
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,440
Why did you sigh all of a sudden?

249
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,559
Nothing.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I was just thinking about

251
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,840
when I can go to your place
and clear the snow there.

252
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,000
I want to sleep now.

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,159
Don't wake me up.

254
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,879
I'm hanging up now.

255
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,360
Dad! Mom!

256
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,240
Until what time did they play mahjong
last night

257
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,159
that they're still sleeping now?

258
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
My memory is so good.

259
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,600
Hello, there.

260
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,639
I'd like to ask for direction.

261
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
I heard that there is

262
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,679
a very delicious beancurd shop
in Yixing.

263
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,120
I don't know the way.

264
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,559
I'm hungry.

265
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
Hey, I'm only asking for direction.

266
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,039
Isn't it a bit inappropriate
to hug me like this?

267
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,320
Didn't you say you were going to
continue your sleep?

268
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,279
You're the one who woke me up.

269
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,360
I woke up

270
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,720
and saw that my parents were
still in bed.

271
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm starving.

272
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,519
Poor thing.

273
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,120
Why aren't you asking me

274
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,519
how did I know that you lived here?

275
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,960
Let's go.

276
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll bring you to get breakfast.

277
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,240
Yu Tu!

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,519
Your grandaunt called to say that

279
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:56,840
she'll be coming over later
to have a meal.

280
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,559
You go...

281
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,000
Your mom...

282
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,640
Oh, no.

283
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,119
We're caught.

284
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,000
Yu Tu...

285
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,319
This... This is...

286
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,319
Mom.

287
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,039
This is my...

288
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,119
Happy Lunar New Year.

289
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,759
I am Yu Tu's girlfriend.

290
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,799
My name is Qiao Jingjing.

291
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,000
Girlfriend?

292
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,440
Qiao Jingjing.

293
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,839
The story's like this.

294
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,680
Yu Tu and I

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,960
have been in a relationship
for a very long time.

296
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
But he always refused

297
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,319
to bring me to see you.

298
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,279
So, I have no choice

299
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,519
but to come myself.

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,720
Yes.

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,160
It was me.

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,640
I feel that...

303
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,559
I feel that...

304
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,599
He feels that...

305
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,880
You might not like me.

306
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,359
Who said that?

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,279
Yu Tu!

308
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,599
What kind of nonsense is that?

309
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,920
Jingjing.

310
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
How can we

311
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
not like you?

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,559
I've never said anything like this.

313
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,240
He never mentioned anything to me.

314
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,799
Mom...

315
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,000
So, he has never even mentioned me
to you before...

316
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,960
No... That's not it...

317
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
He hinted me before.

318
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,799
I was the one who didn't get the hint.

319
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:16,759
I must have said something

320
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,319
that made him misunderstood me.

321
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,359
It's just a misunderstanding.

322
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Jingjing.

323
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,559
I really like you.

324
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:24,880
I've never missed an episode

325
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,440
of the dramas that you're in.

326
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:27,720
I know

327
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,359
you two were classmates in high school.

328
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,240
But I never thought you two would...

329
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,000
Uhm...

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,839
Let's not just stand here.

331
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,880
Let's go into the house.
Go in and chat.

332
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,240
Let me take a call.

333
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,599
Hello.

334
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,440
You guys are here?

335
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,839
Yes. Yes.

336
00:18:44,839 --> 00:18:45,640
It's the junction in front.

337
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
It's right after
you turn in the junction.

338
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,440
Yes. Yes.

339
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,880
Okay. See you in a while.

340
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,359
Mom.

341
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,400
We would like to

342
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,359
keep it low for now.

343
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,119
Jingjing hasn't had her breakfast yet.

344
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,319
I'll take her out for breakfast.

345
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,079
Okay. Okay.

346
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,079
Happy Lunar New Year!

347
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,720
Eat more!

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,599
I'll keep the secret for you two!

349
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,079
It tastes so good!

350
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,580
(Mom)

351
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:28,319
Yu Tu.

352
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,319
Mom.

353
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:30,839
Your grandaunt

354
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,400
wants to hang out at our place
until afternoon.

355
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,440
Why don't we ask Jingjing
to come tonight?

356
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Tell me.

357
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,920
Is Qiao Jingjing

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,319
really your girlfriend?

359
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,359
Mom.

360
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,440
Didn't you see everything already?

361
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,119
I just want to confirm it again.

362
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's see when she is free

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,319
to come to our house.

364
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,039
Ask her

365
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,160
whether she's free tomorrow at noon.

366
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,279
We'll treat her to a meal.

367
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,200
Mom, the thing is

368
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,240
she has to rush back to Shanghai
this afternoon

369
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,279
and back to her drama shoot

370
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,359
tomorrow morning.

371
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,000
How about this?

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,359
Wait till when she comes back
for her holiday next time.

373
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:05,640
I see.

374
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,839
What a shame.

375
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,319
It's all your fault.

376
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,599
Not only did you not tell us

377
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,759
that you have a girlfriend,

378
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,039
you even talked nonsense

379
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,079
in front of her,

380
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,720
ruining your parents' image.

381
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,079
Are your dad and I that kind of people?

382
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,519
I haven't even told your dad yet.

383
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,839
You just wait until he finds out
about this.

384
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,480
Mom.

385
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
I was wrong.

386
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,000
I know.

387
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,319
You must tell her that

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,079
you were the one

389
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,240
who was imagining things all this time.

390
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,640
It has nothing to do with us.

391
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,799
We would always

392
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,680
welcome her to our house
with open hands.

393
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
We all like her

394
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,519
very much.

395
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:36,839
Mom.

396
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,400
She already knows.

397
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,440
Sure.

398
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,759
You two enjoy yourselves.

399
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,160
Mom, I'll hang up now.

400
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:42,880
Okay. Okay.

401
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I feel that

402
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,079
my parents

403
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,759
wouldn't like you?

404
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,920
This way, your mom

405
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,079
wouldn't have a problem with me.

406
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,039
Who asked you to

407
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,640
create a negative image for me
before this?

408
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:02,920
Not bad.

409
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,680
It's a pretty good idea.

410
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,039
Right?

411
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,160
Was I quick with my response?

412
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,319
Yes.

413
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,200
I need to learn from you.

414
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,599
It's the EQ that I've trained up

415
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,000
after all these years of

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,519
variety shows and interviews.

417
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,039
Where should

418
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:19,960
we go after this?

419
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,559
Let's go to Hufu.

420
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,720
I only covered half of the place
the other day.

421
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,480
Are we going to ride a boat?

422
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,839
You'll be steering it?

423
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:34,880
Do you know how to steer it?

424
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,039
Then...

425
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,559
Do you really know how to steer?

426
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:41,680
Yes.

427
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:50,519
Come.

428
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,079
Put on the life vest.

429
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,480
I don't really trust you.

430
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,240
You have no choice but to trust me.

431
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,880
You're already on my boat now.

432
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,079
Hurry and put it on too.

433
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,960
Are you ready to go?

434
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,119
You really know how to steer!

435
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,839
This is amazing!

436
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:00,039
The one in front!

437
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:00,880
Go there!

438
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,400
Why did you stop?

439
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,519
I can't go any further.

440
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,920
Let's fuel up.

Later in the afternoon,

460
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,720
let's stick to what we've planned before

461
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,759
and say that I, your ex-classmate
in high school,

462
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,960
am here to pick you up. Am I right?

463
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Yup.

464
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:49,920
Once I'm done with my act,

465
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,839
I'll let you know.

466
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,119
Sure. I'll wait for your contact.

467
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:55,599
I'll get going then.

468
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,480
Here.

469
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,799
Old man.

470
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,359
Eat more.

471
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,039
Okay.

472
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,960
Eat more.

473
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,880
Dad, Mom.

474
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:31,799
Once I'm done eating,

475
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,119
I'll need to get back to Shanghai.

476
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,559
What's the rush?

477
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,160
That's good too.

478
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,079
It gets dark earlier in winter.

479
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,319
Plus, it's snowing outside.

480
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,039
It's safer to go back earlier.

481
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,920
When is your driver coming?

482
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,599
He can't come today.

483
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,839
I'll be driving back myself.

484
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,160
What?

485
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
- You can't!
- You can't!

486
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
Why can't I?

487
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,799
Although I don't drive a lot,

488
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,119
my skill is not bad.

489
00:25:59,359 --> 00:25:59,960
I even drove out

490
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,279
to hang out with Peipei today, didn't I?

491
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,599
I haven't told you off about that yet,

492
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,200
and you dare to bring it up yourself.

493
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,279
Tell me.

494
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,680
How many times do you even drive
in a year?

495
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,759
Plus, that's in the city.

496
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,039
There's no snow on the road.

497
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,680
Who knows what can happen

498
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,000
when you drive long-distance.

499
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
No way. You can't.

500
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:16,880
That driver of yours...

501
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,079
Why is he not here?

502
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,920
His plane ticket was canceled

503
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,200
and he couldn't get any tickets
last minute.

504
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,559
You...

505
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,279
How about this?

506
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,519
Get her cousin brother to send her back.

507
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,359
If he can't, I'll send you.

508
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,240
Either way,

509
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,599
you can't drive back yourself.

510
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,759
That's so troublesome.

511
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,079
I can drive back on my own.

512
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,200
No means no.

513
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,559
There's no room for discussion
about this.

514
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:39,200
Exactly.

515
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,319
You don't have to worry

516
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,559
or trouble my cousin brother anymore.

517
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Just so happens, my ex-classmate

518
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,200
sent a message in the chatroom,

519
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,480
saying he'll be going back
to Shanghai today.

520
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,960
Plus, he's been driving for a long time.

521
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,039
Really?

522
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,759
Coming!

523
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,880
What a cold day today.

524
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:38,400
Coming.

525
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,000
Good afternoon.

526
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,839
Good afternoon.

527
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,079
You are Jingjing's ex-classmate.

528
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200
Hurry.

529
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,799
Come in and have some water.

530
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,960
She's almost done.

531
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,839
Mom!

532
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,759
There's no need to drink.

533
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,640
Hurry!

534
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,720
We'll go now.

535
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Hurry up.

536
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:56,960
This kid...

537
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,039
How can you be so thoughtless?

538
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,319
It's so cold today.

539
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,599
You can go after having something warm.

540
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,680
Exactly.

541
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,519
It won't hold you guys up for too long.

542
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,480
Come. Have a seat inside.

543
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,400
Yes.

544
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,039
Mr. and Mrs. Qiao.

545
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,160
It's okay.

546
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:08,920
There will probably be

547
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
more chances in the future.

548
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,640
Hurry, let's go.

549
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,000
Actually, I'm Jingjing's boyfriend.

550
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,319
We've been in a relationship
for a long time.

551
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,160
But she always refused

552
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
to bring me to see you

553
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
and told me to say that

554
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:22,440
we're just ex-classmates.

555
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,960
