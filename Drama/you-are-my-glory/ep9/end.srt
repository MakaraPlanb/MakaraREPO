=Episode 9=

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,519
Let's order more dishes.

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,360
If we can't finish them,

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,519
just pack some for So Panicky.

17
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,360
I want to try

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,239
some of the dishes.

19
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:55,959
Jingjing.

20
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,440
I need your help.

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,360
For what?

22
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,559
I bumped into

23
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,720
my professor and his wife.

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,319
They are waiting at the entrance

25
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,559
and there are

26
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,839
more than ten customers ahead of them.

27
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,559
So,

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,360
can we

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,559
let them take this room?

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,600
I'll bring you to somewhere else.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,960
I don't mind

32
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,679
but why can't we

33
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,759
invite them over?

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't mind?

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,320
Why would I?

36
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,880
I'll bring them over.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,240
Here, sir, madam.

38
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello.

39
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,119
This is my high school classmate,

40
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:45,960
Qiao Jingjing.

41
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:46,839
Jingjing,

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,679
this is my professor, Mr. Zhang,

43
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,160
and his wife, Mrs. Wang.

44
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,399
Hi, Mr. Zhang.

45
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,119
Hi, Mrs. Wang.

46
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,199
Hello.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Hello.

48
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,960
Come, have a seat.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,639
Here.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,119
You can put this here.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,360
Have a seat.

52
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
Okay.

53
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,000
Yu,

54
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,679
when did you find

55
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,600
such a beautiful

56
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
high school friend?

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,479
I feel like

58
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,559
I've seen you somewhere.

59
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:24,199
Is today your birthday, Mrs. Wang?

60
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,240
No.

61
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Today is actually

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,880
our

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
wedding anniversary.

64
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,080
We will have dinner here

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,320
every year to celebrate it.

66
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,479
We actually

67
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,880
booked a table

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,399
but for some reason,

69
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,279
they couldn't

70
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:40,520
find

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,479
the record.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
They must have a lot of customers.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Mr. Zhang,

74
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,479
if today is your

75
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,360
wedding anniversary,

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
then we...

77
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,960
It's no bother!

78
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,839
You know very well that

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
both of us

80
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,199
like companies.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
Having a meal

82
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,720
with you two,

83
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,000
one of which is a pretty girl,

84
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,639
it can't possibly be better
than this, can it?

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,759
Okay.

86
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll order food then.

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,880
No need.

88
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,679
We are its patrons for several decades.

89
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,920
I know very well which dish is the best.

90
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:19,959
Just enjoy

91
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,160
the free meal today.

92
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,000
You take their room first.

93
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,760
Excuse me.

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,760
Hello.

95
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
Ready to order?

96
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.

97
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,239
For the cold dish,

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
one smoked fish,

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,519
drunken chicken,

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,839
candied lotus root,

101
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,720
and the Four-Treasures-In-Huadiao-Wine.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,799
That's all.

103
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,359
As for the hot dish,

104
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,519
red braised pork belly is a must-have.

105
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,600
Then, one stir-fried prawn.

106
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:51,480
And then...

107
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,079
Mr. Zhang,

108
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,760
wouldn't it be too oily?

109
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,640
We should have something light.

110
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,839
This is a rare occasion.

111
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:56,799
Also,

112
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,760
you guys are still young.

113
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,320
Sautéed peas.

114
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,480
Fish noodle.

115
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:02,480
Those will do.

116
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,839
Okay.

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
You're staying in Shanghai?

118
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
No travel plan?

119
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:09,640
Yes,

120
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,359
I have some business here.

121
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,559
I was looking for you.

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,399
Yu Tu,

123
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,119
I have dealt with

124
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,640
your problem.

125
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,559
I know that

126
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,679
Guan Zai and you

127
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,920
have reached a bottleneck

128
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,200
in the model research project.

129
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,079
The school

130
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,079
has always played safe.

131
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,760
You have to understand that

132
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,079
that's how

133
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,760
we survive thus far.

134
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,279
Safety

135
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:40,799
is the most important part.

136
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,959
More redundancies are always good

137
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,359
because

138
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
the stake is too high.

139
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,200
However,

140
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,640
the time has changed.

141
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,239
Our nation has become stronger

142
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,079
so we need to change our mindset too.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,279
We ought to encourage the young

144
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,320
to innovate.

145
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:01,119
I can understand why you suddenly said

146
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,359
you wanted to quit.

147
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:03,679
That's why

148
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
I gave you a break.

149
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,200
Let you take your mind off.

150
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,000
During this month,

151
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
I was busy as well.

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,679
I discussed

153
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,119
with Mr. Hu many times.

154
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,760
The school's attitude

155
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,559
has now softened.

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,679
Your project represents the future.

157
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,239
The higher-up

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,119
have their eyes on Guan Zai and you,

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,239
the future leaders.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,959
We don't want you

161
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,679
to follow the old mindset,

162
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:41,640
and refuse to change.

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,679
Your break is almost over.

164
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,000
When you return,

165
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,000
revise

166
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
the proposal

167
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,720
with Guan Zai

168
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,720
and try to get

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,799
the school's support.

170
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
Did you hear me?

171
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,320
You still wish to quit?

172
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
Let's not talk about business.

173
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,200
Relax.

174
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,040
Come.

175
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:26,359
Let him speak.

176
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,040
Do you have other reasons?

177
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:36,839
Mr. Zhang,

178
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,480
I left

179
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
for money.

180
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,000
I understand.

181
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,600
Many people

182
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,040
have left over the years.

183
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,519
I can sympathize

184
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,720
with them.

185
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:24,279
I'm just a bit disappointed.

186
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,040
Yu Tu,

187
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,320
you really let me down.

188
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,960
You're my proudest student.

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,640
I thought...

190
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
Let's not talk about how my generation

191
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
started everything from zero.

192
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,400
Look at your colleague,

193
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,400
Guan Zai.

194
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
He gave up his high-paying job

195
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,280
and came back from the US.

196
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,479
I thought

197
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,559
you're like him,

198
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,919
that

199
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,000
you have your own belief.

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,000
Yu Tu gave up

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,239
his high-paying job too.

202
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,520
Yu Tu and his colleague

203
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,679
are talented people.

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,159
They deserve the best.

205
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,359
But

206
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,760
asking them to do what they are told

207
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,359
for the sake of their dream,

208
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,000
isn't this...

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,119
isn't this guilt-tripping?

210
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,479
Jingjing!

211
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Sorry.

212
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,640
I apologize,

213
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,080
Mr. Zhang.

214
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,719
We should leave now.

215
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,799
Enjoy your anniversary dinner.

216
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,239
You're

217
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,880
the biggest benefactor
of our current system,

218
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,400
so you shouldn't

219
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
say those things to my professor.

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
What do you mean?

221
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,359
If I'm not Qiao Jingjing,

222
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,440
if I'm not a celebrity,

223
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,479
I'll be able to say it?

224
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,119
I just wanted to defend you.

225
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,000
I want you to be

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,599
an aerospace engineer

227
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,640
more than anyone else.

228
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:17,799
Why?

229
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,159
Jingjing.

230
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,159
Mr. Yu.

231
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,039
Why are you guys out here?

232
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,280
Can you

233
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,400
delete the photo you took just now?

234
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,320
Thank you.

235
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,159
(I'm sorry.)

236
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,679
(Don't take what
Mr. Zhang said to heart.)

237
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,000
(He was just a bit upset.)

238
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
(We respect your decision.)

239
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,960
(Also, don't be mad at your friend.)

240
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,520
(What she said was true.)

241
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,400
(Thanks, Mrs. Wang.)

242
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,380
(Qiao Jingjing. Sorry.)

243
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
(Qiao Jingjing. But you're the rabbit
who has seen the most stars.)

244
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,380
(Good luck, Rabbit God!)
(Thanks. You should sleep now.)

245
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
(Let's start a ranking match tomorrow.)
(Goodnight)

246
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
(I'll leave then. Wait for my return.)
(Okay.)

247
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,580
(Sorry.)

248
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:09,620

(Treatment Value)

251
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,400
What's happening?

252
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,640
Why haven't we received
the telemetry signal?

253
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,860

(Unknown ID)

255
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,960
Yu Tu,

256
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,880
Satellite JX

257
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
has some emergency issue.

258
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,599
The attitude is out of control.

259
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,119
I don't care where you are.

260
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,320
Your break is terminated

261
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,960
and get to

262
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,799
Northwest Satellite Control Center
immediately.

263
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,200
The boot.

264
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,039
What happened?

265
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,520
Mr. Hu summoned you

266
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,320
with one phone call?

267
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,479
I grabbed some documents
from the institute

268
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,640
and took the last flight

269
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,440
to Xi'an.

270
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,520
Why are you here?

271
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,080
I flew over from Beijing.

272
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,320
I just arrived.

273
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,520
Mr. Hu said you'd be here

274
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,559
so I was waiting for you.

275
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,000
What exactly happened?

276
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,200
They didn't tell me anything.

277
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's go in first.

278
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,159
Are you two the staff from Base 158?

279
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,719
ID, please.

280
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,440
These are your passes.

281
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,159
Follow me.

282
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,640
Okay.

283
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,760
Here.

284
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,760
JX was working properly.

285
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But last night,

286
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,359
after it finished its first rotation,

287
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,560
the ground station did not receive

288
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,959
any telemetry signal.

289
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:15,959
The center

290
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,479
informed us

291
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,959
straight away.

292
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,479
Fixed channels transmission
from the ground station,

293
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:22,439
RF module from the transponder,

294
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,760
issuing commands to the back-up.

295
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,319
They did it thrice

296
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,239
but they still couldn't

297
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,000
receive the telemetry signal
from the satellite.

298
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,239
MIA straight away?

299
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,599
No response even from the backup?

300
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,239
Yes.

301
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:37,839
The backup

302
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,199
transponder on Satellite JX

303
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,479
is heterogeneous.

304
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,239
The possibility of a simultaneous

305
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:43,479
error is extremely low.

306
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:45,239
But it happened.

307
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,359
We are the first to arrive.

308
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,839
Others who worked on JX

309
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,839
are occupied.

310
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,959
They'll be here by tomorrow.

311
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:07,760
Mr. Li.

312
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,359
Mr. Han. Mr. Yang.

313
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,359
Our colleagues from

314
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,359
Base 158 are here.

315
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,000
Hi.

316
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,640
Hello.

317
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,839
Allow me

318
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:18,560
to introduce,

319
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
Mr. Li, Head of the Technical Department

320
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,160
in this center.

321
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,000
These two are

322
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,880
Mr. Yang and Mr. Han,

323
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,359
also from the Technical Department.

324
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,119
I'm Guan Zai from Base 158,

325
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,760
Satellite JX Head Engineer.

326
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,959
I'm Yu Tu from Base 158,

327
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,000
Satellite JX Engineer.

328
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,680
Mr. Hu is in Taiyuan now.

329
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,239
He has some business to attend to.

330
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,760
He'll be here tomorrow afternoon
at the latest.

331
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,680
Wonderful.

332
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,000
Thank you, Lv.

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,680
No problem.

334
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,880
Have you prepared for their reception?

335
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,239
The receptionists have done it.

336
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:41,800
Don't worry.

337
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,719
This is not urgent.

338
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,640
Mr. Li,

339
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,920
please brief us

340
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,800
the latest news of JX.

341
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:48,520
Last night,

342
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,400
after you transmitted

343
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,640
the commands during the second

344
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,319
and third rotation,

345
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,760
any downlink signal?

346
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,280
So,

347
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,479
when it entered our range,

348
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,959
we sent the command straight away.

349
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,239
However, we still haven't received

350
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,719
the downlink signal.

351
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,680
We switched to the backup and sent
the command via fixed channels

352
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,760
but there's no response.

353
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,319
I have with me its documents

354
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,520
and blueprint.

355
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,959
Do you have

356
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:13,959
any recent telemetry data

357
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:14,479
of the satellite?

358
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:15,280
It's all in our

359
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,040
system.

360
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,560
Let's figure out the problem then.

361
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:18,719
Once we find it,

362
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:19,959
we can devise a solution.

363
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,300
(Real-time fault diagnosis system
for on-orbit spacecraft)

364
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,980
(Two hours later)

365
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,239
Are you okay?

366
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm getting old.

367
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,560
One white night
and I'm all dizzy already.

368
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,280
Back then,

369
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,280
a few hours of sleep

370
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,920
for a few nights? No problem.

371
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,239
I'll head to bed now.

372
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,560
I received

373
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,959
another call from the ministry.

374
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:28,000
The government

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,199
invested a lot

376
00:20:29,199 --> 00:20:30,119
to launch this satellite.

377
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,719
Now that it's not working out,

378
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,640
the ministry wants an explanation.

379
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,680
Should we explore other options

380
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,239
instead of focusing on the transponder?

381
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:38,880
It could be the power supply.

382
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,319
Besides,

383
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,119
is it possible that its orbit

384
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,280
has changed?

385
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,040
The fixed channels

386
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,319
might not be able to reach it.

387
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,280
The power subsystem

388
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,239
and the recent orbital data,

389
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,239
I've read them all.

390
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:49,880
The telemetry data

391
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,160
is within

392
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,680
the normal threshold.

393
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,400
I've also checked the orbital data.

394
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,040
It matches quite well with the

395
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,400
predetermined orbit.

396
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,119
However, Mr. Guan and I

397
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:00,920
designed the model.

398
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,959
To reach a conclusion,

399
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,719
we need to wait for the

400
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,479
electrical and orbital engineers'

401
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,719
input.

Guan.

409
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,000
We found the satellite?

410
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,760
No,

411
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,199
but I might have found an explanation.

412
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,880
All right. Let's have a meeting.

413
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,239
(Four hours later)
Solar energetic particle

414
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,439
(Four hours later)
is already a rare phenomenon.

415
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:34,160
But to have one whose energy

416
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,119
affects two machines at the same time?

417
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,719
This is

418
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,280
too unlikely.

419
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,160
Previously,

420
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:41,040
we've

421
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,920
been focusing on the satellite itself

422
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,199
and we couldn't locate the problem.

423
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,000
I was exploring the possibility
of external factors

424
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,479
and I suddenly thought of

425
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,239
the solar wind forecast I saw earlier.

426
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,640
I consulted

427
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,719
the International Space Environment Web

428
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,719
and I did find some relevant info.

429
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,119
While we were waiting for you,

430
00:22:59,239 --> 00:23:00,000
Mr. Guan and I

431
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
did a rough calculation.

432
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:03,959
This possibility cannot be ruled out

433
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,239
but to reach the final conclusion,

434
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,160
we still need

435
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,680
a lot of calculations and simulations.

436
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:11,880
The backup is a dynamic backup.

437
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,920
Did we really hit the jackpot this time?

438
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,439
This year is also

439
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,719
the year of peak solar activity

440
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:18,280
according to the 11-year solar cycle.

441
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,000
Contact the Space Department of
the Chinese Academy of Science.

442
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Ask them to provide us the details

443
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,680
regarding

444
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,280
Satellite JX in its trajectory
yesterday.

445
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,920
On it.

00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:32,280

448
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,760
and others who worked on JX

449
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,880
have arrived.

450
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:37,719
Li.

451
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:38,760
Mr. Hu.

452
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
You arrived earlier.

453
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,319
Time is of the essence.

454
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,479
I traveled through the night via car.

455
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,319
Let's not waste time chatting.

456
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,119
Any update on JX?

457
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,760
Look at me. So anxious that

458
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,719
I got sick.

459
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,199
Satellite JX

460
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,719
is my last work before

461
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,920
I retire into administration.

462
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,680
If it's gone like that,

463
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:59,880
I will regret it
for the rest of my life.

464
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,959
Take a break first, Mr. Hu.

465
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:03,160
We might have found

466
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
the reason.

467
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,239
We're waiting for the confirmation.

468
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,260
(Two hours later)

469
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
The Chinese Academy of Sciences replied.

470
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,479
They confirmed that

471
00:24:15,479 --> 00:24:16,719
the malfunction of the satellite

472
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,119
coincided with the solar storm.

474
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,239
Run the simulation now.

475
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,040
Cross-check the satellite's position,

476
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,760
the time of the malfunction,

477
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
and the range
of the energetic electron storm

478
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,199
triggered by the solar storm.

479
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,199
See if they match.

(Northwest Satellite Control Center)

481
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,719
How long will it take?

482
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:30,959
No longer than two hours.

483
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,800
We can still salvage it today.

484
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,239
The one in charge of orbit monitoring,

485
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,719
calculate its orbit

486
00:24:36,719 --> 00:24:38,439
and surmise its

487
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,760
precise trajectory and travel time.

490
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,239
write the command script now.

copy the previous energy level

492
00:24:44,479 --> 00:24:45,959
on the satellite and evaluate

493
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,439
if there's any breach
in the power supply.

494
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,400
Besides,

495
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,319
the solar storm

496
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,520
is only the most

497
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,199
probable explanation so far.

498
00:24:53,199 --> 00:24:54,880
We need to wait for the result.

499
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,560
Think

500
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,280
if there are any other

501
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,719
latent factors.

502
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,160
Guan Zai.

503
00:25:01,479 --> 00:25:02,199
Since you're the head engineer,

504
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,160
stay in the loop.

505
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,160

(Two and a half hours later)

508
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,400
According to the simulation,

509
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,760
we can confirm that

510
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,079
before the Satellite JX

511
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,280
rotated to within our range

512
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
last night, it was hit

513
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,560
by the energetic electron storm

514
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,640
that happens once

515
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,719
every 11 years.

516
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:48,760
The massive energy released

517
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:50,920
might have affected

518
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,800
both transponders.

519
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
Single-event upset took place
simultaneously

520
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
and damaged the satellite's

521
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,079
communication system.

522
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,560
We have already devised

523
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,599
a contingency plan

524
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,680
for this.

525
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:04,920
The reception part

526
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,280
of the transponder

527
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,680
uses analog electronics.

528
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,319
It won't be affected

529
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,880
by the single-event upset.

530
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,000
Therefore,

531
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,920
when the satellite
rotates into our range again,

532
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,119
transmit reboot command

533
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,119
to the two transponders

534
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:17,119
via fixed channels.

535
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,599
If the satellite

536
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,079
receives the command successfully,

537
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,520
its telecommunication system

538
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,160
should come back online.

Please check every system now.

552
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,160
How's the satellite?

553
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,520
Stabilization subsystem malfunction.

554
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,000
Three-axis
earth-oriented stabilization failed.

555
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,239
Power system normal.

556
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:29,319
Excessive power supply.

557
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,280
It uses less power

558
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
than expected.

559
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:32,640
We did take into account

560
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
the damage
to the stabilization subsystem

561
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,479
due to the solar storm.

562
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,040
We have a plan

563
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,000
for this exact scenario.

564
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,199
The power supply malfunction

565
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,000
must be the side product

566
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,959
of the damaged

567
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,000
stabilization subsystem.

568
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,479
I think it is
because of the solar sails,

569
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,040
that we can't establish
solar orientation properly,

570
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,640
so the power demand increased.

571
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:49,959
Our utmost priority now

572
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,640
is to reduce the workload
on the satellite.

573
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,680
Contain its energy consumption

574
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,119
and correct its attitude

575
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:56,359
as soon as possible.

576
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,160
Follow the protocol
and launch the commands.

577
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,400
Shut down all unnecessary systems

578
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,880
to reduce power consumption.

579
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,640
Meanwhile,

580
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,719
launch commands to request

581
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,400
solar sails to be solar-oriented.

582
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,079
The satellite is now
out of the monitoring range.

583
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,319
The next rotation will be at

584
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,479
8:03 PM.

585
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,800
Attention, everyone.

586
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,680
Reporting in from Kunming post.

587
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,640
Target is in range.

588
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,040
Telemetry data reports

589
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,920
malfunction
in the stabilization subsystem.

590
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,040
The satellite has not entered

591
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,319
a solar-oriented stable state.

592
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,079
Another white night.

593
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:15,599
Send the amended contract

594
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,880
to my e-mail.

595
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,719
The latest one, okay?

596
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,160
Xiao Zhu.

597
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,520
Come here.

598
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,199
Yes?

599
00:29:30,199 --> 00:29:32,000
What happened to Jingjing recently?

600
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,599
She came to the office
three days in a row now.

601
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,959
She's in an argument with Mr. Yu.

602
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,760
Mr. Yu has been absent these few days.

603
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,520
Really?

604
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,280
Aren't they get along well?

605
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,280
Jingjing.

606
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,800
I have good news.

607
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,239
Mr. Li sent us the contract

608
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:53,199
back.

609
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,319
I quite like the conditions.

610
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,479
Also,

611
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,199
if we announce this news now,

612
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,599
we'll have a higher offer

613
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,760
for the upcoming drama.

614
00:30:02,479 --> 00:30:04,560
Am I worth the money?

615
00:30:07,719 --> 00:30:08,319
I mean,

616
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,280
shooting for a drama usually
lasts for five months.

617
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,479
Am I worth the money?

618
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,239
Of course, you do!

619
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,839
Just think about it.
When you star in a show,

620
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,439
TV channels and streaming platforms

621
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,520
all want it.

622
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,439
Advertisers want to
place their products in it.

623
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,199
That's how the TV channels

624
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,040
and the streaming platforms make money.

625
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,680
Of course, you're worth the money.

626
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Other B-listers

627
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,560
would ask for this price,

628
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,599
not to mention

629
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,199
you're an A-Lister yourself.

630
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,520
I don't want to be compared to them.

631
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,719
To who then?

632
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,000
Am I too

633
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,520
sentimental now?

634
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,520
Well,

635
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:53,719
it's not about

636
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,359
being sentimental or not.

637
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
I've thought about

638
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:58,599
this question too.

639
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,040
But you see,

640
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,000
that's how the market works.

641
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,839
If you don't grab it, someone else will.

642
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,079
Besides,

643
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,520
if you don't take the money,

644
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,839
the main investors

645
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,040
will still sell the copyright
at the same price.

646
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,359
So where will the price difference go?

647
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,160
Into the pocket

648
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,000
of the investors, of course.

649
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,319
It has

650
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,920
nothing to do with sentimentality.

651
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,400
Dwelling it in will serve no purpose.

652
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,119
Let me ask you then.

653
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,000
If someone offers you
several million yuan

654
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,239
for a drama,

655
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,160
would you say,

656
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,839
"No, I just want
several hundred thousand yuan?"

657
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,439
I wouldn't.

658
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,400
See?

659
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,079
There's no point in dwelling in this.

660
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,920
Just do your job properly.

661
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,199
Act well.

662
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,520
Stay out of trouble.

663
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,040
Respect their work.

664
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,640
Respect their money.

665
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Donate to charity

666
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,680
like we're supposed to.

667
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,359
Is that not enough?

668
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,199
Look at you.

669
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:54,760
Sulking.

670
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,199
Why this all of a sudden?

671
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,119
Where's Mr. Yu?

672
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,719
All right.

673
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,199
I'll leave now.

674
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,640
Cheer up.

675
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:22,599
See you then.

676
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,640
Call me if anything.

677
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:33,920
Check on her.

678
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,079
If something happens,

679
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,199
call me.

680
00:32:36,199 --> 00:32:37,319
See you then.

681
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,239
Will do. Don't worry.

682
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,100
