=Episode 12=

13
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:41,639
Well...

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,919
Yu Tu.

15
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,160
These days,

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,319
can I use your mobile phone

17
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
to play games?

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
For the match, we must use

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,400
a phone model meant for
competitive gaming.

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,480
Your mobile phone happened
to be that model.

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,160
I was thinking if I can

22
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,279
practice with it first.

23
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,360
The passcode is 0424.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Take it from the living room yourself.

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,679
Yu Tu.

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,759
Did you join our high school group chat?

27
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,479
Yes.

28
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,479
I didn't.

29
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:29,199
I'm very curious

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,559
how our classmates are doing.

31
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,199
Can I

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,119
use your WeChat

33
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,800
to check their Moments?

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
Moments

35
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:39,080
are for friends to see.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
You're their classmate too.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,399
I'll use your WeChat?

38
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,559
Sure.

39
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,700
(WeChat)

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,620
(Xia Qing)

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,639
All

42
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,639
our classmates?

43
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:39,759
Yes.

44
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,679
(He didn't get my point at all.)

45
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,240
(Forget it.)

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,520
(It's good if he didn't get it too.)

47
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,240
I won.

48
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:52,839
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

49
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,720
I haven't even mocked Su Lie yet.

50
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll give a thumbs up to my team.

51
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,720
I played so badly earlier,

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,000
and they didn't complain about me.

53
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:15,880
All right.

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,239
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

55
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,519
I'll help you win one round too.

56
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,720
I think

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
you should just check WeChat Moments.

58
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
I was kidding.

59
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't want to check it.

60
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,040
What's the matter?

61
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,480
You don't believe that I can win?

62
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:32,640
Do whatever you want.

63
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,519
I'll do that then,

64
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,839
and help you win.

65
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,119
Xiao Zhu is calling you.

66
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,920
Help me answer it.

67
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:47,320
Hey, Jingjing.

68
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,799
A brand sent you a birthday gift

69
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:51,119
and three big boxes.

70
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,880
I'll tell the driver to bring them up.

71
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:54,880
Wait.

72
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,519
It's not convenient for the driver
to come up.

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,959
Can you help me bring them here?

74
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,480
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
Which brand

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,279
sent me a birthday gift
so far in advance?

77
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,279
The one you're endorsing.

78
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,959
They send them to you in advance
each year.

79
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,160
All of these?

80
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,399
These three boxes aren't from them.

81
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,160
These are the clothes, bags,
shoes, and stuff

82
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
that you bought

83
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,920
last time.

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
They arrived at the same time.

85
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,959
You can mix and match them

86
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,239
for the next match.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,480
Didn't you tell me

88
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
that a brand gave me a gift?

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,880
It's this one.

90
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,519
I'll do it.

91
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,160
It's a bit heavy.

92
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,079
Thank you.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,119
It's so heavy.

94
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:46,880
Jingjing.

95
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:47,880
Do you want to see

96
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
what the brand gave you?

97
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,720
Just leave it there.

98
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,959
I'll place it in the cloakroom then.

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Should I move these to the cloakroom?

100
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,640
No, there's no need.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,279
My cloakroom is very messy.

102
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,160
Actually, I don't

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,320
usually buy so many clothes.

104
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,200
Jingjing.

105
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,000
There are too many clothes

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,399
in your cloakroom.

107
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,720
I'll gather those clothes

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
that aren't suitable for you.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,760
Many of them still have the tags on.

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,880
Just like before,

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,760
I'll distribute it to everyone.

112
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,959
I'll give some to Peipei.

113
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:26,880
(Who taught you)

114
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,399
(such an exaggerated acting technique?)

115
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:36,880
That's quite good.

116
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,200
You mean it?

117
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,519
Yes.

118
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,160
I still have some work lately.

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,640
I must leave around 6 PM.

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,519
What time is it now?

121
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,880
You're leaving now?

122
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,160
What about dinner?

123
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,079
You won't eat anymore?

124
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,399
Xiao Zhu already brought the food.

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,359
I'll take the food today.

126
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,519
Starting tomorrow,

127
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,760
you don't need
to bring me dinner anymore.

128
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,839
Then

129
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,040
you won't finish watching

130
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Saturday's final match?

131
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:17,519
The official match starts

132
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,160
at around 5 PM.

133
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,519
I'll inform them,

134
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:26,559
and I'll finish watching it
before leaving.

135
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,519
But I might arrive later

136
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,000
in the morning.

137
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,200
Okay.

138
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,720
See you tomorrow then.

139
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,559
See you tomorrow.

140
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,079
But tomorrow,

141
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,399
don't bring me meat buns.

142
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Xiao Zhu.

143
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,160
Can your EQ be any lower?

144
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,279
If you say those things,

145
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,320
and Mr. Yu misunderstands me

146
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,600
as a spoiled girl who doesn't
spend money wisely,

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,279
what should I do?

148
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,799
I think

149
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,880
that's not a misunderstanding.

150
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,760
Who says I'm that way?

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,959
I work so hard.

152
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,000
I work until so late at night

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
and even hang on wires.

154
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,959
Who says that I'm spoiled?

155
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,480
Besides, didn't I buy

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
these clothes, bags, and shoes

157
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,880
for work?

158
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,279
Even if I don't wear them,
I give them away.

159
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,119
I didn't let them go to waste.

160
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,839
However,

161
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,760
Mr. Yu said that it's quite good.

162
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,000
Through my beautiful

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
and dazzling performance,

164
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
he must have seen

165
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,559
my beautiful,

166
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:30,239
dazzling, and simple heart.

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,559
Right.

168
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,640
Mr. Yu must know

169
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,840
that you have a simple heart.

170
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,239
I think so too.

171
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,200
This one is nice.

172
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,679
I can wear this

173
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,840
during the match, right?

174
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,719
Try it on.

175
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,760
And this one is really nice too.

176
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,559
No.

177
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:47,960
This one.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,760
This one.

179
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,400
This one.

180
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,280
This one's nice.

181
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,520
That one's nice too.

182
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,039
Take a look.

183
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
Yes, this one's nice.

184
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,020
How would I dare to fool you?

185
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,520
(In-patient Department)

186
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,799
I really told Yu Tu already.

187
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,159
He's here.

188
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,239
Ask him

189
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,400
if he has a girlfriend already.

190
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,159
Who says that I didn't work hard

191
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,440
to recommend your junior?

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,640
Not recommend,

193
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,159
it's

194
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,840
introduce.

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,440
It has only been a while

196
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,640
since you went to my house for a meal.

197
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,159
You have a girlfriend already?

198
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:40,239
Yes, I do.

199
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,919
Is that so?

200
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
What does she look like?

201
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,719
Do you have a photo?

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,000
A photo.

203
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
It's fine if you don't have one.

204
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,760
It's fine if you don't like her.

205
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,919
Why can't you just be open about it?

206
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:09,919
Look at you.

207
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,159
You've gone too far.

208
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:13,000
You even said that she likes you.

209
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,280
But you can't

210
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,400
even show us a photo.

211
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,479
I don't have time for you two.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to pick up our kid.

213
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,919
I'll see her off.

214
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,640
I was intentionally joking

215
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,039
with Guan Zai just now.

216
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,239
Don't take it to heart.

217
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,359
He's not feeling well today.

218
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,400
I wanted

219
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
to distract him.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
On the other hand,

221
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,559
I didn't want to let him feel

222
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,599
that I'm under a lot of pressure.

223
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,799
I wanted him to relax a bit.

224
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,640
I understand.

225
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:54,919
Actually, I won't introduce

226
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,520
my junior to you.

227
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,760
What if she ends up hating me later on?

228
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,799
You and Guan Zai

229
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,000
are the same.

230
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,880
I don't see him all day.

231
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,159
He just keeps working

232
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,039
and working.

233
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
I remember that he wasn't home

234
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,280
for a maximum

235
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,359
of half a year.

236
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,479
For the remaining half,

237
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:18,520
he was working overtime daily.

238
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,159
He didn't have time for family at all.

239
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,799
You should go back to the ward.

240
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:31,679
I'll see you off.

241
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:32,799
There's no need.

242
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,520
Go on.

243
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,000
Ren Wang.

244
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,919
I'm really sorry.

245
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
I hope I didn't delay you.

246
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
It's fine.

247
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,080
There are always many people

248
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,359
who want to work in our industry.

249
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,760
It's good as long as you've thought
about it carefully.

250
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,599
However,

251
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,400
have you resolved the reason

252
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,280
why you wanted to resign before?

253
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,359
What are you looking at?

254
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,520
For the work

255
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
that can be handled over the phone,

256
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,880
I must provide instructions.

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,919
It's not convenient
if my wife is around.

258
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,239
Keep this a secret for me.

259
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,799
15 minutes.

260
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,520
That's enough.

261
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,159
There actually isn't a lot

262
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,239
that can be handled over the phone.

263
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,000
That's enough.

264
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,960
I'll heat up some food.

265
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,400
What did you have for dinner?

266
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,599
I had some porridge.

267
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,280
You bring

268
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,760
your own food now?

269
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:20,060
(In-patient Department)

270
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,359
(Where did you go
for your business trip?)

271
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,280
(It was so sudden.)

272
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,640
(Xi'an.)

273
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
(I can't tell you anything else.)

274
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,080
(It's confidential.)

275
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,599
(You can't tell your family too?)

276
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:41,159
(I can't.)

277
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
How boring.

278
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,880
There's no topic to talk about then.

279
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,880
(You and Guan Zai)

280
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
(are the same.)

281
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,239
(I don't see him all day.)

282
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,479
(He just keeps working)

283
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,359
(and working.)

284
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,159
(He didn't have time)

285
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,520
(for family at all.)

286
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
(You're only thinking)

287
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,280
(about your ambition.)

288
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,119
You shouldn't delay people.

289
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:41,119
Yu.

290
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,359
Your colleague suddenly vomited.

291
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,080
He suddenly vomited.

292
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,479
Here.

293
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,520
Slowly.

294
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,359
Go, ring the bell.

295
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,359
Ring the bell.

296
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,333
(In-patient Department)

297
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,100
Based on his condition,

298
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,600
(Doctor's Office)

299
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,159
that patient's stomach

300
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,799
has obvious changes.

301
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,799
We can confirm that it's cancer.

302
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,799
But it was discovered early,

303
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,039
and it hasn't metastasized

304
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,080
to other organs.

305
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,880
He kept feeling dizzy before.

306
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
Is it related to the cancer?

307
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,599
Dizziness

308
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:29,400
has nothing to do with stomach cancer.

309
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
And his brain exam results

310
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,520
don't indicate any illness.

311
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
His dizziness

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,919
should be related

313
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
to over exhaustion

314
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,159
and too much stress.

315
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,400
But we should

316
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,119
be thankful for his dizziness.

317
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,880
Because of it,

318
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,760
the patient

319
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,599
was able to discover this cancer.

320
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
After he

321
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,719
becomes stable,

322
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,119
undergo surgery as soon as possible.

323
00:15:54,599 --> 00:15:55,400
I'm fine.

324
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,239
Back in Xi'an,

325
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:58,280
I kept thinking

326
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,359
if the hospital

327
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,359
misdiagnosed him.

328
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,119
Now that it's confirmed,

329
00:16:02,119 --> 00:16:03,280
I'm not thinking much about it anymore.

330
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,679
Just treat the illness.

331
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:06,280
Didn't the doctor also say

332
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,119
that it was discovered early?

333
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,479
Just treat the illness.

334
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,599
Mr. Hu.

335
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,479
Mrs. Hu.

336
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
In the past couple of days,

337
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,799
he had been lethargic.

338
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,000
What if

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
you go home first?

340
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
After he wakes up,

341
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,799
I'll tell him that you came by.

342
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,119
Okay.

343
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,760
We won't disturb you then.

344
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,239
We'll come here during the weekend.

345
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,880
Before coming,

346
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,039
I'll call you.

347
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,599
There's no need
to go through such trouble.

348
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,159
You need to travel far
to come here as well.

349
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,679
How can it be troublesome?

350
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,880
We must go out anyway.

351
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
On the weekend,

352
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
I'll make him

353
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,640
some clear soup

354
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,599
and bring it over.

355
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,400
Thank you, Mrs. Hu.

356
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,679
We'll go ahead then.

357
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,039
I'll see you off.

358
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:56,880
There's no need.

359
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,359
Stay with him.

360
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,239
Yu.

361
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,400
Go home too.

362
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,039
You weren't able to rest well
in the past couple of days.

363
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
Guan Zhu called me

364
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,000
saying that he'll be back soon.

365
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,280
It's hard on Shen too.

366
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,839
She's alone,

367
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,640
and she has to take care of her child,

368
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,280
and she must take care of Guan Zai.

369
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,599
Before,

370
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,680
she was such a beautiful and neat girl.

371
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,079
Now, she looks so haggard.

372
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,119
I remember how we were back then.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
You

374
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,359
didn't have time for family as well.

375
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,479
When I gave birth,

376
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,760
you almost didn't make it home.

377
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,680
Telephones weren't so common back then.

378
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
All right.

379
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,760
I'll stop.

380
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,359
It's all in the past now.

381
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,079
Yu.

382
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,640
If Shen

383
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,920
needs any help,

384
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,280
you must tell me.

385
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,280
Guan Zai

386
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,640
doesn't want to tell others.

387
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,760
Otherwise,

388
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,239
our office could have made
some arrangements.

389
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:05,479
The two of them

390
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,800
aren't willing

391
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,119
to trouble others.

392
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,119
Tell me.

393
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,959
Guan Zai is such a nice person.

394
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,119
How can he get this kind of illness?

395
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,959
He'll recover.

396
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,520
Yu.

397
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,640
We need to hide this

398
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,079
from Mr. Zhang.

399
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,800
He's not in good condition.

400
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,280
You and Guan Zai

401
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,400
are the students

402
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,880
he cares about the most.

403
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,040
Guan Zai is so sick now.

404
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm afraid that he won't be able
to handle it.

405
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,880
Mr. Hu.

406
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,640
I want to apply
for an extended vacation.

407
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,959
An extended vacation?

408
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,280
Right.

409
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,920
I've accumulated a lot
of vacation leaves before.

410
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,880
I don't know if they can be used.

411
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,280
You mean...

412
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,000
Regarding the investment bank...

413
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,599
I've already turned down their offer.

414
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,920
We must

415
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,040
still carefully consider

416
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,400
certain things.

417
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
Your teacher, Guan Zai

418
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,079
isn't your responsibility.

419
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,800
So don't keep feeling responsible

420
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,160
for a lot of things.

421
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,959
And don't change your decisions

422
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,479
because of others.

423
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,199
It has nothing to do with others.

424
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,319
When I went to Xi'an

425
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,920
to save JX,

426
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
I thought that I should stay here.

427
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,880
That's good.

428
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,560
I'll handle

429
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,400
the extended vacation.

430
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
For how long?

431
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,839
One week.

432
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:42,760
Aside from Guan Zai,

433
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,000
there are other things
I need to do as well.

434
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:48,640
I promised a friend
that I'll do something,

435
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,719
and I haven't completed it yet.

436
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,199
I worked so hard

437
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:16,920
to get this vote.

438
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,640
Who should I vote for?

439
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,400
Who did you vote for?

440
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,800
I haven't voted yet.

441
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,599
Help me vote for Luo Shen.

442
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,079
You really want to vote for Luo Shen?

443
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,079
Luo Shen was the champion
for the spring season.

444
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,880
He has a lot of experience too.

445
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
But Snow's condition is very good too.

446
00:20:40,719 --> 00:20:41,640
If you want to win,

447
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
vote for Luo Shen.

448
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,800
The chances are higher.

449
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,560
If you want to support your idol,

450
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,599
vote for Heavenly Palace.

451
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,800
What if

452
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,119
we make a bet?

453
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,599
Whoever bets on the losing team

454
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,359
will agree

455
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,199
to one request.

456
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,959
This will make it more fun.

457
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,239
Sure.

458
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,560
I think the match has begun.

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,640
Get your own juice.

460
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:10,359
Right.

461
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,359
Heavenly Palace is in
very good condition now.

462
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,439
And Cai Wenji too.

463
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,439
They can't be guarded against.

464
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,680
And once the soldiers come in...

465
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,719
12 minutes and 22 seconds.

466
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,560
A tank can hold off well
in a head-on battle.

467
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,479
Guard the nexus.

468
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:19,199
Bring the soldiers in.

469
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:19,839
They're in.

470
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,119
12 minutes and 25 seconds.

471
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,439
- Congratulations, Luo Shen!
- Luo Shen!

472
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,160
He won at 1:0.

473
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,719
Just now,

474
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:26,680
Luo Shen's nexus

475
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,560
was almost destroyed.

476
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,680
Just circle around the back.

477
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,479
Ghost Valley Kings are in.

478
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,599
Get three.

479
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,160
Push back.

480
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,359
Got the fourth one.

481
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,839
This team battle is so good.

482
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:41,920
Instant kill.

483
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,400
He's catching up.

484
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
12 minutes.

485
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,119
Look.

486
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:46,520
I told you.

487
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,719
Heavenly Palace's Team
is very incredible.

488
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,040
Their rhythm in this round is very good.

489
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,280
Snow is really amazing.

490
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,119
I would have died 100 times already
if it were me.

491
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,199
You can't kill him head-on.

492
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,040
He got him.

493
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,160
Snow got killed.

494
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,640
Luo Shen is still very stable.

495
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,800
What do you...

496
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,079
Why does a guy

497
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,599
have such nice eyelashes?

498
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,400
What have you been busy with lately?

499
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,160
Didn't you say

500
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,040
that you're resigning
from the Research Institute?

501
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,839
You even have heavy dark circles.

502
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,640
You can even fall asleep while watching

503
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,920
such an intense game.

504
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,319
It's not easy to edit the photo
from this angle.

505
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,520
(He didn't wake up from that?)

506
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,280
(I'm so light after all.)

507
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,239
(Quietly.)

508
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,880
(Quietly get up.)

509
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,319
Well...

510
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,800
What were you trying to reach?

511
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,319
An orange.

512
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:34,160
Who won?

513
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,400
Guess.

514
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,319
I'm guessing

515
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,079
that you lost.

516
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,319
Yes, I lost.

517
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:53,760
Make a request then.

518
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,439
Your birthday is at the end
of the month.

519
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,160
What gift do you want?

520
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:16,760
You're the one who should
make a request.

521
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,719
The request

522
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,160
for our bet is

523
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,599
to tell me

524
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,359
what gift you want.

525
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,680
I won't be shy then.

526
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,199
Don't be shy.

527
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,239
This is too sudden.

528
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,319
I'll tell you after I think about it.

529
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,839
(Mr. Yu is such a dense guy.)

530
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,880
(Who asks people what gift they want?)

531
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,040
(Shouldn't he suddenly take it out)

532
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,359
(as a surprise?)

533
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,359
The final match is over.

534
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,920
The awarding ceremony

535
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,079
will occur after a few days.

536
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:00,239
Have you decided
which professional players

537
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,479
to choose as your teammates?

538
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm still thinking about the gift.

539
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,719
Any suggestions?

540
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,640
First choice,

541
00:27:11,439 --> 00:27:12,239
Heavenly Palace,

542
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,280
Zhou Yin.

543
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,199
Heavenly Palace

544
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,479
may have lost to Luo Shen
in the final match,

545
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,880
but as a team leader,

546
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,359
he's a rare all-around player

547
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,959
in the match.

548
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,119
I thought

549
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,800
you'd recommend Luo Shen's team.

550
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,280
Luo Shen may be very competent,

551
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,079
but their strongest point

552
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,560
is in their overall coordination.

553
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,719
Okay.

554
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,680
I quite like Zhou Yin too.

555
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,119
Zhou Yin is handsome too.

556
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:38,199
He's only 19 years old.

557
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,319
You even know his age?

558
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,439
Pay attention to Zhou Yin's way
of playing.

559
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,439
What can you see?

560
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,920
What?

561
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,479
While training with you
in the past few days,

562
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,079
I imitated Zhou Yin.

563
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,239
The heroes he often uses,

564
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,719
his habit in playing,

565
00:28:00,719 --> 00:28:01,760
his behavior.

566
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
During the match,

567
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
you'll be more familiar

568
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,599
and more easily coordinate with him.

569
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,800
You were imitating him

570
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,920
to familiarize me
with his way of playing

571
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,160
and practice coordinating with him?

572
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:16,560
I even imitated Snow.

573
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:18,079
You didn't notice?

574
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,680
I know what I want
for my birthday gift now.

575
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,040
Give me a Penta Kill.

576
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,040
Until now, I haven't gotten

577
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,239
a Penta Kill yet.

578
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,680
But I want you to give it to me,

579
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,839
not them.

580
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
So you don't need to imitate

581
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,920
their way of playing.

582
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:45,920
Because I like

583
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,040
coordinating with you more.

584
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,319
Why are you laughing?

585
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,800
Nothing.

586
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:56,920
I just think that it's hard work.

587
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:58,880
Don't think I can't tell

588
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,920
that you're laughing at me.

589
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,319
I was just unlucky.

590
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,000
That's why until now,

591
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,280
I haven't gotten a Penta Kill yet.

592
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:06,680
Let's begin then.

593
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,920
Play alone first.

594
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,199
Drop 30 stars.

595
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,479
Your level is too high now.

596
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:18,199
I can't afford

597
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,119
a 50-star Penta Kill.

598
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,760
I don't care.

599
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,079
Oh, right.

600
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,160
These are the tickets
to the awarding ceremony.

601
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,400
Bring So Panicky

602
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,119
with you.

603
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,839
But please

604
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,079
get a good sleep first.

605
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:40,599
Don't fall asleep again

606
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,719
halfway in the ceremony.

607
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,160
Bring

608
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,599
So Panicky?

609
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,599
Then you can

610
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,640
tell him

611
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,040
that the most competent...

612
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:56,119
The most beautiful person on stage

613
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,839
is Hand-picked Cotton.

614
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:26,060
(Spend more time together)

615
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,479
(I promised a friend
that I'll do something,)

616
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,520
(and I haven't completed it yet.)

617
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,920
(Then you can keep teaching me)

618
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,959
(until the match.)

619
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,760
