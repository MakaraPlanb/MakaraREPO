=Episode 16=

14
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,280
Last night

15
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,000
I checked

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the detailed design reports and blueprints

17
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,799
of every subsystem.

18
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,000
Doctor Zhao.

19
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,480
What's the difference between

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,200
the currents on flats and on slopes?

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,359
It's five times the number.

22
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,260
(Hall effect sensor module study)

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,000
That's the problem.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,319
The most likely cause of this issue

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,360
is electromagnetic interference.

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,800
This is the power line
of the electric machine.

27
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,840
If the current is i,

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,759
and this is

29
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,080
the hysteresis loop of
the Hall effect sensor,

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
the distance between these two lines

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
is 1.6 mm

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,199
in standard design.

33
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,479
As for our design,

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,319
the distance is also 1.6 mm.

35
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,680
There is no room for error.

36
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,400
When the current exceeds

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
the set point,

38
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,719
it's possible

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,400
the electric machine's
Hall effect sensor

40
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,719
will experience interference.

41
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,439
It's entirely possible.

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
How do we recreate the situation?

43
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,719
We can prove it with

44
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,680
a wheel loading test.

45
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,199
The command for the slope climbing is sent.

46
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,080
Pay attention to the waveforms
and telemetry signals.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
The wheel speed is inconsistent.

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,919
At the same time, the Hall effect sensor

49
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,039
is showing spikes.

50
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,000
The electric machine is in PWM mode.

51
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:15,560
The chopper frequency alone

52
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
is over tens of thousand Hz.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,960
I just checked.

54
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,439
When we added the weight,

55
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,919
the current is over 1000 mA.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,879
The Hall effect sensor

57
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,240
and the three-phase line

58
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,280
are too close to each other.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,479
That's the reason

60
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,439
our Hall effect sensor

61
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,719
is showing so many spikes.

62
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,919
The next step

63
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,560
is to separate the signal line
and the power line

64
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,319
into two different directions.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,719
The command for the slope climbing is sent.

66
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,479
Pay attention to the waveforms
and the telemetry signals.

67
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,039
The wheel is operating normally.

68
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,439
The waveform from the Hall effect sensor

69
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,319
is not showing spikes.

70
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,439
This is it.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Prepare for the slope-climbing test.

72
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,439
The command for the slope climbing is sent.

73
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,159
Please observe the telemetry signals.

74
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,800
The wheel is functioning normally.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,159
We've found the cause.

76
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Well done, everyone.

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,680
We should run more tests

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
to make sure it's fine.

79
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,560
- Okay.
- Sure.

80
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,839
Mr. Zhang.

81
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,959
You should go home.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,439
Isn't today your girlfriend's birthday?

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,759
Sure.

84
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,439
You did well today.

85
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,560
I'll make up for the work tomorrow.

86
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,360
It wasn't a major problem,

87
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,839
but he handled it with composure.

88
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,759
His work was efficient.

89
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,879
He's undoubtedly

90
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:51,680
an outstanding beginner.

91
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,279
Not bad.

92
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,639
He needs to hone his skills.

is a collaborative effort
with the researchers

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,759
from Beijing.

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,759
You must inform them firsthand

102
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,240
when there is an issue.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,759

104
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:33,600
will be conducted next month.

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,879
Guan Zai was supposed to lead the team,

106
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,040
but he can't make it.

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,120

As for the follow-up work,

115
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,959
we'll reconsider our options.

make it back next month.

sooner or later.

150
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
and he's come to,

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,439

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,679
with Mr. Hu.

194
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,759
Are you working

195
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,799
at the institute?

196
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,960
Yes.

197
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,759
Are you staying?

198
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,639
Yes.

199
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,679
Are you doing this for me?

200
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
Don't be so dense.

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,879
Right.

202
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:57,919
I have

203
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,399
the plans for Uno's modifications.

204
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,159
Have you checked them?

205
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,720
What do you think?

206
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,399
Before I left for Xi'an,

207
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,759
you already sent me the plans.

208
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,960
Were you so certain I would be back?

209
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,600
If you didn't come back,

210
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,799
then my effort would go down the drain.

211
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,039
I read it.

212
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,080
Some of the modifications are viable.

213
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,600
They don't affect the performance.

214
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,919
However,

215
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,799
there are

216
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,720
some unrealistic goals

217
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,679
that I want to realize.

218
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,200
I knew you would say that.

219
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,720
You're the most stubborn one.

220
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,759
You have my support.

221
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,279
But I'm sick.

222
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,240
It's hard to tell.

223
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,159
I can no longer

224
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,519
be in charge of the project.

225
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,840
You lack experience.

226
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,639
You're not up for the job.

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,480
Yes.

228
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,360
I considered the options.

229
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,039
The person who's most likely
to take over your job

230
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,159
is Tong Bo.

231
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,960
Tong Bo is a kind person.

232
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,399
He's a professional.

233
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,919
I talked to him

234
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,039
about this matter.

235
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,679
There's no one else here.

236
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,120
So I'll be frank with you.

237
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,919
His mindset is too conventional.

238
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,559
He lacks the imagination for the future.

239
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,399
His work might not have a good prospect

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,279
internationally

241
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,919
in a few years.

242
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,279
Dameng, Hu, and I

243
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,240
discussed it.

244
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,879
We wish to carry on

245
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,879
with the current plan.

246
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,519
We aren't

247
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,799
very experienced in this field.

248
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
The best solution

249
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,879
is for our professor to lead us.

250
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
But this solution

251
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
requires his consent

252
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,559
on the matter.

253
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,360
As for Tong Bo,

254
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,159
it's a little over a month
from the launch.

255
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,200
Xi'an Control

256
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,519
will take over the satellite

257
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,320
after two months.

258
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,440
During that period of time,

259
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
We'll try again

260
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,679
and persuade him to take the job.

261
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,279
Okay.

262
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,360
You've only been here for days,

263
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,440
but you've been attentive

264
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,639
to every aspect.

265
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,399
I'll try my best

266
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,159
while following the order.

267
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,840
Don't shout the slogan.

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,559
Give the project a name.

269
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,320
A name?

270
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,600
That seems unnecessary.

271
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,519
We should stop calling it Uno.

272
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,559
Give it a proper name.

273
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,240
Me?

274
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:48,399
Yes.

275
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:49,720
You get to decide.

276
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,320
(In the seemingly endless cosmos,)

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,399
(we search for the truth)

278
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,519
(of human and Earth's origins.)

279
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,759
(In this infinite time and space,)

280
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,280
(we search for the existence)

281
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,560
(of another God's miraculous work.)

282
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,759
Its duty is to prove
that we're not alone

283
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,559
in this world.

284
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
We'll call it...

285
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:39,519
the "Search for God."

286
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,639
Great.

287
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,399
Don't visit me too often.

288
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,240
Uno...

289
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,799
No.

290
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,159
I leave "Search for God"

291
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,559
and the rest of the project

292
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,600
in your care.

293
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,519
I won't let you down.

294
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,759
(Are you always so well-coordinated?)

295
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,159
(He used Zhuge Liang
while you used Shouyue.)

296
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,840
(Not really.)

297
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,399
(He can perform well
with any positions.)

298
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,279
(He does well with any heroes.)

299
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,159
(So)

300
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,840
(he's been coaching me.)

301
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Why did you ask me out
in the middle of the night?

302
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,759
Is this about Yu Tu again?

303
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,640
I watched the video.

304
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,039
Every time the bunch of us

305
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,039
had a gathering,

306
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,880
you always found a way

307
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,319
to pry information about Yu Tu

308
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,119
out of us.

309
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,079
Was that so?

310
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,759
You told us

311
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
he was childish,

312
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,759
selfish,

313
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,039
and a perfectionist,

314
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,240
that you never regretted
breaking up with him.

315
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,200
Why is it so hard to move on?

316
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,880
Was I wrong?

317
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,759
Wasn't he selfish?

318
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,920
He gave up a handsome salary

319
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,319
for his dream to be an aerospace engineer.

320
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:36,559
Had I not broken up

321
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,599
with him back then,

322
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
I would have to
provide for our family.

323
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,000
Look at the housing prices.

324
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,440
Life in Beijing only gets more costly.

325
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,720
It costs a fortune

326
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,839
to pay for our kid's education.

327
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
Why should I take on the burdens

328
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,119
all by myself?

329
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,079
Everyone has their own pursuit.

330
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,039
And most importantly,

331
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,559
both you and Yu Tu

332
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,160
are

333
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,359
the self-centered type.

334
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,680
When you run into an argument,

335
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
none of you makes any compromise.

336
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,720
It was a subtle breakup.

337
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,200
It's been years since you broke up.

338
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,440
You were in love after that.

339
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
Why do you care

340
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,880
so much about his new relationship?

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
He broke up with you.

342
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,920
It's not like you still own his heart.

343
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,200
He can fall in love with anyone.

344
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,799
Anyone but Qiao Jingjing.

345
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,720
(Outstanding Performance Awards)
Up next,

346
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,920
(Outstanding Performance Awards)
Let's welcome the gold medalist of

347
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,960
National Mathematics Championship,

348
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,759
Yu Tu from Class 5 of Year 3

349
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,720
to give his speech.

350
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,599
Let's welcome him.

351
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,680
Yu Tu is amazing.

352
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
He won again.

353
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,200
I heard that

354
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,960
Qiao Jingjing has a crush on him.

355
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:08,759
You almost sounded

356
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:09,640
surprised.

357
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,240
There are plenty of girls

358
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,880
who like him.

359
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,319
Do you think

360
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,640
Yu Tu would fall for Qiao Jingjing?

361
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,839
She is very pretty.

362
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,359
I think...

363
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,920
he might.

364
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,160
That's what bothers you?

365
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,319
I wouldn't be bothered.

366
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,319
Her grades were mediocre in high school.

367
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,319
She confessed to Yu Tu,

368
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,400
but he turned her down.

369
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,000
Yu Tu was never

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,799
in love with her.

371
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
But now...

372
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,720
I must say,

373
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,279
fame sure does come in handy.

374
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,160
I'm leaving for Shanghai.

375
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,140
(Zhai Liang)

376
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,119
Yu Tu.

377
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,640
Xia Qing is in Shanghai.

378
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,599
She wants to make it up to us

379
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,559
and treat us to dinner.

380
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,839
She asked me to invite you.

381
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,039
It's either tonight or tomorrow night.

382
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,519
I'm busy. Tell her I won't be joining.

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,440
Okay, I was just asking.

384
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,559
I'm glad you rejected it.

385
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,640
Otherwise Qu Ming will
get under your skin again.

386
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
(Zhai Liang)

387
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:12,759
Yu Tu.

388
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,799
This Ms. Qiao...

389
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,079
Who is she?

390
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,440
It's Jingjing, of course.

391
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,799
Ever since you went back to work,

392
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,359
you've been barely at home.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,759
Seeing you in person is difficult than

394
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,680
winning ten matches in a row.

395
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,960
Be realistic.

396
00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:01,200
Ten-game win streak in solo matchmaking.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,720
Fine.

398
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
You don't carry me anymore,

399
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,440
and you haven't been playing.

400
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,519
Xia Qing came and asked me out

401
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,240
for a drink.

402
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,039
You know what that means

403
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,079
and what she wants.

404
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
It's weekend tomorrow.

405
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:22,720
If you have the time...

406
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm busy.

407
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:24,960
I don't see the point.

408
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,079
Fine.

409
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,839
Don't eat too much.

410
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,119
(Yu Tu is busy.)

411
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,039
(You know about the aerospace project.)

412
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,559
(The team is always working overtime.)

413
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,480
(He is too busy to hang out.)

414
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,240
(We live in the suburb.)

415
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,720
(A round trip takes three hours.)

416
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,880
(Send me the address)

417
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,839
(of his workplace.)

418
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,000
She sounds so confident.

419
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,440
(A message from Xiao Qing:
Zhai Liang told me you were working overtime.)

420
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,319
(Could we grab some tea later?)

421
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,140
(XS-2 Rover
Field Modification Requirements)

422
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,799
That's all for our plans

423
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,880
for the field test.

424
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,200
Are there

425
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,920
any questions?

426
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,279
Very well. Dismissed.

427
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
It's weekend,

428
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,359
go home and rest well.

429
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
(I'm waiting at the coffee shop)

430
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,119
(next to your workplace.)

431
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,759
We got off work at 8 pm.

432
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,279
We can bear hardship,

433
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,640
we have no fear for overtime work.

434
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,720
Let's go.

435
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,880
Let's have hot pot together.

436
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,839
Go on without me.
I have things to see to.

437
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:39,759
See you.

438
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:58,079
Miss.

439
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,160
Do you need more water?

440
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,519
Never mind.

441
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:01,359
Very well.

442
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Yu Tu.

443
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,839
Have you decided on
what I told you earlier?

444
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,279
If you have no plan

445
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,599
for our future,

446
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,359
then we might as well break up.

447
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,119
Fine.

448
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,240
So be it.

449
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,880
If I could win his heart back then,

450
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,799
I can win it again.

451
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,400
They were just playing games.

452
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,000
What's the big deal?

453
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,960
Don't be so obsessed with him.

454
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,440
Tons of people are wooing you,

455
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,119
but you want to get him back?

456
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:55,640
Yu Tu

457
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,759
is still working in the institute.

458
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,400
He's still getting that meager salary.

459
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,599
That doesn't bother you now?

460
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:02,960
I don't care

461
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
about his salary now.

462
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,079
He has a Ph.D.,

463
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,440
and works in the institute.

464
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,039
At least his social status is high.

465
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:12,079
Not to mention...

466
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,640
I can't move on.

467
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,680
(I can't move on.)

468
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,599
Your workplace

469
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,400
is quite a distance from the downtown.

470
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:47,960
Zhai Liang told me

471
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,519
your phone often has no reception.

472
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,640
He was right.

473
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,039
Was it for confidentiality?

474
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,480
Can't you have phones inside the lab?

475
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,079
What do you want?

476
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,920
I've been waiting for over two hours.

477
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,119
Do you expect me to leave

478
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,319
after just a few words?

479
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,599
Did you have your dinner?

480
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,759
Should we order some food?

481
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,759
I've had mine.

482
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:09,960
Sir.

483
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,359
May I take your order?

484
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:11,839
Okay.

485
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,720
Never mind, thanks.

486
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:14,079
Sure.

487
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,240
Zhai Liang and I sat here for a while.

488
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,640
You started working at
the institute again.

489
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:25,799
Yes.

490
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,680
He is worried about you.

491
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,680
He knew you were stressed.

492
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,200
But he didn't want to pry.

493
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:34,319
Is there

494
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,559
some issue with the investment bank?

495
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,079
Nothing.

496
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,400
I like it better here.

497
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,559
A person's mindset

498
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:46,799
can change.

499
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,440
I think

500
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,119
you're a man of focus.

501
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,519
The job at the institute suits you.

502
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,359
We were talking

503
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,559
about it last night at the gathering.

504
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,880
I even joked

505
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,680
that your brilliant mind

506
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,480
should best be used

507
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,839
for contributions to science.

508
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,279
I even argued with you

509
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,440
over this matter.

510
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,759
I was too young and silly.

511
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,599
I thought I was right.

512
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,319
By the way,

513
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,319
how did you end up

514
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,480
playing games with Qiao Jingjing?

515
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
We were discussing it

516
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,319
during the gathering last night.

517
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,799
Some blamed us for not

518
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,640
telling people we studied in the same
high school as her.

519
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,200
It's hard to tell people about it.

520
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,920
We barely know her.

521
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,640
Did you have a drink together?

522
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,000
I pondered on it,

523
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,359
but that seemed unlikely.

524
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,079
So as soon as they left,

525
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,519
I came by to confirm it with you.

526
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,000
So it really was her.

527
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,000
We were high school classmates.

528
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,000
It's normal that we stayed in touch.

529
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,240
Indeed.

530
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,319
But she was never

531
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,480
in the class chatroom.

532
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,359
I thought

533
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:32,880
she didn't like

534
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,440
hanging out with her old classmates.

535
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,599
Perhaps...

536
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
she is the most successful

537
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
from our class.

538
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,839
We, on the other hand,

539
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,000
haven't achieved anything.

540
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:48,920
The moment we step into society,

541
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
grades won't do us any merit.

542
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,319
It comes down to our EQ.

543
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,279
She graduated from a key university.

544
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,640
Is that so?

545
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:00,880
I didn't pay

546
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,359
much attention to her back then.

547
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,200
But I do find
her achievement impressive.

548
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,880
The showbiz is a complicated industry.

549
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,039
There are bad people in the business.

550
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,519
She has managed to find success

551
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,599
and become famous,

552
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,160
she must have sacrificed a lot.

553
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,200
Xia Qing.

554
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,640
I think...

555
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,880
I owe you an apology.

556
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,240
I accepted your love then

557
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,400
because you were
capable and independent.

558
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,559
But it never

559
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,920
occurred to me I should return your love.

560
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,400
It turned out that

561
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:45,920
I was not

562
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,119
an ideal choice for you.

563
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,279
But you were always smart.

564
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,359
You put an end to our relationship in time.

565
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,279
Is this supposed to be your generosity?

566
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:25,319
It's been too long since we last talked.

567
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,400
This is uncalled for.

568
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,119
I see now why you chose to work there.

569
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,000
After all,

570
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,640
worldly possessions no longer
concern you.

571
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,720
Hold onto your precious chance.

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,279
♪Happy Birthday to you!♪

573
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,920
(Jingjing, blow out the candles!)

574
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,200
(Happy Birthday!)

575
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,799
I...

576
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,160
I sent Xia Qing

577
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,160
the address of your workplace.

578
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,359
I hope you're not offended.

579
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,240
It's all right.

580
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,000
It was mostly because

581
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,039
she seemed a little obsessive

582
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,119
this time around.

583
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:52,160
I doubt

584
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,279
she would contact me again.

585
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,400
A heart of stone.

586
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,359
I forgot to remind you.

587
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,839
Did you tell them Jingjing and I...

588
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,680
were playing games together?

589
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,440
Of course not.

590
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,680
You told me not to tell anyone.

591
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,880
I just pretended I didn't know her.

592
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,519
I won't tell others

593
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,920
how bad she was at the game.

594
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,800
So...

595
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,679
in your heart, she's...

596
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,159
Cotton is

597
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,119
pretty adorable.

598
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,519
She is energetic and cute.

599
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,760
She's like a little girl.

600
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,320
You two studied

601
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,119
in the same high school,

602
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,280
but the distance...

603
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,800
is a little too far.

604
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,039
I'm not saying

605
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,719
she's beyond your league.

606
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,000
I think...

607
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,119
We played games with her

608
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,639
for almost two months,

609
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,320
and she disappeared

610
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,440
without a word.

611
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,000
A superstar should always

612
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,320
keep her distance from us.

613
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,360
Did you

614
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:12,679
see her go online again?

615
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,239
I checked the game history.

616
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,079
It's stopped

617
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,199
on the day of your match.

618
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,719
The last two matches

619
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,719
were impressive.

620
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,199
She gave me two tickets

621
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,199
and invited both of us.

622
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,519
But I didn't tell you.

623
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,000
What?

624
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,559
She gave me a ticket too?

625
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,159
It's on the bookshelves.

626
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:55,760
Zhai Liang.

627
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,119
I made her upset.

628
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,440
That's why she's gone.

629
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,599
She's not a bad person.
