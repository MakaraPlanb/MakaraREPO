No.

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,220
How long has it been since we last met?

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,420
Has it been a week?

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, something like that.

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,740
I knew it. I missed you so much.

What is it?

12
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,520
Why can't you just say it?

13
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:05,150
I can't bring myself
to say it to your face.

14
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,370
Let's

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,900
break up.

16
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,520
Of course.

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,810
Were you going to stay with me all night?

It's not like we are an item.

19
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,300
My love for you has stayed the same.
The love of a fan.

20
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,600
-As a fan?
-Since before you debuted.

21
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,260
It was even before Fins was established,

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,400
so I'm a true fan. Right?

23

-Ma-ha--
-Hold on.

24
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,290
You're more dangerous than I thought.

25

A sad soppy breakup isn't in your cards.

26
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,280
I'll get going then.

and look over them yourself.

Besides, it's not like you
to suggest a break.

This is exactly who I am.

179

Who warms up for half a day?

182
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:45,250
Something's up with you, isn't it?

183
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:47,930
Whatever.

184
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,370
Just get me my next movie, okay?

185
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,690
When did he become the Energizer Bunny?

186
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,950
Something's definitely up.

187
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,410
Where's Hyun-ji?

188
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,870
Maybe she went to the restroom.

189
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,240
She won't give me a moment to apologize.

190
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,420
I haven't seen her that mad before.

191
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,110
Jeez, you're so dense.

192
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,550
Hyun-ji.

193
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,790
I see you still have cold hands.

194
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,580
Here.

195
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,030
And use this if it cools down.

196
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm sorry, Hyun-ji.

197
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,560
That day.

198
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,110
I made a mistake.

199
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,330
I should've been more attentive,

200
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,580
and I'm really sorry.

201
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Will you accept my apology?

202
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,650
What a relief.

203
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,400
Maybe it's because we teamed up once,

204
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,910
but I was told we looked
the best together.

205
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,490
I overheard the staff talking.

206
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,200
Are you busy this week?

207
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,410
-Me?
-If you're not,

208
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,830
let's meet up briefly.

209
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,539
So are you in or out?

210
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,970
You agreed to a new album ages ago.

211
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,269
How can I get you on TV
when you don't do anything new?

212
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,730
You've been rejecting every offer.

213
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:01,120
That's because none of the projects
speak out to me.

214
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,980
La Ri-ma,

215
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,970
I went up Mount Halla last week

216
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,950
which took me ten hours.

217
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,500
I wore out my legs to get to the top,

218
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,190
but do you know how long I stayed there?

219
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,060
I descended 15 minutes later
after taking a few photos,

220
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,740
The place up top you're occupying
won't be yours forever.

221
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,380
I know that.

222
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,970
If that's the case,
why not release some albums,

223
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,130
show your face on variety shows--

224
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,360
Okay.

225
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,190
But I'll choose the songs
to release in my album.

226
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,560
And I won't just be on any variety show.

227
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,760
Only those that are
as popular as "Y.M.S.A.".

228
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,520
Okay?

229
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,140
[CEO Hwang Yong-tae]

230
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,290
"Y.M.S.A."?
Be the CEO yourself, why don't you?

231
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,330
I'm the CEO,
so who's she to call the shots?

232
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,790
So how are things going?

233
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,010
Music Holic and SJ Entertainment
will soon sign the contract.

234
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,820
And Queen Entertainment?

235
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:09,320
[CEO Park Jin-man]

236
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,970
Well...

237
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,770
I told you to focus on the deal with them

238
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,350
since we lack female artists.

239
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,380
La Ri-ma alone costs quite a lot.

240
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,520
Unbelievable.

241
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,940
Why take the difficult route?

242
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,850
Since when did we spend money
to get what we want?

243
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,130
Create a situation that goes in our favor,

244
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,850
and the money will come rushing in.

245
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,110
All we need is a headline that would work.

246
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,480
Gosh.

247
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,300
Book a meeting with
Queen Entertainment's CEO.

248
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,120
Hyun-ji.

249
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,040
I'm sorry for being so dense.

250
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,920
I was so wrapped up in my problems

251
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,530
that I made it hard on you and Ri-a.

252
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,990
I didn't even notice how you felt.

253
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,370
Why are you suddenly saying this?

254
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,500
You've always been a good friend
who worried about me.

255
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,670
It was my mistake.

256
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,540
I took you for granted
because you're my close friend.

257
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,940
I'm sorry for hurting you like this.

258
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,580
But

259
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,440
I have something to tell you.

260
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,790
I used to like you.

261
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,930
Since our training years.

262
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,120
Yu-jin.

263
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,710
-Did that surprise you?
-Why would you say that out of the blue?

264
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,080
Just because.

265
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,680
I just wanted to tell you how I felt.

266
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm finally unburdened.

267
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,800
You're so full of surprises.

268
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,860
I couldn't see it before
because I only had my eyes on one person,

269
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,940
but now I can.

270
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,290
I can feel the heart

271
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,120
that someone has for me.

272
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,880
He dumped me as soon as
he confessed his feelings.

273
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,820
That jerk.

274
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,230
Things were hectic,
so I forgot to share this with you.

275
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,680
Sorry.

276
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,630
Yu-jin

277
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,200
likes you, not me.

278
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,020
You know that he's a really nice person.

279
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,620
He's warm and always sincere.

280
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,350
Right.

281
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:08,790
Hyun-ji.

282
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,460
You've been keeping me company

283
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,840
from the first day I went to OMEGA.

284
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,800
I've always been grateful,

285
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,460
and I'll do better from now.

286
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,530
I won't be preoccupied,
and I'll focus on Tea Party only.

287
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,560
Okay.

288
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,910
I'm sorry

289
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,370
for being so small-minded.

290
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,230
Also,

291
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,270
I'm grateful.

292
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,160
Hey, B!

293
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,020
Don't look at her and keep the distance.

294
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,440
Hey.

295
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,330
A is here.

296
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,180
Hey!

297
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,570
Hello, Ryoc.

298
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,470
That's right. Act like this
when there are people around.

299
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,850
It's our lunchtime. Did you eat, Ryoc?

300
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,880
Join us if you haven't.

301
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,950
No, he can't! He has a meeting.

302
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,570
He has the meeting
for a variety show today?

303
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,200
I'll get going.

304
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,290
Good luck with your shoot.

305
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,000
Gosh, you guys.

306
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,680
Well done. Don't even exchange looks.

307
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,140
-Wasn't that weird?
-Both A and B were.

308
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,300
-There's something going on.
-That we don't know of.

309
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,150
Thank you.

310
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,130
I'm even more grateful.

311
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,800
I don't know how the words got out,

312
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:42,830
but so many brands want to do a PPL
on our show.

313
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,910
Of course. Ryoc has star power.

314
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,930
Now that you joined us,
let's raise the stakes.

315
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,440
-Thank you in advance.
-Thank you in advance.

316
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,630
-Here.
-Sure.

317
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,780
-It's nice to be busy.
-What do you mean?

318
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,290
It's been so long, Ryoc.

319
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,720
I thought you two would be
smiling like fools in love,

320
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,050
but things seem cold.

321
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,790
Did you fight with her?

322
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,180
Please lower your voice.

323
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,610
You two are old enough.

324
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,690
Thank goodness you're no longer
in the pool.

325
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,800
Hello, Ri-ma.

326
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,310
Hi, you're here.

327
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,380
I called her.

328
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,470
-Maybe I shouldn't have?
-I'll get going.

329
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,860
Darn it, maybe I went overboard.

330
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,140
Tell me, Lee Ma-ha.

331
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,320
Ab... About what?

332
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,490
Ab... About what?

333
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,570
What's with you two?

334
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,620
The thing is,

335
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,170
it's not like what you think.

336
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,020
Of course it is.

337
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,170
We decided to remain good colleagues

338
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,440
who cheer for each other, and...

339
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,380
And...

340
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,150
That's enough.

341
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:01,520
[Enjoy! Hot pepper chicken]

342
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,430
What's all this?

343
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,160
You can't leave unless you finish them.

344
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,450
Hurry up and eat them. They'll get cold.

345
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,390
Okay.

346
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,090
-It's good.
-It is, right?

347
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,960
Gosh, the coffee smells nice.

348
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,910
You won't kick me out
just because it's closed, right?

349
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,310
Of course not.

350
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,350
Oh, right. They dropped the charges.

351
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,850
It's thanks to you.

352
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,000
I didn't do much.

353
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,910
You wrote the follow-up article.
Thank you so much.

354
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,840
I only wrote the facts as a reporter.

355
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:53,170
Also, I got something in return.

356
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,720
I've told you before,

357
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,830
but if it's about Eun-jo...

358
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,630
It's not about him
who has no right to be forgotten.

359
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,850
It's about someone
who doesn't have any right at all.

Eun-jo and Annie

370
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,330
were a couple
even before their trainee days.

371
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,900
They had the same dream.

372
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,800
Eun-jo became a trainee in NOG,

373
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,280
and Annie joined OMEGA.

374
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,100
Eun-jo debuted as a member of SHAX
and became a top star.

375

But Annie couldn't even debut.

And one day,

377
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,180
I received a photo...

378
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:42,790
Annie was involved in
a scandalous case, wasn't she?

379
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,260
Someone anonymously
reported about Eun-jo's girlfriend

380
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,050
with this picture not so long ago
regarding his disappearance.

381
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,730
Why did you do that
when your debut is just around the corner?

382
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,610
There could've been other options.

383

I'm so sorry.

385

I'm not saying this

386

because you're seeing Eun-jo.

387
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,730
Didn't you think it'd harm the two of you?

388
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,330
I was worried that she'd get in the way
of Eun-jo

389

after their relationship gets revealed.

390
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,160
Did you tell Eun-jo about it?

No.

392
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,600
Eun-jo doesn't know about it.

Don't you know how crucial this period is?
