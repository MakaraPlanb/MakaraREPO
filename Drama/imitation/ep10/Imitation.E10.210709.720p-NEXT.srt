00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,028

to take over.

353
00:27:49,028 --> 00:27:50,428
What do we do now?

354
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:53,648
What if we get kicked out after the merge?

355
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:57,388
I'm sure some of us will be kicked out.

356
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:00,818
I practiced with all my might
for my debut.

Those jerks.

358
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:15,908
I thought it'd be
a good chance for you too.

359
00:28:16,388 --> 00:28:18,808
You went through a lot in our agency
because it was small.

360
00:28:19,688 --> 00:28:21,148
-Sir.
-Yes?

361
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:23,038
I liked working with Queen Entertainment.

362
00:28:23,738 --> 00:28:26,118
You had an eye for talented kids

363
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:29,808
and didn't save on the creative lessons
for the trainees.

364
00:28:31,568 --> 00:28:35,798
Although it wasn't a big agency,
I was proud of it.

365
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:40,678
But since when did you
start selling talents for money?

366
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:42,038
That's not it.

367
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:43,668
You sold me out

368
00:28:43,758 --> 00:28:45,558
to fire all those trainees?

369
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:47,758
Why would you mind them?

370
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,218
They have their own paths.

00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:01,501
I can't even sleep because of him.

529
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:29,441
Even if she doesn't mean it,
why couldn't she text me

530
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:32,821
saying I did a great job
and thank me for my trouble?

531
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,951
Gosh.

532
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:39,951
It's so cold.

533
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,851
Why is he still here?

534
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,481
It's cold by the sea.

535
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,351
Should I have brought a blanket?

536
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:52,451
Gosh, it's so cold.

537
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:55,701
It's so cold.

538
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,741
I guess he's leaving now.

539
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:41,641
[Dae-gwon]

540
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:43,131
Hey, Dae-gwon.

541
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:45,251
[Missed calls, Dae-gwon]

542
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:45,471
[Where are you?]

543
00:42:46,211 --> 00:42:47,271
[Pick up your phone!]

544
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,331

545
00:42:49,211 --> 00:42:50,661
[Dae-gwon]

546
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:50,791
[Where did you run to?]

547
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:52,371
[Hey, Ryoc!]

548
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:56,641
Gosh, it's so cold.

549
00:42:57,791 --> 00:42:59,241
It's so cold.

550
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:07,031
What?

551
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,341
What?

552
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:13,491
What?

553
00:43:14,951 --> 00:43:15,911
No.

554
00:43:16,271 --> 00:43:18,641
No!

555
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,521
You haven't left?

556
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:30,481
-May I borrow some money?
-What?

557
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:32,021
I ran out of gas.

558
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:39,231
You should've called someone.

559
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:41,211
If I do, Dae-gwon might faint.

560
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:42,451
That car is his treasure.

561
00:43:44,821 --> 00:43:48,121
I'm so tired
from trembling through the night.

562
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:51,381
It's so cold.

563
00:44:04,491 --> 00:44:05,631
Are we all done now?

564
00:44:07,001 --> 00:44:08,761
I'll give you a ride. Hop in.

565
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:11,841
It's okay. Goodbye.

566
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,741
Enjoy your lunch. Eat everything.

567
00:44:34,501 --> 00:44:37,051
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

568
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:38,721
Eat up.

569
00:44:42,811 --> 00:44:44,181
Why are you here?

570
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:45,941
What are you doing here?

571
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,801
Don't be so mean
to someone who came to help.

572
00:44:49,151 --> 00:44:50,471
That's not what I meant.

573
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:52,321
So you two were friends for a long time?

574
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:55,881
I thought he only looked handsome,
but he has a kind heart too.

575
00:44:55,971 --> 00:44:57,511
He came out here to volunteer.

576
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:59,141
And he helped out yesterday too?

577
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:01,861
I was a bit clumsy yesterday,
but I can do better today.

578
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:06,841
Come on, Dae-gwon.

579
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,641
It looks like you came
without telling him.

580
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:10,881
You should go.

581
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,911
Ma-ha, I want a rolled omelet.

582
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,671
A rolled omelet? Okay.

583
00:45:16,821 --> 00:45:18,761
You should fight with her
from time to time.

584
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:22,811
She came home for the first time in months
thanks to your fight.

585
00:45:22,901 --> 00:45:24,441
I'll fight her from time to time.

586
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:26,331
Leave it to me.

587
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:29,581
A cute bickering, lovey-dovey. Okay?

588
00:45:29,671 --> 00:45:32,001
Lovey-dovey.

589
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,791
All right, I have your egg omelet.

590
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:41,681
Who ordered this?

591
00:45:41,771 --> 00:45:42,831
I did!

592
00:45:44,101 --> 00:45:46,611
-Try some.
-Thank you.

593
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:47,761
Don't mention it.

594
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,371
I told you to go,
but you just won't leave.

595
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,231
Why do you suddenly pop up
and make my life hard?

596
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:00,821
Do you hold a grudge against me?

597
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:04,651
Why did you suddenly show up?
What are you trying to do?

598
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:06,371
You wanted to break up.

599
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,221
Let's at least stay in touch.

600
00:46:08,831 --> 00:46:09,801
What?

601
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:12,401
You know,
as a senior and a junior, as fans.

602
00:46:13,581 --> 00:46:15,701
We can do that, can't we?

603
00:46:17,021 --> 00:46:19,351
There's no reason
to treat each other like strangers.

604
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:20,801
The padded jacket incident.

605
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:23,131
Do you remember that?

606
00:46:24,101 --> 00:46:26,211
I realized how sensitives fans are

607
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,901
when that incident broke out.

608
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:35,541
They take notice of my feelings
even before I realized them myself.

609
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:39,761
We're people
who have to receive things from them.

610
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:43,331
We need their interest and love.

611
00:46:44,561 --> 00:46:47,201
If we stay in this relationship in secret,

612
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:50,061
our fans will end up catching on to us.

613
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:54,281
And Tea Party
just began to get people's attention.

614
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:58,461
I want to make Tea Party work
with Ri-a and Hyun-ji.

615
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:01,591
So I can't get involved in a scandal

616
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,631
with you.

617
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:07,831
Ma-ha.

618
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,651
If you forgot
all about SHAX, Tea Party, and Fins,

619
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:13,601
how would you feel?

620
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:17,601
How do you feel about me now?

621
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:29,881
Don't you see anything?

622
00:47:30,231 --> 00:47:31,591
What am I supposed to see?

623
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,131
The hidden truth.

624
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:37,451
Gosh, you're supposed to spot it.

625
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:46,421
This is...

626
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,611

Are you worried?

663
00:52:12,881 --> 00:52:14,031
Of course, I am.

664
00:52:41,351 --> 00:52:43,861
Ryoc, you went easy on her, right?

665
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,101
Did you keep the speed limit?

666
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:48,481
You won't make me pay a fine

I took such good care of you
that your career is spotless.

670
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:57,891
I hope you also didn't hurt my baby.

671
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:00,971
Why won't you say anything?

672
00:53:04,361 --> 00:53:06,251
-Dae-gwon.
-What now?

673
00:53:06,341 --> 00:53:07,621
I want to publicize my romance.

674
00:53:08,941 --> 00:53:11,091
Are you crazy? You're going public?

675
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:12,241
Have you gone insane?

You've gone crazy.

680
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:25,791
I knew something wasn't right
the moment he came to the cafe.

681
00:53:28,781 --> 00:53:30,761
I'm sorry everything came down to this,

682
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:33,931
and I was scared
this might affect SHAX negatively.

683
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:36,571
So I tried to hold myself back,

684
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:39,301
but I can't do this.

00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,671
Please understand me just this once.

00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,541
I know. I know that I'm being selfish.

687
00:53:49,461 --> 00:53:50,911
But I can't live like this.

688
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,941

00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:14,631
Fine, do it. Go public!

697
00:54:14,721 --> 00:54:15,731
Calm down.

698

Why didn't you tell me first?

699
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:25,631
I'm sorry.

700
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,291
Don't forget
just because you're a big shot.

701
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:33,551
I'm the leader.

702
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,511
You should've told me first
before you dropped that bomb.

703
00:54:38,831 --> 00:54:39,841
I'm sorry.

704
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:44,111
I knew how hard you work for SHAX.

705
00:54:45,431 --> 00:54:47,281
That's why it was harder to tell you.

706
00:54:50,751 --> 00:54:52,071
Please trust me, though.

707
00:54:52,731 --> 00:54:54,141
I won't let this hurt SHAX...

00:54:54,231 --> 00:54:56,121
I don't want to lose you
just as we lost Eun-jo.

709
00:54:58,011 --> 00:54:59,201
SHAX will keep going

710
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:01,581
to the very end.

711
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:02,681
Jae-u.

712
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:05,401
Why are you bringing Eun-jo into this?

713
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:10,551
I'm willing to do anything for our team.

714
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,491
Are you sure you'll be okay?

715
00:55:41,571 --> 00:55:44,171
Now that I actually took his hand,
I'm starting to get scared.

716
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:47,111
And the reality hits me very hard too.

717
00:55:48,921 --> 00:55:49,931
But

718
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:54,421
I don't want to deceive my feelings
or other people

719
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,111
any longer.

720
00:55:58,601 --> 00:55:59,831
What now?

721
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:04,101
It's because they have nothing to lose.

722
00:56:04,411 --> 00:56:06,741
No, that's not what I meant.

723
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,731
I get how you feel.

724
00:56:10,521 --> 00:56:11,711
I get it.

725
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,581
But this isn't the right timing.

726
00:56:17,081 --> 00:56:19,281
We need to take a special measure.

727
00:56:19,981 --> 00:56:22,181
They're making so many of us concerned.

728
00:56:23,811 --> 00:56:25,751
Kids, I'm busy.

729
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:28,341
I have to find an agency soon.
I got many people on the payroll.

730
00:56:28,431 --> 00:56:30,231
I need to release my song too.

731
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:33,581
What about my song?
When will you be finished?

732
00:56:34,241 --> 00:56:36,881
First off, we'll be the only ones
who know about this.

733
00:56:37,141 --> 00:56:38,681
And you all agree

734
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:41,101
that it's too early
to publicize their relationship, right?

735
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:45,191
Then where will they meet?

736
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:47,921
-If we stop them...
-He'll do anything to see her.

737
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:50,081
I'm worried they might

738
00:56:50,171 --> 00:56:52,851
end up getting caught by stalker fans
while they drive around.

739
00:56:52,941 --> 00:56:54,351
And the secret place is finished.

740
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,241
They can't be at a park or a mountain.

741
00:56:56,331 --> 00:56:57,951
I'm sure they'll manage.

742
00:56:58,041 --> 00:56:59,101
-No!
-No!

743
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:02,001
-They'll get caught soon.
-Whatever. I'm done with this.

744
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:04,201
Why do you act like
this doesn't concern you?

745
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:06,711
Then what? Should I get them a hotel room?

746
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:07,771
-A hotel room?
-What?

747
00:57:07,851 --> 00:57:09,261
-What hotel?
-Are you crazy?

748
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:11,371
-How can you say that?
-They'll manage.

749
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:12,651
-We can't let...
-Nonsense.

750
00:57:12,741 --> 00:57:15,471
Hey! All of you.

751
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:17,361
Has any of you ever dated?

752
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:21,101
-The safest hideout is your dorms.
-Dorms?

753
00:57:21,191 --> 00:57:22,951
-Can they be at yours?
-No.

754
00:57:23,031 --> 00:57:24,351
People have their eyes on us.

755
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,471
No, it'll be too uncomfortable.

756
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,711
-What about yours?
-What?

757
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:31,481
Well, I...

758
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:33,461
Our neighborhood is pretty quiet.

759
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:36,541
-And only Ri-a and Ma-ha live there.
-Hyun-ji.

760
00:57:36,891 --> 00:57:39,401
Okay, then they'll meet there. Happy?

761
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:40,591
No, wait.

762
00:57:50,271 --> 00:57:52,201
I practiced all these.

763
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:54,671
I practiced so much.

764
00:57:55,281 --> 00:57:57,401
I'm glad they could

765
00:57:57,481 --> 00:57:59,951
eat here and have coffee here,

766
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,101
but why do I feel lonely?

767
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:03,911
Right, Ryoc.

768
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:06,371
I need to get something from you.

769
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:09,761
-What is it?
-One second.

770
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:27,011
All three of them are cute.

771
00:58:42,941 --> 00:58:44,261
Where have I seen her?

772
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,451
If you aren't here for an inspection,
take a seat.

773
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:00,761
So who's she?

774
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:04,411
Oh, Annie?

775
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:07,661
-Annie?
-A former member of OMEGA-3.

776
00:59:07,931 --> 00:59:10,521
Ma-ha joined us when Annie left.

777
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:25,441
Ryoc.

778
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:29,001
I'll be done with this
once I get you to sign it.

779
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:33,581
[Let's be stars! Go, Ma-ha!]

780
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:14,281
Eun-jo.

781
01:00:33,241 --> 01:00:35,711
[Epilogue]

782
01:00:36,451 --> 01:00:37,601
[9:39 p.m., December 17th, 2016]

783
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,651
Where did he go in this snow?

784
01:00:40,061 --> 01:00:41,511
I should be taking you home.

785
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:42,831
Forget it.

786
01:00:44,461 --> 01:00:46,001
I'm sorry I couldn't walk you home.

787
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:48,641
You'll get cold. Hurry up and go home.

788
01:00:50,621 --> 01:00:51,851
Call me when you get home.

789
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:54,631
Bye, then.

790
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:09,541
Who is she?

791
01:01:10,161 --> 01:01:11,211
Ryoc.

792
01:01:15,661 --> 01:01:16,761
She's my girlfriend.

793
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:18,211
Your girlfriend?

794
01:01:19,271 --> 01:01:20,541
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you.

795
01:01:21,821 --> 01:01:24,191
-Today was our 3,000th day anniversary.
-Your 3,000th day?

796
01:01:30,131 --> 01:01:31,941
You've secretly been with her
for 3,000 days?

797
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:34,401
Ryoc.
