-Okay?

181

He's a famous lecturer on YouTube.

Noh Yang-jin is like an idol.

286

Idol singers don't last for that long.

287

fall for other stars.

was sold to another agency.

among us.

[-I was in OMEGA too.]

How could such a soft-hearted guy like you

that your apology is sincere?

Do you have any evidence to prove this?

722

and the desktop computer.

Could you testify
what you just said in court as well?

Of course, I'll bring everything.
