-Okay?

181
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,760

Then do you know who Noh Yang-jin is?

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,400
He's a famous lecturer on YouTube.

276

Noh Yang-jin is like an idol.

286

Idol singers don't last for that long.

287

fall for other stars.

was sold to another agency.

among us.

[-I was in OMEGA too.]

How could such a soft-hearted guy like you

that your apology is sincere?

Do you have any evidence to prove this?

722
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:39,710

and the desktop computer.

Could you testify
what you just said in court as well?

727

Of course, I'll bring everything.
