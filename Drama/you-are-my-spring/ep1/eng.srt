<i>was nowhere.</i>

6
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,786
<i>He was never there…</i>

7

<i>to begin with.</i>

00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:09,253
DECEMBER 1994, SEOUL

9
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,183
<i>Their story</i>

10
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:28,355
<i>had already begun a long time ago
in this town that seemed peaceful.</i>

11
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>The child didn't receive any presents
again last Christmas,</i>

12
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:43,996
<i>but she thought it was because she shed
some tears while yawning.</i>

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,039
All done.

14
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,126
<i>She believed in Santa Claus.</i>

15
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,640
<i>Here's her father.</i>

16
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:08,521
<i>No one thought lowly of him
besides himself,</i>

17
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:12,066
<i>but he never realized that,
so he drank every day.</i>

18
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,792
That's 800 won.

19
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,586
That's 2,000 won.

20
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,759
They don't look good.

21
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,470
I'll only take the soy sauce.

22
00:03:57,778 --> 00:03:59,071
<i>Here's the child's mother.</i>

23
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,116
<i>Everyone in the neighborhood knew</i>

24
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,035
<i>what she was going through.</i>

25
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:09,623
<i>But the mother had to put
something else before her pride.</i>

26

SANGJI GROCERY

27
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:17,298
Hey, you! You'd better stop right there!

28
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,758
My name is Kang Da-jeong.

29
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,844
I heard you're giving out food.

30
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,345
Like bread.

31
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,473
Books are much more valuable than bread.

32
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,893
They can satisfy your spiritual hunger.

33
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:31,687
God will save us through His words.

34
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,817
No way.

35
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,904
-Da-jeong, what about the bread?
-It was a lie.

36
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,741
Why didn't Santa Claus come to our house?

37
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,958
He did. He came, but he spat…

38
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,465
He suddenly had to use the bathroom,
so he went to take a dump.

39
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:00,841
He really needed to go.

40
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,801
I see.

41
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's hurry back.

42
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,539
Da-jeong, why is your face red?

43
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,458
What are you talking about? Be quiet.

44
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,002
Da-jeong, your face is bleeding.

45
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,921
Do you want your nose to bleed?

46
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,560
Mom.

47
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,856
The mermaid turned into bubbles.
What does that mean?

48
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,276
<i>THE LITTLE MERMAID</i>

49
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,327
A princess who has the world at her feet
falls for some guy she barely knows.

50
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,789
So she ditches her family and goes away.

51
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:17,001
But after going through so much hardship,
she ends up…

52
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:20,212
She ends up dying.

53
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,131
I want another book.

54
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,173
<i>THE HAPPY PRINCE</i>

55
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:32,683
The bird really digs out the prince's
left eyeball and gives it to a beggar.

56
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:37,604
The next day, it digs out the other
eyeball and gives it to another beggar.

57
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,317
And the bird lies on the cold ground
with its belly exposed

58
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:42,943
and dies.

59
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,236
<i>SNOW WHITE</i>

60
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,823
She's just so happy to receive the apple
and eats it right away.

61
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:50,409
So she dies.

62
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:53,829
But the dwarfs weep
because they don't want her to die.

63
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,164
<i>THE FAIRY AND THE WOODCUTTER</i>

64
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:59,001
A stupid fairy takes off her clothes
and scrubs her body in another town.

65
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:03,672
And some thief steals her clothes
and cuts a deal with her.

66
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,133
<i>THE BLACK CAT</i>

67
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,054
An alcoholic jerk kills his wife.

68
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,224
He puts her body in the wall
and covers it up with cement.

69
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,143
So no one knows about it.

70
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,236
But a black cat that was also put
in the wall with her body

71
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,740
meows when the police come.

72
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,494
So the jerk gets arrested.

73
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,330
I see.

74
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:43,170
<i>The child read</i> The Black Cat
<i>over and over again.</i>

75
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,508
<i>Because out of all the stories

76
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:50,552
<i>it was the most reassuring.</i>

77
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,807
Please stop it!

78
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,643
Why must I live like this? Why?

79
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,895
It's all because of you.

80
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,315
My life was ruined
because I ended up with a woman like you!

81
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,483
I didn't make you stay!

82
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,403
Just leave! Please!

83
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,612
Damn it.

84
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,198
What? You want me to leave?

85
00:08:11,281 --> 00:08:12,324
Is that it?

86
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,078
-After I put up with a stupid woman
-I bought tangerines, kids!

87
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,413
-like you?
-Dad!

88
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,834
-Please…
-Come here!

89
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:25,587
Damn it. Hey!

90
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,311
How come those darned kids
don't come out to greet their father?

91
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,105
-Please don't…
-Damn it. Come out!

92
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,356
-Please.
-Hey!

93
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:50,988
Don't you lay a finger on them,

94
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:54,533
-or I'll kill you.
-Fine.

95
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:57,995
You already ruined my life anyway.

96
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,580
Kill me.

97
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,707
Just kill me!

98

99
00:09:26,273 --> 00:09:28,817
<i>Her younger brother
didn't know how to read,</i>

100
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,738
<i>and she had a knack
for reinterpreting the stories.</i>

101
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:37,075
<i>So in their room, the plot
of </i>The Black Cat<i> changed every night.</i>

102
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:40,871
Once upon a time, there was a girl.

103
00:09:40,954 --> 00:09:44,833
It turned out that
her father wasn't her real father.

104
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,878
The man next door was her real father.

105
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:51,924
So they lived happily ever after.

106
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,969
The end.

107
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:04,978
Once upon a time, there was a girl.

108
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:09,358
The next-door neighbors turned out
to be her real family.

109
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:12,194
So she lived happily ever after with them.

110
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,404
The end.

111
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,573
Read me another story.

112
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,785
A story with a prince.

113
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:26,500

114
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,127
if you like princes or princesses?

115
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,422
You'll turn into bubbles,
get pricked by a needle,

117

178
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,582
You know I got mixed up with some weirdos.

179
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,750
Just weirdos?

180
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:28,421
You ought to be in the Olympics.
You'd win a gold in collecting trash.

181
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:30,465
Don't exaggerate now.

182
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:31,383
What?

183
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,135
An alcoholic, a two-timer,

184
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,722
a pathological liar, and a bum
who asked his girlfriend for money.

185
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:39,724
That was a long time ago.

186
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,351
That was this year.

187
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,898
I think only good things will happen here.
You know my hunches are right.

188
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,526
No, your hunches are usually wrong.

189
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:07,669
This is nice.

190
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,799
Hey, cover yourself.
Today's rainwater is dirty.

191
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,056
It's the smell of a new start!

192
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,224
I'm in Pungji-dong
where the murder took place.

193
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,435
The building was recently renovated,

194
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:09,064
and some tenants were scheduled
to move in starting today.

195
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:12,192
The entire building was empty
at the estimated time of the murder.

196
00:19:12,275 --> 00:19:13,818
The police began investigating

197
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,238
using the security and dashcam footage
from around the building.

198
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,793
Generally speaking, an abandoned body
means the culprit was flustered.

199
00:19:29,876 --> 00:19:31,711
But in this case, it's the contrary.

200
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,214
By abandoning the body,
the killer took it further.

201
00:19:34,714 --> 00:19:37,675
After getting the answer they wanted
by choking the victim,

202
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,719
<i>the culprit pretended
to release their hold,</i>

203
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,013
<i>stabbed the victim in the back,</i>

204
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,183
<i>then left the body for everyone to see.</i>

JU YOUNG-DO, PSYCHIATRIST

206
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,687
IS IT POSSIBLE
THE CULPRIT IS MENTALLY ILL?

207
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,564
<i>That's a difficult question to answer.</i>

208
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,568
<i>Being mentally ill doesn't make one
prone to commit more crimes.</i>

209
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,864
<i>Lacking MAO genes
or growing up in an abusive environment</i>

210
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,991
<i>doesn't cause antisocial behaviors either.</i>

211
00:20:03,326 --> 00:20:05,745
<i>Mental illnesses
and childhood environments</i>

212
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,332
<i>can only be factors
for a small minority of criminals.</i>

213
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:11,876
<i>So it could be a discriminatory notion.</i>

00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,471
MURDER OF LEE JEONG-BEOM
IN PUNGJI-DONG, 2018

217
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,997
My goodness. What the…
Why would you blow into my ear?

218
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:52,125
Why are you looking at me like that?

219
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,044
Why?

220
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:01,593
You're not a cop, but you come here
and sit in my chair whenever you want.

221
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:05,430
And you're reading the same case report
for the 3,000th time.

222
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:09,267
People might think that you're cuckoo,
but you're a doctor who treats cuckoos.

223
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,936
That's why.

224
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,315
I told you that the patients I treat
aren't crazy. They're just sick.

225
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,025
Real cuckoos end up here.

226
00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,485
Say hello, Detective Park.

227
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:21,905
This is our rookie.

228
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,948
Hello. I'm Park Ho.

229
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,200
Nice to meet you. I'm Ju Young-do.

230
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:29,954
He's our consultant. He's somewhat useful.

231
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,627
Why are you reading it again?

232
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,129
If I found anything,
I would have called you.

233
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:45,386
I understand that you want to do something
for your heart donor,

234
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,972
but I was his senior officer.

235
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,767
And I couldn't even catch his killer.

236
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,653
What is it this time?

237
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,413
That's a strong heart.

238
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:14,916
Jeong-beom's heart

239
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:17,210
is still beating.

240
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,508
Your food is here.

241
00:22:24,842 --> 00:22:25,843
I'll get going.

242
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,430
Leave already?
Have some food before you go.

243
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,016
-I need to go and pack.
-Are you going somewhere?

244
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,018
My clinic is relocating to the third floor

245
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,020
of Gugu Building
where the murder happened.

246
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:38,147
That's our district. Is it around it?

247
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,649
I told you, it's that building.

248

JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

250
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:56,833
You're arriving today, right?

251
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,792
Pardon?

252
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,461
Yes. I am.

253
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,796
Name?

254
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,923
Ju Young-do.

255
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:05,967
Elderly, right?

256
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,511
I'm not that old.

257
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,054
Wait.

258
00:23:11,597 --> 00:23:13,099
Who are you? You're so rude.

259
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:14,934
I'll talk to the hotel in Busan.

260
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,729
But the elderly tend to prefer
the floor heating system,

261
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,647
so I'm not sure if I can get it changed.

262
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,361
I want <i>jjamppong</i>.

263
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,697
-Come upstairs.
-Where?

264
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,561
What are you doing here?

265
00:24:00,396 --> 00:24:01,689
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i> or <i>jjamppong</i>?

266
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:06,110
-It was you?
-It wasn't me.

267
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:09,655
What are you talking about?

268
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,783
Whatever. I want to be alone.

269
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,117
I was about to go upstairs.

270
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,494
So which one is it?

271
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:18,706
Me too.

272
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,584
What?

273
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,171
I want <i>jjamppong</i>, too.

274
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,715
It looks so good.

275
00:24:32,178 --> 00:24:33,262
You've never met, right?

276
00:24:33,846 --> 00:24:36,182
He used to be my private tutor.
And she's my friend.

277
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:38,351
She's not your friend. She's my friend.

278
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:41,771
-I'm Kang Da-jeong.
-I'm Ju Young-do.

279
00:24:41,854 --> 00:24:45,024
Right. I know.
I also know you're not that old.

280
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,235
Right.

281
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,493
You spilled coffee beans this morning
and food now.

282
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:59,038
What are you going to spill
in the evening? Get a grip, will you?

283
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:08,089
Just because we were conceived
on the same day, which I never asked for,

284
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,925
we've had to split everything
in half since birth.

285
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:12,009
Not even a spoonful.

286
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:16,013
Fine.

287
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,975
You can gobble up
all of the carbs and salt.

288
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:22,145
That's enough.
We have instant sauce. Wait.

289
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,191
-Clean that up!
-Okay.

290
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,872
We need more tissues.

291
00:25:41,372 --> 00:25:42,373
Okay.

292
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,297
-Hold on.
-Okay.

293
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:09,984
A concierge manager, right?

294
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,447
Yes.

295
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,325
Isn't it so cool?
He's really good at this.

296
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,701
He can guess everything.

297
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:28,794
Well, he heard my call earlier.
He must've figured out I work at a hotel.

298
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,630
Come on. He can do more than that.

299
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,965
Right. Young-do, do that thing. Snoopy.

300
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,009
Snooping.

301
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,719
Same thing.

302
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:40,389
What else can you do? Give me an example.

303
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,517
Never mind.

304
00:26:44,977 --> 00:26:47,897
-What is it?
-I'll pretend I didn't see it.

305
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:50,858
See what?

306
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,948
Everyone has stories they want to hide
and things they don't want to hear,

307
00:26:57,448 --> 00:26:59,283
even if it's true.

308
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,827
So telling the truth
can be a form of assault.

309
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,664
What do I want to hide?

310
00:27:04,747 --> 00:27:06,999
It's okay. Everyone is like that.

311
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,088
Why don't you just tell me?
I'm curious now.

312
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:16,217
Right. I want to find out
why you only choose to date trash

313
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,595
and why you're turning down a decent man
when he wants to date you.

314
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,555
It's high time we found it out.

315
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,474
That's what he can figure out?

316
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:24,642
Totally.

317
00:27:25,476 --> 00:27:27,853
It may be uneasy
to listen to the innermost truth

318
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:31,148
in front of other people,
especially for someone like Ms. Kang.

319
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,071
Maybe you spilled the beans
without even realizing it,

320
00:27:37,154 --> 00:27:38,531
and he impressed you with it.

321
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:42,243
"You had a persimmon tree in the town
where you grew up

322
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:44,787
and a relative passed away
when you were young, right?"

323
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,163
I bet that's how he got you.

324
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:49,208
I'm pretty sure that's all fraud.

325
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:53,212
A legless bird, a trash magnet,
a black cat, and a red foxtail.

326
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:59,343
What is that? Some kind of password?

327
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,928
A legless bird.

328
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:04,181
You're scared of settling down.

329
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:07,518
You fear relationships
that require emotional commitment.

330
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,478
Why? You've been burned a lot.

331
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,481
You read the ending
of mystery novels first

332
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:16,402
and don't even watch a new TV show
unless you know it has a happy ending.

333
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:22,825
But I moved here to settle down.

334
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,410
You always start with that.

335
00:28:24,493 --> 00:28:27,705
"I'm really starting anew.
It's different this time."

336
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:30,499
But in reality,
you're still a trash magnet.

337
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,002
Bad men constantly come into your life

338
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:36,088
when in fact,
you're the one attracting them.

339
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,508
Are you telling me
that I enjoy being abused?

340
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,720
After recreating the exact same misery
you underwent,

341
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,847
you try to overcome it this time around.

342
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:48,476
You're trying to escape
your miserable memories.

343
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,187
If your life was miserable
because of an alcoholic,

344
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,565
you date another alcoholic,
so you can help him quit drinking.

345
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,067
But it doesn't work. Why?

346
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,235
You can recreate your misery,

347
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,863
but you've never learned how
to overcome it.

348
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:03,991
Then, what's the memory
you want to escape so badly

349
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,743
that causes repetition compulsion?

350
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:08,579
The black cat.

351
00:29:10,456 --> 00:29:14,085
You put the poster up in a place more
visible to others than yourself.

352
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:19,006
It means that the person you are looking
for or want is someone like a black cat.

353
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,843
In Poe's story, the cat comes back to life
even when it's killed,

354
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,805
and helps catch the killer by meowing
even after getting buried.

355
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,808
Your decision to hang a poster
other people find creepy

356
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:33,062
tells me that you identify with the victim
at a very high degree.

357
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:35,773
When you were young,
I think someone in your family…

358
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,235
Hey.

359
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,449
I'm sorry.
If I offended you, I will apologize.

360
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,492
Hey.

361
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,913
This is why I didn't…

362
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:55,126
But I'm curious about the red foxtail.

363
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:57,628
-Hey.
-Foxes aren't your animal.

364
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,089
He might be wrong about that.
Let's hear it.

365
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,466
He's been right so far, though.

366
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,509
Hey.

367
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:13,394
Leave family out of it.

368
00:30:25,614 --> 00:30:30,077
What makes the red foxtail more charming
is that it is clearly a flower,

369
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,455
<i>but it doesn't seem like it's showing off.</i>

370
00:30:32,538 --> 00:30:36,834
She probably doesn't like things
like flowers that are visibly pretty.

371
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,294
I think when she was young…

372
00:30:40,045 --> 00:30:41,505
Without mentioning her family,

373
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,759
I'll get to the point.

374
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,222
You know that you're pretty, Ms. Kang.

375
00:31:02,234 --> 00:31:03,319
What was that?

376
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:06,363
Was that your way of telling her
how you feel about her?

377
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,205
Hey, it's Kang Da-jeong!

378
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,794
Hey, it's my stalker.

379
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,477
Why do I have to introduce you two…

380
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:45,069
This is a man who's been chasing me
for over two months

381
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,279
when he doesn't even know me that well.

382
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:50,783
This is a man who assaulted me
when we just met today.

383
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,702
-I did?
-You said telling the truth

384
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,496
is also a form of assault.

385
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,090
Well, what do you say?

386
00:32:06,173 --> 00:32:08,509
Since there are three of us,
should we play some cards?

387
00:32:08,592 --> 00:32:10,094
Let's play next time.

388
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:12,847
I came here today
because I have something to tell you.

389
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,100
I'll leave you to it.

390
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:27,653
JU YOUNG-DO PSYCHIATRY CLINIC

391
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:30,114
He's on the third floor?
He's a psychiatrist?

392
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:32,533
A doctor ought to alleviate people's pain,

393
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,036
but he rubs salt in the wound instead.

394
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,755
Are you going somewhere?

395
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,093
Or do you just want to walk with me?

396
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,889
-Or…
-I'm trying to ditch you.

397
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,058
It's a great day for a walk, right?

398
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:00,436
The air's quite clean today.

399
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,772
Right. You can clean out your nostrils.
Good for you.

400
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,442
You really won't take this?

401
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,236
Don't waste it on me.

402
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,613
This flower means--

403
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:13,198
"I'll die in a week." That's probably it.

404
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,867
Gosh. No way.

405
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,291
What's your problem?

406
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,293
Why do you keep doing this?

407
00:33:24,376 --> 00:33:27,087
Because I'm not joking around.
I'm serious.

408
00:33:29,715 --> 00:33:32,009
Did I provoke your competitiveness?

409
00:33:32,718 --> 00:33:35,930
Or did someone tell you
that I'm a rich heiress, but I live

410
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,389
on the rooftop for kicks?

411
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,476
Why do you keep chasing me
when you barely know me?

412
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,896
Why do you keep turning me down
when you barely know me?

413
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,820
You're chasing a woman
after seeing her at a hotel.

414
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,198
And you tell me you like me,
but you bring me

415
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:56,200
some dead plant without its root.

416
00:33:57,451 --> 00:33:58,577
Ms. Kang.

417
00:33:59,161 --> 00:34:02,790
Other people call this a flower
and it makes them happy.

418
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:10,422
Even if I put it in water with some ice,
it will wither in a few days.

419
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,299
And the water will rot and stink.

420
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:16,178
I can't even recycle it,
so I have to throw it out.

421
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:18,806
But the thorns will rip the trash bag.

422
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,600
And the trash will spill out,
and my finger will bleed.

423
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,311
Gosh. Trash.

424
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:26,647
This is why I like you.

425
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,983
You're fun to be around.

426
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,444
Congratulations
on finding your entertainment.

427
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:38,367
You remind me of someone who would
actively fall for voice phishing.

428
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:42,079
"Hello, this is the police."
After hearing just that,

429
00:34:42,162 --> 00:34:45,040
you'd say, "Gosh.
Here's my bank account number.

430
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,544
And this is my passcode.
Someone must've used my account illegally.

431
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:51,130
Then where should I wire
my entire savings?"

432
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,384
What's up with today?
Why is everyone analyzing me?

433
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,095
I'll just throw the flower away.

434
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,016
You can't…

435
00:35:02,766 --> 00:35:03,809
What's important

436
00:35:03,892 --> 00:35:07,438
is that you don't hate me.

437
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,897
Right?

438
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,859
Because…

439
00:35:12,943 --> 00:35:15,738
I seem like a fool
who'd fall for voice phishing easily?

440
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,990
I think you're just scared
of relationships.

441
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,537
And if that's the case, you can date me.

442
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,080
Go out with me.

443
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,169
You should.

444
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,718
I'll be back tomorrow.

445
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:40,137
I was going somewhere.
I just stopped by to see you.

446
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,639
Gosh, I'm late.

447
00:35:56,429 --> 00:35:58,931
We have a VVIP group coming in today.

448
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:01,350
They asked for an extra humidifier
and air purifier.

449
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:04,270
You all read the notice
about the drama shoot, right?

450
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,605
-Yes.
-Yes.

451
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:06,773
Please cooperate,

452
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:09,901
but if you see them smoking,
don't let it slide.

453
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:12,320
Tell them to put it out
and report it right away.

454
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:18,409
Just to be clear, you can't put
profanity in your report like somebody.

455
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:23,873
You can't write things like,
"The production crew is going crazy."

456
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:31,547
Jeong-bin, this is your first time.
Don't just rely on the fire alarms.

457
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:34,133
The previous crew disassembled them
just to smoke.

458
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,010
Gosh, that's pretty bold.

459
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:37,595
I understand.

460
00:36:40,014 --> 00:36:41,307
-Mr. Min.
-Yes?

461
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,560
Do you have anything else to add
regarding the drama shoot?

462
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:53,820
Gosh. I can't believe
I'll be seeing Ahn Ga-yeong in person.

463
00:36:53,903 --> 00:36:56,364
But that's all makeup, right?

464
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,157
Without the makeup,

465
00:36:58,241 --> 00:37:01,410
she must have blemishes
like freckles or dark spots, right?

466
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:03,746
Should I ask her when I see her?

467
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:06,249
I'm joking.

468
00:37:06,332 --> 00:37:09,502
You know,
Ahn Ga-yeong had her wedding at our hotel.

469
00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:12,004
It'd feel weird to film
a wedding scene here.

470
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,005
Right?

471
00:37:20,596 --> 00:37:23,141
-You can't…
-What's important

472
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:28,354
is that you don't hate me.

473
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:29,522
Right?

474
00:37:30,106 --> 00:37:31,482
-What is it?
-What?

475
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,944
Oh. It's nothing.

476
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:44,203
Put it inside, please.

477
00:37:57,049 --> 00:37:58,176
<i>How many times</i>

478
00:37:59,385 --> 00:38:00,553
<i>have I…</i>

479
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:05,766
<i>thrown myself into the trash can?</i>

480

<i>is unavailable. Please leave a message.</i>

483
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,045
I'm at Hongdae.

484
00:38:36,172 --> 00:38:38,841
Answer your phone. I'm worried.

485
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:44,597
Hold on.

486
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,601
Sit.

487
00:38:58,444 --> 00:38:59,654
Why are you dating me?

488
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,534
Be honest. You're sick of me.

489
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:07,662
I can see through you.

490
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,563
Drink some water.

491
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:37,858
I'll call you in the morning.

492
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,629
<i>How come those darned kids
don't come out to greet their father?</i>

493
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,631
-<i>Please don't…
-Damn it. Come out!</i>

494
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:02,508
<i>-Please.
-Hey!</i>

495
00:40:05,594 --> 00:40:07,596
<i>Don't you lay a finger on them,</i>

496
00:40:08,264 --> 00:40:09,849
<i>or I'll kill you.</i>

497
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:13,561
Fine.

498
00:40:14,228 --> 00:40:16,689
You already ruined my life anyway.

499
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,817
Kill me. Just kill me!

500
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:23,821
Please…

501
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,990
Come here!

502
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:35,499
<i>The seven-year-old girl</i>

503
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,835
<i>who wanted to sleep.</i>

504
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,339

00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:44,258

<i>To scrape off an old scab,</i>

507
00:41:00,483 --> 00:41:02,151
<i>I was hurting</i>

508
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:05,696
<i>the healed skin as well.</i>

509
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,989
I'll get going.

510
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,543
Hey.

511
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,212
It's Kang Da-jeong.

512
00:41:22,421 --> 00:41:23,339
Hey…

513
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,885
My stalker waits for me
even at the bus stop now.

514
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,191
You got hurt. Did it bleed a lot?

515
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,110
You don't feel dizzy?

516
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:47,530
Given your condition,

517
00:41:48,197 --> 00:41:50,074
you should have a meal with me right now.

518
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,293
Has anyone called you trash?

519
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:06,173
Do you hate the thought
of eating with me that much?

520
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:10,928
Alcohol, drugs, lying, cheating,
perverted behaviors,

521
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:12,388
ghosting, and assault.

522
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,558
Have you done any of these?

523
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:23,691
Do you finally have questions for me?

524
00:42:34,201 --> 00:42:36,370
I can't tell you here.

525
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:42,918
Your usual. And the same for you.

526
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,560
When I first saw you at the hotel…

527
00:43:01,854 --> 00:43:03,022
"She's the one."

528
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:06,233
I could sense it.

529
00:43:09,278 --> 00:43:11,155
If you heard bells or something--

530
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,656
Sometimes I see

531
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,368
my childhood memories in my dreams.

532
00:43:19,747 --> 00:43:21,415
It was snowing a lot.

533
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,211
There were tangerines at home,

534
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:28,464
so I was watching TV while eating them.

535
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,511
It was really ordinary.

536
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:36,847
But I guess it was

537
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:39,600
the happiest day of my life.

538
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:46,273
When I first saw you,
that scene flashed through my head.

539
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,819
And…

540
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,660
in that room,

541
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:04,917
you were…

542
00:44:09,088 --> 00:44:10,589
by my side.

543
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,509
You were smiling.

544
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,805
You can…

545
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:22,643
take your time.

546
00:44:37,157 --> 00:44:39,034
<i>Did you tell Mr. Hong?</i>

547
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:40,369
<i>You like tangerines.</i>

548
00:44:40,953 --> 00:44:42,788
What are you talking about?
What about him?

549
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:45,582
He bought tangerines.

550
00:44:46,166 --> 00:44:47,668
Tangerines. Poems.

551
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:50,587
I don't like those presents.

552
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,174
Mom, you like handbags.

553
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:58,470
He should have brought tangerines
in a handbag. A plastic bag? How dare he?

554
00:44:59,054 --> 00:45:02,391
So what if they're sweet and pretty?
They're just fruit.

555
00:45:03,726 --> 00:45:06,103
Why did he think of me
when he saw tangerines?

556
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:11,191
Is using tangerines
to confess your feelings a trend?

557
00:45:13,569 --> 00:45:15,362
Did someone get some for you?

558
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,449
<i>What does he do? He's not ugly, right?</i>

559
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:21,076
I don't know him that well yet,

560
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:24,288
but he said what I like to hear.

561
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:30,586
Something about eating tangerines
in a warm room

562
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:34,882
while watching TV on a snowy day.

563
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:49,146
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELOCATION
FROM AHN GA-YEONG

564
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,903
You still work here, Ms. Oh.

565
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,991
I can see that you've been well.

566
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:03,994
Look at those babies.

567
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:06,038
Both top and bottom.

568
00:46:06,121 --> 00:46:07,122
I have been well

569
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:10,876
as I've been hassle-free
for the past few years.

570
00:46:10,959 --> 00:46:12,920
Right up until a moment ago.

571
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,548
Gosh. This scarf is beautiful, isn't it?

572
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,634
He gave me the same one.

573
00:46:19,218 --> 00:46:20,969
Was it last year? Or two years ago?

574
00:46:22,137 --> 00:46:23,514
Anyway, it was long ago.

575
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:28,185
I should find it and give it away.
Where did I shove it?

576
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:31,563
Okay. She will tell you what to do.

577
00:46:34,733 --> 00:46:35,818
I'm here.

578
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,826
You don't want me here.
I'll wait downstairs.

579
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:48,330
-I'll see you around.
-Okay.

580
00:46:48,914 --> 00:46:49,748
Sure.

581
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:51,542
Okay.

582
00:46:58,424 --> 00:46:59,842
Goodbye.

583
00:47:01,677 --> 00:47:04,513
A psychiatrist's personal life
can't be known to patients.

584
00:47:04,596 --> 00:47:06,432
Transference is needed in therapy,

585
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:08,851
and the more information they have on me--

586
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:12,187
Fine. Yes. I know.
It will be hard for you to treat them.

587
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,650
I heard that when you exploded on me for
putting our wedding photo at the clinic.

588
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:18,527
Then why are you doing this?

589
00:47:20,612 --> 00:47:25,826
People don't think a couple can
stay friends after their divorce.

590
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,036
But we can. Are we not normal?

591
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,581
No. You're being really weird right now.

592
00:47:30,664 --> 00:47:33,167
We didn't get a divorce
because one of us messed up.

593
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,376
We didn't break up…

594
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:39,214
because I'm crazy or anything.

595
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:44,678
How could you not be happy to see me?

596
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:48,348
-Have you been getting counseling?
-Aren't you tired

597
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,476
of wondering if I'm crazy or not?

598
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,269
Is that the only question you have?

599
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:53,437
No.

600
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:58,150
How many sleeping pills do you take?

601
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:00,235
Two?

602
00:48:00,819 --> 00:48:01,737
Three?

603
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,072
-Four?
-Four…

604
00:48:05,866 --> 00:48:06,867
You doubled it?

605
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:10,370
Was that your request or…

606
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,581
Maybe it's because you nag twice as much.

607
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,461
What's the matter?

608
00:48:18,086 --> 00:48:20,380
Why are you asking?
You won't even help me.

609
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,174
You won't treat people you know.

610
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:24,343
You came to tell me anyway, didn't you?

611
00:48:25,928 --> 00:48:28,889
I'll leave without telling you.
That way, you'll worry about me.

612
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,602
I'm very sick.

613
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:42,110
Yes. Bring the car to the main road.

614
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,812
Hey. I just saw Ahn Ga-yeong.

615
00:49:16,895 --> 00:49:18,939
She's filming a drama
at the hotel next week.

616
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,066
She even got married at the hotel.

617
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,193
Why?

618
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,946
-What?
-Be quiet.

619
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,365
What?

620
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:29,950
Look.

621
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:32,035
Yes. That's the hotel I work at.

622
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:33,245
Exactly.

623
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:36,665
Don't just look at the photo.
Read what it says here.

624
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,127
"Actress Ahn Ga-yeong and Psychiatrist Ju,

625
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,796
who was the medical consultant
for <i>Doctor Criminal</i>,

626
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,257
get divorced after only a year…"

627
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:50,220
Have a good day.

628
00:49:54,808 --> 00:49:56,476
Thank you. Bye.

629
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,691
-I told you.
-That's why…

630
00:50:04,109 --> 00:50:06,111
He did look familiar, neck down.

631
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:09,906
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELOCATION
FROM AHN GA-YEONG

632
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:12,576
-Wait.
-Gosh.

633
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,371
Goodness. There you go again. Gosh.

634
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:20,542
Ms. Oh told me to throw this out.

635
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,420
But the plant is still alive.

636
00:50:25,213 --> 00:50:26,381
You think so?

637
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,925
She says the plant is cursed.

638
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,595
But it was a present.

639
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:34,806
If this stays, I go.

640
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,475
End of story.

641
00:51:07,547 --> 00:51:08,590
Oh, no.

642
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:10,610
Oh, no!

643
00:52:14,448 --> 00:52:16,074
Let's put this here for now.

644
00:52:16,158 --> 00:52:17,617
I'll look for a bigger bucket.

645
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:19,327
Okay.

646
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:21,663
You still don't think the plant is cursed?

647
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:32,674
Cheol-do.

648
00:52:33,759 --> 00:52:36,428
Can you check on the fourth floor?
There's a water leak.

649
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:40,974
But Da-jeong went to a convenience store
since the coffee shop was full earlier.

650
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:43,059
I see.

651
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,606
You washed your hair.

652
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,487
I often wash my hair at night.

653
00:52:54,613 --> 00:52:56,281
Are you here to see me?

654
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:58,450
Don't be silly.

655
00:52:59,367 --> 00:53:01,787
I often sit on this bench.

656
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:04,539
I see. I mean,

657
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:08,376
you were on the bench I could easily see
from the car, so I was just wondering.

658
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,378
I'm very busy right now.

659
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:11,630
06M 5381

660
00:53:11,713 --> 00:53:13,006
Are you free this weekend?

661
00:53:14,049 --> 00:53:15,675
I'm busy on the weekend, too.

662
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,260
Come on.

663
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:22,682
What? Do you think I'm in my bed all day

664
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,852
watching <i>Guardian</i> and reciting
Eun-tak's lines again and again?

665
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,771
Is that how you spend your weekend?

666
00:53:31,149 --> 00:53:32,067
No, it's not.

667
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,278
Gosh. I lost my focus.

668
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,739
You're reading entertainment news.

669
00:53:38,698 --> 00:53:41,243
It's about a drama
that will be filmed at the hotel!

670
00:53:41,326 --> 00:53:43,495
I see. Okay.

671
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:51,711
"Akheubukjutdan."

672
00:53:52,337 --> 00:53:54,047
Is it a Russian drama?

673
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,218
Who said you could look?

674
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:04,349
You're leaving your coffee for me?

675
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:05,433
Can I drink it?

676
00:54:05,934 --> 00:54:07,602
-There's a water leak.
-This weekend…

677
00:54:17,028 --> 00:54:18,780
I thought you guys were done talking.

678
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:22,868
We are.

679
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,203
What about the water leak?

680
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:28,248
Let me go up and check on it.

681
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,292
-Now?
-Is it too late?

682
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,215
Let's just call a plumber.

683
00:54:39,593 --> 00:54:42,345
The leak might be caused
by a pool of water.

684
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:44,431
Let me turn on the water.

685
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,975
Be gentle.
I cranked up the water pressure.

686
00:54:47,058 --> 00:54:47,976
Oh, no.

687
00:54:48,977 --> 00:54:51,271
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

688
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,189
Goodness! Oh, my!

689
00:54:57,944 --> 00:54:59,279
Hold on.

690
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:11,666
Hey, Mom.

691
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:14,461
I'll call you later.
I'm watching a cobra show.

692
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,922
No. I'm okay.

693
00:55:17,005 --> 00:55:18,340
That cobra…

694
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,060
It's dead.

695
00:55:43,114 --> 00:55:45,283
I'll buy you the same one.

696
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,872
I don't see any water trapped here.

697
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,208
I don't get why it's leaking.

698
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:56,294
I should have called a plumber.

699
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:02,592
Can I check your washing machine
just in case?

700
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,935
Maybe another time.

701
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,822
If you don't have a passport too,

702
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:26,658
you won't get
the health insurance benefits.

703
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:28,201
Is that okay?

704
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:52,350
Hello.

705
00:57:04,195 --> 00:57:05,947
You see patients at night, too.

706
00:57:06,698 --> 00:57:08,700
You work at a university hospital as well.

707
00:57:10,785 --> 00:57:11,870
Please sit.

708
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:14,331
Do I have to?

709
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,461
No.

710
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:22,088
Suit yourself.

711
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:28,678
You're a US citizen.

712
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:32,098
You've seen a psychiatrist before, right?

713
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:34,684
-People there see shrinks--
-No.

714
00:57:35,977 --> 00:57:37,604
I suddenly got upset today.

715
00:57:39,773 --> 00:57:41,107
Why?

716
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,570
I think you're surveilling me.

717
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,619
Have you ever felt
you were being watched before?

718
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:57,832
You must think I'm really here
as your patient.

719
00:58:20,105 --> 00:58:22,107
If you're not here as my patient…

720
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:26,945
Then what?

721
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:33,827
It's the other way around.

722
00:58:36,037 --> 00:58:39,165
You walked into my sight.

723
00:58:41,334 --> 00:58:42,419
Just like now.

724
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:57,183
Why did you put your foot under mine?

725
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:04,107
Is that what you mean?

726
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,073
I'm here as a patient.

727
00:59:12,907 --> 00:59:15,577
That way, whatever I say,
you have to keep your mouth shut.

728
00:59:19,205 --> 00:59:20,582
To keep your license.

729
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,006
Great.

730
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:33,344
Then did you come to my clinic--

731
00:59:33,428 --> 00:59:34,637
Do you like Ms. Kang?

732
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:49,319
Because I do.

733
00:59:55,408 --> 00:59:57,160
CHAE JUN
AMERICAN

734
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,278
Do you think I bought a new jacket
to cover up the rapist's face?

735
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:14,489
I became a cop to catch bad guys,

736
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:17,784
but I'm their caretaker,
protecting their identities. Seriously.

737
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:20,453
Why do they always do this
during my mealtime?

738
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:21,746
Come on.

739
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:26,835
You know what? As soon as I catch
that bastard, I'm turning in my badge.

740
01:00:28,336 --> 01:00:30,880
-What? You don't think I mean that?
-No.

741
01:00:33,299 --> 01:00:34,425
What is it?

742
01:00:35,176 --> 01:00:36,845
I brought a delicious treat.

743
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:41,015
Why didn't you come sooner?

744
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:43,893
I missed you a lot.

745
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:48,022
MURDER OF LEE JEONG-BEOM
IN PUNGJI-DONG, 2018

746
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,774
About the Pungji-dong case,

747
01:00:50,316 --> 01:00:52,277
do I have access to any files?

748
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:55,572
You can access anything in there.
You're our consultant.

749
01:00:55,655 --> 01:00:57,699
Classified files won't open there anyway.

750
01:00:58,533 --> 01:00:59,576
Really?

751
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:05,582
Why?

752
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:09,169
Are you scared to live in that building
because the culprit

753
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:10,295
hasn't been caught yet?

754
01:01:10,378 --> 01:01:13,506
Goodness. Were you scared?

755
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,801
I was wondering if he would reveal himself
as a defensive behavior.

756
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:21,055
In layman's terms?

757
01:01:25,018 --> 01:01:28,813
"The culprit always returns
to the scene of the crime."

758
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:35,195
THE MURDER CASE ON THE 3RD FLOOR
OF GUGU BUILDING…

759
01:01:36,362 --> 01:01:38,698
If you had coffee,
let's drink water on the rooftop.

760
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:39,782
Shall we go upstairs?

761
01:01:39,866 --> 01:01:40,700
No.

762
01:01:41,284 --> 01:01:42,952
How about some air on the rooftop?

763
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:45,788
-Shall we?
-No.

764
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:53,046
Gosh. Random people
can come and go as they please.

765
01:01:53,129 --> 01:01:55,423
I'm so worried. Should I walk you up?

766
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:57,550
No.

767
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,012
It won't work. What should I do?

768
01:02:01,554 --> 01:02:03,223
Should I think about that upstairs?

769
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:04,307
No.

770
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:08,311
Right? Even if it's a rooftop,
it's your personal space.

771
01:02:08,394 --> 01:02:10,730
Besides, it's quite late.
Can I still go up?

772
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:33,920
This is a present.

773
01:02:35,046 --> 01:02:37,924
But it was in the hallway for a while.

774
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,267
"Congratulations on your relocation.
From Ahn Ga-yeong."

775
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:48,351
Oh, no.

776
01:02:56,317 --> 01:02:59,529
I didn't know you were divorced.

777
01:03:01,572 --> 01:03:03,992
Getting a divorce isn't a joke or a flaw.

778
01:03:04,075 --> 01:03:05,493
Sorry about what I said.

779
01:03:09,372 --> 01:03:10,248
What?

780
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:13,710
When we were having <i>jjamppong</i>,
you were so blunt, so out of anger, I said

781
01:03:13,793 --> 01:03:18,715
you never date and are stuck at your
clinic because you always analyze people.

782
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:22,635
I said you would get a divorce within
a year since you have two hair whorls.

783
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:28,266
But I don't know much
about double hair whorls.

784
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:31,477
Well, is it like a two-horse carriage?
Or double headlights?

785
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:32,937
Or <i>ssanghwacha</i>?

786
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:36,065
You never said that.

787
01:03:40,778 --> 01:03:41,863
Oh.

788
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:48,536
Actually, I said it to Eun-ha.

789
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,122
-I see.
-Anyway…

790
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:53,666
I'm sorry.

791
01:03:54,834 --> 01:03:57,253
When we first met,
I said you were a trash magnet…

792
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:00,965
Anyway…

793
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:05,887
If you're sorry,
can you take care of this for me?

794
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:10,808
-No.
-But you said you're sorry.

795
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:13,519
Yes, I'm sorry, but no.

796
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:15,730
-Why not?
-I don't want to kill again.

797
01:04:16,314 --> 01:04:18,608
-Who did you kill?
-Everything except that one.

798
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:22,820
Every plant I had including herbs
and cacti ended up dying.

799
01:04:22,904 --> 01:04:24,155
Just water it occasionally.

800
01:04:24,238 --> 01:04:26,157
They die
even when I water them diligently.

801
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,910
You probably watered them
until their roots rotted.

802
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:33,581
Whether it's dating or growing plants,
you give them

803
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:35,500
-every piece of you.
-That's enough.

804
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,460
Defense mechanisms just come out

805
01:04:37,543 --> 01:04:39,796
without you even realizing it.

806
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:41,964
You might find this hard to hear, but--

807
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:45,009
Whether it's analyzing me, deducing,
or guessing, just stop it.

808
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,761
-Can I say one more thing?
-No.

809
01:04:46,844 --> 01:04:48,554
-I'll just say it anyway.
-Stop it.

810
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,098
Don't see him.

811
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,365
I…

812
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:10,868
wasn't going to see him.

813
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:13,663
That's a relief.

814
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:21,045
All right, then.

815
01:05:23,464 --> 01:05:24,382
Take your plant.

816
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:26,676
-No need to thank me.
-You must be crazy.

817
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:28,344
I'll come by from time to time.

818
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:30,805
-Come where? Who said you could do that?
-Thanks.

819
01:05:31,347 --> 01:05:33,015
I really might end up killing it.

820
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:34,934
Have a good night, Ms. Kang.
