00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
(Praomook)



19
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,380
Why did you take me here?

20
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,219
To relieve your stress.

21
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,619
Your special order has arrived.

22
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm going home.

23
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,260
Oh, you can't leave yet.

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,860
Mook has prepared
everything for you.

25
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,499
Do you want to ruin her plan?

26
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,019
Isn't that right, Mook?

27
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:51,019
Right.

28
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:55,339
This is for you. I don't want
you to get drunk somewhere else.

29
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,619
Think of it as
you're DJ Prao's VIP guest.

30
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,819
Do you want to try?

31
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,220
Sure.

32
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,220
Let me.

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Come here.

34
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:11,460
This is play control.

35
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,860
Mook is with him. Don't worry, Pat.

36
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,420
That's a relief.
Mook is always there for him.

37
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,980
Please take care of my son.

38
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,980
Of course.

39
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:17,939
Thank you.

40
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I'm sorry.

41
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,780
I'm sorry for looking down on you

42
00:05:08,499 --> 00:05:09,980
and thinking that
you're an irresponsible person.

43
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,420
Today I saw that you don't
fool around with your life.

44
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,780
No matter what you do from now on,

45
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm willing to support you
in everything.

46
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,699
What do you want in return?

47
00:05:26,499 --> 00:05:30,379
I just want to watch you
go forward on your own.

48
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,860
Are you sure I can do that?

49
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,059
I believe in you.

50
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,540
I accept your apology.

51
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
Thank you for believing in me.

52
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:46,859
Well.

53
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,059
You look much better now.

54
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,059
If you want to stay over,

55
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,510
you can stay in the studio.

56
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,780
I'm selfish like you.

57
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
We're different.

58
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,780
I do what I do for my family,
for the company, for your future.

59
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,260
Have you ever asked me

60
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,859
if I want that future?

61
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,179
I don't want it.

62
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,500
You may be successful in life.

63
00:08:58,219 --> 00:08:59,380
To me,

64
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,660
you're a bad father.

65
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,059
Lan!

66
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,620
Dear!

67
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:09,699
Lan.

68
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,339
I'm sorry.

69
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:07,979
Can I take a shower?

70
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Sure.

71
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,420
Stay still.

72
00:10:22,219 --> 00:10:23,380
I'll move.

73
00:10:56,979 --> 00:10:58,979
- Oh no.
- Hey!

74
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,579
Lan, there's a gecko.

75
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:01,699
- Lan.
- What?

76
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:03,140
There's a gecko. Get it out of here.

77
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,459
- Then stay still.
- Get it out of here.

78
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:06,819
- I know. Just get it out of here.
- Come on.

79
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:09,459
Just get it out of here.
I don't care how.

80
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,380
- Please get it out of here.
- Alright, alright.

81
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,780
- Oh my goodness.
- I can't do it if you don't let go.

82
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,620
I won't let go. Just find a way.

83
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,260
- Come on, Lan.
- Hey!

84
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,260
Is it gone?

85
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,339
- Calm down.
- Get it out of here.

86
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,339
- Lan!
- Don't get excited.

87
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,020
Focus on the gecko.

88
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:42,020
- Oh.
- What?

89
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,900
It disappeared.

90
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,859
What? How?

91
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:49,699
You have to find and catch it.

92
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,979
Otherwise, it will come after me
and I will die.

93
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:54,819
Do you hear me?

94
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,540
It's a sin to
ruin people's happiness.

95
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:02,339
You will be punished.

96
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,059
Do you think I'm scared?

97
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,380
I'm not scared. I'm not scared.
I'm not scared.

98
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,260
Hey!

99
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,420
You have something on your head.

100
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,699
What is it?

101
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,300
- What is it?
- Don't move.

102
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:24,540
What is it?

103
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,380
What is it?

104
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,020
It's this.

105
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,699
- Where are you going?
- No!

106
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:34,459
- What?
- No!

107
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,099
No, get it away!

108
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:39,059
Come here.

109
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:40,179
No!

110
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,219
No, get it out!

111
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,179
- How do you like that?
- Get it out!

112
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,740
It ran off.

113
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:52,979
What?

114
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,660
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

115
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,819
Watch this!

116
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,059
- Lan!
- What? There's nothing.

117
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,819
- Jerk, you scared me.
- Ow.

118
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:18,020
- Take this.
- Hey, duckling, stop.

119
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:38,459
Oh no!

120
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,140
Lan, close your eyes.

121
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,660
- Right, got it.
- Don't look. Close your eyes.

122
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,140
- Both eyes.
- Okay.

123
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,699
Let go of me. Lan, come on.

124
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:53,219
- Open your eyes when I say so.
- Okay.

125
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:55,179
It's not like I want to look.

126
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,740
Lan!

127
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,459
- Oh.
- Move.

128
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:06,579
Ow!

129
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:41,899
Cute.

130
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
What?

131
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,059
Hey.

132
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,190
Are you scared that
I will do something?

133
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,379
Nonsense. I'm not scared.

134
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,710
You aren't scared, right?

135
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,379
Then explain this.

136
00:15:17,859 --> 00:15:19,339
Do you think it will keep you safe?

137
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:29,540
Well, which cheek
should I start with?

138
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,419
It won't keep you safe.

139
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:55,899
What are you doing?

140
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,020
You said you weren't scared.

141
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:00,619
I won't do anything to you.

142
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:23,419
Petch.

143
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:29,139
Did you come here by yourself?

144
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:30,899
Yes, I did.

145
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,139
There's a very important guest
at my house.

146
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,619
I don't want the owner of this house
to feel lonely, so I came over.

147
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,300
Wait, Petch.

148
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:43,740
The thing is...

149
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:55,950
I can't contact Lan. I'm worried
So I came here.

150
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:58,300
Lan is away right now.

151
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,579
But don't worry.
He can handle himself.

152
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,780
I know that but I can't help it.

153
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,470
If you're worried about him,

154
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,260
you can drop by every day.

155
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,899
You're always welcome at this house.

156
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,059
What do you want in return?

157
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:23,099
I just want to support
my friend's love life.

158
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,579
I want to support you too.

159
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,300
I want Mook to
finally find her own love.

160
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,099
I don't support you two.

161
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,980
This is an adult matter.
A kid should stay out of it.

162
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,220
I'm not a kid. I'm mature
enough to know what is proper.

163
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,020
Not only do you
try to be the other woman,

164
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,099
but you also try to destroy
the love between two people.

165
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,579
No.

166
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:56,980
I'm not destroying anyone's love

167
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,819
because there's no love
in the first place.

168
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,500
Then take a look at this.

169
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,940
Do you see love in this picture?

170
00:19:29,659 --> 00:19:31,419
(Delete)

171
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,379
(Delete)

172
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,740
There's nothing to see now.

173
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:41,940
Anything else?

174
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:50,500
Your behavior is immoral.

175
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,659
You don't care about others.
You only care about yourself.

176
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
You're selfish.

177
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:56,619
Nampetch,

178
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,260
you're crossing the line.

179
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:03,379
Honestly,
what are you insulting me for?

180
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,579
Your sister, Lan,

181
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,500
Rut, or yourself?

182
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,020
If you're doing it for yourself,
you're just as selfish.

183
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,700
Nampetch, stop.

184
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Come here.

185
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,740
Come here.

186
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,500
Nuch is my guest.
You have no right to do that.

187
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,980
If you're still acting immature,
you will not come here again.

188
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Rut.

189
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,659
Have you changed your mind?

190
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,020
No, I haven't.

191
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
Here.

192
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,780
Are you calmer now?

193
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:06,020
If you are, you should have
a talk with your father.

194
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,619
I don't want to talk to him now.

195
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,899
If you say so.

196
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,139
Life is unpredictable.
Anything can happen.

197
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:34,659
If you have a problem,
you should solve it quickly.

198
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:38,139
You don't know
what tomorrow will bring,

199
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,020
if you will be alive or dead.

200
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,579
Look at me and my dad.

201
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,099
I have tomorrow,

202
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:48,579
but my dad doesn't.

203
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:13,980
I have to go to work.
Tell Lan to call me when he's back.

204
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
Sure.

205
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:21,059
- Nuch.
- Lan.

206
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,859
She was worried because she couldn't
contact you, so she came here.

207
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,460
I'm fine. Thanks for your concern.

208
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,980
I'll leave you two alone.

209
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,980
If something is troubling you,
you can talk to me.

210
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,379
If you mean my dad,
I already handled that.

211
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Really?

212
00:23:56,819 --> 00:23:58,500
I have good news for you.

213
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:01,500
Your company launch video
has over a million views.

214
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:05,419
With this great feedback,
your company will do well.

215
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,700
I know you can achieve anything
that you set your mind to.

216
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,940
What if I don't succeed?

217
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,700
That day won't come. I'm sure of it.

218
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,740
A reward for being awesome.

219
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:38,700
I should head to work.
See you later.

220
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,099
What did your dad say

221
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,899
about you resigning?

222
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,460
He was angry
and we fought, as usual.

223
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,859
He wouldn't let me quit.

224
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,020
Did you tell him the reason

225
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:38,300
why you're resigning?

226
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:40,339
No.

227
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,980
You know I can't tell him.

228
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:48,419
Right.

229
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:50,740
Are you okay?

230
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,020
Yes.

231
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,780
Where were you last night?

232
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,780
Well?

233
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,099
I went to Mook's house.

234
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,940
Did you go with her?

235
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,780
Yes, I did.

236
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,940
Do you have something
to tell me about her?

237
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:48,819
No, I don't.

238
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:53,460
Everything remains the same
between me and her.

239
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,659
That's good to know.
Try to be honest with me.

240
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,180
I want to hear it from you.

241
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:01,780
Don't let me find out on my own

242
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:04,339
because it will end differently.

243
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Boss.

244
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,180
I've finished checking the documents
from Lan's company.

245
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,740
Just as you suspected,

246
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:23,619
millions worth of products
were lost.

247
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:25,099
Financial statements
were manipulated.

248
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:27,579
Poom has traced these transactions.

249
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,180
The account holder's name is Rawin.

250
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,260
Don't underestimate this guy.

251
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,139
Rawin is our prime suspect now.

252
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,419
It's the contract.
You left it at my house.

253
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,940
Thank you.

254
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:06,540
Did you come to talk to me
about this contract?

255
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,180
Yes, I did.

256
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:14,139
But I've changed my mind.

257
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,619
I want my son to work for me again.

258
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,339
And if you can do that,

259
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,819
just tell me
what you want in return.

260
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:39,419
What if I ask you to give your son
a chance to follow his own path?

261
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:46,780
I want to see him enjoy his life
and do what he loves.

262
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,859
I don't care
if he fails or succeeds.

263
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:53,220
Just seeing him on his own journey
is good enough.

264
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,220
Mook,

265
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,780
real life isn't pretty.

266
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,059
I know you want to help him.

267
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,780
But I must insist on this.

268
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,500
I want my son to come back.

269
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:21,099
We can follow our dreams
while doing our duty.

270
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,059
We don't have to make a choice.

271
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,419
I'm not trying to impede him
or ruin his life.

272
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,099
He chose to give it up.

273
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,180
He chose to do only one thing.

274
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,220
And I can't accept that.

275
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:41,339
Do you understand me?

276
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,899
Does this mean
you will give him a chance?

277
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:49,899
That's right.

278
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:56,899
But you have to convince him
to come back and do his duty.

279
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:02,819
Alright, I will try.

280
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,980
I handled it.

281
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:32,260
If the auditor finds out,
you will be in trouble.

282
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:35,459
If this can help you,
then it's worth it.

283
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,419
Don't worry about me.
You can carry on with your plan.

284
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,300
If you need my help, let me know.

285
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,499
No matter how risky it is,

286
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,220
I'm willing to do it for my friend.

287
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Win.

288
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,539
If Rawin did attack me
to cover up the fraud,

289
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,459
he should have done it
when I started working there.

290
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,339
But this began in Korea.

291
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,629
It could be that email.

292
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,780
Do you think these sales figures are
lower than they are supposed to be?

293
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:28,819
Right.

294
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,220
You should tell your dad
to take a look at it.

295
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:37,700
I'll send it to my sister.

296
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,780
If something is wrong,
she should be the one to tell him.

297
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Okay.

298
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:47,629
Lak.

299
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,109
She might know about the fraud
and doesn't want you to find out.

300
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:59,339
Not to mention
her position in the company.

301
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,499
If you consider these factors,
the whole thing makes sense.

302
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,819
Impossible.

303
00:33:05,979 --> 00:33:08,260
It's possible and you know it.

304
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:10,419
Look.

305
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,499
What proof do you have
that my sister is behind everything?

306
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,780
What proof do you have
that your sister didn't do it?

307
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:23,629
Nothing.

308
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,700
Then your sister and Rawin
are the suspects.

309
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,899
It could be someone else.

310
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,140
It could.

311
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,220
If you're afraid of the truth,
you should back away.

312
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,740
Ignore it and let them work it out

313
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:40,539
while you focus on our company.

314
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:46,979
Right. I should do that.

315
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,629
But I'm not a coward
who shies away from reality.

316
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:11,660
Then it's time to change the game.

317
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,260
Your attacker is
keeping a low profile,

318
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,819
figuring out your next move.

319
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,339
If you want to catch him,
you have to lure him out,

320
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,300
vice president.

321
00:34:32,069 --> 00:34:35,740
I have to be a hunter
who acts like prey.

322
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,859
Check where Rawin was
and if he left the country

323
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:57,109
- while Lan and I were in Korea.
- Got it.

324
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:17,260
If you're still acting immature,
you will not come here again.

325
00:35:23,459 --> 00:35:24,899
Could you show me this side?

326
00:35:42,419 --> 00:35:43,419
Here.

327
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,140
Are you upset that
Boss gave you a scolding?

328
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,379
He just gave me a scolding.
I'm not upset by that.

329
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,780
How is Lan?

330
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:08,419
He is calmer now.

331
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:13,220
It worries me that
Lan has a problem with his dad.

332
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:18,700
I understand him though.
He's doing it for his future.

333
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,539
If it's possible,
I want to help him.

334
00:36:23,899 --> 00:36:27,499
Don't worry.
Lan can take care of himself.

335
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,019
That's good to hear.

336
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:34,539
Is that all you want to say to me?

337
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:36,780
There's one more thing.

338
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:38,339
Well?

339
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,859
Will you and Lan stay together
until the term is over?

340
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:48,069
I can't give you an answer.
That's in the future.

341
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,109
Why are you asking?

342
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,939
I'm worried about you.

343
00:36:59,629 --> 00:37:00,740
If I were to guess,

344
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,339
Dad probably helped you
with your financial situation.

345
00:37:05,379 --> 00:37:07,459
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
agreed to marry him.

346
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:12,939
If one day being around Lan
makes you feel uncomfortable

347
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,300
and you're afraid to tell Dad,

348
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,140
you can talk to me.

349
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,780
I may be able to help you.

350
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,740
Think of me as your brother.

351
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:34,109
Thank you for your concern.
But I don't want to bother you.

352
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,660
If that's all,
I'd like to get back to work.

353
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,740
Alright.

354
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:20,979
(Lan)

355
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,819
Do you want to go with this concept?

356
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Mook?

357
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:39,589
Yes?

358
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,109
It's the concept for the new line.
I want you to create a design.

359
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,660
Okay.

360
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,499
Are you okay?

361
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,069
Do you feel unwell?

362
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:13,220
She is fine.

363
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:15,180
Lan.

364
00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:19,629
Do you have business here?
I heard you quit.

365
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,300
I came to deal with something.

366
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:26,780
Can I have a moment with
your co-worker?

367
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Sure.

368
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,180
You're a charmer.

369
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:55,819
Where are you taking me anyway?

370
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,220
- You'll be my witness.
- Witness.

371
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,019
Don't tell me you're going to quit.

372
00:40:05,859 --> 00:40:07,629
If I decide to do something,

373
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:11,499
will you still support me?

374
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,819
If it isn't wrong or illegal
and it makes you happy,

375
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,539
I will be on your side.

376
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:45,700
(Chalantorn, a passionate CEO)

377
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:26,019
What's your business?

378
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,700
I will work here again.

379
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,499
What are you saying?

380
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:52,379
Yesterday you announced
to everyone that you were resigning.

381
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,379
Now you want to come back.

382
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:57,660
This is a company, not a playground.

383
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,180
You can't just come and go
whenever you feel like it.

384
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,019
Are you going back on your word?

385
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,060
- You...
- I'm sorry.

386
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,899
What did you say?

387
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,620
I'm sorry for
thinking only about myself.

388
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,260
If it isn't too late,

389
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,140
I'd like to come back
to help you and my sister out.

390
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,260
I'm serious.

391
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:03,859
Okay.

392
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:08,740
If you can convince the board
to put their trust in you,

393
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,260
you can return to work.

394
00:43:11,979 --> 00:43:13,499
I won't help you.

395
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:16,819
You are responsible for your words.

396
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,700
Alright.

397
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,379
If I can do it,
I want full control of the company.

398
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,580
I want to show them
I got this job because I deserve it.

399
00:43:36,499 --> 00:43:37,499
Alright.

400
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:40,899
However, you will be
accountable for any consequences.

401
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,780
This emergency meeting

402
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,339
is about Chalantorn's resignation
as vice president.

403
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:08,700
Alright.

404
00:44:09,459 --> 00:44:11,300
I will let him explain.

405
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,060
Go ahead.

406
00:44:18,979 --> 00:44:21,539
My announcement may have
consequences,

407
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:24,539
especially for
the company's credibility.

408
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,740
I have reconsidered it

409
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,539
and decided to
continue working here.

410
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,660
Your indecisiveness
affects the company anyway.

411
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,419
You should just resign.

412
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,859
If you don't, your company's
credibility will be affected too.

413
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:52,260
Don't worry about us.

414
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,459
We can handle this on our own.

415
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,620
I caused this problem,
and I will find a way to solve it

416
00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:03,260
if you give me a chance
to prove that I'm capable.

417
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:14,220
You have your own company.

418
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:16,660
Time management
may be an issue for you.

419
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:33,459
He has been managing
his time well so far.

420
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,260
I don't think it will be an issue.

421
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,979
I have a plan for the future.
Please hear me out.

422
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:53,300
I want to focus on the online market
to promote our products

423
00:45:53,419 --> 00:45:55,140
without relying on other platforms.

424
00:45:55,499 --> 00:45:57,620
This will reduce costs
and boost sales.

425
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,539
We will target new markets
in Asia to improve distribution.

426
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,660
Well, that sounds interesting.

427
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,180
If you can't do it,

428
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,819
will we be able to remove you
from your position?

429
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,780
Of course.

430
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,300
I will earn your confidence.

431
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,899
Very well.
We will let him continue his work.

432
00:46:34,379 --> 00:46:36,580
After that,
we will do an evaluation.

433
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,539
Lak, send me the vice president's
work as soon as possible.

434
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,499
I want to get to work.

435
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:12,220
Sure. I will handle that.

436
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,620
I hope you can keep your promise,
vice president.

437
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:30,939
Alright. Thank you, everyone.

438
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,140
You're dismissed.

439
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:35,060
I have one more thing to say.

440
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,539
I want all the documents
on your project, Lak.

441
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,939
Rawin and Danai, I want yours too.

442
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,939
Is that all?

443
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:05,700
Yes.

444
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,939
I'm glad to hear that
you're serious about this.

445
00:48:18,419 --> 00:48:20,019
If you need my help, let me know.

446
00:48:20,819 --> 00:48:22,060
Dad, you don't have to worry.

447
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,100
This is just the beginning.

448
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:29,339
We still have a long way to go.
I can't be too confident.

449
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,140
Lak!

450
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,580
Lak, stop it.
Get a hold of yourself.

451
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,060
I'm as calm as I can be.

452
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:13,939
You should give me props for
not giving him an earful back there.

453
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,459
If he wants everything back,
he can have it.

454
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,580
- Let him have it.
- Hey!

455
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,580
Listen to me.

456
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,499
If you want everything back,
I will help you.

457
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,100
What will you do?

458
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,339
Talk to Dad?
Don't even think about it.

459
00:49:32,499 --> 00:49:36,140
As for Lan, with his arrogance,
I don't think he will listen to you.

460
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,140
I know a way to make you
become the company's number one.

461
00:49:49,939 --> 00:49:51,019
If you want it,

462
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,740
I'm willing to do anything for you.

463
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,379
Trust me.

464
00:49:56,939 --> 00:49:58,220
I can do it.

465
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:04,780
I want to be number one.

466
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:10,260
Help me.

467
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,859
Why did you change your mind?

468
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,899
What are you planning to do?

469
00:51:00,379 --> 00:51:01,620
I want to give it a try.

470
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:04,740
You're willing to do
what you don't want to.

471
00:51:16,979 --> 00:51:18,580
Does this have
something to do with your sister?

472
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:26,419
You suspect that
she could be involved

473
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,459
in the incidents.

474
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,220
You knew?

475
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:39,740
I also know that you refused
the position because of her.

476
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:42,620
So why the sudden change of plans?

477
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,300
Can I trust you?

478
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,859
Look into my eyes

479
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,780
and make your own decision.

480
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,859
Are you going to
use yourself as bait?

481
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,660
If I don't do that, we won't
know who is behind the whole thing.

482
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:26,539
This matter is too
important to ignore.

483
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,060
What will you do
if the attacker shows up?

484
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,019
I will catch him.

485
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,419
And what will you do
if you don't catch him?

486
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,459
Don't you have another plan?

487
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:42,979
No, I don't.

488
00:52:46,459 --> 00:52:48,100
You only have one life.

489
00:52:48,459 --> 00:52:50,260
Don't play around with it
as if you're playing a game.

490
00:52:59,899 --> 00:53:01,499
Just be careful.

491
00:53:01,939 --> 00:53:05,459
If something seems wrong,
tell me, Rut, or Poom.

492
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,499
Don't go it alone.
Do you understand?

493
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,260
You're bossy.
How will telling you help me?

494
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:16,819
I don't know. But I won't let
anything happen to you.

495
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:29,060
You stay out of it.
I can deal with it on my own.

496
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,260
I want to stay out of it
and leave you on your own,

497
00:53:34,939 --> 00:53:36,180
but I can't do that.

498
00:53:46,339 --> 00:53:47,899
I'm worried about you.

499
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,819
I know about Lan's decision.

500
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,700
It's very risky.

501
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,939
I'm envious of him.

502
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,100
If it were me, would you be worried?

503
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:08,780
Of course I would.

504
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,660
We're friends after all.

505
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,700
We may be friends now,

506
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:23,580
but we don't know about the future.

507
00:55:25,899 --> 00:55:26,939
Rut.

508
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,379
You should be careful too.

509
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,499
Don't forget you're the only one
who saw the attacker.

510
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,379
I'm scared he will come after you.

511
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,580
Alright, I will be careful.

512
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,100
Hey!

513
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,780
- What?
- Come on.

514
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,620
Oh.

515
00:56:35,539 --> 00:56:36,539
Hey.

516
00:56:40,419 --> 00:56:41,419
Lan!

517
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,979
Lan and Praomook's
marriage contract.

518
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:00,740
She married for money and her house.

519
00:57:01,899 --> 00:57:04,060
I thought she did it out of love.

520
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:08,459
Do you think Lan knows about this?

521
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,220
I don't think he knows.
If he did, he'd have thrown a fit.

522
00:57:13,979 --> 00:57:16,620
What do you want me
to do about this?

523
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:19,459
It's up to you.

524
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,419
You could show it to him
and bring him to his senses.

525
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:29,660
I have someone else in mind though.

526
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:32,499
Who?

527
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,660
Lak.

528
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,660
I assure you.
She will burn the house down.

529
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,859
From now on,
Rut won't see me as a kid anymore.

530
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,140
Lan!

531
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,499
Do you think
the attacker will show up?

532
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,220
Soon.

533
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:04,539
Lan.

534
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,060
What happened?

535
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:26,979
What's wrong?

536
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,499
I dreamed about the attacker

537
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,499
and you.

538
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,220
Did I get hurt in your dream?

539
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,019
It's just a dream.
It doesn't mean anything.

540
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:30,459
Happy birthday to you.

541
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,459
Happy birthday to you.

542
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:40,060
Happy birthday. Happy birthday.

543
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:46,260
Happy birthday to you.

544
01:01:46,459 --> 01:01:48,859
- Bang!
- Wow.

545
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,499
Happy birthday, my dear.

546
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:55,939
I wish my daughter
good health and happiness.

547
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:59,740
You're 18. You're an adult now.

548
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:02,140
Always think before you act.

549
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:05,019
Thank you, Mom.

550
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,459
Well, I wish you success
in your career and studies.

551
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,939
And in love.

552
01:02:15,499 --> 01:02:16,499
Come on. Make a wish.

553
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,580
I hope I succeed in everything I do.

554
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:31,459
Happy birthday to you.

555
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,220
Bang!

556
01:02:36,899 --> 01:02:38,339
Yay!

557
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:13,260
Are you waiting for your girl?

558
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:17,740
No.

559
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:19,700
I see.

560
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:23,140
Don't wait. She won't come.

561
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:27,060
Did you forget that
you told her not to come here?

562
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:30,539
I told you I'm not waiting for her.

563
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,339
Sure.

564
01:03:37,379 --> 01:03:38,499
Well.

565
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,260
Who is at the gate?

566
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:23,780
Boss.

567
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,019
Someone sent you a threat.

568
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,459
I've checked the cameras.

569
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:19,700
His face is covered.

570
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,260
Shall I go to the police?

571
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:36,869
No.

572
01:05:37,579 --> 01:05:39,659
We don't have any leads on him.

573
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,779
He was well prepared.
We won't find his fingerprints.

574
01:05:52,539 --> 01:05:54,339
Using myself as bait worked.

575
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:58,699
Now that I've returned to
the company, he's on the move again.

576
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,779
I can't believe
it's actually what I thought.

577
01:06:03,419 --> 01:06:04,739
Don't assume things.

578
01:06:04,949 --> 01:06:07,260
We don't have proof
that can identify the attacker.

579
01:06:09,459 --> 01:06:12,829
I can't help it.
Everything is abundantly clear.

580
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,260
Lan.

581
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:44,699
What is it?

582
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:55,379
It's nothing.
I'm just being paranoid.

583
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,379
You're paranoid.

584
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:00,909
Do you think he is nearby?

585
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:04,100
Forget about it.

586
01:07:07,579 --> 01:07:10,579
What will you do if he comes out?

587
01:07:12,499 --> 01:07:14,579
You know the answer.

588
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:17,300
Don't put your life at risk
because of me.

589
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:19,659
Think about this.

590
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:23,980
Would you do nothing
if I'm targeted and in danger?

591
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:30,949
You can't help it.

592
01:07:31,739 --> 01:07:34,699
The only way to stop me
is to catch the attacker.

593
01:07:36,779 --> 01:07:38,659
I will try to remember
more details about him.

594
01:07:38,779 --> 01:07:43,180
Even if I didn't see his face,
I may be able to identify him.

595
01:08:17,419 --> 01:08:18,419
What is it?

596
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:22,779
I brought you coffee
and your favorite dessert.

597
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,539
You need energy from sugar
and starch while you work.

598
01:08:35,379 --> 01:08:37,180
- Poom.
- Hm?

599
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:40,180
Tell me how to make Rut fall for me.

600
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,180
Poom.

601
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,699
I also brought you my work.

602
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,180
Hand it to me.

603
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:49,100
(How To Be Romantic)

604
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:53,539
How to be romantic.

605
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,499
It's a catchy title, I promise.

606
01:10:08,539 --> 01:10:09,659
You brat.

607
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:13,909
I'm not a kid anymore.

608
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:19,260
I should get back to work.

609
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:01,180
Mook is very worried about you.

610
01:11:01,949 --> 01:11:03,419
She is either worried
or is stressed.

611
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:07,779
She has always been with me
when the attacker showed up.

612
01:11:09,419 --> 01:11:11,020
If this continues,

613
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:13,260
it will take a toll on her.

614
01:11:14,539 --> 01:11:16,869
If it really takes a toll
on her mental health,

615
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:18,699
what will you do?

616
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:29,180
What will you do if he comes out?

617
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:31,659
You know the answer.

618
01:11:32,619 --> 01:11:34,260
Don't put your life at risk
because of me.

619
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:35,699
Think about this.

620
01:11:35,949 --> 01:11:40,060
Would you do nothing
if I'm targeted and in danger?

621
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,459
What's wrong?

622
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:37,260
Let's go home.

623
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:40,260
I'm going to take her home.

624
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:42,539
If something comes up,
leave it for tomorrow.

625
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:45,909
- Come on.
- Wait.

626
01:12:46,419 --> 01:12:47,779
Let me clean my desk.

627
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:26,739
You leave work on time,
vice president.

628
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:38,339
You two seem to get along well now.

629
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,020
Is it you who convinced him
to come back here?

630
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,260
You're mistaken.

631
01:13:49,379 --> 01:13:52,100
The person who made me
change my mind is you.

632
01:13:52,499 --> 01:13:53,499
Why?

633
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:55,140
I want to help you.

634
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,379
With work.
I don't want you to work too hard.

635
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:05,419
I don't need help.

636
01:14:05,659 --> 01:14:06,949
But I want to.

637
01:14:08,739 --> 01:14:10,379
One day you will understand.

638
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:55,739
Why did you take me to my house?

639
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:57,869
You have to stay away from me.

640
01:14:58,379 --> 01:14:59,579
For now you will stay here.

641
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:03,499
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

642
01:15:05,339 --> 01:15:06,619
I don't want to be around you.

643
01:15:07,379 --> 01:15:08,739
Being around you

644
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,949
makes me miss my chance
to be with Nuch.

645
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:13,829
You make me feel uncomfortable.

646
01:15:21,419 --> 01:15:24,980
Do whatever you want then.
If it makes you happy,

647
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:28,579
I told you I'm willing to
support you in everything.

648
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:57,699
He is so stubborn.
I can tell he is worried about her.

649
01:15:59,869 --> 01:16:00,869
Oak.

650
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:12,619
Oak, I have urgent news.

651
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:16,300
You don't want her to put her life
at risk, so you sent her home.

652
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,619
That's right. This place isn't safe.

653
01:16:19,739 --> 01:16:22,379
The attacker came to our front door.
Something could happen to her.

654
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,779
Staying away from me is best.

655
01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:29,140
And she agreed to stay home
even though she's very worried?

656
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:35,220
I guess you hurt her
with your words again.

657
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:40,180
Like I can convince her
by being nice. She is stubborn.

658
01:16:40,779 --> 01:16:43,539
She will listen
if you explain things to her.

659
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:48,499
Just admit you're worried about her.

660
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,379
Tell her how you feel.

661
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:52,980
Don't be so stoic.

662
01:16:54,869 --> 01:16:56,659
It's already done. What's the point
of bringing it up?

663
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:58,180
It's to make you think.

664
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:00,869
What worries me is,

665
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:03,779
what if he targets her instead,
who will be there to help her?

666
01:17:09,220 --> 01:17:10,220
That won't happen.

667
01:17:10,419 --> 01:17:11,869
Anything can happen.

668
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:18,739
Don't forget that
Mook is our witness.

669
01:17:47,949 --> 01:17:51,300
Nuch, are you free tomorrow?
I want to see you.

670
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,180
Come in.

671
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:35,909
Oh, your complicated relationship
gives me a headache.

672
01:18:36,579 --> 01:18:39,140
Not to mention the attacker
and the love triangle.

673
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,779
Now he goes back to Nuch.

674
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:44,539
And I'm a crazy woman
who worries about him.

675
01:18:45,579 --> 01:18:50,459
Who knows, he could be worried
about you and want to keep you safe.

676
01:18:52,829 --> 01:18:54,379
Don't give me hope.

677
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:56,909
It's possible.

678
01:19:06,829 --> 01:19:08,949
(I will take care of him.
You can't get him back now.)

679
01:19:13,909 --> 01:19:15,659
He is a man of his word.

680
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,379
Can you tell me
what's troubling you?

681
01:19:49,909 --> 01:19:51,459
Is it about your work?

682
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,619
Yes, it's about my work.

683
01:20:03,459 --> 01:20:05,180
Don't think of other things.

684
01:20:05,909 --> 01:20:07,539
Focus on me.

685
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:59,020
(Lan)

686
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:08,619
(Praomook)

687
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:16,020
(Praomook)

688
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,499
(Rut)

689
01:25:43,779 --> 01:25:46,180
Rut, did you miss me?

690
01:25:46,459 --> 01:25:49,180
How is Mook?
She didn't answer her phone.

691
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,860
Nampetch,

692
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,140
I have to speak to your sister.
Can I talk to her?

693
01:25:57,659 --> 01:25:59,100
Let me think about it.
