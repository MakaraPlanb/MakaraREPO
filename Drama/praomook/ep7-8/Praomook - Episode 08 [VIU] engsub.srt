1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,159
Stay away from Treenuch from now on.

4
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,919
Why do I have to listen to you?

5
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,319
This is my life. I can do whatever I want.

6
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,960
Remember my hatred.

7
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Because you will face it for the rest of your life.

8
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,319
- I won't do it. - Don't you want to prove yourself

9
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,919
that you're not what Dad thinks?

10
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,280
No. It's futile.

11
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,080
You should be careful of Treenuch.

12
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,280
There are only a couple of reasons why people who disappeared

13
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,520
from your life suddenly turn up.

14
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,199
Lan will be mine again.

15
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,919
I can't hand him over to you.

16
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,159
You're a nasty piece of work.

17
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,680
You already have the other man, now you want the other woman?

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,439
Did you forget that you're gay?

19
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,759
What is it again?

20
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,719
What are you doing?

21
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,080
Be still.

22
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,479
You're all dirty. I'm cleaning you up.

23
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,759
Her perfume makes me feel sick.

24
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,719
The only person who can test if you are gay or not

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,800
is me and no one else.

26
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,159
Are you jealous?

27
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,599
But you said you don't love me.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,159
Judging from your state of panic, you obviously love me.

29
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,000
You're mistaken. I don't love you.

30
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,840
I'm doing this to protect my rights, so that dog doesn't drag you off.

31
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,960
Don't get me wrong.

32
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,519
This explains why you readily agreed to meet me.

33
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,759
I won't let you get away next time.

34
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Lan.

35
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,040
You told me you were going to deal with some business.

36
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,160
Why are you returning with Mook?

37
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,040
Why don't you ask her?

38
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,120
I helped him deal with some stuff. That's why we came back together.

39
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,439
It looks like you put him through the wringer.

40
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,839
I did.

41
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,439
A promiscuous man like this should be kept in check.

42
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,439
Rut, don't worry.

43
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,319
As long as I am here, he won't get involved with any women.

44
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,120
You're number one. You will be his only lover.

45
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,519
Alright?

46
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,120
Mook, thank you for being my eyes and ears.

47
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,959
Having you around

48
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,360
is such a relief.

49
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,240
It's my pleasure.

50
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:50,160
From now on, if any women come near him,

51
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,839
I'm going to stop them.

52
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,040
As long as you're on my team, I'm on your team.

53
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,759
We're on the same team.

54
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,959
What's wrong with you, Lan?

55
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,759
Did you forget that she is trying to get between us

56
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,720
and ruin our relationship?

57
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,439
How can you be on the same team?

58
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,959
Mook and I agreed to live in peace.

59
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Why should we waste our energy fighting each other

60
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,680
when we can save it for something else?

61
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,120
That's right. Rut and I are friends.

62
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,079
You should feel happy that we get along well.

63
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,639
Alright. Since you seem to get along well,

64
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
why don't you sleep in the same room tonight?

65
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,160
Then, I'll be at peace.

66
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,519
Alright. I'll sleep in his room tonight.

67
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,519
And if I accidentally sleep with your beloved Rut,

68
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,959
don't come at me later.

69
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:13,439
Wait, don't tell me you're going to be alone with Rut tonight.

70
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,160
You know it's very unlikely that he's gay.

71
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,639
You're putting yourself at unnecessary risk.

72
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
How about this? I'll volunteer to test him for you.

73
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:27,759
Well, that doesn't sound like you're worried about me at all.

74
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,120
I am.

75
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,120
That's why I volunteered.

76
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,960
Living with three grown men,

77
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,120
I would be shaking if I were you.

78
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,960
Look. If you didn't say that you're worried about me,

79
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,840
I would think you're envious of me.

80
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Well, a little.

81
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,600
Anyway, I'm calling you to let you know you got a gig in another city.

82
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,960
Are you going to accept it?

83
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Decline it for now. I'm worried about my dad.

84
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,679
Also, I want to keep an eye on Lan in case something happens.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,919
Are you that worried about him?

86
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,679
I'm not worried about him.

87
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm just doing my job.

88
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,159
You know why I married him. I have to keep warding off bad luck.

89
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,480
Oh, is that right?

90
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,759
Do you seriously believe in the prophecy?

91
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,330
Just admit it that you care about him.

92
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,960
I just don't want something to happen that can ruin the deal.

93
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,120
Listen to me carefully.

94
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,039
I don't care about Lan.

95
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,639
I care about my family. Got it?

96
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,210
Alright. I'll try to believe you.

97
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,159
That's all I want to say. Now, good night.

98
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,679
And take care. Don't do anything to Lan.

99
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
Nonsense.

100
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,840
Oh, and take care of Mom for me.

101
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Sure. I'm pretty much her son now.

102
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,450
- Thanks, Oak. - Sure.

103
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:30,720
How can I leave you by yourself?

104
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,279
You'll be in charge of this project.

105
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:30,120
This project is yours. Why are you handing it over to me?

106
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,200
That's right. It's my project.

107
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,120
But Dad wants you to take over.

108
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
To be honest,

109
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
I don't think you can do it.

110
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,159
I don't care if you don't want to. Just get the job done.

111
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,320
If you fail, the company fails.

112
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
What is it?

113
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Are you going to sleep alone tonight?

114
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Yes.

115
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
Are you sure? I've never let a woman enter my room

116
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,679
while I sit around doing nothing.

117
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,159
It doesn't concern me. Why are you telling me this?

118
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,840
I'm just giving you a heads-up.

119
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,360
You told me to help you get a divorce.

120
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,919
Tomorrow everything will go as planned.

121
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:48,639
Good. I can't wait for tomorrow.

122
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,519
After tonight,

123
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,799
your duckling will no longer exist. DJ Prao will be mine.

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
Duckling isn't mine.

125
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,120
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

126
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,720
If you're done, leave. I want to get back to my work.

127
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Lan.

128
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,080
I'm not breaking our rule that says we won't date the same woman.

129
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,639
You said it yourself that Mook doesn't mean anything to you.

130
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,759
Are we on the same page?

131
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,799
Duckling is none of your business, Lan.

132
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,399
M,

133
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,320
root for me. I have to win this for myself.

134
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,399
Let's go.

135
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,080
Stop right there.

136
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Don't tell me you're wearing that to sleep in Rut's bed.

137
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,159
That's right. Have a good night.

138
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,679
No, stop right there.

139
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:01,919
You can't wear that to bed. You don't have my permission.

140
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,200
I can wear whatever I want. I don't need your permission.

141
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,639
Move.

142
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,960
Hey. Change into a new outfit now.

143
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,519
Go.

144
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,360
Why? Are you scared he will go for me instead?

145
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,399
Don't worry.

146
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,919
He won't look at me even if I'm naked.

147
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,399
Trust your boyfriend.

148
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,399
I trust him but I don't trust you.

149
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,799
Change into a better outfit or I will do it for you.

150
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:32,919
I'm not changing.

151
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Are you sure?

152
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,399
Alright. I will do it for you.

153
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,200
Hey, Lan!

154
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,679
- Let go. Hey! - No.

155
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,159
- Let go. - No.

156
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,600
- Let go. - No.

157
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,919
Duckling!

158
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,080
Come here. Change into a new outfit.

159
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,200
- Lan! - Duckling, come here.

160
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,639
Lan, let go of me.

161
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,519
Duckling! Did you bite me, pup?

162
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,799
Am I a duckling or a pup?

163
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,200
I don't need your help. I'll ask Rut to help me change.

164
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,119
He will kick you out of his room.

165
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Really?

166
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,559
I'm curious to know if he will do as you said.

167
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,720
Don't worry about him tonight. I will take good care of him.

168
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,039
Have fun sleeping by yourself. Bye.

169
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,000
Hey, duckling, stop right there.

170
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,890
Right, her outfit.

171
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,799
Hey, duckling, stop right there.

172
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,839
Hey, Rut.

173
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,039
Hey.

174
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:27,799
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

175
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,119
Sure thing.

176
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,960
What are you doing?

177
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:56,319
You will wear this to bed.

178
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,170
No. What I wear to bed is none of your business.

179
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,650
If you don't change into this, I will throw you out.

180
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,799
No.

181
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,650
This is Rut's house. The only one who can throw me out is him.

182
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,599
Rut, help me.

183
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,359
He's acting crazy about the way I dress.

184
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,200
Lan, why do you keep bothering her?

185
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,200
How she dresses is none of your business.

186
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,799
I think this outfit is great.

187
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,650
No.

188
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,799
She can't wear this dress with straight men around her.

189
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,480
Where are the straight men?

190
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,170
Aren't you two gay men?

191
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,799
There's Poom.

192
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,039
Poom is a straight man in the house.

193
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,240
If he sees you in this state and gets horny, Rut can't stop him.

194
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,799
Then lock the door and don't let him in.

195
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,960
Anyone calling me?

196
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,039
Oh my gosh.

197
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:26,799
Poom, close your eyes.

198
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,650
He is a straight man. You should dress appropriately.

199
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,559
Change into a better outfit.

200
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,410
Lan, you didn't have to yell. Just ask her nicely.

201
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,240
Did she listen to me when I asked her nicely?

202
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Give it to me. I'll handle it.

203
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,890
Mook.

204
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
My room is cold.

205
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,960
You will feel more comfortable if you wear this shirt to bed.

206
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,410
Trust me.

207
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,759
Okay.

208
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Is that it?

209
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,319
Had you told me your reason, I would have listened to you.

210
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,119
You were trying to annoy me.

211
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,319
What do you think?

212
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,410
Alright. Do whatever you want.

213
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,960
If something happens, don't say I didn't warn you.

214
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,559
Did you have fun teasing him?

215
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,720
What do you mean? I didn't tease him.

216
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,319
Really?

217
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,599
I have to warn you though. When you spend the night in my room,

218
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:58,640
you may not get to sleep.

219
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,680
Well, can I open my eyes now?

220
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Go ahead.

221
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,759
I'll sleep in his room tonight.

222
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,359
And if I accidentally sleep with your beloved Rut,

223
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,359
don't come at me later.

224
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,240
Stop thinking about her.

225
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,880
You told me to help you get a divorce.

226
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,359
Tomorrow everything will go as planned.

227
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,880
Rut, please, I give up. Don't be rough with me.

228
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,559
I told you to give up.

229
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,519
Don't worry. I won't be rough.

230
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,799
Rut, take it easy.

231
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,119
I can't hold back anymore.

232
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,519
- Rut! - What are you doing?

233
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,079
What are you hollering about?

234
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:31,519
I'm about to punish her.

235
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,480
Ow! Hey!

236
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,240
You said you'd give me a warning first.

237
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,839
That hurt!

238
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,640
I was being gentle.

239
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,359
Losers can't be choosers.

240
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,599
I will win the next game.

241
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,960
You lost five times in a row.

242
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,359
Mook, you can't beat my boss.

243
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:53,640
He plays games for a living.

244
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,039
What are you doing here anyway?

245
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,079
You said you were going to sleep alone.

246
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:10,000
I couldn't sleep because you were being loud.

247
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Really?

248
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,599
Then we'll keep our voices down.

249
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,559
You can go to bed.

250
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,960
No, I'm not sleepy.

251
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
I will play with you.

252
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,720
Lan,

253
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,599
what's wrong with you?

254
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,279
There is plenty of space. Why don't you sit somewhere else?

255
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm sitting beside my boyfriend. Sit somewhere else if it bothers you.

256
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,200
No, I will sit right here.

257
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,119
Mook, you can sit over there.

258
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Lan and Boss want to sit next to each other.

259
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:49,960
Aren't they irritating?

260
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,920
Well, let's continue the game.

261
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,039
Duckling, compete against me.

262
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,640
Whoever loses sleeps alone.

263
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,799
Alright. If I win, I can sleep in any room I want.

264
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:18,839
Fight!

265
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,200
Come on. Show her what you got.

266
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,359
That punch almost knocked her out.

267
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,640
Yes, that's it.

268
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,279
I will win this round.

269
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,400
You've got to work harder.

270
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,279
Yes!

271
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,079
Come here.

272
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,960
It's okay, Lan. You have another round.

273
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm rooting for you.

274
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:00,839
Whoa.

275
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,359
- That's a mean hook! - Yes!

276
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Wait.

277
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:17,079
Just you wait.

278
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,480
Another round, Lan.

279
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,279
Hey.

280
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:23,640
- Yes! - Wow.

281
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,799
Mook, you're awesome.

282
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,559
Duckling, I think you're drunk. Go to bed.

283
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:17,279
Hey, she is having fun. Leave her be.

284
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:22,920
Poom, dance with me.

285
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,759
Come on.

286
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,880
Alright, one, two, three.

287
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,960
Duckling, come with me.

288
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:42,079
Mook.

289
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,680
- Mook. - Mook.

290
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,000
Well, she's gone.

291
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,440
I should get her to bed.

292
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,960
No, you're drunk. I will take her to bed.

293
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Hm.

294
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,400
Poom, turn off the lights.

295
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Sure thing.

296
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,079
- Hey! - Hey!

297
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,279
Lan!

298
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,200
What's happening?

299
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
What's happening?

300
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,440
Boss, Lan, did you sleep with each other?

301
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,799
- Shut up. - Shut up.

302
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:35,319
Rut, we just slept on the same bed. Did you have to do that?

303
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,319
Look, I wouldn't do something that stupid.

304
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,440
Then what happened?

305
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,440
I don't know. We were drunk.

306
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,079
Oh, come on.

307
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,079
Lan,

308
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,720
I think we are still the same.

309
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,519
Let me check.

310
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:18,880
I think we are still intact.

311
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
Absolutely.

312
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:24,960
Try it.

313
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,640
You love each other so much, don't you?

314
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,440
I'm curious to know if you still will when you wake up.

315
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,599
You two are all lovey-dovey this morning.

316
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,920
Please be kind to a single man like me.

317
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:12,000
We're like this every morning. You should be used to it by now.

318
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,329
Rut, your favorite.

319
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,079
How did you get here anyway?

320
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,880
I came to see my sister and I was hoping to get a ride to work.

321
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,400
I didn't think I would get to witness such an interesting scene.

322
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:47,809
Mook.

323
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,880
What happened last night?

324
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,239
Did both of us do something

325
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,039
that bothered you?

326
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,440
Well, I was a little drunk. I don't really remember.

327
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,519
I woke up feeling uncomfortable,

328
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:12,960
so I took a shower and slept in Lan's room.

329
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,920
I don't recall what happened.

330
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,289
Maybe you felt warm.

331
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,199
Or maybe you felt amorous

332
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,639
and a little drunk, and...

333
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,329
Oh.

334
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:28,840
I should stop there.

335
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,199
Is that true, Mook?

336
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,559
What are you planning to do?

337
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:56,809
You disagreed with my plan. So why are you complying now?

338
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,559
Rut, don't worry about upsetting me.

339
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,559
I understand that you love each other.

340
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:07,960
Let's say I'm invisible in this house.

341
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,920
Feel free to show affection toward each other. Don't mind me.

342
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,719
Alright.

343
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,769
Then I will stop being considerate.

344
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:21,920
Now you will see how much Lan and I love each other.

345
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,039
I'm doing this because I love you.

346
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,679
- Wait. - As a friend.

347
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,039
You said you don't want Mook to love you.

348
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:49,289
I'm trying to make her feel hopeless with you.

349
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,289
If she is certain that we love each other, she will get over you.

350
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,159
Then I will try to find a way to get close to her.

351
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,769
Be good to her.

352
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:02,519
And when she falls for me, I will go for it.

353
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,960
Are you going to pursue duckling even though she thinks you're gay?

354
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,440
You won't succeed.

355
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,199
That doesn't matter. I can fix it.

356
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,920
You know that when I have eyes for someone,

357
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:23,880
I have to have them.

358
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,719
Do you really like her, or you think this is a game?

359
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,480
Both.

360
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,519
You're a blind and tasteless man. You think a duckling can be a swan.

361
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,639
Keep thinking like that.

362
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,159
Don't change your mind.

363
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,920
Because in this game

364
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,360
I must win.

365
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,159
Whatever.

366
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:01,440
Get it done and be very discreet. Is that clear?

367
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,289
I think we should hold off.

368
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,679
It's almost time for our audit. We may be scrutinized.

369
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,559
We've made it every time. Why are you scared now?

370
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,679
But...

371
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:12,960
This should be enough for you.

372
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,239
Alright.

373
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,440
I won't let you risk yourself for free.

374
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,079
But don't hesitate when I give you orders.

375
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:24,159
Okay.

376
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:03,960
What's happening?

377
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Petch!

378
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,159
Are you okay?

379
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,679
I'm okay.

380
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,079
But I'm starting to feel not okay after seeing blood.

381
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,679
- Petch, take it easy. - I'm scared of blood.

382
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,329
What's happening?

383
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:39,519
Get me tissues.

384
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Here.

385
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,559
Don't tilt your head back, or you will choke.

386
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,809
Poom, get a cold compress and herbal inhaler.

387
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,719
Squeeze your nose and breathe through your mouth.

388
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,920
Look down.

389
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,809
Your pulse is racing. Do you have any medical conditions?

390
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,400
Keep looking down.

391
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,289
Here you go.

392
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,039
Hold this.

393
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,079
Keep the pressure.

394
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Head down.

395
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,199
If the bleeding doesn't stop, I will take you to a doctor.

396
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:25,079
- Poom. - Yes?

397
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:26,519
Keep an eye on her.

398
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:29,719
If the bleeding doesn't stop in ten minutes, take her to a doctor.

399
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,159
Boss, don't make it a big deal. She just has a nosebleed.

400
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,039
- That's an order. - Okay.

401
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:48,039
He is cranky.

402
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:50,329
Here. Let me help.

403
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,519
Keep squeezing your nose.

404
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,840
Mom, are you okay?

405
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,039
I'm okay. I just have a nosebleed.

406
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,199
I will be fine.

407
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:47,440
Rut, can you get me some tissues?

408
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:48,719
Okay.

409
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:57,809
Mom!

410
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,039
Mom, are you okay?

411
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,239
Mom!

412
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:04,480
Mom!

413
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,559
Mom, are you okay?

414
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:12,519
Mom!

415
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,159
Mom!

416
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:18,960
Mom!

417
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Rut, come here.

418
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:54,599
Listen.

419
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,039
From now on Auntie will take care of you.

420
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,119
You will live abroad with me.

421
00:44:01,159 --> 00:44:03,199
What about my father?

422
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,480
Forget about him.

423
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:09,199
Since your parents split up, has he ever visited you?

424
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:11,719
He didn't even show up for your mother's funeral.

425
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
Leave this life behind you.

426
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,840
And start a new one with me.

427
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:21,920
Okay, Auntie.

428
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,119
Why do you ask for information from the last three years? What's wrong?

429
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,000
There's nothing wrong for now.

430
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:02,119
I just want an overview of the company's performance.

431
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,239
As well as each department's spending,

432
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,199
so I can decide if an adjustment is needed.

433
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:13,280
You keep saying you don't care,

434
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,760
but you want every detail.

435
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,840
Dad will be happy to know that you care about the company.

436
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,159
I'm just trying to make it look like I'm working.

437
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:25,639
I still don't want to be in charge of this company.

438
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,480
It's better to let you and my sister run it.

439
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,039
If you find anything strange, let me know.

440
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,079
I will deal with it.

441
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:38,960
Okay.

442
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:42,679
Lak wants you and Lan to visit the factory

443
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,000
to see its capacity and how it works.

444
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,159
Okay.

445
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:57,039
Hey.

446
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,679
Where are you two headed?

447
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,320
I was about to go see Lan and ask him to do a factory visit.

448
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,239
It's Lak's order.

449
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,320
You're a good friend. You always do what she says.

450
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,840
I have to follow my boss's orders.

451
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,039
If I don't comply, I will be in trouble.

452
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:20,920
That's a quality of a good employee.

453
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,199
I guess you will get a bonus at the end of the year.

454
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,800
- Shall we go now? - Sure.

455
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,599
Let's go together.

456
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,119
Win is heading to the factory.

457
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,119
Get the job done.

458
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,320
Heading to the factory

459
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:33,119
to check if something looks suspicious.

460
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,360
Okay. Be careful.

461
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,320
You don't want to trip over a stump.

462
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:04,159
Do you feel better?

463
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,199
Oh, the bleeding stopped.

464
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,119
I guess I didn't get enough sleep.

465
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:17,679
Good.

466
00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:20,559
If you feel sick, you can leave work early.

467
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,159
No. I have a presentation today. I have to stay no matter what.

468
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,760
Is it that important to you?

469
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,039
It's very important.

470
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,519
If I win, I will get to learn a lot from you.

471
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,719
Alright.

472
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,480
Follow me.

473
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,679
This is the trimming and final assembly line.

474
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,320
These machines are manual.

475
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,840
Automated machines are in the other warehouse.

476
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,039
That's a conveyor system.

477
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:05,599
The molding process will be done here.

478
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,679
We have four warehouses.

479
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,000
Each one has about a hundred workers.

480
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,920
The next warehouse is used for transportation.

481
00:49:16,599 --> 00:49:18,079
This area

482
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,800
is used to store products made to order.

483
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,920
Wood we recently ordered from Germany will be kept here.

484
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,480
Should we follow Lan?

485
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:44,079
No, it's fine. Let's continue.

486
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,440
Then please follow me.

487
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,000
Mine is an otome game.

488
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,079
There are plenty of those on the market. What makes yours stand out?

489
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,840
Nowadays games blend with reality.

490
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,000
This game requires a player to input their love interest's information

491
00:50:09,519 --> 00:50:12,880
and choose a situation that works in reality.

492
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,880
Then the target group is only women.

493
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,719
If we want to target men, we can add female characters.

494
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,199
There are a lot of female players who are interested in this game,

495
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,559
especially younger players.

496
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:59,400
(Cheer up, silly.)

497
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,639
This is a rough idea of the character.

498
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,199
I think this character sounds familiar.

499
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:10,280
I don't think so.

500
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,480
I created this character from my own imagination.

501
00:51:20,199 --> 00:51:21,719
I'll try to believe you.

502
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,639
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

503
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,800
I'll look around the factory.

504
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:50,239
Go ahead. I'll check the products.

505
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,960
Okay.

506
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:54,599
This way.

507
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,559
Mook, let me go with you.

508
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,800
You should do your work. I don't want to disturb you.

509
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,079
Well, excuse me.

510
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,199
Hey, Lak.

511
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,119
When will you come back to the office?

512
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,719
Did you forget you have a meeting this afternoon?

513
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:30,159
I didn't forget about that.

514
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,679
A factory visit isn't on today's schedule. Why are you there?

515
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:37,159
I just wanted to accompany Lan,

516
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,880
in case I could offer him some suggestions.

517
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,239
Are you sure you're there because of Lan and not someone else?

518
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,360
Do you mean Mook?

519
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:48,920
Come on, Lak. This is silly.

520
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,320
Mook is your sister-in-law.

521
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,320
I won't do something like that.

522
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,519
I didn't mention her.

523
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,159
- Why are you making excuses? - Lak,

524
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,599
I know you. I know what you think.

525
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,440
I came here to work. I won't do something ridiculous.

526
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,719
See you at the office. Bye.

527
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:27,719
Lan.

528
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,920
Here you are wandering around.

529
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:34,400
Can you focus on your job?

530
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,239
This is your factory.

531
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,119
How can you command people when you don't know how it works?

532
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,400
The factory is my father's, not mine.

533
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,880
- But... - Stop talking. It's annoying.

534
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,400
I don't care. I will talk until you agree to work for your dad.

535
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,400
Honestly, when will you become serious with your life?

536
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:54,800
Do you plan to only wait for your inheritance?

537
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,920
Yes. I plan to live off my dad's money.

538
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,800
His money can last me for the rest of my life. Why do I have to work?

539
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,679
Lan, don't walk away from me.

540
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,599
Lan, watch out!

541
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,559
Danai, Lan had an accident.

542
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,840
- Where is he? - Follow me.

543
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
Mook.

544
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,079
Mook.

545
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:50,000
Hey, are you okay?

546
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,119
Answer me.

547
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,719
I'm hurt, obviously.

548
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,599
Mook, where does it hurt?

549
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,039
Lan, Mook, what happened?

550
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,599
I don't know. The box just fell down.

551
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,079
How could you let this happen?

552
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,920
I'm sorry, sir.

553
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,800
Handle this and don't let it happen again.

554
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,039
Yes, sir.

555
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,320
Mook, I think you should go to a hospital.

556
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,280
That isn't necessary. It hurts a little. I'll be fine.

557
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
Ouch.

558
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,760
I'll take care of her.

559
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,320
I'm taking you to a hospital.

560
00:55:57,199 --> 00:55:58,199
Can you walk?

561
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,199
Yes, I can.

562
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,719
Don't be ridiculous. Just admit that you need help.

563
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Get on my back.

564
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:14,679
I can walk.

565
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,960
Make your choice.

566
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:20,440
Get on my back or I will carry you on my shoulders.

567
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:08,920
Are you worried about me?

568
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:14,480
Is this the time to be asking that?

569
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,119
If I knew you would be nice to me when I got hurt,

570
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,239
I would've gotten myself hurt a long time ago.

571
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,639
If you don't stop talking about getting hurt, I will drop you here.

572
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,840
There was an accident? How are Mook and Lan?

573
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:36,760
Mook got hurt,

574
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,960
but it's not that bad. Don't worry.

575
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:41,840
How can I not worry? Mook got hurt.

576
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,480
Besides, it happened at my factory.

577
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:49,199
Danai, you have to investigate this

578
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,719
and give me the result immediately. Understood?

579
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,360
Alright.

580
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:56,360
Did something happen, dear?

581
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:00,119
I thought their marriage would make things better.

582
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,480
This time Mook got hurt too.

583
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:07,800
Oh no!

584
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,679
Dear, what's going on? You scared me.

585
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,119
Maybe Mook has to suffer Lan's misfortunes now.

586
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,960
In the past, it's been Lan who's gotten hurt.

587
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,280
Now she's taken his place.

588
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:20,559
No, I can't let this happen.

589
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,880
The doctor said I'll be fine.

590
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,480
I only have a few bumps and bruises.

591
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,840
That's a relief. I came here as soon as I heard the news.

592
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,920
I'm here for you now.

593
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:38,159
She got hurt because of my son. I'm really sorry.

594
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,880
Pat, it was an accident.

595
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,280
How did you know?

596
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,559
I haven't told you what happened.

597
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,880
I have a fortuneteller as my consultant.

598
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,280
He said she got hurt because of you.

599
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,039
Wait, why is this my fault?

600
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,960
Your daughter-in-law has made your son's life better,

601
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,280
but she will suffer Chalantorn's misfortunes instead.

602
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,719
Oh no. Does this mean Mook will suffer in my son's place?

603
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,840
That's right. Your son has avoided the danger

604
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,719
for he has the fourth-waxing-moon girl to help him.

605
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,079
But his misfortunes will fall on your daughter-in-law.

606
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:26,199
Master, is there a way to fix this?

607
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:29,320
There is a way. They have to travel.

608
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,840
Then their stars will change. After their return, things will be better.

609
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,880
In short, you're the reason why Mook got hurt.

610
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:45,960
Therefore, you will go on your honeymoon with her.

611
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,360
So everything is my fault?

612
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,960
That's right. And you have to take responsibility.

613
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:53,360
If I refuse,

614
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,000
you will make me go anyway, right?

615
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,280
Right.

616
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,559
Then I will go. End of story.

617
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,400
I made my decision.

618
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,039
The person who gets to be my assistant is

619
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:38,679
Nampetch.

620
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:52,280
She clearly did a great job.

621
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,280
I guess no one questions my decision.

622
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:56,760
- No. - No.

623
01:01:57,199 --> 01:01:59,599
All of your ideas are interesting.

624
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,039
Turn them into a game and pitch them to me.

625
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,880
- Alright. - Alright.

626
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:06,079
Thanks for today.

627
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,960
Dismissed.

628
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Nampetch.

629
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,280
Yes?

630
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,280
Get your parents' permission.

631
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,719
Don't let it become a problem again, or I won't take you with me.

632
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:27,360
Roger that.

633
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:31,480
I will get permission from my mom and my sister.

634
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,519
(Lan is calling)

635
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,519
Hey, Lan. What did you find?

636
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,400
What?

637
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Okay. I'll have Poom look into it.

638
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,880
Poom,

639
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,920
Lan is going to send us a video from a CCTV camera.

640
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,559
There was an accident at his father's factory.

641
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,519
He wants to know what actually happened.

642
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Roger that.

643
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,679
Wait, was Lan involved in the accident?

644
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,039
Yes.

645
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,119
Your sister was involved too.

646
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,639
Is my sister alright?

647
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,599
She got hurt.

648
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,719
Let's look at the other angle

649
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:43,960
to see if anything happened before Lan and Mook got there.

650
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,440
Okay.

651
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,360
There.

652
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:58,400
Wider angle.

653
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,760
Are you satisfied with the inspection?

654
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,480
I still think it was an accident.

655
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:22,000
I just want to make sure

656
01:04:22,679 --> 01:04:24,280
that it wasn't planned.

657
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:26,320
And what do you find?

658
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:28,960
It was an accident.

659
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,199
Inform Lan about this.

660
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:36,960
And don't let it happen again.

661
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,400
Yes, sir.

662
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,199
Taking a break sounds nice.

663
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,440
This is your chance to seduce Lan.

664
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,840
Wait, you weren't like this before. Why are you encouraging me now?

665
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,400
Sleeping with him a couple of times won't hurt you.

666
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:15,079
This way you will get to experience life after marriage.

667
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,039
A lovely atmosphere on a honeymoon.

668
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:20,920
That's romantic.

669
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,719
Ow, that hurt!

670
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,679
If you don't stop talking nonsense, I will hit you again.

671
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,239
I may flirt with him, but I won't give myself to him easily.

672
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,480
I don't want to lose again.

673
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,960
It's a relief to know that you're still firm about this.

674
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:41,800
I asked you that

675
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,679
because I want to know if you've fallen for him yet.

676
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,440
Don't worry.

677
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,800
The game just started. I won't lose.

678
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,440
On our honeymoon,

679
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,320
I will make him fall for me.

680
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,760
Keep going, my girl.

681
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,440
Mook!

682
01:06:00,679 --> 01:06:02,559
Mook!

683
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,159
Are you alright?

684
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,320
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

685
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,039
I'm not hurt. I'm okay.

686
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,880
That's a relief.

687
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Ouch.

688
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:17,159
What did I do?

689
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,559
Do you have an injury? Let me see.

690
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,159
Petch, I'm fine. It's a small injury. Don't worry.

691
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:02,199
Lan,

692
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,639
just say what you have to say.

693
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,599
Rut, go on a honeymoon with me.

694
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:13,159
No, I won't.

695
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:21,800
If you don't go with me,

696
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:24,840
I have to be alone with duckling.

697
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:26,840
Can you accept that?

698
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,559
Then I will go. When is it?

699
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:33,480
In a couple of days.

700
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:35,760
So you're going with me, right?

701
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,960
You need to be there to stop her from taking advantage of me.

702
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,039
Boss, you can't go.

703
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:45,519
- Boss. - Why can't you go?

704
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,840
He's attending an academic conference.

705
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:51,480
Here, at this place.

706
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:53,119
On this day.

707
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:56,800
(Teach university students)

708
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,599
Alright. I will go to the same place.

709
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,039
After you're done with work, we'll meet.

710
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,679
You, Petch, and Poom

711
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,360
will be the third wheels.

712
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,119
Don't worry though.

713
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,519
While I'm alone with her,

714
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,649
I will be extra careful. Is that okay with you?

715
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:25,119
Okay, then. Deal.

716
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:33,199
Do you want my help?

717
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:35,720
- No. - No.

718
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:46,529
Alright, let's dig in.

719
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:49,199
- It looks good. - Of course.

720
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,159
Excuse me.

721
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,720
Go ahead. I have to try this, and this, and this.

722
01:08:58,079 --> 01:08:59,479
It's so good.

723
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:01,000
Awesome.

724
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:02,119
Poom.

725
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:04,159
Poom.

726
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,960
Woah. That's a lot of fat.

727
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,079
What do you need?

728
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,359
When did my house turn into a restaurant?

729
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:18,609
Thirty minutes ago.

730
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:22,319
We have a lot of guests, so I ordered bbq.

731
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,039
Come on. It'll be over soon.

732
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:37,159
- Which one is good? - This.

733
01:09:38,649 --> 01:09:42,159
Rut, why aren't you eating? All you had was coffee today.

734
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,319
Let me feed you.

735
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,199
I'm not hungry.

736
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:55,479
Nampetch.

737
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:00,199
Have you told your sister about going to work with me?

738
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:05,359
Yes, and she has my permission.

739
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,479
Take care of her for me.

740
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:15,439
But Oak will go with you as her chaperone.

741
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:24,000
Alright. I will go to the same place.

742
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:26,439
After you're done with work, we'll meet.

743
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:31,119
You, Petch, and Poom will be the third wheels.

744
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,359
I will turn this honeymoon into a group trip.

745
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,529
Don't worry though. While I'm alone with her,

746
01:10:38,649 --> 01:10:40,079
I will be extra careful.

747
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,960
- Is that okay with you? - Okay then.

748
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:44,399
Deal.

749
01:10:53,569 --> 01:10:56,439
That explains why he readily agreed to the trip.

750
01:10:56,569 --> 01:10:58,569
He actually planned to destroy the honeymoon.

751
01:10:59,609 --> 01:11:01,880
This isn't a problem. He may destroy it,

752
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:06,039
but I will give you a chance to be alone with him.

753
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:09,479
- How? - I will be Petch's chaperone.

754
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,800
Once we get there,

755
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:14,079
I will keep Rut, Petch, and Poom away from you two.

756
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,039
Then you will have your alone time with him.

757
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:19,529
And if I get the chance,

758
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,199
I will test if Rut is straight or not.

759
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:23,680
I'm willing to do this for you.

760
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:26,399
Whatever.

761
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,680
You're obviously doing this for yourself.

762
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,529
Anyway, it's a good idea. I don't want my sister to be alone.

763
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:36,960
Okay then. Deal?

764
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,159
Deal.

765
01:11:48,399 --> 01:11:51,079
If you don't let Oak go with you, I can't let my sister go with you.

766
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
Okay.

767
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:08,079
Thank you.

768
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:16,760
Rut, don't worry about Lan. I will take good care of him.

769
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,479
Are you worried about the honeymoon?

770
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,960
Don't be.

771
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,800
Once I get there, I will try to get between them.

772
01:12:54,439 --> 01:12:56,439
So you can enjoy some time alone with him.

773
01:12:58,960 --> 01:12:59,960
I see.

774
01:13:04,439 --> 01:13:05,960
You're on my side, aren't you?

775
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:09,840
Yes, I'm on your team.

776
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,439
#TeamLanRut

777
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:16,319
Good.

778
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:21,000
When we get there, do anything to get Lan away from your sister.

779
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:22,680
Do we have a deal?

780
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:25,720
It's a deal.

781
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:42,760
Now, let go of my hand.

782
01:13:44,569 --> 01:13:45,569
Oh.

783
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,359
Now, go home.

784
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:04,119
Okay.

785
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:12,479
Now, go home.

786
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,720
Oh.

787
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,800
Lan.

788
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:58,319
Hey, stay still. I'll put this medicine on you.

789
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,720
No, I can do it.

790
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:04,279
Will you let me do it, or do I have to force you?

791
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,319
I hate you.

792
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:25,529
Remember what you said to me

793
01:15:26,039 --> 01:15:28,569
because I will make you love me.

794
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,279
I won't give in.

795
01:15:44,569 --> 01:15:46,439
Your plan won't work.

796
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:57,680
You didn't have to hurt yourself to make me go on a honeymoon with you.

797
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:01,439
Just ask me nicely and I will agree to it.

798
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:09,840
I can give it to you now. I will force myself to do it.

799
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:14,159
Shall we begin?

800
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,920
Your mind is full of dirty things.

801
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,960
If you're going to do something to me,

802
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,529
I'm telling you, I'm a leech.

803
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,720
If I catch you,

804
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,359
I will bleed you dry. Do you want to try me?

805
01:16:34,359 --> 01:16:37,840
You will get nothing from me, especially love.

806
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,609
All I have for you

807
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,279
is hatred.

808
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,529
Should I do this to you?

809
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,199
Make you fall head over heels in love with me

810
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:53,479
and dump you like a piece of trash.

811
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,920
I will never love you.

812
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,840
That's good.

813
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,319
Because I'm disgusted by your love.

814
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:34,649
Mook, you can't love him.

815
01:17:35,649 --> 01:17:37,159
You can't love him no matter what.

816
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,399
Remember, you don't love him.

817
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:00,159
Come on.

818
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,760
I will never love you.

819
01:18:14,199 --> 01:18:16,649
I will never love you, Praomook.

820
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:29,319
Lan, you piece of trash.

821
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,680
I will never love a jerk like you.

822
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:41,840
He might hear you, you know.

823
01:18:44,529 --> 01:18:45,529
Rut.

824
01:18:50,649 --> 01:18:52,199
When did you get here?

825
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:54,319
I got here before you did.

826
01:18:56,609 --> 01:18:57,840
So you heard everything.

827
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,960
Every sentence.

828
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,880
It's actually a relief to hear that

829
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:08,319
you will never love him.

830
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,399
That's right. It will never happen.

831
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:14,319
I will never love him.

832
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,079
If you are jealous of me, you can feel at ease now.

833
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,840
Right, I'm jealous

834
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,720
of him.

835
01:19:27,359 --> 01:19:28,399
What did you say?

836
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:34,399
I mean, I'm jealous of you and worried about you.

837
01:19:36,279 --> 01:19:39,960
You keep saying you don't love him, but your actions say otherwise.

838
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:42,399
You helped him and neglected your own safety.

839
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:46,840
It's clear that he is important to you.

840
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,720
- That's not true. - Be careful of your heart.

841
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,479
I'm warning you for your own sake

842
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,680
as a man who cares about you.

843
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:22,359
Dad.

844
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,840
We'll be back soon.

845
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,569
After I come back, I will tell you everything.

846
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,760
I will learn as much as I can.

847
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,760
And when I successfully make my own game,

848
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,529
you'll be the first person to play it.

849
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,239
Hey, Oak.

850
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,439
If you change your mind and want to stay here, let me know.

851
01:21:02,569 --> 01:21:04,479
I volunteer to be a chaperone.

852
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:09,159
Who knows, I might find the man I've been waiting for my whole life.

853
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,079
I'm sorry to disappoint you. I don't want to make my man wait.

854
01:21:15,399 --> 01:21:18,119
I guess your man will have to wait.

855
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:21,239
Oh, it doesn't hurt to wait a little longer.

856
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:24,800
I can wait here with Da.

857
01:21:29,569 --> 01:21:32,960
Ting, look after Mom for me. I'm worried about her.

858
01:21:33,569 --> 01:21:35,479
Mom, be sure not to work too hard.

859
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,279
Oh, you don't have to worry.

860
01:21:38,529 --> 01:21:41,000
I will take good care of her.

861
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:43,720
If she is being difficult, I will let you know immediately.

862
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:46,840
Hey, that's too much.

863
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,479
I can take care of myself.

864
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,720
Mook, take care of yourself too.

865
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:53,920
Yes, Mom.

866
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,760
And Petch,

867
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:58,319
don't be difficult with your boss.

868
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:01,439
Oak, take care of her for me.

869
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,529
- Of course. - Mom, I won't be difficult.

870
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:08,239
- Really? - Really?

871
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:31,960
Wow.

872
01:22:59,239 --> 01:23:01,609
Lan, where are you going?

873
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:04,439
Lan.

874
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:10,439
Lan.

875
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:15,199
Lan, where are you going?

876
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:16,609
Mind your own business.

877
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:20,439
I'm going with you. Don't forget we're on our honeymoon.

878
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:22,079
Wherever you go, I go with you.

879
01:23:22,649 --> 01:23:25,159
You know I don't want to be here with you.

880
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:27,609
I agreed to this because I was fed up with you.

881
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:30,840
I want to get it over with so you can stop bothering me.

882
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:42,649
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with you.

883
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:04,239
Come with me.

884
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,039
Come on, now.

885
01:25:07,239 --> 01:25:08,680
We've been followed.

886
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:19,359
What are you saying?

887
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:21,279
Trust me.

888
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:20,319
Hey!

889
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,760
- Come here. - No.

890
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,720
So, where is the person who's been following us?

891
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,119
I lost him.

892
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,479
I don't think there ever was anyone following us. You made it up.

893
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,920
I shouldn't have trusted you.

894
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,039
Lan, wait.

895
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:05,920
Lan, wait.

896
01:27:06,039 --> 01:27:07,239
Stop making things up.

897
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:10,199
I didn't make it up. We were being followed.

898
01:27:10,649 --> 01:27:13,119
I can take care of myself. I don't need you.

899
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,760
Now be sensible and recall how many times I got hurt because of you.

900
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:22,199
Let me tell you something.

901
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,079
No matter how much I hate you, I don't want to see you die.

902
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:29,920
Had I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have saved you and got myself hurt.

903
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:32,560
I don't care how you feel.

904
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:35,800
Now we only have each other. So I'm going to keep following you.

905
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,640
Get used to seeing my face.

906
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:42,880
Because all I care about is your safety.

907
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,439
Alright. Do whatever you want.

908
01:27:51,079 --> 01:27:52,640
But keep your distance.

909
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,800
Whatever.

910
01:27:58,199 --> 01:27:59,960
I've done everything because I care about you.

911
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:08,279
So are you coming with me or what?

912
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:10,880
I'm coming with you.

913
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:40,560
I can't wait to test your sexuality

914
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,039
and find out whether you're gay or not.

915
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:45,760
You won't get away this time.

916
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,000
Mook, what is it?

917
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:50,439
Dad went into cardiac arrest.

918
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:54,039
During this time, you should be by her side,

919
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,680
consoling her, reassuring her.

920
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,399
- It's not my place. - You're her husband.

921
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,119
A husband who doesn't love her.

922
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,520
So I don't have a duty to fulfill.

923
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:07,640
It's actually a good thing that you're mean to her.

924
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,279
The more you hate her,

925
01:29:10,279 --> 01:29:12,840
the greater the chance I have of making her fall in love with me.

926
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:14,720
I will begin my own game.

927
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:16,840
And I'm sure that in this game

928
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:18,479
I will be the winner.
