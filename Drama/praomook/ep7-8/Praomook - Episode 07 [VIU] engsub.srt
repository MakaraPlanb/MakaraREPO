1
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,929
(Praomook)

2
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,560
(Praomook)

3
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,370
It's your fault Dad is bedridden
and Mom is suffering.

4
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,159
- It's your fault.
- Mook!

5
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,599
Watch out!

6
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,479
The suspect
is likely to be left-handed.

7
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,319
I'm positive that he held
the gun in his left hand.

8
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,759
Win, are you left-handed?

9
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Remember this, Danai.

10
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,719
You got this position
because of my love for you.

11
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,840
If you disappoint me,

12
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm ready to destroy you.

13
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,800
Darn it.

14
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,199
How did you get here?

15
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,319
I'm moving in with my husband.

16
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,879
Wherever you go, I will go with you.

17
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:10,560
I want you to know
that I still love you.

18
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,199
Can you love me again?

19
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,240
Lan, open the door.

20
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,560
I've got to go.

21
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,400
That crazy woman
knows exactly when to turn up.

22
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Who is it?

23
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,280
It's Mook. She suddenly barged in.

24
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,039
I almost got him.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,120
She interferes with everything.

26
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:41,000
What did Lan say?

27
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,960
He is still being distant.

28
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,439
Lan is an unforgiving man.

29
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,639
At least, it's proof that
he's never forgotten about you.

30
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,479
If you were single, I'd want you
to get back together with Lan.

31
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,680
Is this the reason why
you picked me to work with him?

32
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Precisely.

33
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,520
Use this opportunity to get close
to him. Eventually he will give in.

34
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,680
Just keep Mook out of the way.
I'll help you.

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I've always been sincere with Lan.

36
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,240
But it might be too late.

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,360
The biggest obstacle isn't Mook.
It's Rut, Lan's lover.

38
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,920
It's just Lan's childish attempt
to confuse people.

39
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,279
He created a narrative that
he is gay to avoid getting married.

40
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,050
Both Lan and Rut used to be

41
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,279
on the news with different girls.
There's no way they're dating.

42
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,879
Remember this, Nuch.

43
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,959
You're his first love. The love
that never goes away from his heart.

44
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,170
The title of LS Group's
daughter-in-law is waiting for you.

45
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,639
Of course.

46
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,560
I need you to do something for me.

47
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,800
It's about my unwanted
sister-in-law.

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,610
Can you get her out of my life?

49
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,560
Do you hate Mook that much?

50
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,759
Yes.

51
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,639
What do you want me to do this time?

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,759
Make her fall in love with you
and end their marriage early.

53
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Wait.

54
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,839
I went to your office
to look for you.

55
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,279
Your team told me
you went out with Mook.

56
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
You two got close quickly.

57
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,759
We were out discussing work.

58
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,959
Do you have business with me?

59
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,439
It's nothing. I just want to
remind you about the new collection.

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Consider the cost
when you design a new product.

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,360
Your last two collections
were expensive.

62
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,560
Which led to increased prices.

63
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,600
In this economy,
nobody will want to buy them.

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't put the blame on my team.

65
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,839
If marketing doesn't approve, I'll
revise the design until they do.

66
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,720
Take it easy.

67
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,959
I don't care that Lak has your back.

68
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,079
I only have the company's
best interests in mind.

69
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,079
And keep in mind
that I'm in management

70
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,399
and you're an employee.

71
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Please follow my orders.

72
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,600
Win, no.

73
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,079
I warned you not to hurt her.

74
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,879
If you want her just because
she's the boss's daughter, stop it.

75
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,279
I'm just a second-rate employee.

76
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm unsuited for
the chairman's daughter.

77
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,319
But I've been trying to
prove myself. I truly love Lak.

78
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,240
I asked her to help me pick the ring

79
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,639
to give to you as a surprise.

80
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Danai.

81
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,399
Will you marry me?

82
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,399
Yes.

83
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,079
I will marry you.

84
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:51,159
Oh. Where is he?

85
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,960
Who are you looking for?

86
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm looking for my boss.

87
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,639
He was just sitting there.
Now he is gone.

88
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,159
Well.

89
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
What do you want?

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,159
Oh.

91
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,210
I want you to look at my work.
I've just finished it.

92
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,279
Please.

93
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,450
Interesting.

94
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,000
I think this is good enough.
Forward it to the development team.

95
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,159
Good job.

96
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,090
Okay. Okay.

97
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,039
No, Petch.

98
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,000
He is Lan's boyfriend.

99
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,159
You can be a fan,
but you can't fancy him.

100
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,399
What's the matter?

101
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,879
Why are you blushing?

102
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,210
Am I blushing?

103
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,159
Yes, obviously. Are you sick?

104
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,639
You don't feel hot.

105
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,759
- I'm fine.
- Really?

106
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,639
Okay. Okay.

107
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
That's good to hear.

108
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,279
Don't forget that you came here
to learn from Boss.

109
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,080
Don't develop feelings.
It's not going to happen.

110
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,039
I know It's not going to happen.

111
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,320
I won't develop feelings.
I will focus on my work.

112
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,039
Now keep your promise.

113
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,120
I won't develop feelings for him.

114
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,639
Rut has a lover.
And they clearly love each other.

115
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,679
I don't want to be
in a love triangle.

116
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,480
Now I should get back to work.

117
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,559
Does Boss have a lover?

118
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
No way.

119
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,480
Wow. Do you really have to do that?

120
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,840
You don't know if the man that owns
that house is gay or not.

121
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,720
Don't make a big deal out of it.

122
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,480
Lan hates me.
He doesn't even want to look at me.

123
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,799
Either way, I'm worried about you.

124
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,840
I came here to find out

125
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
if Lan and Rut are really lovers,
or they're just faking it.

126
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,799
Alright, whatever,
I can't stop you anyway.

127
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,960
- I'll give you a visit to help you.
- Alright.

128
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,879
Take care of Mom for me.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,120
I will. No problem.
She is like a mother to me.

130
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,919
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

131
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,720
Waiting for me out here,
you miss me, don't you?

132
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I do.

133
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Good evening, ma'am.

134
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
Thank you for dropping her off,
Rut and Poom.

135
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,399
No problem.

136
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,360
It's late. Have you eaten?
Why don't you have dinner with us?

137
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,799
I want to talk to you about Mook.

138
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
Did she move into Rut's house?

139
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,519
Lower your voice.

140
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,879
I was surprised. She just decided
to live in someone else's house.

141
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,720
I wouldn't dare to do that
if I were her.

142
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:20,879
Petch.

143
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,759
I apologize on Mook's behalf.

144
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,679
It's fine, Auntie.

145
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,039
Don't worry. It's actually nice to
have someone to keep Lan in check.

146
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,679
She isn't there
to keep him in check.

147
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,559
She is there to be a third wheel

148
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
or pick a fight with Lan.

149
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,960
I have an idea, Mom, Rut.

150
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,720
Let me stay at your house
so I can stop them from fighting.

151
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,960
- No.
- No.

152
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,759
Stop right there.
You will stay with me here.

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,799
That's all I want to
talk to you about.

154
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,240
Let's eat.

155
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,879
Okay.

156
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,679
You didn't make enough for me.
How selfish.

157
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,679
Do you want some? I can share.

158
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,200
I'm not selfish like someone I know.

159
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,799
No.

160
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,360
The restaurant gave me this.
I don't like it. You can have it.

161
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,879
This is crispy garlic shrimp,
your favorite.

162
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,559
I asked Ting to make it.

163
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,960
Thanks.

164
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,960
But don't bother next time.

165
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,360
- Oh.
- Then don't eat it.

166
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,679
I didn't say that I wouldn't eat it.

167
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,679
Say thank you in a meaningful way
first, then you can have it.

168
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,240
No, I won't eat it.

169
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:18,799
I will be in trouble if you put
some sort of love potion in it.

170
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,200
I don't need to rely on that stuff.

171
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,559
If you don't want it, fine.
I'll eat it myself.

172
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Hey.

173
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,599
Do you remember where this is?

174
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,920
You asked me to come here

175
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,960
to see all of that, didn't you?

176
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,170
That's right.

177
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,650
It's to make you realize
that I don't love you.

178
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,480
I never have

179
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,480
and never will.

180
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,759
It's nice that
the cafe is still open.

181
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,440
I think I will invite Lan here
to take a trip down memory lane.

182
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I love you, Nuch.

183
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,359
Only you.

184
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,599
Don't you love Praomook?

185
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,890
I will never love
that ugly duckling.

186
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm at the cafe.

187
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,890
If I give him a call,
do you think he will come?

188
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,440
Do you think he will go?

189
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,319
I can make him come to me.
Do you want to see me try?

190
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,359
But I think
he is already on his way.

191
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,200
If he comes to me,
you'll have to sleep alone tonight.

192
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,680
I won't let him go back easily.

193
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,839
He doesn't love you anymore.

194
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,680
It doesn't matter.
I can make him love me again.

195
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,960
Don't forget that it's easy
to spark up an old flame,

196
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,960
unlike you, a wet log

197
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,200
that is incapable of catching fire.

198
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,559
I won't let him go to you.

199
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,480
You're wasting your time
waiting for him.

200
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,279
Do you remember what happened
between us at this place?

201
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,519
You may not remember it.

202
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
But I always will.

203
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,559
I remember the first time
you said you love me.

204
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,000
You're the first man
who said he loved me.

205
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,410
You're my first love.

206
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,480
(Treenuch)

207
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,279
Lan will stay with me.
I won't let him go anywhere.

208
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,599
If you're so lonely,
call someone else.

209
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,279
If you don't want to be called
a mistress, stop calling my husband.

210
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,759
What's wrong with you?

211
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,000
Stay away from her from now on.

212
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,650
Why do I have to listen to you?

213
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,240
This is my life.
I can do whatever I want.

214
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,799
Even my parents can't tell me what
to do. Who do you think you are?

215
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,440
I'm your wife.

216
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,680
I have the right to stop you
from seeing other women,

217
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,319
especially one
who is thirsting after you.

218
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,200
A legitimate wife
whom I did not wish to marry.

219
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,200
I will not listen to you.

220
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,720
That's right. I'm a legitimate wife

221
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,599
who can file a lawsuit against
my husband's mistress.

222
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,650
I can sue you.
Do you want to try me?

223
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,650
You're a greedy, selfish woman.

224
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,650
Call me anything you want.
You gave me this right.

225
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,039
Let me tell you something.

226
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,039
You're mine.

227
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,960
I've never been yours.
Quit talking nonsense.

228
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,650
You're the same annoying woman.

229
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,890
Quit talking nonsense.
I don't love you.

230
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,799
I never loved you,
not even a little.

231
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:12,960
Calm down, Mook.

232
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,890
You don't love him.

233
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:17,119
You don't feel anything for him.

234
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,960
Don't answer it. This is an order.

235
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,200
I don't take orders from you.

236
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,680
Hey. Give it back.

237
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,480
- Don't answer it.
- Praomook.

238
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,240
- You're not allowed to answer it.
- Give it back.

239
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,359
Let go.

240
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,920
Let go, Lan.

241
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
Praomook.

242
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,279
Duckling.

243
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,799
Praomook!

244
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Lan!

245
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,039
- Lan, help me!
- Duckling!

246
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,279
Help me!

247
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,559
Mook!

248
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,119
You weren't drowning.
You tricked me.

249
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:19,359
If I didn't trick you,
you would've gone to see her.

250
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,599
So? Do you have to
risk your life for that?

251
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,680
What if you actually drown
and no one helps you?

252
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,079
I'll just die.

253
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,079
Praomook.

254
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,039
You care about me.

255
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,640
I don't care about you.
I just don't want you to die here.

256
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:42,680
I hate you. Why would I help you?

257
00:23:50,839 --> 00:23:52,039
You know,

258
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:55,880
although your appearance changed,

259
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,640
the way you look at me
hasn't changed.

260
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,039
You always look at me
with annoyance,

261
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,519
anger, frustration,

262
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,480
disdain, humor.

263
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,279
Sometimes you look at me
with concern, like now.

264
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,640
But what I will never forget

265
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,279
is your look of hatred.

266
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,720
Are you trying to
play on my sympathy?

267
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,559
I won't fall for your tricks.

268
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,759
Remember my hatred

269
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
because you will face it
for the rest of your life.

270
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,880
Remember my hatred.

271
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,119
Because you will face it
for the rest of your life.

272
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Hey.

273
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
Do you feel better?

274
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,319
Rut.

275
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,880
When did you get here?

276
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,200
Long enough to know
the cause of your frustration.

277
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,960
If you feel better,
please get out of the pool.

278
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,559
Sorry.

279
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,359
Thanks.

280
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,839
Come on. Let's go.

281
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,799
You must hate duckling.

282
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,920
Hate her as much as possible.

283
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,160
Hey, Dad.

284
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:45,119
You have your own house. Why are you
staying at someone else's place?

285
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,920
You're married. You have to think of
your wife before you do things.

286
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,519
If Mook wasn't nice enough
to follow you there,

287
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,079
I would've dragged you back myself.

288
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,839
You don't hold back, do you?

289
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,079
- Let me talk to him.
- Dear, I'm not done.

290
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,000
- I'll talk to him.
- But...

291
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,640
- Lan, my dear.
- Yes, Mom.

292
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,640
Listen. Mook is your wife.

293
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:13,559
You have to take good care of her.

294
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,079
Mook can take care of herself.

295
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh, give me. Listen, Lan.

296
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,880
You think you don't have
a duty to anybody, do you?

297
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
You don't care about your wife.
You don't go to work.

298
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:25,839
I guess so.

299
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,079
Is that all? I want to sleep.

300
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,839
No, I haven't finished talking.

301
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,079
Be aware that you're married.

302
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,160
If you mess around with Rut,
it means you're having an affair

303
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:39,640
and I will kill you.

304
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
What?

305
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,079
Look at this. He hung up on me.

306
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,519
Dear, will you calm down?

307
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,480
If I were him, I would do the same.

308
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,920
You didn't let him talk.
You just kept bashing him.

309
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,559
Don't you think
he deserves to be bashed?

310
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
(Together in happiness and hardship.
Get well soon.)

311
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,400
M, he is taken.

312
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,400
Don't develop feelings, Petch.

313
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,559
Oh, look at my son.

314
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,920
- Dear.
- Hm?

315
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:54,799
He wants to rile me up, doesn't he?

316
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,160
Look at this.

317
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,799
Dear, it's nothing. It's lovely.

318
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,160
Lovely? What's lovely about this?

319
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,920
They're friends taking care
of each other. That's lovely.

320
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,039
Dear, we're in a risky situation.

321
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,000
If Lan really loves him,

322
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,519
this will be a big issue.
We won't get to have grandchildren.

323
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,079
What would you get into a panic for?

324
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,240
I'm telling you.
Lan is probably snickering right now

325
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,759
for successfully
getting a rise out of you.

326
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,079
Lan, you jerk.

327
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,559
Poom, can you apply this for me?

328
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
Am I hurting you?

329
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
Mook.

330
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,319
I thought you were Poom.
I should do it myself.

331
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,680
Let me do it for you.

332
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,359
I want to return the favor
for helping my sister.

333
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Come on.

334
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,640
Do you still love Lan?

335
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,880
Why do you ask?

336
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,960
I'm just curious.

337
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,839
I can't love him.

338
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,759
Why can't you love him?

339
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,240
Don't you see

340
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,920
that he hates me?
He doesn't even want to look at me.

341
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,200
If I fall in love with him,
I will be the one who gets hurt.

342
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,519
You can't love him, but you can
love somebody else, right?

343
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,519
Rut.

344
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,880
I can't leave you
by yourself, can I?

345
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,400
You're so used to seducing men,
knowing he's gay doesn't stop you.

346
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,400
You have a dirty mind. I was just
putting ointment on for him.

347
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:42,880
You don't have to be that close
to put ointment on him.

348
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,240
You were trying to seduce him.

349
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,160
What are you making a fuss about?

350
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,920
I'm possessive of you.

351
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,920
You're my boyfriend.
I can't let girls be near you.

352
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,759
Are you two together?

353
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,799
Impossible.

354
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,000
Why do you say it's impossible?

355
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,839
- Boss and Lan...
- Poom.

356
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,279
Look. You arrived at the right time.

357
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,440
I have to talk to you
about something. Follow me.

358
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,440
Boss. Lan.

359
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,640
Are you dating each other?

360
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,359
How did I miss this?

361
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,680
What on earth is going on?

362
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,240
Poom, shut up and listen to me.

363
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,240
- But...
- If you don't shut up,

364
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,319
I will kick you out of here.

365
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,839
I'll tell you the whole story.

366
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,079
Do you really have to do this?

367
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Yes.

368
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,640
Now that you know, help us
sell it to people that we're lovers.

369
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,400
If Mook finds out that it's a lie,

370
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,319
as the co-owner of our new company

371
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,519
and your future boss,

372
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,720
I'll cut your pay by 40 percent.

373
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,920
There will be no bonus,
no paid holiday.

374
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,360
If you refuse to be my assistant,
I will tell Rut to fire you.

375
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,199
Come on, Lan.

376
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,400
Your punishment is harsher than his.

377
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,599
How could you do this to me?

378
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,239
Now you can't get caught.

379
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,039
If someone asks you about us,
just make up a story. Got it?

380
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,559
Got it.

381
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Where are you going?

382
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:57,559
I'm sleeping in Rut's room.

383
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:01,119
Do you think I will sleep here
after I gave you my room?

384
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,960
Sorry to disappoint.
I won't share a room with you.

385
00:35:06,289 --> 00:35:08,360
I knew this would happen.

386
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,480
You can go anywhere you want.

387
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,639
Do you mean it,
or am I hearing things?

388
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:16,440
I mean it. You can sleep
anywhere you want.

389
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,809
Lan, what's wrong?

390
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,239
It's nothing.
I just have a bad feeling.

391
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,719
Now isn't the time to be hesitant.
We have to get to work.

392
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,329
I made a new marketing plan.

393
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,769
Take a look at it.

394
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:16,329
Rut, can I sleep
in this room tonight?

395
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
No, you can't.

396
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:20,639
Why? Spouses are supposed to
sleep together.

397
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,079
I'm sleeping with him.

398
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,480
Go ahead.

399
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,840
I can sleep on his other side.

400
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
- No.
- No.

401
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,239
Look. Didn't you hear
that we said no?

402
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,719
Get out now.
Don't make me throw you out.

403
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,769
No. I'm sleeping beside
my husband tonight.

404
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,360
You can sleep beside
Rut and Poom if you want.

405
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:52,440
No. If you're possessed by the devil

406
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,679
and violate my Rut,
who will take responsibility?

407
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:57,159
I will take responsibility.

408
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,159
Either way, it won't happen.
Get out.

409
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
- No. Let go.
- Leave.

410
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,079
Lan, be gentle.

411
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:07,519
I'm not leaving.
I will sleep here tonight.

412
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,289
You can prove
that you love each other.

413
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,769
Why do I have to prove it to you?

414
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,039
So I can be sure that
my husband doesn't like women.

415
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,719
Maybe I will change my mind

416
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,480
and decide not to
get between you two.

417
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,880
All I know right now

418
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:28,199
is that your love
may not be reciprocated.

419
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,000
I've been only listening to
your declaration of love.

420
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,039
I've never seen him do anything.
It's like he is being forced.

421
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,679
He doesn't talk much.

422
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,599
Ask Poom if you don't believe me.
He can confirm it.

423
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,920
Is it true, Poom?

424
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,639
It's true. Boss and Lan
love each other very much.

425
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,400
It's just that
Boss isn't very expressive.

426
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:50,199
If you don't believe me,
they can show it to you.

427
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,519
Hug him. She will buy it.

428
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,809
You can kiss his cheek.

429
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,769
If you do it, I will sleep alone.

430
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,079
Why do I have to do as you say?

431
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:08,400
Come on, Lan. Just get it over with.

432
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,199
- Poom.
- It's just a kiss. Don't be shy.

433
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,519
Come on. I'll help you.

434
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm in trouble.

435
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,769
Do you see how in love we are?

436
00:38:55,769 --> 00:38:57,719
You can't get between us.

437
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,360
Go back to your room.

438
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:04,920
Hey.

439
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,400
Rut, please let me sleep here.
I don't want to sleep alone.

440
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,480
We can talk about Lan tonight.

441
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:19,639
Enough, duckling.
He won't let you sleep here.

442
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,480
Stop trying to get between us.

443
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:24,289
- No, I'm not leaving. Hey!
- Hey.

444
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:28,289
Alright.

445
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,960
You can sleep anywhere you want.

446
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,159
Rut.

447
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,769
No.

448
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,159
You're a woman. You can't sleep
in the same room with two men.

449
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:41,880
Why not?

450
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,079
You two don't like women.

451
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,440
Poom, shut your mouth.

452
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,239
Poom is right.

453
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,159
You and Rut
don't feel anything for me.

454
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:59,119
So I can sleep anywhere.

455
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:03,119
Unless you're scared of me.

456
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,960
Or maybe you feel something for me.

457
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,809
You can't make me feel anything
except annoyance.

458
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,559
Go back to your room.

459
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:16,719
Hey, let go. I'm not going.

460
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,809
- You're hurting me.
- Lan.

461
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:21,960
You're being too harsh.
You're hurting her.

462
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:24,000
This is nothing compared to
what she has done to me.

463
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,480
It doesn't mean you can hurt her.

464
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:29,289
Rut, are you taking her side?

465
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:33,880
I'm not taking anybody's side.
I just don't agree with this.

466
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,769
Besides, I said
she can sleep anywhere she wants.

467
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:40,599
She has your permission,
but not mine.

468
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,559
Then you can go back to your room.

469
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,480
This is my room.
I get to make the decision.

470
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,159
You're good,
getting him on your side.

471
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,289
Sleep anywhere you want.

472
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Lan.

473
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:36,039
You can't sleep, right?

474
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,840
Neither can you.

475
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,960
Rut, this is your fault.

476
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,480
If you feel uncomfortable,

477
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,639
you can go to your room.
I can stay here.

478
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,480
No way. I'm staying here.

479
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,480
Okay, whatever you say.

480
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,599
Whatever.

481
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Evil duckling.

482
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,329
Well, is it comfortable
on the floor?

483
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,199
Well, is it comfortable
on the floor?

484
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:21,769
Lan, you.

485
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:26,559
What? I'm sleeping here.

486
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:28,119
Lan, no.

487
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:36,360
- Share it with me.
- Alright. Let's share.

488
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Alright.

489
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:41,559
Move over a little.

490
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,199
You're too big.

491
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
M,

492
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:02,760
I will help you get rid of
a thorn in your side.

493
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,079
Duckling, you can't beat me.

494
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,519
What are you doing in here?

495
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,440
I was going to take a shower.

496
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,639
Didn't you see that I was showering?

497
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,320
Or you did and want to join me.

498
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:56,320
Hey.

499
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,760
No, wait.

500
00:46:58,639 --> 00:46:59,760
What are you doing?

501
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,599
Do you want me to wash you?

502
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,880
Sorry, I'm kidding.

503
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,760
Did you really think I meant it?

504
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:21,039
I've told you before.

505
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,320
Even if you're the only girl left
in the world, I will not go for you.

506
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,159
In my eyes,

507
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,960
you're just an ugly duckling.
Nothing about you is attractive.

508
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,760
Your mind is twisted and dirty.

509
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:36,719
All I see

510
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,199
is that same bad attitude of yours.

511
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,719
Do you think
you can hurt me with that?

512
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,920
I feel nothing.

513
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,840
Remember what you said to me though.

514
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,159
When you find me attractive one day,
you will have to swallow your words.

515
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,039
That day won't come.

516
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,679
An ugly duckling just becomes
an ugly duck. Still covered in mud.

517
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:09,039
It can never become a swan.

518
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,119
It's a children's story
that's never come true.

519
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,280
I warned you.

520
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,840
Endure it

521
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,079
because there's nothing else
you can do.

522
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Lak,

523
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,679
I think you should let Lan be
in charge of the marketing project

524
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,440
that we partnered with
a real estate developer for.

525
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,559
But I started this project.
Why should I give it to him?

526
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,760
Just let him work on it.

527
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,800
You have a lot on your hands.
Why don't you let him help?

528
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,960
But, Dad.

529
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,559
Just do as I say. Trust me.

530
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,199
I think you should
assign him a new project.

531
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,719
Changing the person now
may disrupt the work.

532
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,159
Oh, Lak will continue to oversee
the project initially.

533
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,039
Once things are in good order,
she can hand the project over.

534
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,400
- But...
- Just do as I say, alright?

535
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:33,440
Alright.

536
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:36,400
But if your beloved son ruins it,

537
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,440
don't ask me for help.

538
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,119
Because I won't help him.

539
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,159
Lak.

540
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,480
Excuse me.

541
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,000
How will she live on her own
being unreasonable like that?

542
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,519
Dear, why do you always
bring up work at the dining table?

543
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,840
And why do you have to do this?

544
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,760
You can't just ask Lak
to hand over her project to Lan.

545
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,960
Anybody would be upset to hear that.

546
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,519
Dear, the reason why
I want Lan to be in charge

547
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,960
is that the project
is in good order now.

548
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,840
I actually have a new project for
Lak because I know she can do it.

549
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:22,199
A director doesn't have to
stay till the end of every project.

550
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,039
Oh, hey.

551
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,079
Why didn't you tell her this

552
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:31,199
before she stormed off?

553
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:35,400
Well, she left
before I could say it.

554
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,480
Lak.

555
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,320
Lak.

556
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,480
If you're going to make excuses
on Dad's behalf, don't bother.

557
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,079
You know how much effort
I put into this project.

558
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:53,599
It's unfair that Dad thinks
Lan can take it from me like that.

559
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,400
Maybe he thinks
you have a lot on your hands.

560
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,719
Is that why he wants to hand
things over to his favorite child?

561
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,719
Like Lan wants to do it.

562
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,679
Sometimes I wish
the whole thing would fail.

563
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,480
That might make Dad realize that
Lan doesn't deserve to be the heir.

564
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,039
Calm down, Lak.

565
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,199
This project is important
to the company.

566
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,159
We can't let it fail.

567
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,360
If you want to help Lan,

568
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,840
go ahead.
I want nothing to do with it.

569
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:42,039
Hey!

570
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:45,679
How did you get here?

571
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,440
I walked in. It's not hard.

572
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,079
Did you ask for permission
before you entered my house?

573
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,440
This is private property,
not public property.

574
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
Now,

575
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,559
you're still clueless.

576
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,320
Now that I entered the place,
please give me permission.

577
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:11,519
Thank you.

578
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,960
Never mind.

579
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,360
Are you here for your sister?

580
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,079
I'm here for both of you.

581
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:25,920
I came to check to see if she
was giving you a hard time.

582
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,360
Tell me if she's done anything to
offend you, and I'll deal with her.

583
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:33,119
You will deal with her?

584
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,280
Once I'm determined to do something,
nothing can stop me.

585
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,599
You're such a liar.

586
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,800
Don't underestimate me.

587
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,480
I know I'm right.

588
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,480
Now, get out. And don't
be nosing around here.

589
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:08,639
You bratty child, quit staring.

590
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,400
Here.

591
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:14,480
I'm not a child anymore.

592
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,880
Can't I check you out?

593
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:18,760
Don't be mingy.

594
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,280
Rut.

595
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:44,719
What is it again?

596
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:48,480
Your arm is still recovering.
Won't it hurt to swim in a pool?

597
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,119
Don't touch me.

598
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:52,719
It's better now.

599
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,880
Hey!

600
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,599
Your arm still hurts.

601
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,880
I'll get you some ointment
to help relieve the pain.

602
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:10,320
Where can I find it?

603
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,000
- Oh!
- Hey!

604
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,760
Rut, help me. Don't let go of me.

605
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,559
If I let go of you,

606
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,519
you will fall.

607
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,519
What should I do with
a rude and stubborn child?

608
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:35,400
Rut, don't do it.

609
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
No.

610
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,559
Sorry. I'm sorry for being rude.

611
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,880
I promise I will behave.

612
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,039
Rut, you jerk! You meanie!

613
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:00,280
Come on.

614
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,280
Nampetch! Boss, what happened?

615
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,840
Nothing.

616
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:13,280
I just taught a nosy rat a lesson.

617
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,880
Nampetch, get out of the pool.

618
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,360
Poom, stop!

619
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:29,119
What?

620
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,079
Rut!

621
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,920
Poom, take her.

622
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:22,840
Yes, Dad.

623
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,079
Come on.
I'll take you to your sister.

624
00:56:27,559 --> 00:56:30,480
Let's get you into dry clothes.
He'll scold you if you get sick.

625
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:33,920
You're mean.

626
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,639
Wait for my turn.

627
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,639
I'll make you regret it.

628
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Mook.

629
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:12,639
Did you move here to
break Lan and Rut up?

630
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,239
I've never wanted to break up
anyone's relationship.

631
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:18,079
Then why did you move here?

632
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,599
I'm married, Petch.

633
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,239
I go where Lan goes.

634
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,880
Still I don't agree with
you moving here.

635
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,360
Mook, I think
marrying him is enough.

636
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:31,119
Our house situation
has been dealt with.

637
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:34,159
What do you actually want from him?

638
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,559
Don't you want him to be happy?

639
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:38,599
Stop asking me questions.
This is between me and him.

640
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,280
I don't want my sister to
ruin someone's relationship.

641
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,840
This is my life.
I can deal with it myself.

642
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,119
I guess you don't want to
listen to a kid like me.

643
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:52,880
You can do whatever you please.
Go ahead.

644
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:56,119
And I will do what I think is right.

645
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:58,039
Don't try to stop me.

646
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,719
Baby.

647
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:19,039
What's with you, Lan?

648
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,760
Can you get
duckling out of the house

649
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,559
before I go crazy?

650
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,000
This is your problem.
Fix it on your own.

651
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
Hold on.

652
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,880
You let the problem into this house.

653
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,800
I just want to be near her.

654
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,400
I have to seize the opportunity
when I see it.

655
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,159
Then make her fall in love with you
and divorce me already.

656
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,159
I will. Don't worry about that.

657
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,639
Don't change your mind later.

658
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,800
I won't change my mind.

659
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,559
Remember what you said.

660
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:06,559
You know that

661
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,119
once I start doing something,

662
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,440
no one can get in my way.

663
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,239
I know.

664
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,159
(Treenuch)

665
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,360
(Treenuch)

666
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,760
I will make you give in.

667
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:04,039
Why didn't you answer?

668
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,719
I have nothing to say to her.

669
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,079
Is it because
you're afraid of yourself?

670
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
I don't know.

671
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,239
To be honest,
I have no idea why she came back.

672
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,000
My instincts are telling me
to be careful.

673
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:26,599
But I'm unsure
what to be careful of.

674
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,679
You should be careful of Treenuch.

675
01:00:30,039 --> 01:00:32,880
There are only a couple of reasons
why people who disappeared

676
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,119
from your life suddenly turn up.

677
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:38,480
It's either intent or fate.

678
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,559
But I don't believe in fate.

679
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,039
Why are you trying to say?
Just tell me. I don't want to think.

680
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,599
You're in a dangerous situation.

681
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,199
I have to do a background check
on everyone who enters your life.

682
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,519
But I found nothing on Treenuch.

683
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,320
Don't you think that's strange?

684
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,360
(Lak)

685
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,519
Come into the office now.

686
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,400
You can do other things later.

687
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,519
They're all controlling people.

688
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:43,360
Hey.

689
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,559
She came with me.

690
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:48,519
You'll be in charge of this project.

691
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,920
And you

692
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,760
will work with Win
on the design project.

693
01:02:56,199 --> 01:02:57,199
Okay.

694
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,719
I'm not doing this.

695
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:08,360
This project is yours.
Why are you handing it over to me?

696
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,320
That's right. It's my project.

697
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,360
But Dad wants you to take over.

698
01:03:13,239 --> 01:03:17,679
I guess he wants to show the board
his son can take on big projects.

699
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,079
That's why he is giving you my work.

700
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,400
To be honest,

701
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,559
I don't think you can do it.

702
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:30,320
Right. I'm useless

703
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,760
and irresponsible.
I will ruin your work.

704
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,840
You can take your project back.
I don't want it.

705
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,159
You threw away your chance
before you even began.

706
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,480
Don't you want to prove yourself
that you're not what Dad thinks?

707
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:47,639
No. It's futile.

708
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:52,119
Can you stop being aimless?
I'm begging you.

709
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,559
Start being responsible so that
Dad can stop messing with my work.

710
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:00,599
Your behavior affects
not only yourself

711
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:02,599
but also me and Danai.

712
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,760
Quit playing around.

713
01:04:07,079 --> 01:04:08,159
I'm not playing around.

714
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,679
I just want to
live the life I choose.

715
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,800
But Dad, you, or even Mom
doesn't listen to me.

716
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,440
You keep telling me what to do.

717
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:18,000
And when I say no, you don't care.

718
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,599
I don't play around with my life.

719
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,840
Don't judge me
when you know nothing about me.

720
01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:27,840
Are you done?

721
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,360
If you are, take this project.

722
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,480
I don't care if you don't want to.
Just get the job done.

723
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,880
Now, you,

724
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,920
do your job properly.

725
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:56,960
If you make even a little mistake,
being Dad's favorite won't help you.

726
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,519
Now you can leave.

727
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,320
Your behavior affects
not only yourself

728
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,400
but also me and Danai.

729
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,440
Quit playing around.

730
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,639
Lan, are you playing around?

731
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:41,280
Why are you here?

732
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,519
You have to take on this project
and get it done.

733
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:48,880
Whether I take it on or not
is none of your business.

734
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,320
After all of that, do you still
want to avoid your duty?

735
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,400
You need to grow up.

736
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,400
Now's your chance to
show everyone that you can do it.

737
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:59,320
But I didn't ask for this.

738
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,079
Then just say what you want to do.

739
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,960
If you don't say it,
nobody will know what you want.

740
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:08,159
Can you quit being nosy?

741
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:10,920
This doesn't concern you.

742
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,920
This is my life. I can handle it.

743
01:06:15,159 --> 01:06:19,039
I don't need my parents, my sister,
and my unwanted wife to help me.

744
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,239
I don't want to be nosy,
but this concerns me too.

745
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:25,840
You might think that
you didn't ask for this.

746
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,000
To me, this is a chance
to learn something new.

747
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,000
You know, I was like you.

748
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,840
I didn't want to take up the baton.
I wanted to do what I love.

749
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:36,000
But when I lost everything,

750
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,760
I realized how much I regretted
turning down my chance.

751
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,800
If it were possible,
I would want everything back.

752
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,920
You wouldn't understand
what I'm trying to say.

753
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:48,119
You never suffered a loss.

754
01:06:49,159 --> 01:06:51,079
How do you know
I never suffered a loss?

755
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:52,960
How well do you know me?

756
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,679
If you know nothing, shut up.

757
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,000
- But I...
- I said, shut up and leave.

758
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:04,119
Do whatever you want.
I don't care about you anymore.

759
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,599
Good.

760
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,360
You are just like them.

761
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:28,679
Jerk! That was
such a waste of energy.

762
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,000
Hey, Mook.

763
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,159
You look well.

764
01:07:41,719 --> 01:07:44,000
I guess you've recovered
from compulsive lying.

765
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,320
It's a recurrent illness.

766
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:52,800
I guess it only happens
in front of Lan.

767
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,039
That's right.

768
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:56,960
You're supposed to
be like that with your husband.

769
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,079
You're good at imagining things
just like before.

770
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,360
I told you that I came back

771
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:06,440
to take back what's mine.

772
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,639
Lan will be mine again.

773
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,239
Lan isn't an object.
I can't hand him over to you.

774
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:17,399
Don't forget that he doesn't feel
the same way about you.

775
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,529
Don't worry about that.

776
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:23,479
I will make him
fall in love with me again.

777
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,239
Ugly duckling.

778
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,079
Shut up. You have no right
to call me that.

779
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:37,239
Oops, sorry, I was being too frank.

780
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:39,880
You're not that ugly,

781
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:44,119
but you still can't get him
to look at you. How pathetic.

782
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:46,199
You're pathetic.

783
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:49,439
You know he's a married man,
and yet you try to be his mistress.

784
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:51,649
Good women don't do that.

785
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,960
I'm not a mistress.
I'm a woman he loves.

786
01:08:55,079 --> 01:08:58,239
He loved you once.
Don't think too highly of yourself.

787
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:01,529
I will not give Lan to you.

788
01:09:02,119 --> 01:09:04,920
If you want him,
over my dead body.

789
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:06,199
Are you shameless enough to do that?

790
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:07,649
Go ahead, hit me.

791
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:09,920
You should know who's place this is.

792
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:13,119
If I get attacked
and his parents find out,

793
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,920
I'm curious to know
what your boss will say

794
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:17,960
when you lose this opportunity.

795
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,239
This time I'll let you get away.

796
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:23,479
I won't stop here.

797
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,609
- Boss.
- What?

798
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,000
A university sent you an invitation

799
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:47,399
to be this year's guest speaker.

800
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:56,920
Accept the invitation
and put it on my schedule.

801
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:00,760
Tell everyone to get ready to
create a new game demo.

802
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,840
Test to see whose demo
is the more interesting.

803
01:10:03,609 --> 01:10:06,840
I want the new faces to try it.
Maybe I will take one with me.

804
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:10,119
Do you want to hold a competition?
Maybe we will get a new game.

805
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:13,079
Good idea.
You can announce the news.

806
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:14,720
Is that all?

807
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:16,199
There's one more thing.

808
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,920
I hacked into the CCTV cameras,

809
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:21,609
but the data was already deleted
according to the interval settings.

810
01:10:27,479 --> 01:10:29,960
Then we have to rely on Mook and
see if she can remember anything

811
01:10:31,569 --> 01:10:33,239
or wait for another attack.

812
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,399
I don't think he will stop here.

813
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:21,649
Why don't these numbers match?

814
01:11:28,359 --> 01:11:29,800
(Treenuch)

815
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,159
Hello, Nuch.

816
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:39,920
Wait for me right there.
I'll meet you in a moment.

817
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:57,920
Nuch.

818
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:01,079
What's wrong with your car?

819
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:03,479
I don't know.
The engine won't start.

820
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,680
I guess we have to get a mechanic.

821
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:24,279
Will it take long? I'm tired.
I want to go home and rest.

822
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,960
I don't know.

823
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,399
If you're tired, you can go home.
I'll have someone deal with the car.

824
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,479
Can you give me a ride?

825
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,800
I don't want to take a taxi.

826
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,199
Don't you care about me anymore?

827
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,439
Alright. I'll give you a ride.

828
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:17,920
(Game design competition
for academic purposes)

829
01:13:18,569 --> 01:13:21,760
Game design competition
for academic purposes.

830
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:25,159
Whoever gives the best presentation

831
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,319
will be Boss's assistant
at an academic conference

832
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:30,439
and win a free trip
with pocket money.

833
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,319
Poom, can I enter the competition?

834
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,199
- Sure thing.
- Really?

835
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:39,680
There's another condition.

836
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,800
To submit your work,
you must complete your job.

837
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:48,840
If you don't complete your job,
a pay cut is waiting for you.

838
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:51,159
- Yes, Boss.
- Yes, Boss.

839
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:03,000
You have to win this, Nampetch.

840
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm happy to spend time with you.

841
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:28,479
It reminds me of the old days.

842
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:32,760
If we didn't break up,

843
01:14:34,359 --> 01:14:36,079
we would have more time together.

844
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:40,569
My short temper ruined everything.

845
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,529
I'm sorry, Lan.

846
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:47,960
Don't blame yourself.

847
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:50,920
Only one person
should be to blame for this.

848
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,960
I don't want to blame Mook,

849
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,359
but without her,
we would have been happy.

850
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:06,649
Can we start over?

851
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:21,960
Alright.

852
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,319
Let's start over.

853
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:25,649
Do you mean that?

854
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:39,680
I should change into new clothes.

855
01:15:40,359 --> 01:15:41,359
Give me a moment.

856
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:21,439
I will make you forget about her.

857
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:43,680
I'm meeting Nuch.

858
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:47,479
Her car breaking down was her plan
to get you to take her home.

859
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,439
Take her home.

860
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,720
I want you to watch her and
see if anything looks suspicious.

861
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,439
I asked Poom to investigate.

862
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,239
A man often gives her a visit,
but we don't know who he is.

863
01:16:58,609 --> 01:17:00,239
You may find a lead.

864
01:17:00,569 --> 01:17:02,800
Alright, I'll play ball with her.

865
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,920
Try to be careful.
You don't want to be tricked.

866
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,439
If you make a mistake, the game may
flip, leaving you at a disadvantage.

867
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,960
I know that.
You don't have to warn me.

868
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:16,319
I have to warn you because
I know you will be tempted.

869
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,279
Remember, if you get excited,
focus on what I told you.

870
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,119
Did you wait long?

871
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:40,279
It felt sticky so I took a shower.

872
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:46,920
Let's get back to dinner.

873
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:53,569
Oh!

874
01:19:22,609 --> 01:19:24,439
I will make you forget everyone.

875
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:26,840
I will be the only thing you see.

876
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,159
I won't let anyone have you.

877
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:59,720
I have to warn you because
I know you will be tempted.

878
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,239
If you get excited,
focus on what I told you.

879
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:08,399
Nuch.

880
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,199
Stay with me tonight.

881
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,079
Nuch, someone's at the door.

882
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:43,720
I'll be back.

883
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:26,159
Mook, how did you get here?

884
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,960
Why can't I come here?
I'm looking for my husband.

885
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:04,840
Wait.

886
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:11,119
You're a nasty piece of work.

887
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,319
What's gotten into you?

888
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:14,680
I smacked some sense into you.

889
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:17,529
You already have the other man,
now you want the other woman?

890
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,279
Did you forget that you're gay?

891
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:22,680
Make your choice.
Don't fool around like this.

892
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,720
- This is...
- Don't say this doesn't concern me.

893
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:27,399
Because this concerns me,

894
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:30,529
Rut, and Nuch,
your promiscuous woman.

895
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,880
That's out of line.
I will report you for trespassing.

896
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,359
Be my guest.

897
01:22:36,609 --> 01:22:39,359
I will sue you for having an affair
with my husband.

898
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:42,000
What kind of charge is that?

899
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:47,239
Besides having loose morals,
you're poorly educated.

900
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,960
These days there's a law
protecting married women's rights.

901
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:53,479
If I have proof that you are
having an affair with my husband,

902
01:22:53,609 --> 01:22:56,039
I can file a lawsuit against you.

903
01:22:56,199 --> 01:22:57,529
Are you threatening me?

904
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,720
You can't do anything to me.

905
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:02,760
Do you want to find out?
I will do it.

906
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:05,359
Are you sure
you can handle it, mistress-to-be?

907
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,960
- You!
- Hit me.

908
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:10,680
Go ahead.
You will be charged with assault.

909
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,159
Come on. Hit me.

910
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:15,760
- Come on.
- Hey, stop it.

911
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,279
We didn't do
what you thought we did.

912
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:21,880
Then why is your shirt like this?

913
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:25,399
Don't tell me you wanted it off,
nothing happened. I'm not stupid.

914
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:28,720
One is in a skimpy dress.

915
01:23:30,079 --> 01:23:31,199
The other...

916
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:34,359
What is this lipstick mark?

917
01:23:34,569 --> 01:23:36,960
If I were late, I'd probably have
walked into a scandalous scene.

918
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,000
Nonsense.

919
01:23:39,239 --> 01:23:41,199
Nothing happened. You're crazy.

920
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:44,720
I told you I love Rut.
Women don't excite me.

921
01:23:45,609 --> 01:23:47,119
I can get crazier.

922
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:51,199
And I'll test it myself
whether women can excite you or not.

923
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,680
You don't have to test anything.

924
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:54,529
Stop prying into my business.

925
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Lan.

926
01:23:57,159 --> 01:23:58,319
I've got to go.

927
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,079
You can try to get between us
with your rights as a wife.

928
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:06,079
But it doesn't mean he loves you.

929
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,399
Even in your next life,
he will never love you.

930
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,039
He doesn't love you either.

931
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,649
Don't act like
you have the upper hand.

932
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:22,279
If you were important to him, he
would've come back to you long ago.

933
01:24:23,439 --> 01:24:25,239
You aren't different from me.

934
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:27,720
I might even be in the lead.

935
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:30,479
Try harder.

936
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,880
Our bond is deeper than you think.

937
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:37,840
I won't let you take him from me.

938
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,840
I'm not a mistress. I'm number one.

939
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,319
Lan will be mine.

940
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:23,920
(You failed, didn't you?)

941
01:25:24,039 --> 01:25:26,439
(Sorry, Mook suddenly showed up.)

942
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,119
(She ruined everything.)

943
01:25:29,239 --> 01:25:33,039
(I won't fail next time.)

944
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:43,569
(Useless!)

945
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:47,439
(I'll give you another chance.
Don't fail this time.)

946
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:52,649
(If you fail,
you won't get anything!)

947
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,479
A promiscuous man like this
should be kept in check.

948
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:44,760
As long as I am here,
he won't see any women.

949
01:26:45,359 --> 01:26:48,840
You're number one.
You will be his only lover.

950
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:50,569
You seem to get along well.

951
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:52,319
Why don't you sleep
in the same room tonight?

952
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,159
So I can finally be at peace.

953
01:26:56,359 --> 01:26:57,359
- Hey!
- Hey!

954
01:26:58,649 --> 01:26:59,880
Did you sleep with each other?

955
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:01,239
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

956
01:27:01,569 --> 01:27:05,000
Are you going to pursue duckling
even though she thinks you're gay?

957
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,960
You really like her,

958
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:08,720
or you think this is a game.

959
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:12,000
Win is heading to the factory.

960
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,239
Get the job done.

961
01:27:16,239 --> 01:27:17,569
Lan, watch out!
