Unforgettable Love
EP17

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,790
Are you sad to leave?

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
I just can't bear to part with Xiaobao.

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,670
Don't be too sad.

5
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,440
You like He Qiaoyan.

6
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:16,560
This is a wonderful thing.

7
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,270
Even though you don't end up being with each other

8
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,270
you will also gain happiness in the process.

9
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,360
That's enough.

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,590
You're right.

11
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,310
The process is more important than the result.

12
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,880
Let's go.

13
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,919
Why did you make this recording?

14
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,630
Qin Yiyue, are you an idiot?

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
Good night.

16
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,880
Good night.

17
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,590
Be calm.

18
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,790
After all, in such case

19
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,960
I don't have much experience.

20
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,360
Don't be too sad.

21
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,230
You like He Qiaoyan.

22
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
This is a wonderful thing.

23
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,110
What a trick.

24
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:20,790
Hi.

25
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,310
Something happened.

26
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,590
Something big happened.

27
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,190
What's the matter?

28
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,960
What's up?

29
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,590
Is Xiaobao lost?

30
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,480
Is Lin Wei pregnant with your child?

31
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,880
Do Qin Yiyue and Lin Wei

32
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,590
have a fight in the street and grab each other's hair?

33
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,440
To call the police or to find the lawyer?

34
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,310
I'll arrange it right away.

35
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,560
What can I do for you?

36
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,840
Just tell me

37
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,590
and I would do anything I can to help you.

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,190
Hi, bro.

39
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,230
What's wrong with you?

40
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
Do you have something wrong with your brain?

41
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,560
Let's go. I'll take you to...

42
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,790
Sit down.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,960
What happened?

44
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,670
Dr. Qin likes me.

45
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,880
This is a great development in your relationship.

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,920
Hey, my buddy.

47
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Grab the chance.

48
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,920
What happened?

49
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,790
I said love to He Qiaoyan.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,710
Did you drink too much and vomit?

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,920
I said it word by word.

52
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,960
I said it clearly.

53
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,880
What did He Qiaoyan say?

54
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
He said nothing.

55
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,920
Nothing?

56
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,790
That's...

57
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,400
He is such an asshole.

58
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,270
That's fine.

59
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,630
Previously,

60
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,190
I had

61
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,710
some expectation on him.

62
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,110
But now I can completely give it up.

63
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,750
No, no, no, no.

64
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,080
You can't think like that.

65
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,190
Men and women

66
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,400
have different mindset.

67
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,360
So when a man is in love

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,670
his thinking is different from woman's.

69
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,670
There is no such difference.

70
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,670
I don't want to think about it.

71
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,440
He Qiaoyan

72
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,880
didn't agree to terminate the contract.

73
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,560
But now, to

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,710
keep distance from me

75
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,440
he definitely wants to

76
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
terminate the contract with me as soon as possible.

77
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
That's fine.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
This is what I put forward.

79
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,040
That's what I want.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,630
Now the situation is that she likes me

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,000
but she thinks that I don't like her.

82
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
It's too painful for her.

83
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,840
Thus

84
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,000
she wants to break up with me.

85
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,400
You

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
have said it 73 times.

87
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,670
It's really out of my expectation.

88
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,840
Qin Yiyue

89
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,960
is trying to figure out

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
whether I like her

91
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
or not.

92
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
Come on. Stop showing off.

93
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,880
I know you

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
have been confessed by someone you like.

95
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,150
You two like each other.

96
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,880
But now the key is that

97
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,480
she insists on leaving.

98
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,310
Really?

99
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,040
So I'd ask you

100
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
what are you thinking now?

101
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,190
How do you think about it?

102
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,310
For Qin Yiyue

103
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,310
the fact that you don't respond to her now

104
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,880
as well as your irresponsible attitude

105
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,080
is refusing her love.

106
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,480
If you can't

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
be serious to her love

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,590
the damage to her would be doubled.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,710
Once a girl is vulnerable

110
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,230
she would be more likely to accept those boys

111
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,110
who try to get close to her.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,230
Anyone's care for her

113
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,840
is likely to

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,790
be taken as a life-saving straw by her.

115
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,920
So the boy could take this chance.

116
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
You don't know.

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
I have a good knowledge of

118
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,310
those men around her.

119
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,480
Up to now

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,840
there is no man

121
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
who can threaten me

122
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
and be better than me.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,630
Did you remember the man, Ning Fang?

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,190
What I can give Qin Yiyue

125
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
can never be provided by Ning Fang.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,000
That's not necessarily true.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,960
I'm telling you, once the love comes

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,480
who cares about weighing

129
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560
the pros and cons.

130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,080
Besides, you shouldn't forget that

131
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,000
they share

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,520
much more memories.

133
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,560
Now, for them

134
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,190
it's the best time to nurturing their relationship.

135
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,560
Forget it.

136
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,640
Coming.

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,960
Is everything ready?

138
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,390
Yes.

139
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,470
Come on, give it to me.

140
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,309
One sec, please.

141
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,799
Hello, Xiaobao.

142
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,919
Mommy.

143
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,080
Mommy's going to the mountain villa.

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,549
See you later, ok?

145
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,760
Good boy.

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,960
Give me a kiss.

147
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,080
Ok, bye.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,640
Let's go

149
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,680
Xiaobao, what's up?

150
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,760
Mom is at the mountain villa.

151
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,880
Wait for me.

152
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,270
Xiaobao.

153
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,470
Xiaobao.

154
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,150
Pack up and get ready to go.

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,470
Brilliant.

156
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,000
It's all packed up.

157
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,920
Come here.

158
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,840
Let's go.

159
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,270
Go.

160
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,550
Hold on tight.

161
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,270
Everything must be efficient.

162
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,800
Why do you come so early?

163
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,760
In order to ensure Xiaobao's safety

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,800
and let him

165
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,110
integrate into the collective life better

166
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,390
I decide to

167
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,350
control the layout of venues by myself.

168
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,640
Make sure everything is all right.

169
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,800
It's unscientific to classify the toys this way.

170
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,230
First of all, the building blocks should be put together.

171
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,110
And then, the car toys

172
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,110
should be put together.

173
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,390
Don't underestimate

174
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,510
children's ability to learn

175
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,720
and to discriminate differences.

176
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,040
Let me do it.

177
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,680
You're hanging it backwards.

178
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,880
And you are hanging it so high

179
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,230
that even Yao Ming can't reach it.

180
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,110
Play by yourself.

181
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,800
I have something to say.

182
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,310
What do you want to say?

183
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,550
I think I should explain something

184
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,760
between us.

185
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,720
If you feel guilty

186
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,550
because

187
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,640
you refused me

188
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,000
that's not necessary.

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,110
What are you talking about?

190
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,150
Forced love does not last.

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,350
You can take a horse to the water

192
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,720
but you cannot make him drink.

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,600
This is our last cooperation

194
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,000
before the end of our contract.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,190
Just stay with Xiaobao

196
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,640
and finish this parent-child activity.

197
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,150
Do I

198
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,680
cause you some misunderstanding?

199
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,110
The word I said before

200
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,190
is just a kidding.

201
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,960
Do you think that I, Qin Yiyue

202
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,840
is that kind of girl

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,600
who would only like one person

204
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,680
forever?

205
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,550
date with different kind of men.

207
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,680
Different kind of men?

208
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,680
Look at that man.

209
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,470
The math teacher with glasses.

210
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,190
Cold and elegant. I like him.

211
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,080
And that one

212
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,680
with strong muscle.

213
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
A PE teacher.

214
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,430
He's so cool.

215
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,680
I like him.

216
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,600
That kind of man?

217
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,350
It seems that you

218
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,390
know nothing about my charm.

219
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,800
Look.

220
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,600
Hey.

221
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,080
Your muscle is excellent.

222
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,720
I am a PE teacher.

223
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,920
I come here with Xiaobao.

224
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
He is in class three, grade one.

225
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,760
You can also think that

226
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
I'm Xiaobao's sister.

227
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,600
I wonder

228
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,040
whether it's possible

229
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,350
that such a young girl is a mom.

230
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,080
Let me help you.

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,510
It's so heavy.

232
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,000
It's OK. Put it here. I'll do it.

233
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,150
You are so man.

234
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,390
Do you have a girlfriend?

235
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,920
He has no girlfriend

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,880
but he has a wife.

237
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,040
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

238
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
Well, I mean that

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,960
if he doesn't have a girlfriend

240
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,040
I'll introduce one to him.

241
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,640
Honey.

242
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,470
You are lighter than the box

243
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
and you even dare to help carry it.

244
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:20,920
Excuse me.

245
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,390
My wife

246
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:22,960
doesn't

247
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,880
do such manual work at home.

248
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,270
She is such a person

249
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,230
who thinks herself strong enough

250
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,840
and seizes those rare opportunities to

251
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,920
help others.

252
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,390
Sorry to trouble you.

253
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,550
No problem.

254
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,080
And,

255
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,640
this is our first time to participate in

256
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,840
such collective activities.

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,680
Thank you very much

258
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
for taking care of Xiaobao for us.

259
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,000
No worries.

260
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,040
Hi, everybody

261
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,080
today

262
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,680
let me invite you

263
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,190
to eat barbecue on the grass for lunch.

264
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,920
In addition

265
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,040
I'll in charge of your accommodations.

266
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
I'll order rooms for you

267
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,390
at nearby five-star hotels.

268
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,720
If you have any problem

269
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,920
please contact me.

270
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,350
Terrific.

271
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,800
What did you mean just now?

272
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,840
As long as the contract is not terminated

273
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,550
you're still Mrs. He

274
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
You are Xiaobao's Mommy.

275
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,800
You should always pay attention to

276
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,270
your public image.

277
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,680
You should keep certain distance from the other men.

278
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,720
You should self-respect

279
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,880
and self-love.

280
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,680
Sorry but I disagree with you.

281
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,430
We are both independent from each other.

282
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,880
I'm not your accessory.

283
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,390
Also

284
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,390
I'm going to the bathroom now.

285
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,000
Should I also pay attention to my public image now?

286
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,080
Excuse me.

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,270
Self-respect and self-love.

288
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,080
Self-respect and self-love.

289
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,270
Can we talk for a while?

290
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,080
Ruowei

291
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,270
I tell you that

292
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,680
He Qiaoyan is really bothering me.

293
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,000
What's up?

294
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,880
He just popped up

295
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,680
and had to be around me and made trouble for me.

296
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,510
He had such a big reaction.

297
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,880
In my opinion

298
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,390
his behavior

299
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,600
is to

300
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,310
tell others that you are his wife.

301
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,510
Men

302
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,270
are born with hunting attributes.

303
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,680
And they have a strong sense of territory.

304
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,310
You've successfully

305
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,000
aroused his sense of crisis.

306
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,470
So you don't have to

307
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,720
care about him.

308
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,840
The less you care about him, the more upset he would be.

309
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,390
Thank him.

310
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,840
Why?

311
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,270
Thanks for his demonstration.

312
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,550
It gives me a good idea.

313
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,150
Where are you going?

314
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,270
What do you want to say?

315
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,840
Can't we talk about it in front of Yiyue?

316
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,190
Sit down.

317
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,150
Two men are sitting here.

318
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't you think it's weird?

319
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,430
Do you like Qin Yiyue?

320
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,550
She's my wife.

321
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,920
I'll say it directly.

322
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,720
From the beginning

323
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,800
I know you

324
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,150
are in a fake marriage without love.

325
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,960
And I know that

326
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,310
she's going to break up with you now.

327
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
So I

328
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,680
just want to remind you that

329
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,040
after termination

330
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,840
Yiyue wants to return to

331
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,760
her own life.

332
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,800
Please respect her freedom.

333
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,040
Don't disturb her.

334
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,550
It's none of

335
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,640
your business.

336
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,880
And in addition

337
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,680
I'm not going to break up with her.

338
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,349
I can guess

339
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:11,550
your reasons for refusing to terminate the contract.

340
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,040
If you like her

341
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
just tell her.

342
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,470
If you don't like her

343
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,430
just let her go.

344
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,760
Don't

345
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,349
torment her with procrastination and indecision.

346
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,109
Why do you

347
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
say this to me?

348
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,550
I like her.

349
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,110
Then why don't you just tell her?

350
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,960
I will.

351
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,800
Sometimes if you get close to the girl too quickly

352
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,310
you may lose her.

353
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,640
Then you are too slow.

354
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,550
You haven't told her your love until now.

355
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,800
It can only indicate that time

356
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,040
has given you the answer.

357
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,430
I'm not like you.

358
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,150
I think that man should insist his principles.

359
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,350
I will never hurt her.

360
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you know her?

361
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,080
Yiyue is pure.

362
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,110
She seems always to be happy

363
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,600
and doesn't complain anything.

364
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,680
And she has tried her best

365
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,510
to be good to everyone around her.

366
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,550
When she falls down

367
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,550
she still smiles and asks for candy

368
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,430
just like a little girl.

369
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,270
She would pat the dust

370
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,920
just say it's OK and leave it behind.

371
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,190
I can see

372
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,310
her inner heart now.

373
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,430
She is painful because of you.

374
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,430
You think

375
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,310
you know her.

376
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,640
In fact, you

377
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,960
don't understand her feelings.

378
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,800
Our relationship

379
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,110
is none of your business.

380
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,880
But I'll remind you that

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,920
stop loss in time.

382
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,080
You should know who you are.

383
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,390
I am off.

384
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,110
I'm ready to go now.

385
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,680
Yang Ruowei.

386
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
We'll...

387
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,390
If you want to date with me, just tell me.

388
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
You don't need to

389
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,000
give such a clear hint.

390
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
Who says I’ll ask you out?

391
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,760
Then why are you dressed up?

392
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,640
I have an appointment with Mr. Wang of Diti Group.

393
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
That guy.

394
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,190
Why are you asking him out?

395
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,640
How did know him?

396
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
What are you talking about?

397
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,350
I'm such a brilliant single woman.

398
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,150
I don't need to ask a man out.

399
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,430
No, he's an asshole.

400
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,390
You'll get hurt.

401
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,640
Really?

402
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,800
I don't think so.

403
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,510
But what you have said

404
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,920
brings up

405
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,270
my desire to win.

406
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,000
Do you know how many girls

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
he has cheated on?

408
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,190
Many of my female friends

409
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,640
have been cheated by him.

410
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,000
They even can't complain about it.

411
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,390
What you said is to

412
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,720
criticize him

413
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,430
or show off that you have so many female friends?

414
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,350
I'll go. The taxi's here.

415
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,270
Hi

416
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,390
do you get here?

417
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,080
Yes.

418
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,110
My destination

419
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,640
is CL restaurant.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The restaurant with the English name CL.

421
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,550
The new one.

422
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,190
OK, I'll go down now.

423
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,640
Then I'll go now, Mr. Wen.

424
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,680
Bye-bye.

425
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,080
It's not true.

426
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,390
She is so deliberate.

427
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,230
She showed off in front of me

428
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,720
and got dressed up.

429
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,190
She said

430
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,680
the address of the restaurant.

431
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,080
It's obvious that

432
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,600
she wants to misguide me.

433
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,270
Whoever she wants to

434
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,800
date with.

435
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,680
I don't care.

436
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,270
Come on.

437
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,800
Wang Cheng

438
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,150
is such an asshole.

439
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
He is still using such a corny way.

440
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
Isn't this a set of valuables?

441
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,550
Trying to attract the girl I like.

442
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,510
It's impossible.

443
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,190
Calm down. It's not true.

444
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,270
No, no, no.

445
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,040
As he used to do

446
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,000
after the set of valuables

447
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,230
something bad would happen.

448
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,390
Yang Ruowei, Yang Ruowei.

449
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,040
You've missed the shot.

450
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,600
Hi, my sister.

451
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,920
What are you doing here?

452
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,310
I want to ask you something.

453
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,000
You are so manipulative now.

454
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,510
Several days ago

455
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,230
you were dating with

456
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,550
Mr. Wen.

457
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,350
Do you change your boyfriend?

458
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,040
Mr. Wang, just here.

459
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Thanks. Bye.

460
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,510
See you.

461
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,310
Mr. Wang, Mr. Wang

462
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,600
don't go in a hurry.

463
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,720
Right?

464
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,150
I didn't come at the right time.

465
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,510
You go on, you go on.

466
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,310
Weiwei

467
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,270
why don't you invite Mr. Wang

468
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,720
to have a cup of tea.

469
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,430
Shut up.

470
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:43,960
Weiwei, why are you so harsh to me?

471
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
I'm observing the man for you.

472
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:46,920
This man

473
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,510
is definitely willing to spend money for you.

474
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,190
It's much more reliable than that Wen Gu.

475
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,190
If you can be his girlfriend

476
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,920
I can also have a backing.

477
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,960
Well, I have things to do.

478
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,800
so I'm off.

479
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,230
So...

480
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,640
What happened?

481
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
What are you doing here?

482
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,390
What's the matter?

483
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,190
Yes.

484
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,960
I want to borrow some money from my sister.

485
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,680
If I have a brother-in-law

486
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,230
who can give me some money generously

487
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,960
it would be better.

488
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,150
How much do you want?

489
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,230
50,000 yuan.

490
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,430
That's enough?

491
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:35,640
Enough. That's enough.

492
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,760
Don't even think about it.

493
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,960
I'm telling you, not even five yuan.

494
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,960
Take it back.

495
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,760
Then you give this to me.

496
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,760
Empty.

497
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,470
Do you think I'm such a woman who

498
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,110
eats out with other men, receives such gifts

499
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,880
and then takes the man home?

500
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,000
This dinner is on me.

501
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,310
After all, I asked you out.

502
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,150
And I want to thank you

503
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,920
for your affection for me.

504
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
The girl paying the bill

505
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,150
is not a good thing for me.

506
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,350
So you mean that

507
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,110
I don't have a chance.

508
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,350
Thank you for your kindness

509
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
but I can't afford

510
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,390
this gift.

511
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,190
Can I borrow

512
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,080
this paper bag?

513
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,230
Are you jealous?

514
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,110
Hey, bro, your watch...

515
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,640
Don't even think about it.

516
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,150
Don't bother your sister again.

517
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,230
Leave here.

518
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,840
It's strange.

519
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
It's so late.

520
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,040
Why my aunt is here?

521
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,190
This is 5000,000 yuan.

522
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,840
This is the last time I give you money.

523
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,040
The amount of money needs to be larger.

524
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,040
He Qiaoyan

525
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,960
has found my hometown.

526
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,190
I can't get home now.

527
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,800
What do you mean?

528
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,880
Get me an apartment in the city.

529
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,150
You

530
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,840
get someone monitor me?

531
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,310
Why is he here?

532
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,270
Drive away, right now.

533
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,040
Xiaobao, look at mom.

534
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,720
Is mom beautiful now?

535
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,960
Mom's skin is white and tender.

536
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,800
Mama loves masks.

537
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,270
When Xiaobao grows up

538
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,000
Xiaobao still accompanies mom to apply the masks.

539
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,960
OK?

540
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,230
That's my boy.

541
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,150
Xiaobao

542
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,230
daddy wants to ask you a question.

543
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,800
Do you think that dad

544
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,230
is a cold and elegant man

545
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,230
or a cool and handsome man?

546
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,190
I'm sorry

547
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,880
but I think you are

548
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,270
neither elegant nor cool.

549
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,720
Okay.

550
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,230
Then I'll tie up your hair.

551
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,600
Mr. He

552
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,390
what kind of hairstyle would you like today?

553
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,760
Ox horn?

554
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,350
OK, mom will tie up two horns.

555
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
Then, the left.

556
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,080
Xiaobao

557
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,390
now looks like a girl.

558
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,550
Shake it.

559
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,510
Do you feel itchy?

560
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,960
Tickle.

561
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,080
Xiaobao.

562
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,150
Xiaobao.

563
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,000
Xiaobao is asleep.

564
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,270
Not only Xiaobao

565
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,840
can accompany you to apply the masks.

566
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,430
I also can.

567
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,350
Do you know what that means?

568
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,390
I know it now.

569
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,760
Xiaobao is asleep.

570
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,430
Then I'll go back to my room.

571
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,600
Mom, don't go.

572
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,350
Mommy, don't go.

573
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,430
Xiaobao, mom won't leave you.

574
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,080
Mom' s here.

575
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,470
After Xiaobao falls asleep

576
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,150
I'll go back to my room.

577
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,350
That's not going to work.

578
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,470
Xiaobao will wake up as soon as you leave.

579
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,640
But there's only one bed.

580
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
That's all right.

581
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,270
Xiaobao sleeps in the middle

582
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,080
you sleep there and I sleep here.

583
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,840
It's impossible.

584
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,310
I'll go back to my room.

585
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:41,310
Mom, sing a song.

586
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
Mom, sing a song.

587
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,880
Xiaobao

588
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,510
Mom will sing a song for you.

589
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,840
Why is Wen Gu here?

590
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,600
Does He Qiaoyan know everything?

591
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,920
Wen Gu saw it.

Where are you?

599
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,430
Xiaobao, Yiyue and I are

600
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,680
at the mountain villa.

601
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:41,920

We are going to take part in an

610

activity of a parent-child program.

611
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,040
Aunt.

612
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,760
Qiaonian,

00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,190
If you're out

614
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,310
and it's still early

615
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,350
come to my house.

616
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,680
I prepare

617
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,000
a birthday cake for Xiaobao.

618
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,600
A cake is prepared for Xiaobao.

619
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
There is a cake.

620
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,470
Aunt

621
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't think we can come.

622
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,230
It's raining heavily.

623
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,550
What's wrong with the brake?

624
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,080
The brake is out of order.

625
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
The rain is too heavy, isn't it?

626
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,640
Sir, stop the car please.

627
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,760
There's an accident ahead.

628
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,000
It's dangerous to stop here, Miss.

629
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,230
Save lives! Hurry up.

630
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,600
I'm a doctor, sir.

631
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,390
Go ahead and find some people to help.

632
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,000
It's urgent to save lives.

633
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,600
Hurry.

634
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,470

00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,110
It's OK. I am here.

00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,960
Now, let's invite

646
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
the performer of our No.2 family

647
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,960
to give us his performances.

648
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,080
Let's welcome the performer of No.4 family

649
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,190
to give us his performances.

650
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,040
Great, Xiaobao.

651
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,600
Let's go, Xiaobao.

652
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:01,880
Well.

653
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,880
All families

654
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,150
have given their performances.

655
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,510
What a beautiful song.

656
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,080
Qiaoyan

657
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:11,600
I happened to

658
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,110
talk to the investor

659
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,760
at the nearby golf course.

660
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,150
It doesn't matter. You go first.

661
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,720
Let's go.

662
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,350
Come by the way?

663
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,310
I think you do it on purpose.

664
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,470
Let's go.

665
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,040
OK, I admit it.

666
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,800
You said last time that

667
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,270
you were not interested in our alliance through marriage.

668
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,880
I think

669
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,510
it's not true.

670
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,720
You are just worried about Xiaobao.

671
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,040
To reassure you

672
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,430
and for our cooperation

673
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,150
I'll prove it to you that

674
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,390
I can

675
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,430
get along well with Xiaobao too.

676
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,110
I advise you not to waste your time.

677
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,390
Marriage is impossible.

678
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,920
Xiaobao is sweating so much.

679
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,000
I am sure that you have a good time.

680
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,110
Xiaobao,

681
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,230
it's too difficult to catch a fish for me.

682
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,310
Mom can do anything

683
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,270
except swimming.

684
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,720
I'm good at catching fishes.

685
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,470
I can help Xiaobao to complete the task.

686
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:23,190
Xiaobao, you trust me for once.

687
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,840
Ok?

688
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:25,350
Auntie.

689
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,720
Call her sister.

690
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,040
Catch fishes, auntie.

691
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,640
Ok, then.

692
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,040
I'll take you to catch fishes.

693
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,230
We can catch the whole pond of fishes.

694
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:39,840
Let's go.

695
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,110
Let's go.

696
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Here.

697
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,510
Xiaobao, do you like Qin Yiyue,

698
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,470
auntie Qin Yiyue?

699
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,000
Mom.

700
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,800
But she's not your real mother.

701
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,880
All right, I'm going to catch a fish.

702
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
Don't use it.

703
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,270
What should I use?

704
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,230
Your hands.

705
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,430
You don't let me use tools but

706
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,760
ask me to use my hands.

707
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,640
Alright.

708
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,800
I didn't wear a watch.

709
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,350
How long have they gone?

710
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,640
About twenty minutes.

711
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,840
I didn't catch a fish.

712
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,110
Why don't they come back yet?

713
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm still a little worried.

714
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:41,390
Xiaobao always

715
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,510
refuse to get along with those unfamiliar

716
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,550
alone.

717
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,150
Why this time

718
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,800
he agrees so quickly

719
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,880
to catch fishes with Lin Wei.

720
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,350
To be honest, I'm a little worried, too.

721
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,760
Let's go and find them.

722
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,840
Ok.

723
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
They are there.

724
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,600
Go and have a look.

725
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,680
Are you injured?

726
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,190
Are you ok?

727
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,680
My feet seem to be hurting.

728
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,350
Maybe it's a sprain.

729
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:27,190
Don't you have tools?

730
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,110
Why do you go into the water?

731
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,230
Xiaobao, he...

732
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,190
Come on, put it on.

733
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,880
I thought it was easy.

734
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,230
He Weifei

735
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,150
how can you do such a thing.

736
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,270
As a man

737
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,470
you shouldn't do this to girls.

738
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
Don't criticize him.

739
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,800
Come up.

740
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,430
It's urgent to go to the camp and find the medical staff.

741
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,640
I'll talk to you later.

742
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,110
Wrap it tight.

743
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,080
It's not serious.

744
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,920
The doctor said it was just a sprain just now.

745
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,840
No big deal.

746
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,550
I didn't expect that

747
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:03,230
Xiaobao should

748
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,150
try to embarrass you.

749
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,920
I apologize for him.

750
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,720
It doesn't matter.

751
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,390
It's just a kid's prank.

752
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,640
I won't take it to heart.

753
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,960
And I won't

754
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,190
give up so easily.

755
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,040
But I do hope that

756
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,550
you stop deliberately

757
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,390
getting close to Xiaobao.

758
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:18,680
I don't want him to be unhappy.

759
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,720
Besides, leave Heshi Group.

760
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,150
I don't think we should

761
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,190
go on working together.

762
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,880
He Qiaoyan.

763
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,310
He Qiaoyan.

764
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
It's too much.

765
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,190
He Weifei.

766
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,760
No one asks you to face the wall and reflect your behavior.

767
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,760
No need to play pathetic.

768
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,600
Xiaobao, where's your mommy?

769
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,040
Catching fishes.

770
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,270
Catching fishes?

771
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,550
I tell you

772
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,600
don't come here.

773
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,190
I've learned to kill snakes.

774
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,760
I know where your tender spot is.

775
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,600
I'll hit you even harder.

776
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,190
Don't come here.

777
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,230
Hey, buddy.

778
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,840
Buddy.

779
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,230
Buddy.

780
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,510
I'm just kidding.

781
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,920
You are the king of the mountains.

782
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,110
How dare I hit you, don't I?

783
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,270
Listen to me.

784
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,640
Life is like a play.

785
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
It's hard for us to meet.

786
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,550
Don't lose your temper over trifles.

787
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,640
It doesn't worth.

788
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,760
Two snakes.

789
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,080
Is she alone?

790
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,040
No trick, right?

791
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,920
Xiaobao, go back to your room and wait for me.

792
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm going to find your mommy.

793
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,150
Qin Yiyue.

794
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,760
Qin Yiyue.

795
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,350
Qin Yiyue. Qin Yiyue.
