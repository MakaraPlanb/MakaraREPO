Unforgettable Love
EP04

2
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,920
I've said it five or six times.

3
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,920
I'm almost a repeater.

4
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,840
Since you put on the big diamond ring,

5
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,750
you've changed.

6
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,000
You are beginning to take bubble bath and apply mask.

7
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,440
So elegant!

8
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,110
If the news that you're going to get married

9
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,789
gets around,

10
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:38,670
what would you do?

11
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,270
I'm just playing along with him.

12
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,310
He stirred up the trouble by himself,

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,479
so he should solve the problem by himself.

14
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,590
Now I just want Dr. Qin

15
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,190
to stop

16
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,440
rejecting my proposal.

17
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,039
Propose?

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,840
What's going on?

19
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,560
Why did he propose to Qin Yiyue?

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,110
It's impossible

21
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,000
Why is that?

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,360
What are you doing?

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm now teaching you

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,630
how to make your ex eat a humble pie.

25
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,440
That's when your ex-boyfriend's

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,670
current girlfriend provokes you,

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,670
take a better new boyfriend

28
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,920
in front of him

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,480
If you agree,

30
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,790
I'd like to be your

31
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,400
better new boyfriend.

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,150
Then thank you, Mr. He,

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,110
for saving the day!

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,270
You make a wise choice.

35
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,079
By the way,

36
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,440
this new building,

37
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,840
no, Yiyue Guan,

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,710
just as

39
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,840
a gift

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,710
witnessing our love

41
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,400
is given to you.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,840
What a rich man!

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,040
You go too far.

44
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,310
I hadn't thought of a name for the building.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,110
This is the right moment.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,630
I'll return this ring

47
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,360
to him tomorrow.

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,440
Then we don't owe each other anything.

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,080
It's bedtime.

50
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
Give the tablet computer to me.

51
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,400
You filmed it.

52
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,840
Have a sleep now.

53
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,000
I didn't expect this man

54
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,400
who looks like

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,110
he is the only one,

56
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,310
he is quite a gentleman at the critical moment.

57
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,750
Take your bath.

58
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,440
Let me try

59
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,269
the new toilet deodorant.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,959
It works very well.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,150
No, no, no, no.

62
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,000
By the way,

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,880
when you take a bath,

64
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,670
remember to take off

65
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,560
your big diamond ring.

66
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,630
You're so careless.

67
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,960
I'm afraid you'll lose it.

68
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,110
Why didn't you say that earlier?

69
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,360
How much do you think this big diamond ring is?

70
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,150
I estimate it to be at least ten carats.

71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll Baidu it.

72
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,000
That doesn't seem right.

73
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,880
You just said that

74
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,670
how many carats is that ring?

75
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,630
I estimate it to be at least ten carats.

76
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,960
Ten carats?

77
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,080
It must be worth more than hundred thousand yuan.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,150
That is only enough to

79
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,920
buy a ring without diamond.

80
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,080
Even if you sell me,

81
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,630
I can't afford to pay.

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,000
What can we do about it?

83
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,670
Did you find the ring?

84
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,440
Nothing found.

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,790
Come on.

86
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,270
Take a look at your cell phone.

87
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,790
You're on the hot search again.

88
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,440
There are more than three million comments.

89
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,670
Not only Weibo,

90
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,480
all the major social media platforms

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,630
are discussing you.

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,790
Saying that in your past life,

93
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,080
you must have done a lot of good things.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,040
We can make a new post

95
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,710
to talk about

96
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,360
the experience of

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,230
living with

98
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,190
an internet celebrity roommate.

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,230
I'm so upset.

100
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,400
You go back.

101
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,040
Qin Yiyue, how can you do this?

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Marriage is such a big thing.

103
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,880
You didn't even tell me, your primary school classmate.

104
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,590
Congratulations.

105
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,310
As your aunt, I'm just calling

106
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,750
to congratulate you.

107
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,190
My daughter, Mengmeng, is not as capable as you.

108
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,310
Would you mind to

109
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,630
introduce her to a good boyfriend?

110
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,310
Dear,

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I am now transformed

112
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,750
to be online beauty blogger.

113
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,040
Could you give me

114
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
some new products of your husband's company

115
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,790
for trial?

116
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,630
Do you want to buy a house?

117
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,880
Contact me.

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
Do you have insurance?

119
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,230
Contact my husband.

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,310
Who is it?

121
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,040
What's wrong with being so loud?

122
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,960
Hi.

123
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,190
Miss Qin, where's your ring?

124
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,670
Ring.

125
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,590
Ring.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,840
Can't you lose it?

127
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.

128
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,040
That's precious.

129
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,000
By bank transfer or by check?

130
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Can I write you an IOU?

131
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
Where are you taking me?

132
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,840
Hello, I'm Qin Yiyue.

133
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,670
It's not Mrs. He.

134
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm a doctor.

135
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,920
I'm not the stepmother.

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,670
I don't accept interviews.

137
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,400
I don't take ads.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,040
I don't go on the red carpet.

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,670
I don't cut the ribbon.

140
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,670
I don't introduce connections.

141
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,790
I don't name children.

142
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,440
Hello, thank you.

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,230
Hello, goodbye.

144
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,920
This is Mr. He.

145
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,790
I don't care if you are or not Mr. He.

146
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,310
He.

147
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,080
He Qiaoyan?

148
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,040
I just let you know that

149
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,520
I've made an appointment for Xiaobao

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,920
and will go over for a follow-up consultation later.

151
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
In addition, Xiaobao's treatment

152
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,360
has shown remarkable results.

153
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,400
You did well last night.

154
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,150
There is a project award.

155
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,670
What kind of project award?

156
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,400
Project award?

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,080
The first indemnity fund for ring.

158
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,150
When did you and Doctor Qin

159
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,560
become like this?

160
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,400
It's not too late to know now.

161
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,520
Go too far.

162
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,670
Even bet on

163
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:53,520
your marriage.

164
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,110
For me,

165
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,110
getting married is just

166
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,000
adding an extra name to the spouse column.

167
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,590
No matter Qin Yiyue,

168
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,790
Zhang Yiyue, Sun Yiyue.

169
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,230
It will not affect the overall situation.

170
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,270
I don't care.

171
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,790
Or you have another picture in mind

172
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,230
All for Xiaobao.

173
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:10,790
What are you going to do next?

174
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
The engagement banquet and wedding ceremony

175
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,630
will be organized

176
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,440
by the most professional and efficient team.

177
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,750
If there's no accident,

178
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,040
within a month,

179
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,590
these processes will all be completed.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,750
Wait.

181
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,920
Are you serious?

182
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,150
Besides,

183
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,800
I will give her a big present first.

184
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,549
Don't go away.

185
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,429
Take a look.

186
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,230
My God.

187
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,190
My God.

188
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Mr. He is so exaggerating.

189
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,080
Luxury houses, sports cars

190
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,230
and other bride price are too low-level.

191
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
This is to show your love in public.

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,960
Not at all.

193
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,680
It's so embarrassing.

194
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,600
If showing love would kill me,

195
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,550
I'd like to die right now.

196
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,230
God forbid.

197
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,640
Don't curse yourself like that.

198
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,680
This is clearly

199
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,110
the building he donated to the hospital.

200
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,550
He merely

201
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,000
gave me a plaque.

202
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
This is not a reward at all.

203
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,880
He clearly wants to make a fool of me.

204
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,600
Look over there, sister.

205
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
What "If you're doing well, I'm doing well."

206
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,390
After breaking up,

207
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,600
it has nothing to do with each other.

208
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,920
Isn't it, sister?

209
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,510
Let's go.

210
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Hi, President He.

211
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,080
Hello.

212
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,510
Let me introduce myself.

213
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,270
I'm the only friend of He Qiaoyan.

214
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,230
I'm Wen Gu.

215
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,960
Do you like this award?

216
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,960
Xiaobao.

217
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,680
You first go with Sister Xiao'an

218
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
and Uncle Wen to play.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,350
I'll talk to your dad,

220
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,920
okay?

221
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,960
Let's go.

222
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,000
Go.

223
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
Hurry up.

224
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,720
President He.

225
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,150
Now the Internet is circulating

226
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,550
the fake news of our marriage.

227
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,150
You still do this.

228
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,920
Who said it is fake news?

229
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,680
Eh.

230
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,390
No one else knows.

231
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,800
We know that

232
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,000
the proposal is false.

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,640
Kissing is fake, isn't it?

234
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,150
Kissing is fake.

235
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,510
But the proposal is true.

236
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,470
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,680
We've only known each other for a few days.

238
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,960
Why do you propose to me?

239
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,430
I mean it.

240
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,110
Or are you afraid?

241
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,960
You're afraid that after getting along with me day and night,

242
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,000
you will fall in love with me.

243
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,230
I fall in love with you?

244
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,350
I'm Qin Yiyue.

245
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,720
I'll never fall in love with you.

246
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,390
Then, Let's have a try.

247
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,270
You're crazy.

248
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,350
Qin Yiyue.

249
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,510
Now everyone in Qincheng

250
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,150
knows that

251
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,800
I am your fiance.

252
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Can you stop

253
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
saying this?

254
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,150
It's a pity to lose

255
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,150
Mr. Right of Qincheng girls.

256
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Be careful.

257
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
It's a pity that

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,760
you are not my Mr. Right.

259
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,550
You are not my Miss Right either.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,230
I am a businessman.

261
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,270
Xiaobao is my only

262
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,640
and most important client.

263
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,640
What does he want

264
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,110
I'll do whatever it takes

265
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,800
to give him.

266
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,000
Dr. Qin.

267
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,800
I'll get you to agree.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,840
What's wrong with you?

269
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
Hello, is my milk tea ready?

270
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,310
Right away.

271
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,230
Hello, lady.

272
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,000
Only you?

273
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,550
Can't you see that

274
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,960
I am alone?

275
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,600
Thank you.

276
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,720
Thank you for coming. Take care.

277
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,110
Here comes the drink.

278
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,190
Xiaobao is also here.

279
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,350
Dr. Qin is really ambitious.

280
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,760
For the patient,

281
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,230
she has become a stepmother.

282
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,080
This kind of doctor-patient relationship

283
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,510
is really worth learning.

284
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Dr. Qin never has any additional ideas.

285
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,550
It's a pity that

286
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,680
you have such a good-looking face,

287
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,510
but you're ugly inside.

288
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:53,880
You're right.

289
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,600
She is the evil queen

290
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
of the cartoon.

291
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,800
She's the bad guy

292
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,080
who fed your mommy the poisoned apple.

293
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,600
How can you help your mother as a little kid?

294
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,840
Xiaobao.

295
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,680
If you need anything, just tell me.

296
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,510
I'll do it for you.

297
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,510
Xiaobao, you are so great.

298
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,550
You can even think of this.

299
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, what?

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,040
What?

301
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
How can I didn't understand anything?

302
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,680
You are not competent enough.

303
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
You and we

304
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
have a little generation gap.

305
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,350
What's this called?

306
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,390
It's called stream of consciousness.

307
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Let's go.

308
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,470
Stop!

309
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,680
It's filthy.

310
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,960
How to wash this?

311
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,680
Can't you take water by yourself?

312
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,310
If you want to drink water.

313
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,110
Where's the ring?

314
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
The ring

315
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,430
is at home.

316
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,600
Drink it.

317
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,840
Such a valuable thing.

318
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm afraid I'll lose it.

319
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,470
It's better.

320
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,800
The 15-carat diamond ring

321
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,230
is the only heirloom of our He family.

322
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,000
It is handmade by the designers

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,190
and craftsmen of the Swedish Royal Family.

324
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,310
It's quite expensive.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's really not suitable for everyday wear.

326
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Why haven't Xiaobao and Xiao'an

327
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,720
come yet?

328
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
I'll take a look.

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,310
Just make a phone call.

330
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,390
Hello, Xiao'an.

331
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,550
We're in the clinic.

332
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,550
Where are you?

333
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,960
We.

334
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,840
We're in the bathroom

335
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,550
Zhou Xiao'an, where are you?

336
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,720
Is there any trouble?

337
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,000
We are in the ward area on the sixth floor.

338
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,080
This is very ridiculous.

339
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,430
He's just a kid.

340
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,350
Where are our clothes?

341
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,720
Who took our clothes away?

342
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,230
If someone comes later,

343
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:47,960
what should we do?

344
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,470
Do something.

345
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,230
I dress like this

346
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,230
is not suitable to go out.

347
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,640
What if I go out and get seen by my colleagues?

348
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,640
Don't you hate

349
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,080
being called "Phoenix man"?

350
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,350
So you should protect me

351
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,470
like a man.

352
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,880
Ziyang.

353
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,390
Don't get me wrong.

354
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,720
We're just taking a bath.

355
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,390
So

356
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,430
you must not think too much.

357
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,510
I'll leave you two alone.

358
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,190
Qin Yiyue.

359
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,600
These are all designed by you,

360
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,510
right?

361
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,640
Don't jump to conclusions

362
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
until things are clear.

363
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,040
By the way, I'll tell you

364
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,000
don't target Dr. Qin everywhere.

365
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,150
Let's go.

366
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,470
What's the matter?

367
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
Did something interesting happen?

368
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,350
Let me see.

369
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,880
Where's Xiaobao?

370
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,390
Did you teach him that again?

371
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,960
How dare I.

372
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,600
It is Xiaobao who taught me to do it.

373
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,390
Sister,

374
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,310
Are you angry?

375
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,270
Anyway,

376
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,640
Zhou Ziyang and Ye Qing

377
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,510
won't let me go.

378
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,390
It's OK for me to take another misplaced blame.

379
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:09,880
Ruowei,

380
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,080
How are you doing?

381
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,150
Did you find the ring?

382
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,270
You hurry up and pack up

383
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,550
all your valuable things

384
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,510
and sell them all.

385
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,839
Why do I have

386
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,640
so little money?

387
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm done.

388
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,510
There are people

389
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,599
taking pictures of Sister Qin wherever we go.

390
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,960
Because sister Qin took away

391
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,110
the girls' dream lover of the whole city?

392
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,680
Qin Yiyue, you are famous overnight.

393
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,350
Ladies, is this convenient for your photographing?

394
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
Your cell phone.

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,840
And yours.

396
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,640
Don't go, you guys.

397
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,310
Keep shooting.

398
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,110
The temperature is high recently.

399
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,190
You sweat too much.

400
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,390
The loss of water

401
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,310
will increase

402
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,150
the viscosity of your blood.

403
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,510
That's why

404
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,720
you've become so grumpy.

405
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,390
Drink this glass of water.

406
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,430
You think

407
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,000
you're helping Dr. Qin.

408
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,390
But have you

409
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,680
put yourself in her shoes

410
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,190
and position

411
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,470
to think about this thing?

412
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,310
How do you protect her?

413
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,350
You still have to rely on me

414
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,880
to clean up your mess.

415
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,230
I gave you a spare key

416
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,080
is not for you to just

417
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,350
go in and out of my house.

418
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,190
Go back to your room.

419
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,190
Think about it.

420
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,080
What's wrong with you again?

421
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,880
Your high-profile marriage

422
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
made my father very stimulated.

423
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,640
In addition to doing everything possible

424
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,600
to force me to go on a blind date,

425
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,960
he also interfered

426
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,190
with my work.

427
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,110
Pei Jin.

428
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,150
I've finished the contract for the planning department,

429
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
you can take it to the reception.

430
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,000
Make me a cup of tea by the way.

431
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,000
Why didn't you answer my phone last night?

432
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,040
Who are you?

433
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,760
Where's Pei Jin?

434
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,510
I'm Wang Beijing.

435
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,270
The chairman said

436
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:21,920
from now on

437
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,150
I'll be your secretary.

438
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,510
It is not only Wang Beijing

439
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,600
who replaced Pei Jin.

440
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,390
And Li Sha replaced Lisa.

441
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,800
Su Daqiang replaced Su Qiang.

442
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,960
Wang Miao replaced Wang Miaomiao.

443
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,270
All the female employees around me

444
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,680
have been replaced by men.

445
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,720
My dad also gave notice

446
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,550
that all future employees

447
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,600
can only be hired with his approval.

448
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,920
And he made it clear that

449
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,720
he would never

450
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,470
let me have any female employees again.

451
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,390
What does that mean?

452
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,640
This means that

453
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
the next woman I hold

454
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,510
can only be my wife.

455
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,600
Only you?

456
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,430
Another scum.

457
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,350
You're not supposed

458
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,510
to be here.

459
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,390
what are you laughing at?

460
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,310
Am I wrong?

461
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,190
I'll teach you a lesson tonight.

462
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,150
I think you are so cute.

463
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,190
Therefore,

464
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,350
I decide to make an exception

465
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,350
and give you a privilege.

466
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,390
Why is this bar

467
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,190
so tasteless?

468
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Is it because of the song

469
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,390
or the wine

470
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,550
or the decoration?

471
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,310
Now I see.

472
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,800
It's because of the boss.

473
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,430
You.

474
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:53,880
How about

475
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,390
going to my booth

476
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,600
for a while?

477
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,430
Dear,

478
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
your booth are full.

479
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:06,800
Don't go away.

480
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,190
I haven't got your WeChat yet.

481
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm blind to marry you.

482
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,550
Lady,

483
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,470
can I buy you a drink?

484
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
What a coincidence.

485
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,150
Yeah, it's a coincidence.

486
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:23,960
Get out of my way.

487
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,150
Let me teach you.

488
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,760
It's not that easy

489
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,760
for you to get a kiss from me.

490
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,040
I.

491
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,640
Can I buy you a drink?

492
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,150
A glass of wine is only a warm-up.

493
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,000
My special cocktail

494
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,470
is very strong.

495
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,960
You'll get drunk on one drink.

496
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,310
My God.

497
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,040
You drink

498
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,800
like a fish.

499
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,430
You can't do it.

500
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,550
Hello.

501
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,390
Come on.

502
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,430
Hello.

503
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,720
Please send him

504
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,680
to the nearest hotel.

505
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,040
Aren't you coming along?

506
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,470
I can't do it alone.

507
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,470
I'm also responsible for the aftermath.

508
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,150
What does she take me for?

509
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,600
She's gone too far.

510
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,550
Should I call mom and dad and tell them?

511
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,110
After telling them,

512
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,550
they will be very angry.

513
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,310
I can buy lottery tickets.

514
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,550
How dare I buy a lottery ticket?

515
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,190
Since I was a kid,

516
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,510
I've only won a bottle of Coke.

517
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,190
How dare I buy a lottery ticket?

518
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,470
Why am I so unlucky?

519
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
My God.

520
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,080
How can you climb so high?

521
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,720
I still owe him a huge amount of money,

522
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,720
so I can't break his bracelet.

523
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,430
Sorry.

524
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,000
The subscriber you dialed

525
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,510
cannot be connected for the moment,

526
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,800
please redial later.

527
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,640
Sorry.

528
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,510
Sorry.

529
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,190
The subscriber you dialed.

530
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,470
I have to go there.

531
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,470
Baby,

532
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,680
listen to me.

533
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm sure

534
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,080
I won't let your mother get into trouble.

535
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,760
Only when you are safe at home

536
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
can I help your mother.

537
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,150
Good to listen.

538
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,840
Brother Ning Fang,

539
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,550
how come it's you?

540
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,800
I've helped you once again.

541
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,470
Didn't you go abroad?

542
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,640
Why are you suddenly back?

543
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,000
You didn't even tell me.

544
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,310
I just came back.

545
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,640
However,

546
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
are you a little fatter

547
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,110
than when you were in college?

548
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,080
I didn't

549
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,270
get fat.

550
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,470
I'm just kidding.

551
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,350
Is this yours?

552
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,270
How did it fall down?

553
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,550
Luckily it's not broken.

554
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,510
It just ran out of power.

555
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,680
Thank you.

556
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,150
Is this your cat?

557
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,800
It's not mine.

558
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,390
I saved it from the tree.

559
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,150
I don't know if it was hurt.

560
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,720
My studio is nearby.

561
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,150
Why don't we take it to check?

562
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,310
Great.

563
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,880
Let's go.

564
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,040
Qin Yiyue.

565
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,510
Qin Yiyue.

566
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,080
Validation failed.

567
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,190
Input error.

568
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,270
Locked.

569
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,110
Why did she change her password?

570
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,960
Here we are.

571
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,680
It's beautiful.

572
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,880
Hello, Doctor Ning.

573
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,550
Hello.

574
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,960
This is my new psychological clinic.

575
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,110
Let's go to my office.

576
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,920
Okay.

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,920
Come in, please.

578
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,880
Are these all your cats?

579
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,040
Yeah.

580
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,040
You still like cats so much

581
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,550
as before.

582
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,640
I still remember when we were in college

583
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,350
you specially placed a dozen huts

584
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,040
for the school's stray cats,

585
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,760
and then fed them water and food at regular intervals.

586
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,880
I am very happy as a cat person.

587
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,800
The money I earn from this clinic

588
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,390
is used to rescue stray animals.

589
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,550
I take care of

590
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,760
all the stray cats around here.

591
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,040
Come, let me see you.

592
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,190
Don't be afraid.

593
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,550
Let me check it for you.

594
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,430
It's okay.

595
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,880
it's just a little malnourished.

596
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,110
It seems that

597
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,390
you have rescued a lot of stray animals.

598
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,110
You are

599
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,000
so professional.

600
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,150
Do you want to raise it?

601
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,680
Of course I do.

602
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,000
But it's too small.

603
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm afraid I can't take care of it.

604
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,150
Or

605
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,350
I just leave it with you.

606
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,430
It's enough for me

607
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,680
to look at it every day when I get off work.

608
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,110
Yes, of course.

609
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,150
Go inside.

610
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,550
You come to my place

611
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,040
without informing me.

612
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,310
You are too polite, right?

613
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,640
In fact,

614
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,720
the first thing I want to do after I return to China

615
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
is to see you.

616
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,800
I heard about you and Ziyang.

617
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,430
It's all over.

618
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,720
Qin Yiyue

619
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,000
is always out of touch.

620
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,190
The cost of communication is too high.

621
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,150
After joining the company,

622
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,510
this will definitely be a major hidden problem.

623
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,840
It can't be like this.

624
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,680
In the formal cooperation contract,

625
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,550
the relevant binding terms

626
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,080
must be added.

627
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,470
So you're being subjected

628
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,600
to cyber violence.

629
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,510
It's not really

630
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,840
cyber violence.

631
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,600
There are just some internet trolls

632
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,080
who have nothing better to do

633
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,040
but go to verbal attacks on others.

634
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,880
You know

635
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,680
when I see myself

636
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,550
on the hot search,

637
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,390
I'm really bummed out.

638
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:08,470
This is simply very irritating.

639
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,680
How unlucky

640
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,600
do you think I am.

641
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,720
First it was Zhou Ziyang,

642
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,840
and later it was He Qiaoyan.

643
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,230
You say

644
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,800
why I am surrounded by oddballs?

645
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,720
I think you should

646
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,510
talk to He Qiaoyan

647
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,960
about your situation.

648
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,680
I can't make it clear to him.

649
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,510
He is a conceited and

650
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,040
presumptuous eccentric.

651
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,800
I couldn't talk to him.

652
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,510
She even spoke ill of her fiance

653
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,680
to other men.

654
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,310
Or I'll help you make it clear to him.

655
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,550
President He.

656
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:53,230
What are you doing here?

657
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,350
Where is the bracelet?

658
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,470
It's here.

659
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,150
It needs to be worn all the time

660
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,720
for sample testing.

661
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,880
The wearer

662
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,110
must be serious, professional

663
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,190
and responsible.

664
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,350
Why do I must wear it when you tell me to?

665
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,270
Do you have anything else to do?

666
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,680
If nothing else, you can leave now.

667
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,840
Who is this?

668
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
This is my...

669
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,080
Why should I tell you?

670
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,110
You are Mr. He.

671
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,510
Hello, my name is Ning Fang.

672
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,390
I am Yiyue's senior brother.

673
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:31,840
Hello.

674
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,920
Thank you for bringing my fiancee back.

675
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,000
Pay attention to your image.

676
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,080
You're Xiaobao's mom.

677
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,680
You can't get too close

678
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,510
to other people.

679
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,350
I told you

680
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,040
I will not marry you.

681
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,680
Pay attention to your own image.

682
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,960
I won't say it again.

683
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,920
Oh, you.

684
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,040
You see.

685
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,430
He is such a conceited and

686
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,270
presumptuous eccentric.

687
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,110
You can't get too close

688
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,310
to other people.

689
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,720
Why is the heart suddenly tight?

690
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,310
It must be because

691
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,470
the change in adrenaline

692
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,960
caused a disruption of my cardiac sympathetic nerves

693
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,270
and cardiac vagus nerves.

694
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,270
That's why the heart suffers from

695
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,310
temporary hypoxic pain.

696
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,350
That's right.

697
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,920
It will be fine

698
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,000
after some rest.

699
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
You know

700
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,000
when I see myself

701
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,270
on the hot search,

702
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm really bummed out.

703
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,920
This is simply very irritating.

704
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,680
President He.

705
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,640
You asked me to look up

706
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,720
articles about Dr. Qin on the Internet.

707
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,000
I've already found out.

708
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:00,920
What's the result?

709
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,920
On the whole,

710
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,390
all are

711
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,430
less friendly articles.

712
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,880
Some say Dr. Qin

713
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,390
went to great lengths to seduce you.

714
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,600
Some say Dr. Qin is ugly.

715
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,510
Even.

716
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,920
Continue.

717
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,310
It is even said that Dr. Qin

718
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,080
relied on you

719
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,550
to become a doctor at Yade Hospital.

720
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,720
Notify the public relations department,

721
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,680
so that they can report to the relevant departments

722
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
in the name of me, the person concerned.

723
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,470
Notify Legal Department

724
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,390
to prepare for litigation.

725
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,470
Yes, I'll do it right away.

726
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
She is not outstanding

727
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,640
but married to He Qiaoyan.

728
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,800
Why remove it

729
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,800
just after it was installed?

730
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,470
I don't know.

731
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,840
Good news.

732
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,640
Why is it removed?

733
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
It's better to removed it.

734
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
It's a lot easier for me.

735
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:05,390
What's the good news?

736
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,230
Those articles that spread rumors about you on the Internet

737
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,840
disappeared overnight.

738
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,000
You see.

739
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,800
Does that woman

740
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,760
really rely on the man to get the job?

741
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,110
Now the plaque is removed.

742
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,080
I guess

743
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,150
she is found to be what she really was.

744
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,720
My wife graduated from

745
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,350
the best medical school in the country.

746
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,080
While in university,

747
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,040
she earned a full scholarship

748
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
and a dual bachelor's degree.

749
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,310
She has won national awards

750
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,150
for her research on three topics.

751
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,680
Two of her papers published in international journals.

752
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,310
She is the youngest attending physician

753
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,110
in the hospital.

754
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,270
She ranks first for three years

755
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,040
in the number of patients she has treated.

756
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,600
She has achieved zero errors and zero absences.

757
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,270
In addition, my wife

758
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,150
is called that woman.

759
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,800
She has a name,

760
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,270
Qin Yiyue.

761
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,000
From this point of view,

762
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,150
it is not that she depends on me,

763
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,640
but that I am fortunate enough to be able to depend on her.

764
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,840
He is the best among all the CEOs in the novels.

765
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,760
So you also deal with

766
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,230
the articles on the Internet.

767
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,230
It was

768
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,840
my wrong way of dealing with it

769
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,080
that brought you such troubles.

770
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,429
I formally apologize to you.

771
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,600
You apologize to me?

772
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,760
You're

773
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,719
the first one

774
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,110
to make me apologize.

775
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,270
You should be proud.

776
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,469
Isn't it normal to apologize

777
00:34:28,469 --> 00:34:30,150
for doing something wrong?

778
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,920
I see, Mr. He.

779
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,510
You finally realize that

780
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,960
it's impossible

781
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,550
to marry me.

782
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,310
You finally get it.

783
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,310
Well,

784
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,350
I'll give you a bow.

785
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,880
Thank you.

786
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,760
You're mistaken.

787
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,960
I don't give up

788
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,190
my determination to marry you.

789
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:49,960
Why don't you

790
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,719
make sense?

791
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,080
What is your reason

792
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,040
for refusing to

793
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,840
marry me?

794
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,840
Nonsense.

795
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,190
We have to be cautious

796
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,000
for marriage.

797
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,110
At least have a dating before getting married.

798
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,429
So you want to

799
00:35:03,429 --> 00:35:04,679
have a date with me first.

800
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,310
Of course not.

801
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,390
I mean

802
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,350
We don't know each other very well.

803
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:08,840
We are

804
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,230
supposed to keep distance.

805
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,840
But you have been

806
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,600
in a serious relationship with Zhou Ziyang for several years,

807
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,390
Have you got any result?

808
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,150
You are still not married.

809
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
It's none of your business.

810
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,800
While in university,

811
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,190
she earned a full scholarship

812
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,310
and a dual bachelor's degree.

813
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,310
She has won national awards

814
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,430
for her research on three topics.

815
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,470
Two of her papers published in international journals.

816
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,760
In addition, she is the youngest attending physician

817
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,600
in the hospital.

818
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,000
She ranks first for three years

819
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,760
in the number of patients she has treated.

820
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,510
She has achieved zero errors and zero absences.

821
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,040
In addition,

822
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,190
my wife

823
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,190
is not called that woman.

824
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,640
She has a name,

825
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,080
Qin Yiyue.

826
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,110
From this point of view,

827
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,310
it is not that she depends on me,

828
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,960
but that I am fortunate enough to be able to depend on her.

829
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,800
blah, blah, blah.

830
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,080
He's a good talker.

831
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,350
Why do I think of him?

832
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,040
Look for the ring.

833
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,390
I'm coming.

834
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,430
Mom, dad.

835
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,640
Why are you here?

836
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,600
Pretty good.

837
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,680
Look at these

838
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,190
messy socks.

839
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,270
You leave things everywhere.

840
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,920
Do you have a lot of money?

841
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,600
You can't put plants in the bedroom.

842
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,640
It can absorb oxygen.

843
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,880
It's a succulent.

844
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,150
Succulent?

845
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,040
Why don't you wear socks?

846
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,080
How many times have I told you

847
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,510
that girls' feet can't be cold.

848
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,760
It can't be cold.

849
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,230
Why let me say it again?

850
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,430
Look at the hair all over the floor.

851
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,840
You stayed up late again, right?

852
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,550
Are you playing games on your phone?

853
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,550
You deserve your hairline.

854
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,390
Look how high your hairline is.

855
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,040
Your hairline is here.

856
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,310
You're like the people of the Qing Dynasty.

857
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,920
I inherited you.

858
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,190
You inherited me?

859
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,550
Why don't you inherit something good?

860
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,080
By the way, what's on the bed?

861
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,270
Eating snacks in bed again, right?

862
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,150
You haven't changed since you were a kid.

863
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,270
All right.

864
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,840
We're here to see our daughter.

865
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,880
You've become

866
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,350
an inspector.

867
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,080
Exactly.

868
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,510
It's still my dad.

869
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:44,880
daddy,

870
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,270
You've come

871
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,230
a long way.

872
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,000
Are you hungry?

873
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,000
How about I

874
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,640
make noodles for you?

875
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,680
Come on.

876
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Don't go anywhere.

877
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,550
If we don't come,

878
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,510
even when your baby is born,

879
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,510
we still know nothing.

880
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,270
Yes.

881
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,600
Call that man for me.

882
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,190
which man?

883
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,310
Zhou Ziyang.

884
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,640
Why do you mention Zhou Ziyang now?

885
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,470
It should be He Qiao...

886
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,550
He Qiaofu.

887
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,920
It's not He Qiaofu.

888
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,470
He Qiaochen.

889
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,920
It's not He Qiaochen.

890
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,190
It's

891
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,840
Yan.

892
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,350
It's Yan from Yanhui.

893
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,760
Yes, He Qiaohui.

894
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,190
He Qiaoyan.

895
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,270
Aren't you talking about Yanhui?

896
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,310
All right.

897
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,230
It doesn't matter

898
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,960
whether it's He Qiaohui or He Qiaoyan.

899
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
We got the news

900
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,470
of my daughter's engagement

901
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,640
from the WeChat Subscription.

902
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,310
Do you know how we feel?

903
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,510
Even the ladies

904
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,760
who danced on the square with us

905
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,800
all congratulated me

906
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,270
on my promotion to the top class.

907
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,190
Don't you want

908
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,470
to be congratulated?

909
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,080
By the way,

910
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,040
Speaking of WeChat.

911
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,550
I haven't blacklisted

912
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,600
Zhou Ziyang yet.

913
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,840
I'm going to blacklist him now.

914
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,960
Yes, blacklist him now.

915
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,760
I blacklist him.

916
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,190
Dear daughter,

917
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,350
are you

918
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,600
pregnant?

919
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm not pregnant.

920
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,760
Really not.

921
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm crazy.

922
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,150
Dear daughter,

923
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,470
this man

924
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,110
must be an

925
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,920
idle dandy.

926
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,110
He thinks our daughter is inexperienced.

927
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:15,270
He tried every means

928
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,150
to attract her.

929
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,680
He proposed

930
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,080
and gave a building as a gift.

931
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,390
We are simple people.

932
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,150
Let's not compare with others.

933
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,470
I always force you to get married.

934
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,350
But,

935
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:27,150
If you marry for the sake of marriage,

936
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,800
you won't be happy.

937
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,960
You'll lose out later.

938
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:30,960
Are you clear about that?

939
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,600
Your mother is right.

940
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Even though

941
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,310
others know some of the wrong things

942
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,350
we do.

943
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,230
But don't worry,

944
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,000
Your mon and I are going to give you...

945
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,640
Stop.

946
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,640
Listen to me.

947
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,470
I and He Qiaohui.

948
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,880
He Qiaoyan.

949
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,640
I and He Qiaoyan.

950
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,390
Our marriage is fake.

951
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,040
One day.

952
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,550
All in all,

953
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,760
He Qiaoyan

954
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,720
is just to help me out

955
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,510
and make Zhou Ziyang angry.

956
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,350
See?

957
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,920
False?

958
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,430
False.

959
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,230
But.

960
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,270
There is no but.

961
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,840
If.

962
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,960
There is no if.

963
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,840
Tonight,

964
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,920
I'll sleep on the sofa

965
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,720
and you two will sleep in my bedroom.

966
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,310
The meeting is over.

967
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:18,800
Wait.

968
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,880
Don't break up the meeting.

969
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
I just saw

970
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,310
a storage room over there.

971
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,470
You clean it up.

972
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,640
I can live there with your father.

973
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,760
Lao Qin,

974
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,430
let's

975
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,920
stay more days

976
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,880
with our daughter.

977
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
No problem.

978
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:31,880
I...

979
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,390
That's it.

980
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,150
Yes.

981
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,550
You...

982
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,510
Stop talking. That's it.

983
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,080
Help clean up.

984
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,470
Yeah.

985
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,150
Oh, my god!

986
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,270
I'll clean up the room.

987
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,230
All right.
