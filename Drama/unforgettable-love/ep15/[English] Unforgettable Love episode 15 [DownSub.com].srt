Unforgettable Love
EP15

2
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,039
I...

3
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,000
Dad

4
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,440
what are you going to say?

5
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,590
I finally...

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,789
Lao Qin, shut up.

7
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,590
I won't allow you to say that.

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,150
Before I leave...

9
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,789
Don't you say that.

10
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,670
I'm just talking about the card before I left.

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,560
Lao Li lost his 20 yuan to me when playing cards.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
Has the money transferred to my WeChat account?

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,229
You old fool,

14
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,190
you're still thinking about playing cards.

15
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,710
Well, you two

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,560
remember that for me.

17
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,229
I am a little bit hungry.

18
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,630
Dad, I made wonton.

19
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,479
It's still hot.

20
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,190
I'll get it for you.

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,840
No, No.

22
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd better not eat it.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,630
In case

24
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,560
I can't make it to the surgery

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
and die before that.

26
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,590
If so, I'm wasting the wonton.

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,270
There you go again.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,750
Dad, it's not time

29
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,150
to make a joke like that.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,190
Well, no wonton.

31
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,110
I'll make you a bowl of millet porridge.

32
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,560
OK.

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,670
Duh...

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,880
I...

35
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,400
I want to eat the wonton you made for me.

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,440
All these years

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,150
I haven't eaten

38
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,670
any food my daughter cooked for me.

39
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,270
Dad

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,079
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,400
I didn't take good care of you.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,270
I shouldn't have said something like that.

43
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,230
Dad

44
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,150
what are you looking for?

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,079
In this ward

46
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
there's no monitor and recorder, right?

47
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,150
Monitor and recorder?

48
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,750
Right.

49
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,670
What do you want?

50
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,360
Come here, daughter.

51
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,480
The password

52
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,190
is your mother's birthday, the other way around.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,080
What do you mean by that?

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,750
Take it.

55
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,150
Here's the money

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,480
you sent to me.

57
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,520
I didn't waste it.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,150
Every remittance

59
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,670
I have saved for you.

60
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,110
And

61
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,440
wages in former company

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,880
my pension

63
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,190
is this number.

64
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,750
That's all.

65
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,560
Daughter

66
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,480
you got married

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,790
without a formal wedding ceremony

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,110
and even dowry

69
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,560
I didn't prepare for you.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
In such a time

71
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,880
heart surgery is no small thing.

72
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,670
Even if I am optimistic enough

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,790
I should be responsible for you and your mom

74
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,360
and leave these matters to you.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,670
Dad, don't talk about that.

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,920
Keep this money for yourself.

77
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,110
No no no

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
It should always be

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,710
dad taking care of his daughter.

80
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,230
You know?

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,790
I don't want you to grow up.

82
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,150
If anyone is to blame

83
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,230
it's dad's getting old so fast

84
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,440
that troubles my daughter.

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,960
Dad

86
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,840
I'll depend on you.

87
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,960
I'll depend on you all my life.

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,590
OK, pinkie promise.

89
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,270
Pinkie promise.

90
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,590
By the way

91
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,880
Lao Li's 20 yuan...

92
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,190
I got it!

93
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,560
Don't forget it.

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,360
I won't.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,230
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,840
It's been more than three hours.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,920
It will be OK.

98
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,360
Mom, Yiyue.

99
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,230
You are here, Qiaoyan.

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,440
He's been in for hours

101
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,590
and hasn't come out yet.

102
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,750
Mom

103
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,590
the operation has certain risks

104
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,520
however

105
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,040
I analyzed

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,400
all the surgical data.

107
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,230
The success rate is not low.

108
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,670
The surgeon, Doctor Xu

109
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,440
is a cardiologist

110
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,710
from GMN Medical Center.

111
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,080
The success rate of his operation

112
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,080
is up to 97.8 percent.

113
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,480
Short term complications

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,790
and local recurrence rate

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,520
are also very low.

116
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,840
He's the golden hand in heart surgery.

117
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,960
Apart from him

118
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,150
his three assistants

119
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,270
and the anesthesiologist

120
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,150
all followed him

121
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,560
for more than ten years and formed a fixed team.

122
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,190
That would be great.

123
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,750
I will not worry about it.

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,960
Just rest assured, Mom.

125
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,190
The operation will take a while.

126
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,880
You two can take a break for a minute.

127
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,150
If you still don't feel at ease

128
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,230
just take a look at

129
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,560
the real time data feedback of the operation.

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
I've arranged another group of

131
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,630
other experts

132
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,520
to monitor the data at the same time.

133
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,000
Two groups of personnel for double guarantee.

134
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,230
You can rest assured.

135
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,560
These...

136
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,150
Did you do these overnight?

137
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,400
That's what I should do.

138
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,630
Xiaobao is also very worried about you.

139
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,400
Don't worry.

140
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,520
We're in this together.

141
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,110
Thank you.

142
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,630
Dad.

143
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,040
How's it going, Dr. Xu?

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,110
The surgery was a success.

145
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,710
Thank you.

146
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Thank you.

147
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
Let's go.

149
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,230
Chicken feet.

150
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
It smells good.

151
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,840
You pervert!

152
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,720
I...

153
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,310
Dad

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,920
you woke up.

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,430
How do you feel?

156
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,190
It hurts.

157
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,000
Straighten your finger.

158
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,840
In the contract

159
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
when can I add

160
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,040
the protection of my personal safety?

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,390
Never.

162
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
You are here, aunt.

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,840
Qiaoyan

164
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,880
Xiaowei has told me everything

165
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,760
and I've reminded you, too.

166
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,880
At this moment, nothing

167
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,720
nobody

168
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,960
can stand in Heshi's way.

169
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,720
Look at you

170
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,190
let a stranger's illness

171
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,640
affect your work.

172
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
He is no stranger.

173
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,800
He's my father-in-law.

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,110
It can be arranged with a phone call.

175
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you wasting your time?

176
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:15,230
Aunt

177
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
perhaps family's company

178
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,230
is also important.

179
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,310
Don't worry.

180
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,880
I'll take care of

181
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,840
things at work.

182
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,550
Take me to the ward.

183
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,510
This way.

184
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,760
Dad, mom.

185
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Aunt.

186
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
This is...

187
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,040
Mom

188
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,350
this is Qiaoyan's aunt.

189
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,190
In-law.

190
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,310
You are very kind

191
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,040
to take time out of busy schedule

192
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,190
to visit Lao Qin.

193
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,840
Sit down. Sit down.

194
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,680
Aunt, leave it to me. Please have a seat.

195
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,880
Have a seat.

196
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,640
Sit down, aunt.

197
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,800
Would you like some fruit?

198
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm good, thank you.

199
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,550
A glass of water then.

200
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,000
Yueyue, get a glass of water.

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Don't bother.

202
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,510
Lao Qin

203
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,150
you don't know

204
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,510
how much your son-in-law

205
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,390
helped this time.

206
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,390
Otherwise, Yueyue and I

207
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,600
don't know what to do.

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,640
Qiaoyan is a good son-in-law.

209
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,190
Mom and dad, look what you said.

210
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,150
It's what I should do.

211
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,430
In-law

212
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,470
your family genes

213
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,040
are really good.

214
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,230
When I first met Qiaoyan

215
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,080
I wondered how could there be

216
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,680
such a handsome boy.

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,960
And today I saw you

218
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,430
what a beauty.

219
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,510
In the future

220
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,510
if Qiaoyan and Yueyue

221
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,430
have a baby

222
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,390
how pretty it will be, right?

223
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,430
Mom

224
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,430
Yeah

225
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,000
So many people.

226
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,190
Hello, uncle and aunt.

227
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,600
Auntie, you're here, too

228
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,040
Mom and dad

229
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,720
This is my best friend

230
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,510
Wen Gu

231
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,390
The boy is very polite

232
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,920
to come such a long way.

233
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's what I should do.

234
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,760
Mr. He.

235
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,270
I've got what you want.

236
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,800
Mom and dad, there's something at work

237
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,840
I need to deal with.

238
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,040
I have to go.

239
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,840
Just go.

240
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,150
We are here.

241
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,230
Yes, just go.

242
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,150
Mom and dad have me here.

243
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,800
I mean I can take care of them.

244
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,600
Go ahead.

245
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,190
Call me if you have any questions.

246
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,190
Aunt, let's go.

247
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,760
Have a good rest.

248
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,190
Take your time.

249
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,150
Take your time.

250
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,880
Take your time.

251
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,640
Look at you

252
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,680
you haven't cleaned your mouth yet.

253
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,470
Do you want any more?

254
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,270
want it or not?

255
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,270
What else to eat?

256
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,190
This

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,080
Why Xiaobao

258
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,350
suddenly got so close

259
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,190
with a stranger?

260
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:07,960
Maybe because Yiyue

261
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,350
has engaged in children's psychological work for years.

262
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,920
She has

263
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,350
the qualities that attract children.

264
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,680
I used to think

265
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,760
Xiaobao has child's nature

266
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,270
to like someone

267
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,880
all of a sudden.

268
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,960
But today When I saw Xiaobao

269
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
I suddenly wondered

270
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,470
was it really that simple?

271
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,390
You mean

272
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,190
Yiyue approaches Xiaobao intentionally.

273
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
This is absolutely impossible.

274
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,680
Thank you

275
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,080
for coming to see my father.

276
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,230
You are very welcome.

277
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,600
I have to go.

278
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,310
Wait

279
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,150
There's one thing

280
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,230
I want to ask you.

281
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,470
What is it?

282
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,600
I used to see pictures of a girl

283
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,680
from the back

284
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,270
at your brother's place.

285
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,720
I thought it was Miss Lin

286
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,510
but now it seems not.

287
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,550
Of course not.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
Who is that?

289
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,390
Well...

290
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,310
I'm not sure if I can tell you.

291
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,600
Fine

292
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,920
I'll change the question.

293
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,150
Who do you think

294
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,270
is the person knows Ruowei best

295
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,760
in the world?

296
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,350
Not a big deal.

297
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,040
What do you want to know?

298
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,550
I will definitely tell the truth.

299
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,270
Smart.

300
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,840
You know me.

301
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,270
I'll sell my best friend

302
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,270
without reservation.

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,230
If you have any questions in the future

304
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,230
just come to me.

305
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,880
Settled.

306
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,720
Can you tell me now?

307
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,470
My brother has been dreaming of

308
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,430
a girl's back

309
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,680
in recent years.

310
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,800
He just wanted to find out

311
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,840
the girl in the dream.

312
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,190
But don't worry

313
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,430
I think

314
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,190
that girl doesn't exist.

315
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,110
The girl in his dream?

316
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,080
That means

317
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,720
this girl doesn't exist at all?

318
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,960
Certainly not.

319
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,190
I must go.

320
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,470
You secretly

321
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,110
call up the information of Qin Yiyue.

322
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,760
The Information of Mrs. He

323
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,680
you've seen it all before.

324
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,680
It's different this time.

325
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to know

326
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,800
her relationship with Xiaobao.

327
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,720
I don't believe

328
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,110
there's such a coincidence in the world.

329
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,430
I'll do it.

330
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,720
Hello.

331
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,080
Qiaoyan.

332
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,190
Mom.

333
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,470
Why is it so noisy over there?

334
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,390
Are you done with work?

335
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,349
I've just finished.

336
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,310
What's the matter?

337
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,920
Come to the hospital.

338
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,230
The hospital?

339
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,800
Is anything wrong?

340
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,230
You have a long journey.

341
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,470
It's fine.

342
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,550
This little girl is really beautiful.

343
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,390
I remembered she was just a kid.

344
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,000
She's grown up

345
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,720
You're right

346
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,310
it's the right room.

347
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
A friendly Reminder

348
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,230
you can't run now even if you want to.

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,840
Nine times out of ten

350
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,720
they came for you.

351
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,680
This group of relatives and friends gathering together

352
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,150
is not easy.

353
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,720
Yes.

354
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,510
How are you, aunts and uncles?

355
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's a long way to come

356
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
to see my dad.

357
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,510
Have some fruit.

358
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,640
It's what we should do.

359
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,080
Yueyue has grown up, too.

360
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,350
You're so beautiful, Yueyue.

361
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,190
Hello everyone.

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,230
How handsome.

363
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,040
Close-up real picture.

364
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,040
Don't be rude.

365
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,800
Brother Qiaoyan, let's take a selfie.

366
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,150
This is my daughter, a medical student.

367
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,760
It's because

368
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,430
she's worshiped Yueyue since she was a child.

369
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,150
She just graduated this year.

370
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,760
Mr. He

371
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,000
is there any vacancy in medical technology

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,150
in your company?

373
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,550
What is her subject?

374
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,110
Veterinary medicine, mainly focus on horses.

375
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,310
Maybe my company is not suitable.

376
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,350
Academy of Agricultural Sciences

377
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,880
I can introduce her there

378
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,550
Brother, can I add you on WeChat?

379
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,600
Brother Qiaoyan

380
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,680
can I also add your WeChat?

381
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,800
He's not the same as what is said on the Internet.

382
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,150
He has no official airs.

383
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,430
Yes.

384
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,080
Right.

385
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,600
Talented.

386
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,510
Hello, uncles and aunts.

387
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,080
You are here.

388
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,840
Why so many people?

389
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,880
I don't know either.

390
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,080
Come to the supermarket with me.

391
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,660
Uncle said he wanted a deck of cards.

392
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,660
He said it's so boring.

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
OK, let's go.

394
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,760
Qiaoyan, I ordered several boxes of fruit.

395
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,640
They are about to arrive.

396
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,310
Would you please come with Ning Fang

397
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,350
to help me move them?

398
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
Why do you want them both?

399
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,920
Nothing else.

400
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,840
I just want to see them in the same frame.

401
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,470
Let's go.

402
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,470
Mom.

403
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm leaving.

404
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,840
Uncles and aunts, we have to go.

405
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,880
Right, they are busy.

406
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,150
How beautiful!

407
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,920
Come in or not, young man?

408
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Don't hang about.

409
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,110
Wait.

410
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,960
The pores are clean and delicate

411
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,680
but the forehead and nose are oily

412
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Has skin care but not exquisite

413
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
The fragrance of wood

414
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,040
fresh and light

415
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,190
Popular taste

416
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,680
but mediocre

417
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,640
Blended T-shirt of

418
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,800
Japanese household brand

419
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,760
Pursuit of cost-efficiency and comfort

420
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,000
but the delicacy is not enough

421
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,000
The edge of the nail is clean and smooth

422
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,270
and smells like disinfectant.

423
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,150
It should be hand sanitizer in hospital.

424
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,720
From the muscles

425
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,270
on his shoulder and chest

426
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,350
his body fat should be about 10 percent

427
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,920
to 13 percent.

428
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,600
I used to think

429
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,680
last time at the hotpot restaurant

430
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,600
was our limit.

431
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,190
I didn't expect...

432
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,000
You can choose not to talk.

433
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,270
In such a small space

434
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:08,840
every word of yours

435
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,430
can cause a surge of air

436
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,920
blowing in my ear.

437
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,110
It's very uncomfortable.

438
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Don't move.

439
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,920
He Qiaoyan really said that?

440
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,960
Arranged marriage was just a joke?

441
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,960
He said there was not such a thing.

442
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,310
He's not lying to you, is he?

443
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,000
No, he's not that kind of person.

444
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,920
I think

445
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,550
you really

446
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,350
like He Qiaoyan now.

447
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,470
Have some snacks

448
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,270
and stop talking.

449
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,390
It's not me you're blocking.

450
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,510
Even if He Qiaoyan

451
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,470
didn't take the arranged marriage seriously

452
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,270
it's clear that Lin Wei takes it seriously.

453
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
She made such a high-profile appearance

454
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,840
at the banquet

455
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,960
and openly

456
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,390
went to work in Heshi Group.

457
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,040
She's obviously telling you

458
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,150
that she's the one.

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,800
If you

460
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,150
really like He Qiaoyan

461
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,640
don't be so stupid.

462
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,510
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

463
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,600
Love affair

464
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,510
is like a battle.

465
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:29,840
let's go.

466
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,270
You want to carry two boxes?

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
What's up?

468
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:33,840
Put it down first.

469
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,470
What is cooperation?

470
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,840
The key to cooperation is

471
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,550
fair

472
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
and reasonable distribution.

473
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,960
There are three boxes of fruit

474
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,720
and each box is three kilos.

475
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,640
That's nine kilos in total.

476
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,000
I think the most reasonable way should be

477
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,150
one for you and one for me

478
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,550
and the box left

479
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,550
we move it together.

480
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,230
It makes sense.

481
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,230
However

482
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,640
I

483
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,080
didn't plan to carry them myself.

484
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,800
I think so, too.

485
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,510
The key to human progress

486
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,080
is using tools.

487
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,510
Together.

488
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,080
You are just as Yiyue described.

489
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,190
What's up?

490
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,000
Minister Xu of R & D department thinks

491
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,510
the new design of the bracelet

492
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,230
has affected the use of the product

493
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,390
but Lucas insists the design.

494
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,310
So now they two

495
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,190
have reached a deadlock.

496
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,040
Got it.

497
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,960
What's the matter?

498
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,430
Wait a second.

499
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,080
There's something in the company

500
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,350
I need to deal with.

501
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,680
Please tell mom and dad.

502
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,550
Just go.

503
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
What's going on?

504
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,680
The meeting of rivals in love is especially envious.

505
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,040
Do you think they two

506
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
will have a fight?

507
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,150
Your father's illness

508
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,960
has affected Qiaoyan's work.

509
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:26,760
Because of the bracelet recently

510
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,880
He Qiaoyan is very busy.

511
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,310
I hope you won't

512
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,680
disturb his work any more.

513
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,190
Otherwise, I won't sit back and watch.

514
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,880
It's our business, what's the matter with her?

515
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
Stop looking.

516
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,040
The car drives away.

517
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,840
Jaws of death.

518
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,080
Yiyue.

519
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,390
Yiyue really

520
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,640
likes He Qiaoyan.

521
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,470
Ruowei

522
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,350
do you know this man?

523
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:18,880
When I came

524
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,760
he was on your seat.

525
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,640
It's OK. You go ahead.

526
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,840
Is that her boyfriend?

527
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,760
No way, he's too low.

528
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,760
Sister, what are you doing?

529
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,920
This bag is worth tens of thousands.

530
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,150
I said don't come to my company.

531
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,040
Why are you here again?

532
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,640
This is your fault.

533
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,310
You have to tell your family

534
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,840
if you change jobs.

535
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,230
I had a lot of trouble finding you.

536
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,040
Alas.

537
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,680
I want to ask you something.

538
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,350
Do you think

539
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,150
this is the most expensive Industrial Park

540
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,190
in this world?

541
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Which moneybag are you leaning on?

542
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,470
The chairman?

543
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,880
This is where I work.

544
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,000
Anything you what to say

545
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,190
go out and tell me.

546
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,150
No need.

547
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,600
I'm good here.

548
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
You get up.

549
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,470
Right off.

550
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,150
What a waste.

551
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,920
Or I'll call security.

552
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,040
Let me tell you

553
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,150
I'm not afraid of losing face.

554
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,000
Weiwei.

555
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,800
Weiwei.

556
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,190
Good morning.

557
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,190
Weiwei.

558
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
Weiwei.

559
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,110
What's the matter this time?

560
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,800
Lend me 200 thousand yuan.

561
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,550
You bet again.

562
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,040
I didn't bet.

563
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,350
This time a friend of mine

564
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,430
pulled me in.

565
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,640
But the business was a failure

566
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,080
and lost 300 thousand yuan.

567
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm not directly

568
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,430
asking for 300 thousand yuan.

569
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,600
Just give me some 100 thousand right now.

570
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,800
Besides paying back the money

571
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
there's the decoration of the house

572
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,150
me and mother's living expenses

573
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,510
and

574
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm going to marry my girlfriend next year.

575
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,510
Before you lie

576
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,600
can you make a draft?

577
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,150
Can people like you

578
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,760
find a girlfriend?

579
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,640
And

580
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,840
how to decorate the house?

581
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
Is our house Queen's garden

582
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,080
that has to be repaired every year?

583
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,040
Can you

584
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
find a decent job

585
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,190
to support the family?

586
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,920
Just tell me will you lend me or not?

587
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,390
You make so much money

588
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,000
so you should

589
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,720
share more

590
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,430
for the family.

591
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,430
This is the word a brother

592
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,640
should say?

593
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,680
Sister.

594
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,920
in fact, in my heart

595
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,080
I've been worried about you.

596
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,880
Having been out there all these years

597
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,310
you must have suffered a lot.

598
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,190
I actually...

599
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:29,960
Sorry, baby

600
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,880
I'm late.

601
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,390
Tell me this kind of thing earlier.

602
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,150
Let me handle it.

603
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,110
I'll take care of my baby.

604
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,800
She doesn't have to suffer with me.

605
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,640
Double rhyme.

606
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
What's your problem?

607
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,550
Dude,

608
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,470
did you hear that just now?

609
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:50,840
Never again

610
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,230
call her sister.

611
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,190
It's greasier than Daqing Oilfield.

612
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,080
She doesn't want to see you at all.

613
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,230
If you are smart, go away.

614
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,430
Who the hell are you?

615
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,880
Who are you?

616
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,720
-She's my sister.   -He's my brother.

617
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,190
Brother, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

618
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,230
Excuse me. Excuse me.

619
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,470
Just go away.

620
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,310
Go away.

621
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,270
What's wrong?

622
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,960
What's the matter? So mysterious.

623
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,150
No way

624
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,470
where did you find it?

625
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,230
Why it smells like

626
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,840
air fresheners?

627
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,840
Poor little ring.

628
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,760
It has lied idle for so long

629
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,230
in the bathroom.

630
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,960
It's really a sin.

631
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,000
Bathroom...

632
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,350
But have you ever thought about it.

633
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,640
This ring appears

634
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,960
just at this moment.

635
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,430
What does it mean?

636
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,600
It means it's time

637
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
for a clean-up.

638
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,080
I am asking you

639
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,920
did He Qiaoyan

640
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,080
give this ring to you?

641
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,550
Yeah.

642
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,920
So is this ring

643
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,270
the symbol of your identity

644
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,600
Mrs. He?

645
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,270
Right?

646
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,920
Right.

647
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,040
So this ring

648
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,600
is obviously a reminder.

649
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,510
It's time to exercise your rights as Mrs. He.

650
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,190
Thunder strikes

651
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,800
to repel the invading enemy

652
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,000
and safeguard your man.

653
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,640
Right?

654
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,760
Is it?

655
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,110
Can you be more positive?

656
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,880
Ouch

657
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,550
Uncle will be up and about soon.

658
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,150
You have to face your crisis in love.

659
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,080
l have to go.

660
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,920
I am late.

661
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,190
Behave yourself.

662
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,110
Bye.

663
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,920
I finally make it to the discharge.

664
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,310
How to describe this?

665
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,310
Right.

666
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,640
There will be a good fortune if you don't die in great danger.

667
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,390
What about my 20 yuan?

668
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,510
There you go again.

669
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,110
Dad, Uncle Li said

670
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,270
he's going to fight you 300 rounds

671
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,000
after you are discharge

672
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
with that 20 yuan.

673
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,430
Old fool.

674
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,230
Let's see what I can do to fix him.

675
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,640
You don't have a chance to fix him.

676
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,470
What's up?

677
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,470
The doctor said

678
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,680
you have a serious lack of exercise.

679
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,760
So when you get discharged,

680
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,270
I have to take you running every day.

681
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,310
I have few years left

682
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,430
If I don't play any more, I'll suffer such a loss.

683
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,390
Let me ask you

684
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,800
If you died this time

685
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,550
You couldn't even see your granddaughter.

686
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,470
Do you suffer or not?

687
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:31,510
That's quite a loss.

688
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:31,880
You two

689
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,600
can live another hundred years.

690
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,840
How sweet our daughter is.

691
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,640
Where's Qiaoyan?

692
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,040
Oh, right.

693
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,550
Your father's discharged is such a big deal.

694
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,470
Why didn't he come?

695
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,920
Didn't you tell him?

696
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,190
Mom.

697
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,190
It's because

698
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,800
I don't want to disturb his work.

699
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,270
That's fine.

700
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,800
Mommy.

701
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,080
Here comes Xiaobao.

702
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
Mom and dad.

703
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,640
You are so busy.

704
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,880
You don't have to come here.

705
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,640
It's what I should do.

706
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,840
I thought you weren't coming.

707
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,350
On my way here

708
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,680
I've been on a conference call

709
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,110
so I didn't get time to call you back.

710
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,720
Mom and dad, your car is ready.

711
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,040
I'll take you home.

712
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,840
That's good.

713
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,150
Let's go.

714
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,270
Let's go.

715
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,800
Don't eat fatty food.

716
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,470
You have to eat something vegetarian.

717
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,800
You just got out of the hospital.

718
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,040
There's no wine.

719
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,680
You shouldn't drink wine just after being discharged.

720
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,230
Fine.

721
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,150
Xiaobao, help yourself.

722
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,680
Dad.

723
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,600
My daughter loves me.

724
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,680
Mom, have some, too.

725
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,430
My son-in-law loves me.

726
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,960
Daughter, eat.

727
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:49,390
Why is Xiaobao so lovely?

728
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,230
Here, call me grandma.

729
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:53,800
Mom.

730
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,760
Oh, my poor memory.

731
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Forget it.

732
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,470
Forget it.

733
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,430
Grandma.

734
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,040
Did Xiaobao...

735
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,430
Did Xiaobao call me?

736
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,350
Call me again.

737
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,510
Grandma.

738
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,190
Fantastic.

739
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,230
Xiaobao, call me grandpa.

740
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,040
Grandpa.

741
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
He's calling you.

742
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,510
What happened to the child today?

743
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
He's enlightened, isn't he?

744
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,429
Fantastic.

745
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,350
Xiaobao, call me daddy.

746
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,110
Say daddy.

747
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,000
Xiaobao, say daddy.

748
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,600
It's daddy.

749
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:36,880
It's daddy.

750
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,270
Mr. He, you need to keep trying.

751
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,429
It's nothing.

752
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,350
That's what kids do.

753
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:56,230
Maybe tomorrow he will call you.

754
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
Take it easy.

755
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:57,960
Yes.

756
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,150
Let's have dinner.

757
00:34:59,150 --> 00:34:59,960
Come on.

758
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,550
Come on, Xiaobao.

759
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,190
Yueyue, have some yourself.

760
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,270
Hello.

761
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,350
Qiaoyan.

762
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,960
Mr. Jia wanted to see us

763
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,190
at the hotel where his company's dinner held.

764
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,510
It sounds like

765
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,230
he wants to cooperate with us.

766
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,000
OK.

767
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,150
Well

768
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,760
send me the location of the hotel.

769
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,230
Before the end of the dinner

770
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,080
I'll be there for sure.

771
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,350
Mom and dad.

772
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,110
It's something at work.

773
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:40,920
I have to go.

774
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,110
If you are busy, just go.

775
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,550
The meal is not finished yet.

776
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,550
Xiaobao, let's go home.

777
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,390
Eat something.

778
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,600
You've hardly eaten anything.

779
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,230
Goodbye, Xiaobao.

780
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,350
Drive safe.

781
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Bye, Mom.

782
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,470
Hotel.

783
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,800
Why to meet in the hotel?

784
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,150
Why didn't take me to dinner?

785
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,800
I'm his wife.

786
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,270
Silly girl.

787
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,920
You finish eating and lie down.

788
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,680
Did I give birth to a baby pig?

789
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,720
I'm going out.

790
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,800
What are you going to do?

791
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,230
Your baby pig's backyard

792
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,640
is on fire.

793
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,350
What does that mean?

794
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,040
Sis, please give me your robe.

795
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,470
What?

796
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,840
Don't you say love affair is like a battle?

797
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm going to fight.

798
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,800
By the way

799
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,190
your so called imperial mask

800
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,430
please prepare for me, too.

801
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,430
Put it down.

802
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,600
So mean?

803
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,230
Tell me

804
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,230
when, where and who.

805
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,960
Hotel, tonight.

806
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,270
He Qiaoyan and Lin Wei.

807
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,720
At the hotel in the evening?

808
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,600
No wonder you sound the alarm.

809
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:50,080
You actually need to

810
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,550
take good care of your skin.

811
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,880
Lin Wei is not a small role.

812
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,390
Don't be outperformed by her.

813
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,550
So I come here

814
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,110
for your equipment.

815
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,680
Depends on it.

816
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,430
My skin color

817
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,190
has lightened a lot.

818
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,470
You are

819
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,190
my fairy godmother.

820
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,510
Only a pumpkin cart's missing.

821
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,430
You can have it.

822
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,470
Excuse me

823
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,430
is the pumpkin car

824
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,680
reserved by passenger 6623?

825
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,000
Why are you here, Ning Fang?

826
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,430
I called him.

827
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,550
It's the evening rush.

828
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,920
It's hard to find a taxi.

829
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,080
Thank you then.

830
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,920
Get in the car.

831
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,190
Bye.

832
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,310
Bye-bye.

833
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,270
Wait a minute.

834
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,350
What are you doing?

835
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,110
What's up?

836
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,470
What's up?

837
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,720
You're taking pictures, aren't you?

838
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,110
Who's taking pictures?

839
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:34,920
Let go.

840
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Come to the police station with me.

841
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,350
Go.

842
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,550
Go.

843
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,760
Hurry up.

844
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,390
What do you want?

845
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,470
How dare you take pictures.

846
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,640
Mr. Jia

847
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,310
Mr. Jia
