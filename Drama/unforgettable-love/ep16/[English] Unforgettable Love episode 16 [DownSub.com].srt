Unforgettable Love
EP16

2
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,150
Go.

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,480
Hurry up!

5
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,590
How dare you take pictures!

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
-Mr. Jia.  -Mr. Jia.

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,670
Yiyue, let him go.

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,190
What are you doing?

9
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,360
This way, please.

10
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,190
Mr. Jia refused to cooperate with Heshi Group.

11
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,790
The cooperation with Mr. Jia

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,110
is a crucial step to

13
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:03,520
the promotion of bracelets.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,150
For this cooperation,

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,150
He Qiaoyan has been busy

16
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,400
for over half a month.

17
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
I never expected

19
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,630
it would happen.

20
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,110
We had had an appointment with Mr. Jia

21
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,750
at 10 a.m. last Monday,

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,440
but because Qiaoyan was concerned about

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,590
your father's surgery,

24
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,310
the meeting was cancelled.

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,440
Then, Qiaoyan

26
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,750
made lots of efforts to persuade Mr. Jia

27
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,230
to give us

28
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,630
another chance to meet.

29
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,790
But again, you...

30
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,440
Qin Yiyue

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,590
Don't you think

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,670
you've always been giving Qiaoyan

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,840
a lot of trouble?

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,230
I know you're not a real couple,

35
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,110
but merely a contractual one.

36
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,630
How did you know?

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,670
Never mind how I knew it.

38
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,440
I had wanted to give you

39
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,960
more time to disguise,

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,310
but right now, you've

41
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,270
severely affected Qiaoyan's work.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,270
I just can't ignore it.

43
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,400
Even if we're in a contractual relationship,

44
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,110
that's our business.

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop deceiving yourself.

46
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,400
You clearly know

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
my relationship with Qiaoyan.

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,670
We have an engagement.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,920
He has told me,

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,920
that your baby engagement

51
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,230
is just a joke.

52
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,880
It's our two families' business.

53
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,630
Whether a joke or not

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,520
can't be defined by He Qiaoyan.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,880
Besides, for Qiaoyan, Heshi Group

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,190
is more important than anything.

57
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,270
Do you think

58
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,920
you can compete with the whole He family?

59
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,079
Besides, I can help Qiaoyan

60
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,230
to run Heshi Group.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,920
Can you do it?

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,110
Keep it real,

63
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,480
you are from totally different classes.

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,750
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,589
All right, I'll drive you home.

66
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,230
No, thanks.

67
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,190
I can go back by myself.

68
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,840
Dressed like this,

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
how can you go back by yourself?

70
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,790
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,440
Dress like this at night,

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,710
what's going on in your mind?

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,790
Let me drive her back.

74
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,400
You came here with him?

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,400
I'll take her home.

76
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,310
Let's go, Yiyue.

77
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,040
I'll go now.

78
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,790
What happened?

79
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,110
I want to drink.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Had a quarrel?

81
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,840
No.

82
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,230
It's just...

83
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,590
I did something wrong.

84
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,920
If you do, just apologize.

85
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,920
If you don't apologize,

86
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,310
nothing will be solved.

87
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,480
Ning Fang,

88
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,880
Do you know that feeling?

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,520
It's like,

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,150
the God

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,590
suddenly knocks my head,

92
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,560
to let me realize

93
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,190
the good merit I thought I had

94
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,000
is nothing but a fake.

95
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,590
It's taken back at twelve o'clock

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,880
to its original owner.

97
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,840
You little fool, you are the best.

98
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,560
No one can take it away.

99
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not pretty nor good.

100
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
I can only affect his work,

101
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,440
and hold him back.

102
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,080
I...

103
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,270
What are they doing here?

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,590
My brother must

105
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,150
be cheated, isn't he?

106
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,840
I must tell him now.

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
Bro, what's the matter with you?

108
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,790
How can you allow sister-in-law

109
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,150
to drink with another man?

110
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,080
She drank?

111
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,480
You've offended her, haven't you?

112
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,400
Where is she?

113
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,590
Inside.

114
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,440
Why are you here?

115
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,590
Isn't it time for you to go?

116
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,920
Ning Fang

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,960
No matter what happens,

118
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll make it clear.

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,270
Wait for me outside.

120
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
You must be Dr. Ning Fang, right?

121
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,590
I've heard of you from Ruowei.

122
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,480
Go, go, go.

123
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:11,880
I haven't

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,150
formally introduced myself.

125
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,190
I'm Wen Gu.

126
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,150
Ruowei's boss.

127
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,110
Go home.

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,720
Go home?

129
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,679
Go home with me.

130
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,880
Back to our home.

131
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,430
Qiaoyan, where are you?

132
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,960
Since it doesn't work with Mr. Jia,

133
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,080
We have to quickly propose

134
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,040
Plan B.

135
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,640
OK, I see.

136
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
Don't be silly,

137
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,230
I'll take you home first.

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
There's another meeting in the evening.

139
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,960
He Qiaoyan,

140
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,880
I have no reason

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,000
to stand by your side.

142
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,550
What do you mean?

143
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,040
Let's

144
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,270
terminate the contract.

145
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,600
Terminate the contract?

146
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,720
Why do you want to do that?

147
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,310
The validity of our contract

148
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,110
is one year.

149
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,880
There's still much time left.

150
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,230
Xiaobao, he...

151
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,960
he's been able to go to school without crying.

152
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,230
His language ability

153
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,640
is also recovering.

154
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,720
He no longer needs

155
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,040
my whole companion.

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
I want to devote more energy and time

157
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,960
to my own career.

158
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
And,

159
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,110
I don't want to

160
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,470
affect your work any more.

161
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,040
I think what you need to do

162
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,390
is to calm down.

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,110
I'll give you two weeks,

164
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,720
two-week paid vacation.

165
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,800
It's me,

166
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,110
who cannot uphold the principle

167
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,310
to be a fake couple with you.

168
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,510
A fake couple?

169
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,800
I'll give my last word:

170
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,150
go home with me.

171
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,510
I've told you, terminate the contract.

172
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,840
You didn't ask me to stay at all...

173
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,760
Sit down.

174
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,310
What on earth can't I let it go?

175
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,510
Do you mean

176
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,840
I can't let go the mansion

177
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
or limousine?

178
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm not superficial, OK?

179
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
Am I that kind of superficial person?

180
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,430
Let me tell you,

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,000
what I can't let go is Xiaobao.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,600
Xiaobao and I

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,150
are good mates forever.

184
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,080
What?

185
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,800
Did you say I can't let go He Qiaoyan?

186
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,080
You are the one who can't let him go, OK?

187
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,880
He's as cheap as you.

188
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,080
I won't even pay a dime

189
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,040
to buy him!

190
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,720
Turn the light off and go to bed!

191
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,080
It's already midnight,

192
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,510
and what are you doing again in my house?

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Well, eat melons.

194
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,840
Eat melons for what?

195
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,390
They contain too much sugar.

196
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,680
Not for bedtime.

197
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,310
Come on,

198
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,000
why does sister-in-law burst into temper?

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,080
Is my sister-in-law cheating on you?

200
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,470
Do you think everyone else is like you?

201
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,350
You bastard!

202
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,960
I came here to comfort you,

203
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,640
but you,

204
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,350
do nothing but attack me.

205
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,270
Or because of Lin Wei.

206
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,510
It has nothing to do with Lin Wei.

207
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,920
You and Lin Wei

208
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,350
once had a baby engagement.

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,150
About that,

210
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,600
I've explained it to Yiyue.

211
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
I've told her

212
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,470
those were just nonsense from elders,

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,640
so don't take it seriously.

214
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
I'm so relieved.

215
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,310
Relieved? Why?

216
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,150
Neither sister-in-law nor you cheated.

217
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,190
What's left

218
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,080
is not a big deal.

219
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,470
Women, women.

220
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,470
Find out the cause, and remedy the problem.

221
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,600
It's so easy to ease women.

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,920
Yue, what's going on?

223
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Haven't I told you to declare sovereignty?

224
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,510
How come it was flipped around?

225
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,080
Good news doesn't come,

226
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,800
bad news has wings.

227
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,150
He Qiaoyan also agreed with it?

228
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,270
Maybe he also realized it.

229
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,510
Since Lin Wei came back,

230
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,190
I

231
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,960
am becoming unnecessary.

232
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,270
Come on in.

233
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,600
Mr. He,

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,760
this is Pediatric Psychology Consulting Room.

235
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,390
Of course I know.

236
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,430
Tell me,

237
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
why do you want to leave?

238
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,110
I've finished my work!

239
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,800
Besides,

240
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,430
for my career,

241
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,000
I have clearer vision and higher pursuit.

242
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,470
I want to do something extraordinary.

243
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
OK, I see.

244
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,230
But I hope

245
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
you're not just bragging.

246
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,840
The title of Mrs. He

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,080
is no longer what I want.

248
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,350
Pretending to be in love every day

249
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,080
is just driving me crazy!

250
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,760
Anyway, there're so many people who like you,

251
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,230
so I don't want to be regarded as

252
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,720
the one squatting on a toilet...

253
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,190
What did you call me?

254
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:10,110
A toilet.

255
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,080
Squatting for a long time,

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,390
I'll easily numb my legs,

257
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,110
then I'll give it to others in the queue

258
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,110
to use.

259
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,040
Let's put it this way,

260
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,600
I disagree.

261
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,080
Why?

262
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,270
The contract is very clear.

263
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,390
Stage three,

264
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,510
Party B should, within the term of the Contract,

265
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,270
help Xiaobao

266
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,600
successfully enter the primary school,

267
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,470
and adapt to social life.

268
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:35,110
Yes,

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,190
I'm doing fine.

270
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,430
Xiaobao is now gradually

271
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,270
adapting to school life,

272
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,760
and he's getting along with kids

273
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,150
without any discomfort.

274
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,040
I think I have

275
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,720
finished the work successfully.

276
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,350
It seems that Dr. Qin

277
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,230
isn't fully aware of

278
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,000
the definition of social life.

279
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,510
It seems I need to popularize to you

280
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,310
what is social life.

281
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,760
Social life is linked by social relations,

282
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,040
which means to build relationships

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,270
with others.

284
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,640
In the field of psychology,

285
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,040
interpersonal relationship

286
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,310
refers to the person-to-person

287
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,550
direct psychological connection.

288
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,720
In terms of that,

289
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,150
Xiaobao haven't done it.

290
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:06,960
Briefly speaking,

291
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,390
Xiaobao just peacefully

292
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:10,000
gets into the social environment,

293
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,920
but doesn't

294
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,390
let down his defences

295
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,680
to make friends with others.

296
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,040
Mr. He,

297
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,430
are you talking to a professional

298
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,470
about the professional?

299
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,550
It seems that Dr. Qin

300
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,720
also agrees with me.

301
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,680
I, He Qiaoyan,

302
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,390
never fail in business.

303
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,550
How about that:

304
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,430
as long as you help Xiaobao

305
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,600
to find a friend,

306
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll count all your work

307
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,550
done completely.

308
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,190
With contract void and debt cleared,

309
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,310
you'll be free.

310
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,430
What are we doing here?

311
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
Meet parents.

312
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,310
Of course I'm a parent.

313
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,310
I mean,

314
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,109
meet parents for what?

315
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,190
Just meet parents.

316
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,109
What were you thinking about?

317
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:27,880
Xiaobao,

318
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,150
This is?

319
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,550
Guoguo.

320
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,510
Hello, Guoguo.

321
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,000
Hello, Uncle...

322
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
Uncle?

323
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,350
Brother.

324
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
My name is Cheng Guoguo.

325
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,510
I'm six years old.

326
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,550
I'm an Aries; my blood type is A,

327
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,110
and I live in Xinyang District.

328
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,640
I like painting and dancing.

329
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,920
I serve as an art commissary in the class.

330
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,150
Xiaobao and I

331
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,230
have fun all the time.

332
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,000
He takes care of me and helps me,

333
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,080
and he can do magic of physics.

334
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,550
I really like playing with him.

335
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,310
Okay.

336
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,960
Now that we're here,

337
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,510
if no one opposes,

338
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,350
we'll make an exchange.

339
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,310
Dr. Qin,

340
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,270
they are just children.

341
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,230
Don't mess around.

342
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,430
Exchange friend cards.

343
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,880
Friend cards?

344
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,550
Now we can exchange hugs!

345
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,390
Xiaobao,

346
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,760
you've done a good job!

347
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,470
Guoguo,

348
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,760
thank you for

349
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
being good friends with Xiaobao.

350
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,600
The little skirt you are wearing today

351
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,880
is so beautiful!

352
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,270
I love it!

353
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,040
From now on,

354
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,920
You can play with toys.

355
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,510
What's going on with them?

356
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,270
To help Xiaobao,

357
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,840
I made a set of friend cards

358
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,510
to encourage him to make friends

359
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,430
in this way.

360
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,720
It was a one-week

361
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,760
challenge of making friends.

362
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,310
Unexpectedly, he succeeded.

363
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,000
By the way,

364
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,680
just now, did Xiaobao

365
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,920
say Guoguo's name?

366
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,510
Yeah.

367
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,000
Now he's

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,470
able to say other names

369
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
except for "Mom"?

370
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,150
When he encounters a special situation,

371
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:53,720
or when he meets

372
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,640
someone he likes,

373
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,470
he can use very simple expressions.

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,470
So far,

375
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,680
The upper limit I've heard is

376
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,510
five words.

377
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Then why do we

378
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,760
still need to use cards

379
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,640
or a wordpad?

380
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,270
That means you should keep going.

381
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,470
After my departure,

382
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,720
he'll only rely on you.

383
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,510
Come on, "Daddy"!

384
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,350
All right, I'm leaving.

385
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Let me give you a drive.

386
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,190
No, thanks.

387
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,600
I'll find another time

388
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,960
to come back and pack up.

389
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,150
You're really serious about it.

390
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,230
Our contract

391
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,640
is originally temporary.

392
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,880
No matter when the contract is signed,

393
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,230
all of them will be terminated eventually.

394
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,000
Even if it's terminated,

395
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,470
we can still

396
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,840
sign a new one.

397
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,390
The workload and working hours

398
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,550
depend on your needs.

399
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,640
In addition,

400
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,840
welfare and salaries can be doubled.

401
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,760
Contract termination

402
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,150
has nothing to do with money,

403
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,190
but my career plan.

404
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,350
Fine.

405
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:06,960
If you have a

406
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,310
higher career pursuit,

407
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,310
I can arrange a

408
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,550
specialized scientific research laboratory,

409
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:12,390
and the best commissioners.

410
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,960
You can do any research you want.

411
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Thank you,

412
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,510
but that's not what I really need.

413
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,150
You should find a chance

414
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,430
to explain it to Xiaobao.

415
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,720
I should have ended

416
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,310
this ridiculous experience as well

417
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,000
to start my own life.

418
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,150
Do you think this period of time

419
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,270
is ridiculous?

420
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,080
Don't distort what I mean.

421
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,190
In a few days,

422
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,550
Xiaobao' school

423
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,680
will hold a Parent-Child Day.

424
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,470
I'll accompany him

425
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,720
to take part in the activity.

426
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,390
After this,

427
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,230
our contract

428
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,350
is completely terminated.

429
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,600
Here you are.

430
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,080
OK.

431
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,840
You can leave now.

432
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,680
Sorry to trouble you to accommodate Qiaoyan

433
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,510
in the restaurant near Heshi Group.

434
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,920
I do apologize for your inconvenience.

435
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,190
It's OK.

436
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,760
I know Qiaoyan is busy.

437
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,720
Young people

438
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,310
should focus on the career.

439
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,510
Heshi Group owes Qiaoyan its prosperity in previous years.

440
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,190
Heshi is really

441
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,270
striding forward year by year.

442
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,550
Xiaowei is excellent, too.

443
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,150
Young as she is,

444
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,840
she's a famous designer already.

445
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,960
It's just her hobby,

446
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,080
but also her part-time job.

447
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,310
In the future,

448
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,310
she will eventually focus on the family business.

449
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,190
Aunt, Mrs. Lin

450
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,920
There will be a meeting later.

451
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,800
I need to go first.

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,510
Enjoy yourselves.

453
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,350
Wait a minute.

454
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,880
We haven't mentioned the most important thing.

455
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,600
Qiaoyan,

456
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,040
Both you and Xiaowei are not kids anymore,

457
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,510
so it's time to discuss

458
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,840
the time to get married.

459
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,110
Get married?

460
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,960
Qiaoyan, we all know that

461
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,110
you've always wanted to

462
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,600
run the business of Heshi well at first,

463
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,510
but marrying Xiaowei

464
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,920
won't affect your plan.

465
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,190
It will help you, instead.

466
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,760
Xiaowei is such a diligent girl.

467
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,510
Aunt, you must be very clear that

468
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,310
I won't marry for family's benefits.

469
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,430
Qiaoyan, you are very smart.

470
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,680
You should know that

471
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,310
the marriage between Lin and He

472
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,230
means a lot

473
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,230
to Heshi Group.

474
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,390
Of course I know,

475
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,600
but I won't sacrifice myself

476
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,190
for the business.

477
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,840
Excuse me.

478
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,000
Excuse me for a minute.

479
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,600
As for Dr. Qin's personal information,

480
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,150
I looked through it again.

481
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,000
Anything special?

482
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,760
We looked up Qin Yiyue's

483
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
all experiences from born till now

484
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
and her social relations.

485
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,960
She was born in a working-class family.

486
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,760
From childhood till now, she is obedient and excellent.

487
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,110
However, there's only one doubt

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,800
in her experience.

489
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,960
When Qin Yiyue was in the university,

490
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,110
she wanted to be a surgeon.

491
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,760
But then,

492
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,110
she abruptly changed her major to psychology.

493
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,350
Why?

494
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,270
According to her teacher,

495
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,040
it's because Qin Yiyue

496
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,600
saved a child

497
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,920
in a car accident,

498
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,470
and got her hands injured.

499
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,640
A car accident?

500
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,190
When?

501
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,550
On the same day as Xiaobao's car accident.

502
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Where was it?

503
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,040
It was probably on Huanshan Street.

504
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,640
Xiaobao's car accident

505
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
also occurred on Huanshan Street.

506
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,640
Qin Yiyue

507
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,390
might be that person.

508
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,600
That's why Xiaobao

509
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,510
has a special affection for her.

510
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,720
Does Qin Yiyue

511
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,840
know the truth of the accident?

512
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,150
Mommy.

513
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,190
Your Mommy's not here.

514
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,080
Mommy.

515
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,350
Told you, Mommy's not here.

516
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,080
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

517
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,390
Can't you say something else?

518
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,920
Xiaobao!

519
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,640
Mommy!

520
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,150
Xiaobao!

521
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:46,000
Xiaobao, Mommy comes here today

522
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,960
to prepare for

523
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,000
the show with you

524
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,150
on the Parent-Child Day.

525
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,600
So,

526
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,350
do you have any show

527
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,550
you want to share with your classmates

528
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,430
and your teachers?

529
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
I came here to help Xiaobao

530
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,000
prepare for the performance

531
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,920
on the Parent-Child Day.

532
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,350
I...

533
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,230
I know you're busy,

534
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,390
don't worry.

535
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,550
When I rehearse with Xiaobao,

536
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,880
I'll give you a simple role.

537
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,800
Just practice before the performance.

538
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,550
♪ Blows the wind, shines the moon ♪

539
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,720
♪ Where is the boat floating to ♪

540
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:40,640
♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

541
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,720
♪ Blows the wind, shines the moon ♪

542
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,880

00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,800
♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

544
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,110
Secretary Zhong

545
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,110
Mr. Jia asked me tomorrow

546
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,840
to talk about the bracelet face to face.

547
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,680
Well,

548
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,550
you send

549
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,000
all materials about the bracelet to me.

550
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,080
All of them.

551
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,960
Your improvement solution

552
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,230
will be further discussed with my colleagues

553
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,150
in the R&D Department.

554
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,080
Though it's sort of difficult to change,

555
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,270
it's not impossible anyway.

556
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
Excellent!

557
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,720
As soon as your samples are produced,

558
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,270
we can sign the contract right away.

559
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,760
I'm looking forward to your good news.

560
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,720
No problem.

561
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,110
Well then, I'll go now.

562
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,960
There are other arrangements.

563
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,720
Mr. Jia, wait a minute.

564
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,310
Is it convenient for me to ask

565
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,600
what makes you

566
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
change your mind?

567
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,150
Well, I didn't change my mind all of a sudden.

568
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,080
Actually, I've always been

569
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,880
very interested in your bracelets.

570
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,080
But last time...

571
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,840
Last time...

572
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,000
Last time, Yiyue

573
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,840
didn't mean it.

574
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,800
No, no, no, you misunderstood me.

575
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,640
Refusing to cooperate with you last time

576
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,270
had nothing to do

577
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,430
with Miss Qin.

578
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,800
It was you and Miss Lin

579
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,600
who never ceased talking about

580
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,800
data this, data that.

581
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,150
In the end, I just couldn't stand it.

582
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,680
Maybe,

583
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,840
you don't know much about me.

584
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,510
In the business,

585
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,230
what I value most

586
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,920
is the usage experience of products,

587
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,080
instead of

588
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,550
something like data.

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,880
Mr. Jia, you are right.

590
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,470
Now it's because...

591
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,000
Today,

592
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,390
I'm able to be here to see you

593
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,960
because of Miss Qin.

594
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,880
The day before yesterday,

595
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,190
Miss Qin managed to find me.

596
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,470
It was her who convinced me.

597
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:16,840
Dressed like this,

598
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,880
how can you go back by yourself?

599
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,760
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

600
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,190
If today

601
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,600
any other accident happens,

602
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,680
how can you deal with it, Yiyue?

603
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:32,960
Xiaobao,

604
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,920
I've recorded the song

605
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,550
in it in advance.

606
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,310
You can

607
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,680
just listen to the song in it.

608
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,960
Get familiar with it.

609
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,080
Tomorrow, Mommy

610
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,680
can't practice with you,

611
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,230
because I'm going to the villa in advance

612
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,350
with Brother Ning Fang

613
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,470
to set up the venue.

614
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,110
Take it.

615
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,960
Yiyue.

616
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,310
Ning Fang, you are here.

617
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
Xiaobao!

618
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,840
Ning–Fang.

619
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,110
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

620
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,430
Brother.

621
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:05,760
Good boy.

622
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,800
Give me a hug.

623
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,190
Look at the present I prepared for you.

624
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,960
Do you like it?

625
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,550
Take it.

626
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,600
Go and play.

627
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,230
Packed up your luggage?

628
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,080
Not yet.

629
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,840
I'll think about it later.

630
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,150
Can't let it go?

631
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,150
I just can't let go Xiaobao.

632
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,110
Where's my phone?

633
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,760
It's on this Sunday.

634
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,470
Do you still remember the concert

635
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,150
we missed when we were in college?

636
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,270
I'll make it up to you.

637
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,190
Lin, are you busy?

638
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,150
Do me a favor.

639
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,510
Is there any other way to buy tickets

640
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,550
for Xie Ming's concert?

641
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,150
Cindy,

642
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,960
is it possible to get me two

643
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,150
VIP tickets for Xie Ming's concert?

644
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,550
♪ Blows the wind, shines the moon ♪

645
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,719
♪ Where is the boat floating to ♪

646
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,639
♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

647
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Ning Fang, you are here.

648
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:21,510
Xiaobao!

649
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,110
Ning–Fang.

650
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,960
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

651
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,270
Brother.

652
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,230
I forgot to take my phone.

653
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,310
Did you see that?

654
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,000
Look for it.

655
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,600
Can't let it go?

656
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,389
I just can't let go Xiaobao.

657
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,550
Don't be so sad.

658
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,270
You like He Qiaoyan,

659
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,270
which should be a wonderful thing.

660
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,270
Even if you ended up

661
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,150
with separation,

662
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,150
you've also gained happiness in the process.

663
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:54,190
That's enough.

664
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,430
You're right.

665
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,110
Process is more important than result.

666
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,720
Let's go.
