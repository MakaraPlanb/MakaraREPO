Unforgettable Love
EP16

2
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,150
Go.

3
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Hurry up!

5
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,590
How dare you take pictures!

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,080
-Mr. Jia.  -Mr. Jia.

7
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,670
Yiyue, let him go.

8
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,190
What are you doing?

9
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,360
This way, please.

10
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:05,190
Mr. Jia refused to cooperate with Heshi Group.

11
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,790
The cooperation with Mr. Jia

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,110
is a crucial step to

13
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,520
the promotion of bracelets.

14
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,150
For this cooperation,

15
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,150
He Qiaoyan has been busy

16
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,400
for over half a month.

17
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,880
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
I never expected

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,630
it would happen.

20
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,110
We had had an appointment with Mr. Jia

21
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,750
at 10 a.m. last Monday,

22
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,440
but because Qiaoyan was concerned about

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,590
your father's surgery,

24
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,310
the meeting was cancelled.

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,440
Then, Qiaoyan

26
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,750
made lots of efforts to persuade Mr. Jia

27
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,230
to give us

28
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,630
another chance to meet.

29
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,790
But again, you...

30
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
Qin Yiyue

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,590
Don't you think

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,670
you've always been giving Qiaoyan

33
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,840
a lot of trouble?

34
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,230
I know you're not a real couple,

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,110
but merely a contractual one.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,630
How did you know?

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,670
Never mind how I knew it.

38
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,440
I had wanted to give you

39
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,960
more time to disguise,

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,310
but right now, you've

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,270
severely affected Qiaoyan's work.

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,270
I just can't ignore it.

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,400
Even if we're in a contractual relationship,

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,110
that's our business.

45
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,000
Stop deceiving yourself.

46
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,400
You clearly know

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,920
my relationship with Qiaoyan.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,670
We have an engagement.

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,920
He has told me,

50
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,920
that your baby engagement

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,230
is just a joke.

52
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,880
It's our two families' business.

53
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,630
Whether a joke or not

54
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,520
can't be defined by He Qiaoyan.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,880
Besides, for Qiaoyan, Heshi Group

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,190
is more important than anything.

57
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Do you think

58
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,920
you can compete with the whole He family?

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,079
Besides, I can help Qiaoyan

60
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,230
to run Heshi Group.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Can you do it?

62
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,110
Keep it real,

63
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,480
you are from totally different classes.

64
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,750
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,589
All right, I'll drive you home.

66
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,230
No, thanks.

67
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,190
I can go back by myself.

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,840
Dressed like this,

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
how can you go back by yourself?

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,790
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,440
Dress like this at night,

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,710
what's going on in your mind?

73
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,790
Let me drive her back.

74
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,400
You came here with him?

75
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,400
I'll take her home.

76
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,310
Let's go, Yiyue.

77
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,040
I'll go now.

78
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,790
What happened?

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,110
I want to drink.

80
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Had a quarrel?

81
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,840
No.

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,230
It's just...

83
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,590
I did something wrong.

84
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,920
If you do, just apologize.

85
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,920
If you don't apologize,

86
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,310
nothing will be solved.

87
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,480
Ning Fang,

88
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,880
Do you know that feeling?

89
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,520
It's like,

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,150
the God

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,590
suddenly knocks my head,

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,560
to let me realize

93
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,190
the good merit I thought I had

94
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,000
is nothing but a fake.

95
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,590
It's taken back at twelve o'clock

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,880
to its original owner.

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,840
You little fool, you are the best.

98
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
No one can take it away.

99
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not pretty nor good.

100
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
I can only affect his work,

101
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,440
and hold him back.

102
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,080
I...

103
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,270
What are they doing here?

104
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,590
My brother must

105
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,150
be cheated, isn't he?

106
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
I must tell him now.

107
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
Bro, what's the matter with you?

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,790
How can you allow sister-in-law

109
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,150
to drink with another man?

110
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,080
She drank?

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,480
You've offended her, haven't you?

112
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,400
Where is she?

113
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,590
Inside.

114
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,440
Why are you here?

115
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,590
Isn't it time for you to go?

116
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,920
Ning Fang

117
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,960
No matter what happens,

118
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,920
I'll make it clear.

119
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,270
Wait for me outside.

120
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
You must be Dr. Ning Fang, right?

121
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,590
I've heard of you from Ruowei.

122
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,480
Go, go, go.

123
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,880
I haven't

124
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,150
formally introduced myself.

125
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,190
I'm Wen Gu.

126
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,150
Ruowei's boss.

127
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,110
Go home.

128
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,720
Go home?

129
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,679
Go home with me.

130
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,880
Back to our home.

131
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,430
Qiaoyan, where are you?

132
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,960
Since it doesn't work with Mr. Jia,

133
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
We have to quickly propose

134
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,040
Plan B.

135
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,640
OK, I see.

136
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,720
Don't be silly,

137
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,230
I'll take you home first.

138
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
There's another meeting in the evening.

139
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,960
He Qiaoyan,

140
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
I have no reason

141
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,000
to stand by your side.

142
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,550
What do you mean?

143
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
Let's

144
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,270
terminate the contract.

145
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,600
Terminate the contract?

146
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,720
Why do you want to do that?

147
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,310
The validity of our contract

148
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,110
is one year.

149
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,880
There's still much time left.

150
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,230
Xiaobao, he...

151
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,960
he's been able to go to school without crying.

152
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,230
His language ability

153
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,640
is also recovering.

154
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,720
He no longer needs

155
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,040
my whole companion.

156
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,760
I want to devote more energy and time

157
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
to my own career.

158
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
And,

159
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,110
I don't want to

160
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,470
affect your work any more.

161
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,040
I think what you need to do

162
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,390
is to calm down.

163
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,110
I'll give you two weeks,

164
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,720
two-week paid vacation.

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,800
It's me,

166
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,110
who cannot uphold the principle

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,310
to be a fake couple with you.

168
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,510
A fake couple?

169
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,800
I'll give my last word:

170
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,150
go home with me.

171
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,510
I've told you, terminate the contract.

172
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,840
You didn't ask me to stay at all...

173
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,760
Sit down.

174
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,310
What on earth can't I let it go?

175
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,510
Do you mean

176
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,840
I can't let go the mansion

177
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
or limousine?

178
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,550
I'm not superficial, OK?

179
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,800
Am I that kind of superficial person?

180
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,430
Let me tell you,

181
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,000
what I can't let go is Xiaobao.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,600
Xiaobao and I

183
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,150
are good mates forever.

184
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,080
What?

185
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,800
Did you say I can't let go He Qiaoyan?

186
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,080
You are the one who can't let him go, OK?

187
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,880
He's as cheap as you.

188
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
I won't even pay a dime

189
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,040
to buy him!

190
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,720
Turn the light off and go to bed!

191
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,080
It's already midnight,

192
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,510
and what are you doing again in my house?

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Well, eat melons.

194
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,840
Eat melons for what?

195
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,390
They contain too much sugar.

196
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:55,680
Not for bedtime.

197
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,310
Come on,

198
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,000
why does sister-in-law burst into temper?

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,080
Is my sister-in-law cheating on you?

200
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,470
Do you think everyone else is like you?

201
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,350
You bastard!

202
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,960
I came here to comfort you,

203
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,640
but you,

204
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,350
do nothing but attack me.

205
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,270
Or because of Lin Wei.

206
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,510
It has nothing to do with Lin Wei.

207
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,920
You and Lin Wei

208
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,350
once had a baby engagement.

209
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,150
About that,

210
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,600
I've explained it to Yiyue.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
I've told her

212
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,470
those were just nonsense from elders,

213
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,640
so don't take it seriously.

214
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm so relieved.

215
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,310
Relieved? Why?

216
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,150
Neither sister-in-law nor you cheated.

217
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,190
What's left

218
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,080
is not a big deal.

219
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,470
Women, women.

220
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,470
Find out the cause, and remedy the problem.

221
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,600
It's so easy to ease women.

222
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,920
Yue, what's going on?

223
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,760
Haven't I told you to declare sovereignty?

224
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,510
How come it was flipped around?

225
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,080
Good news doesn't come,

226
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,800
bad news has wings.

227
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,150
He Qiaoyan also agreed with it?

228
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,270
Maybe he also realized it.

229
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,510
Since Lin Wei came back,

230
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,190
I

231
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
am becoming unnecessary.

232
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,270
Come on in.

233
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,600
Mr. He,

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,760
this is Pediatric Psychology Consulting Room.

235
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,390
Of course I know.

236
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,430
Tell me,

237
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,080
why do you want to leave?

238
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,110
I've finished my work!

239
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Besides,

240
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,430
for my career,

241
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,000
I have clearer vision and higher pursuit.

242
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,470
I want to do something extraordinary.

243
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,880
OK, I see.

244
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,230
But I hope

245
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
you're not just bragging.

246
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,840
The title of Mrs. He

247
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,080
is no longer what I want.

248
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,350
Pretending to be in love every day

249
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,080
is just driving me crazy!

250
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,760
Anyway, there're so many people who like you,

251
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,230
so I don't want to be regarded as

252
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,720
the one squatting on a toilet...

253
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,190
What did you call me?

254
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,110
A toilet.

255
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,080
Squatting for a long time,

256
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,390
I'll easily numb my legs,

257
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,110
then I'll give it to others in the queue

258
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,110
to use.

259
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,040
Let's put it this way,

260
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,600
I disagree.

261
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,080
Why?

262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,270
The contract is very clear.

263
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,390
Stage three,

264
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,510
Party B should, within the term of the Contract,

265
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,270
help Xiaobao

266
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,600
successfully enter the primary school,

267
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,470
and adapt to social life.

268
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,110
Yes,

269
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,190
I'm doing fine.

270
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,430
Xiaobao is now gradually

271
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,270
adapting to school life,

272
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,760
and he's getting along with kids

273
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,150
without any discomfort.

274
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,040
I think I have

275
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
finished the work successfully.

276
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,350
It seems that Dr. Qin

277
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,230
isn't fully aware of

278
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,000
the definition of social life.

279
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,510
It seems I need to popularize to you

280
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,310
what is social life.

281
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,760
Social life is linked by social relations,

282
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,040
which means to build relationships

283
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,270
with others.

284
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,640
In the field of psychology,

285
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,040
interpersonal relationship

286
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,310
refers to the person-to-person

287
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,550
direct psychological connection.

288
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,720
In terms of that,

289
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,150
Xiaobao haven't done it.

290
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,960
Briefly speaking,

291
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,390
Xiaobao just peacefully

292
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,000
gets into the social environment,

293
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:18,920
but doesn't

294
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,390
let down his defences

295
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,680
to make friends with others.

296
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,040
Mr. He,

297
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,430
are you talking to a professional

298
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,470
about the professional?

299
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,550
It seems that Dr. Qin

300
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,720
also agrees with me.

301
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,680
I, He Qiaoyan,

302
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,390
never fail in business.

303
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,550
How about that:

304
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,430
as long as you help Xiaobao

305
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,600
to find a friend,

306
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,840
I'll count all your work

307
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,550
done completely.

308
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,190
With contract void and debt cleared,

309
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,310
you'll be free.

310
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,430
What are we doing here?

311
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
Meet parents.

312
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,310
Of course I'm a parent.

313
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,310
I mean,

314
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,109
meet parents for what?

315
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,190
Just meet parents.

316
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,109
What were you thinking about?

317
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,880
Xiaobao,

318
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,150
This is?

319
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,550
Guoguo.

320
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,510
Hello, Guoguo.

321
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,000
Hello, Uncle...

322
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,640
Uncle?

323
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,350
Brother.

324
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,040
My name is Cheng Guoguo.

325
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm six years old.

326
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm an Aries; my blood type is A,

327
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,110
and I live in Xinyang District.

328
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,640
I like painting and dancing.

329
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,920
I serve as an art commissary in the class.

330
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,150
Xiaobao and I

331
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,230
have fun all the time.

332
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,000
He takes care of me and helps me,

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,080
and he can do magic of physics.

334
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,550
I really like playing with him.

335
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,310
Okay.

336
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,960
Now that we're here,

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,510
if no one opposes,

338
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,350
we'll make an exchange.

339
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,310
Dr. Qin,

340
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,270
they are just children.

341
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,230
Don't mess around.

342
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,430
Exchange friend cards.

343
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,880
Friend cards?

344
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:47,550
Now we can exchange hugs!

345
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,390
Xiaobao,

346
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,760
you've done a good job!

347
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,470
Guoguo,

348
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,760
thank you for

349
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
being good friends with Xiaobao.

350
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,600
The little skirt you are wearing today

351
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,880
is so beautiful!

352
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,270
I love it!

353
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,040
From now on,

354
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,920
You can play with toys.

355
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,510
What's going on with them?

356
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,270
To help Xiaobao,

357
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,840
I made a set of friend cards

358
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,510
to encourage him to make friends

359
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,430
in this way.

360
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,720
It was a one-week

361
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
challenge of making friends.

362
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,310
Unexpectedly, he succeeded.

363
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,000
By the way,

364
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,680
just now, did Xiaobao

365
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,920
say Guoguo's name?

366
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,510
Yeah.

367
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,000
Now he's

368
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,470
able to say other names

369
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
except for "Mom"?

370
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,150
When he encounters a special situation,

371
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,720
or when he meets

372
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,640
someone he likes,

373
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,470
he can use very simple expressions.

374
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,470
So far,

375
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,680
The upper limit I've heard is

376
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,510
five words.

377
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Then why do we

378
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,760
still need to use cards

379
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,640
or a wordpad?

380
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,270
That means you should keep going.

381
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,470
After my departure,

382
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,720
he'll only rely on you.

383
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,510
Come on, "Daddy"!

384
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,350
All right, I'm leaving.

385
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
Let me give you a drive.

386
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,190
No, thanks.

387
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,600
I'll find another time

388
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,960
to come back and pack up.

389
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,150
You're really serious about it.

390
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,230
Our contract

391
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,640
is originally temporary.

392
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,880
No matter when the contract is signed,

393
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,230
all of them will be terminated eventually.

394
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Even if it's terminated,

395
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,470
we can still

396
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,840
sign a new one.

397
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,390
The workload and working hours

398
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,550
depend on your needs.

399
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,640
In addition,

400
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
welfare and salaries can be doubled.

401
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,760
Contract termination

402
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,150
has nothing to do with money,

403
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:13,190
but my career plan.

404
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,350
Fine.

405
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:14,960
If you have a

406
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,310
higher career pursuit,

407
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,310
I can arrange a

408
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,550
specialized scientific research laboratory,

409
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,390
and the best commissioners.

410
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,960
You can do any research you want.

411
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Thank you,

412
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,510
but that's not what I really need.

413
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,150
You should find a chance

414
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,430
to explain it to Xiaobao.

415
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,720
I should have ended

416
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,310
this ridiculous experience as well

417
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,000
to start my own life.

418
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,150
Do you think this period of time

419
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,270
is ridiculous?

420
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,080
Don't distort what I mean.

421
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,190
In a few days,

422
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,550
Xiaobao' school

423
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,680
will hold a Parent-Child Day.

424
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,470
I'll accompany him

425
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,720
to take part in the activity.

426
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,390
After this,

427
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,230
our contract

428
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,350
is completely terminated.

429
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,600
Here you are.

430
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,080
OK.

431
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,840
You can leave now.

432
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,680
Sorry to trouble you to accommodate Qiaoyan

433
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,510
in the restaurant near Heshi Group.

434
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,920
I do apologize for your inconvenience.

435
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,190
It's OK.

436
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,760
I know Qiaoyan is busy.

437
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,720
Young people

438
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,310
should focus on the career.

439
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,510
Heshi Group owes Qiaoyan its prosperity in previous years.

440
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,190
Heshi is really

441
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,270
striding forward year by year.

442
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,550
Xiaowei is excellent, too.

443
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,150
Young as she is,

444
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,840
she's a famous designer already.

445
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,960
It's just her hobby,

446
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,080
but also her part-time job.

447
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,310
In the future,

448
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:42,310
she will eventually focus on the family business.

449
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,190
Aunt, Mrs. Lin

450
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,920
There will be a meeting later.

451
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,800
I need to go first.

452
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,510
Enjoy yourselves.

453
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,350
Wait a minute.

454
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,880
We haven't mentioned the most important thing.

455
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,600
Qiaoyan,

456
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,040
Both you and Xiaowei are not kids anymore,

457
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,510
so it's time to discuss

458
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,840
the time to get married.

459
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,110
Get married?

460
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,960
Qiaoyan, we all know that

461
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,110
you've always wanted to

462
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,600
run the business of Heshi well at first,

463
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,510
but marrying Xiaowei

464
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
won't affect your plan.

465
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,190
It will help you, instead.

466
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,760
Xiaowei is such a diligent girl.

467
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,510
Aunt, you must be very clear that

468
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,310
I won't marry for family's benefits.

469
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:26,430
Qiaoyan, you are very smart.

470
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,680
You should know that

471
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,310
the marriage between Lin and He

472
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,230
means a lot

473
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,230
to Heshi Group.

474
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,390
Of course I know,

475
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,600
but I won't sacrifice myself

476
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,190
for the business.

477
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,840
Excuse me.

478
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,000
Excuse me for a minute.

479
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,600
As for Dr. Qin's personal information,

480
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,150
I looked through it again.

481
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,000
Anything special?

482
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,760
We looked up Qin Yiyue's

483
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
all experiences from born till now

484
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
and her social relations.

485
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,960
She was born in a working-class family.

486
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,760
From childhood till now, she is obedient and excellent.

487
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,110
However, there's only one doubt

488
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
in her experience.

489
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,960
When Qin Yiyue was in the university,

490
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,110
she wanted to be a surgeon.

491
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,760
But then,

492
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,110
she abruptly changed her major to psychology.

493
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,350
Why?

494
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,270
According to her teacher,

495
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,040
it's because Qin Yiyue

496
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,600
saved a child

497
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,920
in a car accident,

498
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,470
and got her hands injured.

499
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
A car accident?

500
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,190
When?

501
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,550
On the same day as Xiaobao's car accident.

502
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Where was it?

503
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,040
It was probably on Huanshan Street.

504
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,640
Xiaobao's car accident

505
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
also occurred on Huanshan Street.

506
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,640
Qin Yiyue

507
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,390
might be that person.

508
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,600
That's why Xiaobao

509
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,510
has a special affection for her.

510
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,720
Does Qin Yiyue

511
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,840
know the truth of the accident?

512
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,150
Mommy.

513
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,190
Your Mommy's not here.

514
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,080
Mommy.

515
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,350
Told you, Mommy's not here.

516
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,080
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

517
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,390
Can't you say something else?

518
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:41,920
Xiaobao!

519
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,640
Mommy!

520
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,150
Xiaobao!

521
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:54,000
Xiaobao, Mommy comes here today

522
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,960
to prepare for

523
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
the show with you

524
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,150
on the Parent-Child Day.

525
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,600
So,

526
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,350
do you have any show

527
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,550
you want to share with your classmates

528
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,430
and your teachers?

529
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,920
I came here to help Xiaobao

530
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,000
prepare for the performance

531
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,920
on the Parent-Child Day.

532
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,350
I...

533
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,230
I know you're busy,

534
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,390
don't worry.

535
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,550
When I rehearse with Xiaobao,

536
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,880
I'll give you a simple role.

537
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,800
Just practice before the performance.

538
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,550
♪ Blows the wind, shines the moon ♪

539
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,720
♪ Where is the boat floating to ♪

540
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:48,640
♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

541
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,720

00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,880

♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

544
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,110
Secretary Zhong

545
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,110
Mr. Jia asked me tomorrow

546
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,840
to talk about the bracelet face to face.

547
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,680
Well,

548
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,550
you send

549
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,000
all materials about the bracelet to me.

550
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,080
All of them.

551
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Your improvement solution

552
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,230
will be further discussed with my colleagues

553
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,150
in the R&D Department.

554
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,080
Though it's sort of difficult to change,

555
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,270
it's not impossible anyway.

556
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
Excellent!

557
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,720
As soon as your samples are produced,

558
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,270
we can sign the contract right away.

559
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,760
I'm looking forward to your good news.

560
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,720
No problem.

561
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,110
Well then, I'll go now.

562
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:20,960
There are other arrangements.

563
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,720
Mr. Jia, wait a minute.

564
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,310
Is it convenient for me to ask

565
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,600
what makes you

566
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
change your mind?

567
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,150
Well, I didn't change my mind all of a sudden.

568
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,080
Actually, I've always been

569
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,880
very interested in your bracelets.

570
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,080
But last time...

571
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,840
Last time...

572
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Last time, Yiyue

573
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,840
didn't mean it.

574
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,800
No, no, no, you misunderstood me.

575
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,640
Refusing to cooperate with you last time

576
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,270
had nothing to do

577
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,430
with Miss Qin.

578
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,800
It was you and Miss Lin

579
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,600
who never ceased talking about

580
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,800
data this, data that.

581
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,150
In the end, I just couldn't stand it.

582
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,680
Maybe,

583
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,840
you don't know much about me.

584
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,510
In the business,

585
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,230
what I value most

586
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,920
is the usage experience of products,

587
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,080
instead of

588
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,550
something like data.

589
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,880
Mr. Jia, you are right.

590
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,470
Now it's because...

591
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,000
Today,

592
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,390
I'm able to be here to see you

593
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,960
because of Miss Qin.

594
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,880
The day before yesterday,

595
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,190
Miss Qin managed to find me.

596
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,470
It was her who convinced me.

597
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,840
Dressed like this,

598
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,880
how can you go back by yourself?

599
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,760
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

600
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,190
If today

601
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,600
any other accident happens,

602
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,680
how can you deal with it, Yiyue?

603
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:40,960
Xiaobao,

604
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,920
I've recorded the song

605
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,550
in it in advance.

606
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,310
You can

607
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,680
just listen to the song in it.

608
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,960
Get familiar with it.

609
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,080
Tomorrow, Mommy

610
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,680
can't practice with you,

611
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,230
because I'm going to the villa in advance

612
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,350
with Brother Ning Fang

613
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,470
to set up the venue.

614
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,110
Take it.

615
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,960
Yiyue.

616
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,310
Ning Fang, you are here.

617
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,040
Xiaobao!

618
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,840
Ning–Fang.

619
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,110
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

620
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,430
Brother.

621
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,760
Good boy.

622
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,800
Give me a hug.

623
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,190
Look at the present I prepared for you.

624
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:20,960
Do you like it?

625
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,550
Take it.

626
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,600
Go and play.

627
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,230
Packed up your luggage?

628
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,080
Not yet.

629
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,840
I'll think about it later.

630
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,150
Can't let it go?

631
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,150
I just can't let go Xiaobao.

632
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,110
Where's my phone?

633
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,760
It's on this Sunday.

634
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,470
Do you still remember the concert

635
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,150
we missed when we were in college?

636
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,270
I'll make it up to you.

637
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,190
Lin, are you busy?

638
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,150
Do me a favor.

639
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,510
Is there any other way to buy tickets

640
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,550
for Xie Ming's concert?

641
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,150
Cindy,

642
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,960
is it possible to get me two

643
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,150
VIP tickets for Xie Ming's concert?

644
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,550
♪ Blows the wind, shines the moon ♪

645
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,719
♪ Where is the boat floating to ♪

646
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:23,639
♪ Take the long journey with me ♪

647
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,800
Ning Fang, you are here.

648
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,510
Xiaobao!

649
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,110
Ning–Fang.

650
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,960
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

651
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,270
Brother.

652
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,230
I forgot to take my phone.

653
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,310
Did you see that?

654
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,000
Look for it.

655
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,600
Can't let it go?

656
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,389
I just can't let go Xiaobao.

657
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,550
Don't be so sad.

658
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,270
You like He Qiaoyan,

659
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,270
which should be a wonderful thing.

660
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,270
Even if you ended up

661
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,150
with separation,

662
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,150
you've also gained happiness in the process.

663
00:35:01,389 --> 00:35:02,190
That's enough.

664
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,430
You're right.

665
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,110
Process is more important than result.

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
Let's go.
