Unforgettable Love
EP15

2
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,039
I...

3
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,000
Dad

4
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,440
what are you going to say?

5
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,590
I finally...

6
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,789
Lao Qin, shut up.

7
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,590
I won't allow you to say that.

8
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,150
Before I leave...

9
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,789
Don't you say that.

10
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,670
I'm just talking about the card before I left.

11
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,560
Lao Li lost his 20 yuan to me when playing cards.

12
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Has the money transferred to my WeChat account?

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,229
You old fool,

14
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,190
you're still thinking about playing cards.

15
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:44,710
Well, you two

16
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,560
remember that for me.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,229
I am a little bit hungry.

18
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,630
Dad, I made wonton.

19
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,479
It's still hot.

20
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,190
I'll get it for you.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,840
No, No.

22
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,000
I'd better not eat it.

23
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,630
In case

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,560
I can't make it to the surgery

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,840
and die before that.

26
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,590
If so, I'm wasting the wonton.

27
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,270
There you go again.

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,750
Dad, it's not time

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,150
to make a joke like that.

30
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,190
Well, no wonton.

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,110
I'll make you a bowl of millet porridge.

32
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,560
OK.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,670
Duh...

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,880
I...

35
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,400
I want to eat the wonton you made for me.

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,440
All these years

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,150
I haven't eaten

38
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,670
any food my daughter cooked for me.

39
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,270
Dad

40
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,079
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,400
I didn't take good care of you.

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,270
I shouldn't have said something like that.

43
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,230
Dad

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,150
what are you looking for?

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,079
In this ward

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,920
there's no monitor and recorder, right?

47
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,150
Monitor and recorder?

48
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,750
Right.

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,670
What do you want?

50
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,360
Come here, daughter.

51
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,480
The password

52
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,190
is your mother's birthday, the other way around.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,080
What do you mean by that?

54
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,750
Take it.

55
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,150
Here's the money

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,480
you sent to me.

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,520
I didn't waste it.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,150
Every remittance

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,670
I have saved for you.

60
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,110
And

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,440
wages in former company

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
my pension

63
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,190
is this number.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,750
That's all.

65
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,560
Daughter

66
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,480
you got married

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,790
without a formal wedding ceremony

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,110
and even dowry

69
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,560
I didn't prepare for you.

70
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,960
In such a time

71
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,880
heart surgery is no small thing.

72
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,670
Even if I am optimistic enough

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,790
I should be responsible for you and your mom

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,360
and leave these matters to you.

75
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,670
Dad, don't talk about that.

76
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
Keep this money for yourself.

77
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,110
No no no

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
It should always be

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,710
dad taking care of his daughter.

80
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,230
You know?

81
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,790
I don't want you to grow up.

82
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,150
If anyone is to blame

83
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,230
it's dad's getting old so fast

84
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,440
that troubles my daughter.

85
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,960
Dad

86
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,840
I'll depend on you.

87
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,960
I'll depend on you all my life.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,590
OK, pinkie promise.

89
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,270
Pinkie promise.

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,590
By the way

91
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
Lao Li's 20 yuan...

92
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,190
I got it!

93
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Don't forget it.

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I won't.

95
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,230
Okay, okay.

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,840
It's been more than three hours.

97
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,920
It will be OK.

98
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,360
Mom, Yiyue.

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,230
You are here, Qiaoyan.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
He's been in for hours

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,590
and hasn't come out yet.

102
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,750
Mom

103
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,590
the operation has certain risks

104
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,520
however

105
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,040
I analyzed

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,400
all the surgical data.

107
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,230
The success rate is not low.

108
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,670
The surgeon, Doctor Xu

109
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,440
is a cardiologist

110
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,710
from GMN Medical Center.

111
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,080
The success rate of his operation

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
is up to 97.8 percent.

113
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
Short term complications

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,790
and local recurrence rate

115
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,520
are also very low.

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
He's the golden hand in heart surgery.

117
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,960
Apart from him

118
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,150
his three assistants

119
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,270
and the anesthesiologist

120
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,150
all followed him

121
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,560
for more than ten years and formed a fixed team.

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,190
That would be great.

123
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,750
I will not worry about it.

124
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,960
Just rest assured, Mom.

125
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,190
The operation will take a while.

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,880
You two can take a break for a minute.

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,150
If you still don't feel at ease

128
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,230
just take a look at

129
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,560
the real time data feedback of the operation.

130
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
I've arranged another group of

131
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,630
other experts

132
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,520
to monitor the data at the same time.

133
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,000
Two groups of personnel for double guarantee.

134
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,230
You can rest assured.

135
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,560
These...

136
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,150
Did you do these overnight?

137
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,400
That's what I should do.

138
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,630
Xiaobao is also very worried about you.

139
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't worry.

140
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,520
We're in this together.

141
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,110
Thank you.

142
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,630
Dad.

143
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,040
How's it going, Dr. Xu?

144
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,110
The surgery was a success.

145
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,710
Thank you.

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Thank you.

147
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Let's go.

149
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,230
Chicken feet.

150
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
It smells good.

151
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,840
You pervert!

152
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,720
I...

153
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,310
Dad

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,920
you woke up.

155
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,430
How do you feel?

156
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,190
It hurts.

157
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,000
Straighten your finger.

158
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,840
In the contract

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,920
when can I add

160
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,040
the protection of my personal safety?

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,390
Never.

162
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,960
You are here, aunt.

163
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Qiaoyan

164
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,880
Xiaowei has told me everything

165
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,760
and I've reminded you, too.

166
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,880
At this moment, nothing

167
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
nobody

168
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,960
can stand in Heshi's way.

169
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,720
Look at you

170
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,190
let a stranger's illness

171
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,640
affect your work.

172
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
He is no stranger.

173
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,800
He's my father-in-law.

174
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,110
It can be arranged with a phone call.

175
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,000
Why are you wasting your time?

176
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,230
Aunt

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,960
perhaps family's company

178
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,230
is also important.

179
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,310
Don't worry.

180
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,880
I'll take care of

181
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,840
things at work.

182
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,550
Take me to the ward.

183
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,510
This way.

184
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,760
Dad, mom.

185
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Aunt.

186
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,960
This is...

187
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,040
Mom

188
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,350
this is Qiaoyan's aunt.

189
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,190
In-law.

190
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,310
You are very kind

191
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,040
to take time out of busy schedule

192
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,190
to visit Lao Qin.

193
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,840
Sit down. Sit down.

194
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,680
Aunt, leave it to me. Please have a seat.

195
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
Have a seat.

196
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,640
Sit down, aunt.

197
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,800
Would you like some fruit?

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm good, thank you.

199
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,550
A glass of water then.

200
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,000
Yueyue, get a glass of water.

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Don't bother.

202
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,510
Lao Qin

203
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,150
you don't know

204
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,510
how much your son-in-law

205
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,390
helped this time.

206
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,390
Otherwise, Yueyue and I

207
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,600
don't know what to do.

208
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,640
Qiaoyan is a good son-in-law.

209
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,190
Mom and dad, look what you said.

210
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,150
It's what I should do.

211
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,430
In-law

212
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,470
your family genes

213
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,040
are really good.

214
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,230
When I first met Qiaoyan

215
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,080
I wondered how could there be

216
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,680
such a handsome boy.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,960
And today I saw you

218
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,430
what a beauty.

219
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,510
In the future

220
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,510
if Qiaoyan and Yueyue

221
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,430
have a baby

222
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,390
how pretty it will be, right?

223
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,430
Mom

224
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,430
Yeah

225
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,000
So many people.

226
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,190
Hello, uncle and aunt.

227
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,600
Auntie, you're here, too

228
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,040
Mom and dad

229
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,720
This is my best friend

230
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,510
Wen Gu

231
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,390
The boy is very polite

232
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,920
to come such a long way.

233
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,920
It's what I should do.

234
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,760
Mr. He.

235
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,270
I've got what you want.

236
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,800
Mom and dad, there's something at work

237
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,840
I need to deal with.

238
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,040
I have to go.

239
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,840
Just go.

240
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,150
We are here.

241
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,230
Yes, just go.

242
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,150
Mom and dad have me here.

243
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,800
I mean I can take care of them.

244
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,600
Go ahead.

245
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,190
Call me if you have any questions.

246
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,190
Aunt, let's go.

247
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,760
Have a good rest.

248
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,190
Take your time.

249
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,150
Take your time.

250
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,880
Take your time.

251
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,640
Look at you

252
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,680
you haven't cleaned your mouth yet.

253
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,470
Do you want any more?

254
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,270
want it or not?

255
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,270
What else to eat?

256
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,190
This

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,080
Why Xiaobao

258
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,350
suddenly got so close

259
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,190
with a stranger?

260
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,960
Maybe because Yiyue

261
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,350
has engaged in children's psychological work for years.

262
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,920
She has

263
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,350
the qualities that attract children.

264
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,680
I used to think

265
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Xiaobao has child's nature

266
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,270
to like someone

267
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,880
all of a sudden.

268
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,960
But today When I saw Xiaobao

269
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
I suddenly wondered

270
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,470
was it really that simple?

271
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,390
You mean

272
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,190
Yiyue approaches Xiaobao intentionally.

273
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
This is absolutely impossible.

274
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
Thank you

275
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
for coming to see my father.

276
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,230
You are very welcome.

277
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
I have to go.

278
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,310
Wait

279
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,150
There's one thing

280
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,230
I want to ask you.

281
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,470
What is it?

282
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,600
I used to see pictures of a girl

283
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,680
from the back

284
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,270
at your brother's place.

285
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,720
I thought it was Miss Lin

286
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,510
but now it seems not.

287
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,550
Of course not.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
Who is that?

289
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,390
Well...

290
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,310
I'm not sure if I can tell you.

291
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,600
Fine

292
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,920
I'll change the question.

293
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,150
Who do you think

294
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,270
is the person knows Ruowei best

295
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,760
in the world?

296
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,350
Not a big deal.

297
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,040
What do you want to know?

298
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,550
I will definitely tell the truth.

299
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,270
Smart.

300
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
You know me.

301
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,270
I'll sell my best friend

302
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,270
without reservation.

303
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,230
If you have any questions in the future

304
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,230
just come to me.

305
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
Settled.

306
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,720
Can you tell me now?

307
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,470
My brother has been dreaming of

308
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,430
a girl's back

309
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,680
in recent years.

310
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
He just wanted to find out

311
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,840
the girl in the dream.

312
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,190
But don't worry

313
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,430
I think

314
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,190
that girl doesn't exist.

315
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,110
The girl in his dream?

316
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,080
That means

317
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
this girl doesn't exist at all?

318
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
Certainly not.

319
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,190
I must go.

320
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,470
You secretly

321
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,110
call up the information of Qin Yiyue.

322
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,760
The Information of Mrs. He

323
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,680
you've seen it all before.

324
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,680
It's different this time.

325
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I want to know

326
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,800
her relationship with Xiaobao.

327
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,720
I don't believe

328
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,110
there's such a coincidence in the world.

329
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,430
I'll do it.

330
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,720
Hello.

331
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,080
Qiaoyan.

332
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,190
Mom.

333
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,470
Why is it so noisy over there?

334
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,390
Are you done with work?

335
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,349
I've just finished.

336
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:18,310
What's the matter?

337
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,920
Come to the hospital.

338
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,230
The hospital?

339
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
Is anything wrong?

340
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,230
You have a long journey.

341
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,470
It's fine.

342
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,550
This little girl is really beautiful.

343
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,390
I remembered she was just a kid.

344
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,000
She's grown up

345
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,720
You're right

346
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,310
it's the right room.

347
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
A friendly Reminder

348
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,230
you can't run now even if you want to.

349
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,840
Nine times out of ten

350
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,720
they came for you.

351
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,680
This group of relatives and friends gathering together

352
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,150
is not easy.

353
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,720
Yes.

354
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,510
How are you, aunts and uncles?

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's a long way to come

356
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,960
to see my dad.

357
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,510
Have some fruit.

358
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,640
It's what we should do.

359
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,080
Yueyue has grown up, too.

360
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,350
You're so beautiful, Yueyue.

361
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,190
Hello everyone.

362
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,230
How handsome.

363
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,040
Close-up real picture.

364
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,040
Don't be rude.

365
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,800
Brother Qiaoyan, let's take a selfie.

366
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,150
This is my daughter, a medical student.

367
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,760
It's because

368
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,430
she's worshiped Yueyue since she was a child.

369
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,150
She just graduated this year.

370
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,760
Mr. He

371
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,000
is there any vacancy in medical technology

372
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,150
in your company?

373
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,550
What is her subject?

374
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,110
Veterinary medicine, mainly focus on horses.

375
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,310
Maybe my company is not suitable.

376
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,350
Academy of Agricultural Sciences

377
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,880
I can introduce her there

378
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,550
Brother, can I add you on WeChat?

379
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,600
Brother Qiaoyan

380
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,680
can I also add your WeChat?

381
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,800
He's not the same as what is said on the Internet.

382
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,150
He has no official airs.

383
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,430
Yes.

384
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,080
Right.

385
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,600
Talented.

386
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,510
Hello, uncles and aunts.

387
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,080
You are here.

388
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,840
Why so many people?

389
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,880
I don't know either.

390
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,080
Come to the supermarket with me.

391
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,660
Uncle said he wanted a deck of cards.

392
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
He said it's so boring.

393
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
OK, let's go.

394
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,760
Qiaoyan, I ordered several boxes of fruit.

395
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,640
They are about to arrive.

396
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,310
Would you please come with Ning Fang

397
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,350
to help me move them?

398
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,000
Why do you want them both?

399
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
Nothing else.

400
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,840
I just want to see them in the same frame.

401
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,470
Let's go.

402
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,470
Mom.

403
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm leaving.

404
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,840
Uncles and aunts, we have to go.

405
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,880
Right, they are busy.

406
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,150
How beautiful!

407
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,920
Come in or not, young man?

408
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
Don't hang about.

409
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,110
Wait.

410
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,960
The pores are clean and delicate

411
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,680
but the forehead and nose are oily

412
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Has skin care but not exquisite

413
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,920
The fragrance of wood

414
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,040
fresh and light

415
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,190
Popular taste

416
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,680
but mediocre

417
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,640
Blended T-shirt of

418
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,800
Japanese household brand

419
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,760
Pursuit of cost-efficiency and comfort

420
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,000
but the delicacy is not enough

421
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,000
The edge of the nail is clean and smooth

422
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,270
and smells like disinfectant.

423
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,150
It should be hand sanitizer in hospital.

424
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,720
From the muscles

425
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,270
on his shoulder and chest

426
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,350
his body fat should be about 10 percent

427
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,920
to 13 percent.

428
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,600
I used to think

429
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,680
last time at the hotpot restaurant

430
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,600
was our limit.

431
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,190
I didn't expect...

432
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:14,000
You can choose not to talk.

433
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,270
In such a small space

434
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,840
every word of yours

435
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,430
can cause a surge of air

436
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,920
blowing in my ear.

437
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,110
It's very uncomfortable.

438
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,040
Don't move.

439
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,920
He Qiaoyan really said that?

440
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,960
Arranged marriage was just a joke?

441
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
He said there was not such a thing.

442
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,310
He's not lying to you, is he?

443
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,000
No, he's not that kind of person.

444
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,920
I think

445
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,550
you really

446
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,350
like He Qiaoyan now.

447
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,470
Have some snacks

448
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,270
and stop talking.

449
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,390
It's not me you're blocking.

450
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,510
Even if He Qiaoyan

451
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,470
didn't take the arranged marriage seriously

452
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,270
it's clear that Lin Wei takes it seriously.

453
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
She made such a high-profile appearance

454
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,840
at the banquet

455
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,960
and openly

456
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,390
went to work in Heshi Group.

457
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,040
She's obviously telling you

458
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,150
that she's the one.

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,800
If you

460
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,150
really like He Qiaoyan

461
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,640
don't be so stupid.

462
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,510
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

463
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,600
Love affair

464
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:21,510
is like a battle.

465
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:37,840
let's go.

466
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,270
You want to carry two boxes?

467
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,800
What's up?

468
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:41,840
Put it down first.

469
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,470
What is cooperation?

470
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,840
The key to cooperation is

471
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,550
fair

472
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,080
and reasonable distribution.

473
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
There are three boxes of fruit

474
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,720
and each box is three kilos.

475
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,640
That's nine kilos in total.

476
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,000
I think the most reasonable way should be

477
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,150
one for you and one for me

478
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,550
and the box left

479
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,550
we move it together.

480
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,230
It makes sense.

481
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,230
However

482
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,640
I

483
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,080
didn't plan to carry them myself.

484
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,800
I think so, too.

485
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,510
The key to human progress

486
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,080
is using tools.

487
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,510
Together.

488
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,080
You are just as Yiyue described.

489
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,190
What's up?

490
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:40,000
Minister Xu of R & D department thinks

491
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,510
the new design of the bracelet

492
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,230
has affected the use of the product

493
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,390
but Lucas insists the design.

494
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,310
So now they two

495
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,190
have reached a deadlock.

496
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,040
Got it.

497
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,960
What's the matter?

498
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,430
Wait a second.

499
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,080
There's something in the company

500
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,350
I need to deal with.

501
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,680
Please tell mom and dad.

502
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,550
Just go.

503
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
What's going on?

504
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,680
The meeting of rivals in love is especially envious.

505
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,040
Do you think they two

506
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
will have a fight?

507
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,150
Your father's illness

508
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,960
has affected Qiaoyan's work.

509
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,760
Because of the bracelet recently

510
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
He Qiaoyan is very busy.

511
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,310
I hope you won't

512
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,680
disturb his work any more.

513
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:42,190
Otherwise, I won't sit back and watch.

514
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,880
It's our business, what's the matter with her?

515
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,720
Stop looking.

516
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,040
The car drives away.

517
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,840
Jaws of death.

518
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,080
Yiyue.

519
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,390
Yiyue really

520
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,640
likes He Qiaoyan.

521
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,470
Ruowei

522
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,350
do you know this man?

523
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,880
When I came

524
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,760
he was on your seat.

525
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,640
It's OK. You go ahead.

526
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,840
Is that her boyfriend?

527
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,760
No way, he's too low.

528
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,760
Sister, what are you doing?

529
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,920
This bag is worth tens of thousands.

530
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,150
I said don't come to my company.

531
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
Why are you here again?

532
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,640
This is your fault.

533
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,310
You have to tell your family

534
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,840
if you change jobs.

535
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,230
I had a lot of trouble finding you.

536
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,040
Alas.

537
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,680
I want to ask you something.

538
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,350
Do you think

539
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,150
this is the most expensive Industrial Park

540
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,190
in this world?

541
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Which moneybag are you leaning on?

542
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,470
The chairman?

543
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,880
This is where I work.

544
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,000
Anything you what to say

545
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,190
go out and tell me.

546
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,150
No need.

547
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,600
I'm good here.

548
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,960
You get up.

549
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,470
Right off.

550
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,150
What a waste.

551
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,920
Or I'll call security.

552
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,040
Let me tell you

553
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,150
I'm not afraid of losing face.

554
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,000
Weiwei.

555
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,800
Weiwei.

556
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,190
Good morning.

557
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,190
Weiwei.

558
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,600
Weiwei.

559
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,110
What's the matter this time?

560
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,800
Lend me 200 thousand yuan.

561
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,550
You bet again.

562
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,040
I didn't bet.

563
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,350
This time a friend of mine

564
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,430
pulled me in.

565
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,640
But the business was a failure

566
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,080
and lost 300 thousand yuan.

567
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,600
I'm not directly

568
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,430
asking for 300 thousand yuan.

569
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,600
Just give me some 100 thousand right now.

570
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,800
Besides paying back the money

571
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,960
there's the decoration of the house

572
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,150
me and mother's living expenses

573
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,510
and

574
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,640
I'm going to marry my girlfriend next year.

575
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,510
Before you lie

576
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,600
can you make a draft?

577
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,150
Can people like you

578
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,760
find a girlfriend?

579
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,640
And

580
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,840
how to decorate the house?

581
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,600
Is our house Queen's garden

582
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,080
that has to be repaired every year?

583
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,040
Can you

584
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
find a decent job

585
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,190
to support the family?

586
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,920
Just tell me will you lend me or not?

587
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,390
You make so much money

588
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,000
so you should

589
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,720
share more

590
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,430
for the family.

591
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:16,430
This is the word a brother

592
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,640
should say?

593
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,680
Sister.

594
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,920
in fact, in my heart

595
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,080
I've been worried about you.

596
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,880
Having been out there all these years

597
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,310
you must have suffered a lot.

598
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,190
I actually...

599
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,960
Sorry, baby

600
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm late.

601
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,390
Tell me this kind of thing earlier.

602
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,150
Let me handle it.

603
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,110
I'll take care of my baby.

604
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,800
She doesn't have to suffer with me.

605
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
Double rhyme.

606
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
What's your problem?

607
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,550
Dude,

608
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,470
did you hear that just now?

609
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,840
Never again

610
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,230
call her sister.

611
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,190
It's greasier than Daqing Oilfield.

612
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,080
She doesn't want to see you at all.

613
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,230
If you are smart, go away.

614
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,430
Who the hell are you?

615
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,880
Who are you?

616
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,720
-She's my sister.   -He's my brother.

617
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,190
Brother, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

618
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,230
Excuse me. Excuse me.

619
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,470
Just go away.

620
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,310
Go away.

621
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,270
What's wrong?

622
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,960
What's the matter? So mysterious.

623
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,150
No way

624
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,470
where did you find it?

625
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,230
Why it smells like

626
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,840
air fresheners?

627
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,840
Poor little ring.

628
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,760
It has lied idle for so long

629
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,230
in the bathroom.

630
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,960
It's really a sin.

631
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,000
Bathroom...

632
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,350
But have you ever thought about it.

633
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,640
This ring appears

634
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,960
just at this moment.

635
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,430
What does it mean?

636
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,600
It means it's time

637
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,800
for a clean-up.

638
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,080
I am asking you

639
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,920
did He Qiaoyan

640
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,080
give this ring to you?

641
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,550
Yeah.

642
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,920
So is this ring

643
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,270
the symbol of your identity

644
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,600
Mrs. He?

645
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,270
Right?

646
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,920
Right.

647
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,040
So this ring

648
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,600
is obviously a reminder.

649
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,510
It's time to exercise your rights as Mrs. He.

650
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,190
Thunder strikes

651
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,800
to repel the invading enemy

652
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,000
and safeguard your man.

653
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,640
Right?

654
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,760
Is it?

655
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,110
Can you be more positive?

656
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,880
Ouch

657
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,550
Uncle will be up and about soon.

658
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,150
You have to face your crisis in love.

659
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,080
l have to go.

660
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,920
I am late.

661
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,190
Behave yourself.

662
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,110
Bye.

663
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,920
I finally make it to the discharge.

664
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,310
How to describe this?

665
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,310
Right.

666
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,640
There will be a good fortune if you don't die in great danger.

667
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,390
What about my 20 yuan?

668
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,510
There you go again.

669
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,110
Dad, Uncle Li said

670
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,270
he's going to fight you 300 rounds

671
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,000
after you are discharge

672
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
with that 20 yuan.

673
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,430
Old fool.

674
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,230
Let's see what I can do to fix him.

675
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
You don't have a chance to fix him.

676
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,470
What's up?

677
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:22,470
The doctor said

678
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,680
you have a serious lack of exercise.

679
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
So when you get discharged,

680
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,270
I have to take you running every day.

681
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,310
I have few years left

682
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,430
If I don't play any more, I'll suffer such a loss.

683
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,390
Let me ask you

684
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,800
If you died this time

685
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,550
You couldn't even see your granddaughter.

686
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,470
Do you suffer or not?

687
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,510
That's quite a loss.

688
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:39,880
You two

689
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,600
can live another hundred years.

690
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,840
How sweet our daughter is.

691
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,640
Where's Qiaoyan?

692
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh, right.

693
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,550
Your father's discharged is such a big deal.

694
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,470
Why didn't he come?

695
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,920
Didn't you tell him?

696
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,190
Mom.

697
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,190
It's because

698
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,800
I don't want to disturb his work.

699
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,270
That's fine.

700
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,800
Mommy.

701
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,080
Here comes Xiaobao.

702
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,920
Mom and dad.

703
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,640
You are so busy.

704
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,880
You don't have to come here.

705
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,640
It's what I should do.

706
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,840
I thought you weren't coming.

707
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,350
On my way here

708
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,680
I've been on a conference call

709
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,110
so I didn't get time to call you back.

710
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,720
Mom and dad, your car is ready.

711
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,040
I'll take you home.

712
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
That's good.

713
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,150
Let's go.

714
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,270
Let's go.

715
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,800
Don't eat fatty food.

716
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,470
You have to eat something vegetarian.

717
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,800
You just got out of the hospital.

718
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,040
There's no wine.

719
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,680
You shouldn't drink wine just after being discharged.

720
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,230
Fine.

721
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,150
Xiaobao, help yourself.

722
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,680
Dad.

723
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,600
My daughter loves me.

724
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,680
Mom, have some, too.

725
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,430
My son-in-law loves me.

726
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,960
Daughter, eat.

727
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,390
Why is Xiaobao so lovely?

728
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,230
Here, call me grandma.

729
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:01,800
Mom.

730
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,760
Oh, my poor memory.

731
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Forget it.

732
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,470
Forget it.

733
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,430
Grandma.

734
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,040
Did Xiaobao...

735
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,430
Did Xiaobao call me?

736
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,350
Call me again.

737
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,510
Grandma.

738
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,190
Fantastic.

739
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,230
Xiaobao, call me grandpa.

740
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,040
Grandpa.

741
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,880
He's calling you.

742
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,510
What happened to the child today?

743
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
He's enlightened, isn't he?

744
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,429
Fantastic.

745
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:33,350
Xiaobao, call me daddy.

746
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,110
Say daddy.

747
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,000
Xiaobao, say daddy.

748
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,600
It's daddy.

749
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,880
It's daddy.

750
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,270
Mr. He, you need to keep trying.

751
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,429
It's nothing.

752
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,350
That's what kids do.

753
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,230
Maybe tomorrow he will call you.

754
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,230
Take it easy.

755
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,960
Yes.

756
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,150
Let's have dinner.

757
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,960
Come on.

758
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,550
Come on, Xiaobao.

759
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,190
Yueyue, have some yourself.

760
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,270
Hello.

761
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,350
Qiaoyan.

762
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,960
Mr. Jia wanted to see us

763
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,190
at the hotel where his company's dinner held.

764
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,510
It sounds like

765
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,230
he wants to cooperate with us.

766
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,000
OK.

767
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,150
Well

768
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,760
send me the location of the hotel.

769
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,230
Before the end of the dinner

770
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,080
I'll be there for sure.

771
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,350
Mom and dad.

772
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,110
It's something at work.

773
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,920
I have to go.

774
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,110
If you are busy, just go.

775
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,550
The meal is not finished yet.

776
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,550
Xiaobao, let's go home.

777
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,390
Eat something.

778
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,600
You've hardly eaten anything.

779
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,230
Goodbye, Xiaobao.

780
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,350
Drive safe.

781
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Bye, Mom.

782
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,470
Hotel.

783
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,800
Why to meet in the hotel?

784
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:32,150
Why didn't take me to dinner?

785
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm his wife.

786
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,270
Silly girl.

787
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,920
You finish eating and lie down.

788
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,680
Did I give birth to a baby pig?

789
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,720
I'm going out.

790
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,800
What are you going to do?

791
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,230
Your baby pig's backyard

792
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,640
is on fire.

793
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,350
What does that mean?

794
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,040
Sis, please give me your robe.

795
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,470
What?

796
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,840
Don't you say love affair is like a battle?

797
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm going to fight.

798
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,800
By the way

799
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,190
your so called imperial mask

800
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,430
please prepare for me, too.

801
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,430
Put it down.

802
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,600
So mean?

803
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,230
Tell me

804
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,230
when, where and who.

805
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,960
Hotel, tonight.

806
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,270
He Qiaoyan and Lin Wei.

807
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,720
At the hotel in the evening?

808
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,600
No wonder you sound the alarm.

809
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,080
You actually need to

810
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,550
take good care of your skin.

811
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,880
Lin Wei is not a small role.

812
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,390
Don't be outperformed by her.

813
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,550
So I come here

814
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,110
for your equipment.

815
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,680
Depends on it.

816
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,430
My skin color

817
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,190
has lightened a lot.

818
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,470
You are

819
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,190
my fairy godmother.

820
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,510
Only a pumpkin cart's missing.

821
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,430
You can have it.

822
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,470
Excuse me

823
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,430
is the pumpkin car

824
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,680
reserved by passenger 6623?

825
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,000
Why are you here, Ning Fang?

826
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,430
I called him.

827
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,550
It's the evening rush.

828
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,920
It's hard to find a taxi.

829
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,080
Thank you then.

830
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,920
Get in the car.

831
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,190
Bye.

832
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,310
Bye-bye.

833
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,270
Wait a minute.

834
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,350
What are you doing?

835
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,110
What's up?

836
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,470
What's up?

837
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,720
You're taking pictures, aren't you?

838
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,110
Who's taking pictures?

839
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,920
Let go.

840
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Come to the police station with me.

841
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,350
Go.

842
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,550
Go.

843
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,760
Hurry up.

844
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,390
What do you want?

845
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,470
How dare you take pictures.

846
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,640
Mr. Jia

847
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,310
Mr. Jia
