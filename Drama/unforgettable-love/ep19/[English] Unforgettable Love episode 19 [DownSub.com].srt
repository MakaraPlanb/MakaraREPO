Unforgettable Love
EP19

2
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,150
I

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,110
am

4
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
into

5
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,520
you.

6
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:17,880
Boy

7
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,360
You're finally willing to talk to Dad.

8
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,479
Do you get it?

9
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,440
I...

10
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,190
Why not choose

11
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,750
written expression, which is more rigorous?

12
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,190
For example, e-mail.

13
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,229
It not only can communicate in a timely and efficient manner,

14
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,840
but also can leave evidence

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
as a legal basis.

16
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,360
What are you doing?

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,710
I have watched lots of

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,670
Hollywood romantic films

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,840
and Western movies.

20
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,750
I find that,

21
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,880
after the perfect date,

22
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,880
they will choose to lie in bed together

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,960
and have a heart-to-heart talk.

24
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,400
Perfect date?

25
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,440
That's foreigner's date.

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,710
You watch some

27
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,590
pure love dramas that Asians watch. OK?

28
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,110
I have watched them.

29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,400
After my analysis,

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,270
I draw a conclusion.

31
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,230
Asians are too reserved

32
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,400
in expressing their emotion.

33
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
But European and American people are more direct.

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,880
You want me to

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,110
express my emotion clearly.

36
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,400
If the fishing this afternoon

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
is not enough,

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,480
so come on now.

39
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,310
Xiaowei, Xiaowei

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,480
Mom

41
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Are you all right?

42
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,079
I'm okay. I had a nightmare.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,840
OK, just fine.

44
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,270
All right, it's time for dinner.

45
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,560
Your father won't come back for dinner.

46
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,040
For the wedding of you and Qiaoyan,

47
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
how's it going?

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,360
Your father is old.

49
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,750
From now on, our Lin family

50
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,110
will all depend on you.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,360
You have to work hard.

52
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,440
And

53
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,110
as to the Bracelet project

54
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,670
that you're in charge of in Heshi Group,

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,440
I have already told your dad.

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,000
He'll help you.

57
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,270
He Qiaoyan let me leave Heshi Group.

58
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,190
What?

59
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,630
He...

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,960
He and the doctor

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,630
are dating.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,400
It's said that

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,270
they have terminated the contract.

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,080
Why are they dating now?

65
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,360
I go upstairs.

66
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,590
No, I have to ask He Jiaqin.

67
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,630
What does she mean?

68
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,520
As long as you marry Lin Wei,

69
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,840
what you call hidden danger

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,960
won't exist.

71
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,000
And it's good for Bracelet.

72
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,080
Aunt.

73
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,040
As for this question,

74
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,150
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

75
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,920
I have a meeting later.

76
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,840
I'll hang up now.

77
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
A normal child

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,480
is lovely.

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
But if you

80
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,630
face a child-like Xiaobao every day,

81
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,270
who is more or less

82
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,750
abnormal,

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
I'm afraid that many people

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
will find him unlovable.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,750
Aunt. Well.

86
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,880
It's just because I know

87
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,630
how cute they are by nature,

88
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,630
so I want to

89
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,270
help them get better.

90
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,080
The kids that you saved before

91
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,150
are very lucky.

92
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,000
But I hope

93
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,520
you can leave Xiaobao and Qiaoyan.

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I know that

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,110
you think I'm not good enough for Qiaoyan.

96
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,270
But aunt,

97
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,790
do you really

98
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,040
want him

99
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,790
to marry a woman

100
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,190
he doesn't love for company

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,310
and then live unhappily

102
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,440
for the rest of his life?

103
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,590
Since Qiaoyan decided to

104
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,270
take over his brother's career,

105
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,520
it's not just

106
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,750
his own career.

107
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
He should be worthy of his dead relatives.

108
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,230
He can't escape.

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah

110
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,110
Aunt, I think you are right,

111
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,790
but also selfish.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,230
For lovers who don't the similar family background,

113
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,590
it's hard for them to get married.

114
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,230
Even if they get married,

115
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,710
they will not be happy.

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,270
I've seen lots of such things.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,360
You and Qiaoyan

118
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
will both be hurt.

119
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,590
And Xiaobao

120
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,270
will be hurt again.

121
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,750
Am I right?

122
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,310
Aunt

123
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,480
Please don't embarrass Yiyue.

124
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,710
I don't handle it well.

125
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,230
You come here so fast.

126
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,590
It seems that you really care about her.

127
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,960
Of course I care about her.

128
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,710
I know that

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Heshi Group is the place

130
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,920
where I need to pay all my effort.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Since the day

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,750
my brother and sister-in-law died,

133
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,960
I've accepted

134
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
the fact.

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,790
Over the years,

136
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,440
except Heshi Group and Xiaobao,

137
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,270
I don't have my own life.

138
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,710
I'm very clear about the condition of our family.

139
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,840
I am more aware of

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
my situation and responsibility.

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,360
But at the same time

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,790
I long to have

143
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,000
what a normal adult

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,310
could have.

145
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,710
I want to be with the person I like

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,790
to form a family together.

147
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,750
Aunt

148
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,790
What you want,

149
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,480
I'll help you achieve it.

150
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,190
But as for the relationship between me and Yiyue,

151
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,630
I hope you don't interfere any more.

152
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,040
Let's go.

153
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,110
Aunt, we're leaving.

154
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,350
What are you doing here?

155
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,840
I heard that my aunt is going to invite you to dinner.

156
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,760
I know that

157
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,039
she would say that.

158
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,190
You're not angry, are you?

159
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,230
There is no reason to be angry.

160
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,760
I think you are fantastically handsome just now.

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,390
Be relaxed.

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,000
About aunt,

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,960
I can handle her.

164
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,510
You can rest assured that

165
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,270
I'm not so vulnerable.

166
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,430
Neither would I

167
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,110
be scared away so easily.

168
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,470
I will hold on to you

169
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
tightly.

170
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,510
I also come here today

171
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,190
to tell you

172
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,080
I am into you.

173
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,760
I am into you

174
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,720
From birth to now,

175
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,350
these words,

176
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,640
I never say them.

177
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,600
All the time

178
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,080
I adhere to

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,920
reason and data.

180
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,390
It's kind of embarrassed

181
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,150
to say I am into you suddenly.

182
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,350
But I finally say it.

183
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,190
It's a relief.

184
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,350
You're right.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,680
Emotion

186
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,840
really needs to be expressed.

187
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,150
So I have lots of things

188
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,350
to change

189
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,040
and to learn.

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,430
Yiyue

191
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,190
Would you like to accompany me

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
to continue to change

193
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
and learn?

194
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,510
I do.

195
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,720
Thank you.

196
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,390
Idiot.

197
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:38,110
What's wrong?

198
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,880
Have I

199
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,390
said

200
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,680
thank you too many times?

201
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,270
It's not good, right?

202
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,270
I see the girl in TV plays

203
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,390
who falls in love with the hero

204
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,350
is spoiled

205
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,190
and coaxed by the hero.

206
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,430
As for me,

207
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,840
I meet a babe in the wood.

208
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,640
I have to teach you how to date.

209
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,110
You teach me.

210
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,390
But you are the person who enjoys the achievement.

211
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,080
What you said seems to be very reasonable.

212
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,760
All right.

213
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,510
I just stand on my own feet.

214
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,470
I plant the tree by myself.

215
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,680
And then pick fruits by myself.

216
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,390
Let's go, the babe in the wood.

217
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,080
Who?

218
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,640
Give me some medicine.

219
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Lin Wei.

220
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,720
How much? I give you.

221
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,550
If you really want to transfer money,

222
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,150
you have to add my WeChat first.

223
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,000
When can I have my medicine?

224
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,390
What happened to you recently?

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,430
Nothing

226
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,430
Your anxiety disorder

227
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,150
needs a long-term consultation with a psychologist.

228
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,840
If you don't believe me,

229
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
you can find a

230
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,920
strange psychologist.

231
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,920
Or I can recommend you

232
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,110
a reliable one.

233
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,000
In a word,

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,550
I will never

235
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,680
reveal your identity.

236
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,150
No, I'll get the medicine from you tomorrow.

237
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,390
Mom

238
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:46,880
Miss Lin

239
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,600
They are all

240
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,880
core members of Bracelet project

241
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,840
in Heshi Group.

242
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,430
If you need something in the future,

243
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:55,760
you can just tell them.

244
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Mom. Must you do that?

245
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,190
You should keep your word.

246
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
Otherwise you will disgrace Lin family in the end.

247
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,880
I get it, mom.

248
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,110
Sit down.

249
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,920
Don't worry. There is no camera in this room.

250
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,680
I have given you the money for the medicine.

251
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,550
Why don't you give me the medicine?

252
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,310
I'm a psychologist,

253
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,390
not a drug dealer.

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,270
Hey, Ning Fang.

255
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,110
I can give you the medicine.

256
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,190
But you should fill in this form first.

257
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,190
No

258
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,840
I have said that I don't need a doctor.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,040
You just give me the medicine.

260
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,230
Are you

261
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,470
always so nosy?

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,230
I'm a psychologist.

263
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:11,800
I can't just sit back.

264
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,840
Okay.

265
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,080
Fill in carefully.

266
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,000
Miss Lin

267
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,470
Your current psychological state

268
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,720
is pessimistic.

269
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,600
I suggest you get treatment right away.

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,040
Otherwise, the condition will be uncontrollable.

271
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
I have filled out the form.

272
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,080
Please keep your word.

273
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,310
Give me the medicine.

274
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
The reason I let you fill in the form

275
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,310
is to make you more aware of

276
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,510
your own illness.

277
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,150
I have read your diagnosis abroad.

278
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,800
Give me the medicine.

279
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,430
This is the last time

280
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,230
I give you the medicine.

281
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,640
If you want more in the future,

282
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,840
you have to see a doctor for a prescription.

283
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,760
How are you feeling?

284
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,960
Is the strength comfortable?

285
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,000
Give me your cell phone.

286
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,720
Cell phone?

287
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,190
From now on,

288
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,230
the profile photo of your WeChat must be my picture.

289
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,550
The cover of you Moments

290
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,960
must be a picture of the two of us.

291
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,760
Let me see. What else.

292
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,000
By the way,

293
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,840
the lock screen password of your phone

294
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,190
must be my birthday.

295
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,080
Good idea.

296
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,510
Give me your cell phone.

297
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,640
I want to change, too.

298
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:05,960
Okay.

299
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
Cheer up, Yiyue.

300
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,760
I'll introduce you to some

301
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,270
cute young boys.

302
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,390
Don't always focus on

303
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,880
the old He Qiaoyan.

304
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,960
You give it back to me.

305
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,720
Your friends

306
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,150
still don't know

307
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,270
that we are dating.

308
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Don't be angry.

309
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,350
I haven't

310
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,110
had time for the official announcement yet.

311
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,040
And she won't do that.

312
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,720
Really.

313
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,150
What are you doing?

314
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,550
I've just sent the message

315
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,680
to 637 friends

316
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,230
in your contacts

317
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,840
to update

318
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
your emotional state.

319
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,230
Mr. He

320
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,110
You are too naive.

321
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:00,960
Dear all,

322
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,640
at 9:30

323
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,230
this morning,

324
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,960
I have officially reached the love cooperation

325
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,390
with He Qiaoyan

326
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,680
and the cooperation project will be steadily advanced.

327
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,150
Please be informed and forward the message.

328
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,310
What's wrong with you?

329
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,040
It seems that my account is hacked.

330
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,349
You don't understand.

331
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,150
All right, get ready to go out.

332
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,430
Where are we going?

333
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,550
Everybody

334
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,839
Today I call all of you here.

335
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,470
Because there is one thing

336
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,510
that is very important

337
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,510
to tell everyone.

338
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,880
Yiyue and me are in serious relationship.

339
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,960
So I'd like to announce it to you.

340
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Er

341
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,150
Mr. He

342
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,720
Actually

343
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,430
you can just post it on your Moment.

344
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,040
Don't need to show affection in such way.

345
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,640
Yeah

346
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,960
Just one piece of paper.

347
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,040
We can't rest assured

348
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,350
that Dr. Qin dates with you.

349
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,000
Come on, come on.

350
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,600
Let's play Truth or Dare.

351
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,270
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

352
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,760
Come on. Rock, Paper, Scissors.

353
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,310
Dare.

354
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,190
Okay.

355
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,720
Mr. He

356
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,430
Please show Dr. Qin

357
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,000
this part of the line.

358
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,230
Impossible.

359
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,760
Why? Let me see.

360
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,080
Are you sure?

361
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,470
I'm ready.

362
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,190
Come on.

363
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,040
Come on, come on.

364
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,550
It's all your fault. And you don't coax me.

365
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,270
I really want to cry.

366
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,840
Beat your chest.

367
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,310
Bad guy.

368
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,920
Aha

369
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,510
You are so annoying.

370
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Ah ah ah

371
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,550
Bad guy. Beat you.

372
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,390
Break up.

373
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,800
It's just "Dare".

374
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,600
Dare.

375
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,600
Don't stop.

376
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
There's a second round.

377
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,350
Come on, come on.

378
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,000
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

379
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,600
Truth.

380
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,150
If I and Ning Fang fall into the water,

381
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,510
who will you save?

382
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,600
Naive.

383
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,310
I won't save anyone.

384
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,230
Because I can't swim.

385
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,600
When do you start to like me?

386
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,150
After you like me.

387
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,150
So

388
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,080
when do you

389
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,190
start to like me?

390
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,110
You can't ask me.

391
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm going to ask.

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Before you like me, of course.

393
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,920
There's a third round.

394
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,150
Come on.

395
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,080
Rock, Paper, Scissors.

396
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,680
Dare.

397
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,760
Okay.

398
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,040
Come on.

399
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,680
Mr. He. Yiyue.

400
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,720
You two

401
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,110
eat the chips together

402
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,840
within 15 seconds.

403
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,350
I have finished.

404
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,680
You're cheating.

405
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,920
Yiyue, are you ok?

406
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,270
I shouldn't have fined her for drinking when she lost the game.

407
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,230
She always loses at games.

408
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,150
Hug.

409
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,150
It doesn't matter. You could go back first.

410
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,230
I'll take care of her.

411
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
Go, go.

412
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,430
Let's go. Let's go.

413
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,270
I know you are the same as me.

414
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,110
What?

415
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,000
We both drink.

416
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,800
Stop.

417
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,760
No drunk driving.

418
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,080
You will get a ticket.

419
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,040
How much shall I be fined?

420
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,190
Five million yuan.

421
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,150
Five million yuan.

422
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,600
Then I want Miss Qin

423
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,040
to help me with this business.

424
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,230
Okay.

425
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,190
Please give evaluation

426
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
for the service of Miss Qin.

427
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,920
Five star praise.

428
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,080
Millions of praise.

429
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,880
Is that enough?

430
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,840
No.

431
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,350
That's enough. That's enough.

432
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,470
No more.

433
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,880
Will Aunt come?

434
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,800
I call her and ask her.

435
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,720
Never mind.

436
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,350
I know

437
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,640
aunt doesn't like me.

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,680
But it's normal that she dislikes me.

439
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,310
Anyway, I grew up

440
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,920
not being

441
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,600
liked by teachers and elders.

442
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,190
Isn't that good?

443
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,310
You go on

444
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,640
being yourself happily.

445
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,640
As to other things,

446
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,680
let me handle them.

447
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,880
But this time is different.

448
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,680
I want to be recognized by aunt.

449
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,080
Not for me,

450
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,000
but for us.

451
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,430
Yiyue

452
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,230
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

453
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,150
What does aunt usually like?

454
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm very good at learning.

455
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,680
Aunt

456
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,600
loves her career

457
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
and also likes profits.

458
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,390
She is a typical member of He family.

459
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,310
And

460
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,840
apart from work,

461
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,390
she would like playing golf.

462
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,110
Golf.

463
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,230
It sounds like

464
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,840
an easy one to learn.

465
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,720
Are you going to

466
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
open a golf shop.

467
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,960
It's called being prepared

468
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,390
before taking action.

469
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
Golf is a sport

470
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,080
of using clubs

471
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,840
to hit balls into a series of holes.

472
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,040
What's wrong?

473
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,230
Do I add too much pepper?

474
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,550
No, I don't add pepper.

475
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,680
Delicate.

476
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,310
Strength.

477
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,840
No.

478
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,640
The important factor of distance.

479
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,040
Distance.

480
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,190
Flexibility of the body.

481
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,150
Press three or four times.

482
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,920
Move away and bend to the right.

483
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:57,080
Only in this way can it be effective.

484
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,840
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.

485
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,150
Choose the right angle to hit the ball.

486
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,110
Pick up the ball.

487
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,840
The distance between the feet

488
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,230
should be slightly wider than the shoulder width.

489
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,550
Toe forward.

490
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,190
The knee is slightly bent.

491
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
At the same time, keep your waist and back straight.

492
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,600
But when I straighten my back,

493
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,720
my club is far from the ground.

494
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,230
It means your movement is wrong.

495
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,550
Come on.

496
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,350
Let me help you.

497
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,600
Press your shoulders down.

498
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,230
Keep your arms straight.

499
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
Raise your hip a little.

500
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,080
Keep your back straight.

501
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,350
Move forward a little.

502
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,920
Is that so?

503
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,080
So

504
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,680
what Dr. Qin wants to learn is not golf.

505
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,680
I can also teach you this.

506
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,720
I'm going to learn the swing.

507
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,390
No hurry. Learn this first.

508
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,720
So many people are watching.

509
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,840
Never mind.

510
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,270
Let's continue.

511
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Not bad.

512
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,600
What's wrong?

513
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,640
Is there something wrong in the company?

514
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,430
Yeah.

515
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,190
There is something urgent in company.

516
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:28,110
They let me go back.

517
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,640
Could you do it yourself?

518
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,760
Take it easy.

519
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,600
I'm a girl

520
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,470
who can beat off several hooligans.

521
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,310
There is no need to mention that matter.

522
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,000
All right. I'll pick you up when I finish.

523
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,040
Come back quickly.

524
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll miss you.

525
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,640
Okay.

526
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,680
I have to go.

527
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,230
Pay attention to safety.

528
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,000
What happened?

529
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,720
I also

530
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,880
received their resignation out of the blue.

531
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,600
I haven't noticed any signs of that before.

532
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,270
Who's left now?

533
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,190
The

534
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,110
three old subordinates of Mr. He are still here.

535
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,470
Others

536
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
are brought in by Miss Lin before

537
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,230
or

538
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,000
employed after she arrives.

539
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,920
They're all gone.

540
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,390
Mr. He, don't worry.

541
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,350
We can

542
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,510
recruit new staff now.

543
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,880
The previous work framework and direction

544
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,430
are in accordance with

545
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,510
the original talent structure

546
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,840
and their respective resources

547
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,600
to build.

548
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,190
Recruit again.

549
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,390
Set a direction.

550
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,840
It's too late.

551
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,270
Well, you go back.

552
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,510
I'll find a way.

553
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,230
Let's go.

554
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
I have said that

555
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,680
I'll get in touch with you.

556
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,600
I'm afraid you'll forget.

557
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,150
Say it. Give me money or not.

558
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,550
I've given you a lot.

559
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,430
You leave Qincheng City first.

560
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,040
Otherwise, any talk is spared.

561
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,110
Now it seems that

562
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,720
you don't have the initiative.

563
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,840
You want to reveal the secret.

564
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,600
But you have to rely on me

565
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,040
to pay off your debt.

566
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,150
Just say it. Give me the money or not.

567
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,600
Is that my Aunt?

568
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,920
I will leave.

569
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,310
How can I go without money?

570
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,640
Give me money first.

571
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,040
Who dares to bully my aunt?

572
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,150
Money. I just want money.

573
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,550
The money, I will...

574
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,110
Aunt, I'm here to protect you.

575
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,920
You have arms and feet. Why do you rob money?

576
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,550
Let's go, aunt.

577
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,680
Dr. Qin, what are you doing?

578
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
You must be Mrs. He.

579
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,270
Does Mrs. He know that her husband

580
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,680
is the culprit?

581
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,550
Shut up.

582
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,150
Are you crazy?

583
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,550
What are you talking？

584
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,680
Mr. Zhang?

585
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,720
Aunt

586
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:39,920
Is he the driver

587
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,350
that He Qiaoyan has been looking for?

588
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,270
Stop running.

589
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,960
Stop.

590
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,840
Yiyue

591
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,960
Over the years,

592
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,880
he asks me for money

593
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,270
several times a year.

594
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,390
Aunt

595
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,920
What the man just said

596
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,510
isn't true, is it?

597
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,270
Five years ago,

598
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,880
the person who caused the accident

599
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,960
was not Mr. Zhang

600
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,720
but Qiaoyan.

601
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,510
And Qiaoyan...

602
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,310
Because of the hit of Qiaoyan's brain

603
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,640
in the car accident

604
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,430
and the stress reaction,

605
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,190
he has lost his memory

606
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,470
about the accident.

607
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,390
In order to protect him,

608
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,680
I decide to hide the truth.

609
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,600
Aunt

610
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,000
These are all things

611
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,680
that Mr. Zhang told you.

612
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,080
Right?

613
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,600
Don't be fooled by him.

614
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
It's true.

615
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,840
Yiyue, have you finished?

616
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,350
I haven't finished my work.

617
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,840
So I can't pick you up tonight.

618
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,430
Yiyue

619
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,510
You are a kind person.

620
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,600
I beg you

621
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,150
to leave Qiaoyan.

622
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,230
Aunt

623
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

624
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,920
Five years ago,

625
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,510
did you

626
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,150
see a car accident?

627
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,270
At that time,

628
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,510
you also saved a little boy.

629
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,600
And your hand was hurt for that.

630
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,230
It was the same accident.

631
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,840
So

632
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,960
do you know why

633
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,760
I don't approve of

634
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,190
you two being together?

635
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,550
You'll bring him up to

636
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,880
his subconscious memories of the car accident.

637
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,190
Your existence

638
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,110
is like a time bomb

639
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,000
that will destroy him at any time.

640
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,390
Something

641
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,640
need to be chosen rationally.

642
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,510
Thank you

643
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,470
for saving Xiaobao at that time.

644
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,390
I beg you

645
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,040
to save Xiaobao and Qiaoyan again.

646
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,390
Xiaobao misses you.

647
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,720
When are you going home, mommy?

648
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,920
Xiaobao

649
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,680
Mommy is waiting for the car.

650
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,310
I'll be home soon.

651
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,680
Little grizzly falls.

652
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,270
But it dries the tears,

653
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,800
gets up again

654
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,600
and picks up its little jar.

655
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,190
So you're the frightened baby

656
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,110
several years ago.

657
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,350
Look how you've grown up.

658
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,469
Mommy is really happy.

659
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,389
But you've been suffered a lot.

660
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,350
Why should you

661
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,040
suffer more?

662
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,230
Brother

663
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,800
Don't go.

664
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,190
Brother

665
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,150
Don't go.

666
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,840
Brother

667
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,880
Brother

668
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,470
Don't go.

669
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Brother, please don't go.

670
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,640
Don't go.

671
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,510
Brother, brother.

672
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,600
You're back.

673
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:44,960
Come here.

674
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,080
Why don't you answer my phone all the time?

675
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,000
I...

676
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,470
I didn't pay attention to my cell phone.

677
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,040
It's all right.

678
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,190
Qiaoyan

679
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,920
Are you tired?

680
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,840
What did you just dream about?

681
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,600
I dream about my brother.

682
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,840
Recently,

683
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,270
I dream about him a lot.

684
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,550
Can you tell me something

685
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,920
about your brother?

686
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
My brother

687
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,040
He is warm, careful

688
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,150
and also very enthusiastic.

689
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,390
When I was 12 years old,

690
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,800
our mom died

691
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,110
and dad was always busy with his work.

692
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,600
So it was always my brother

693
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,550
who spent that time with me together.

694
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,040
The future of us

695
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,760
has been arranged by my father

696
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,880
since I was a kid.

697
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,640
But my brother knew that

698
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,430
I was not interested in business.

699
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,310
What?

700
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,600
Go abroad.

701
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,510
Choose a major you like.

702
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,310
Don't stay here and grab Heshi Group from me.

703
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,150
But you know that

704
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,510
dad wants me to study Business.

705
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,150
I'll persuade dad.

706
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,720
You can rest assured.

707
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,150
Really?

708
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,040
Study hard.

709
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:43,960
I can handle everything.

710
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,000
What happened later?

711
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,760
My dad

712
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,000
was persuaded by my brother.

713
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,720
But I didn't expect that

714
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,000
I've only been abroad for two years

715
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,840
when my father died.

716
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,110
Later,

717
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,110
without the permission of my brother,

718
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,600
I changed my major to Business.

719
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,960
Because I knew he needed me.

720
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,270
He needed me to come back to help him.

721
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,470
But I didn't expect that,

722
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,600
in the fourth year after I came back,

723
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,470
my brother and sister-in-law

724
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
had an accident.

725
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,000
If your brother

726
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,680
knows that you are well now,

727
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,310
he will be happy for you.

728
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,680
By the way.

729
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,550
I want to confess one thing.

730
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,430
Wait a minute.

731
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,190
Over the years,

732
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,720
I always dream of

733
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,960
the girl's back.

734
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,040
Over the years,

735
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,510
She warms me all the time

736
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,760
and gives me hope.

737
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,350
But I'm not going to search her now.

738
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,840
No matter whether the back

739
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,680
is real or not,

740
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,600
no matter

741
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,470
what she really means to me,

742
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,880
I don't want to know.

743
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,840
All I need is you.

744
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:59,310
That's enough.

745
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,550
You...

746
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,600
Are you sure

747
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,190
you have only seen her in your dream?

748
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,310
According to

749
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,680
the appearance of the girl in my dream,

750
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
I drew it.

751
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,430
I've been looking for her all these years.

752
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,230
I'm sure now

753
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,310
I haven't seen her in my life.

754
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,680
What's wrong, Yiyue?

755
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,470
I'm fine.

756
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:42,310
I'm tired and going to bed.
