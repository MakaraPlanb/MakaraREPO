1
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,160
Unforgettable Love

2
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,630
Xiaobao's parents passed away

3
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,630
on the way

4
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,520
to the hospital.

5
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,590
Then Xiaobao was a baby.

6
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,400
At that time,

7
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,230
no one could help me to handle this.

8
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,630
Then you woke up

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,590
but couldn't

10
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,080
recall the accident.

11
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,670
After that we had no clue.

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,360
Even the police's investigation stalled.

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,710
I could only tell you that

14
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,960
your accident happened

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,000
on the way to visit your brother.

16
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,560
So did it have anything to do

17
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,360
with Yiyue?

18
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,880
On that day,

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,630
Dr. Qin passed by

20
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,190
and saved Xiaobao.

21
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:54,560
At that time you were thrown outside the car,

22
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,880
so she didn't notice you.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,000
But you,

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,840
though drowsy,

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,230
might watched her dark figure

26
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,230
and heard her voice.

27
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,920
So the reason you want to expel her

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,150
is to prevent her from

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,790
reminding me of this accident.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
Qiaoyan,

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,520
this is also the reason

32
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,670
why I've been pestered

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,150
by Zhang Cheng in these years.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,270
For our family

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,000
and Xiaobao,

36
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,630
you should calm down.

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,920
Aunt,

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,790
what if Xiaobao knows

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,630
that I have something to do

40
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,520
with his parents' death.

41
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,270
Do you really think

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,040
he can regard me as his dad?

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,040
Hi, mom.

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Yiyue,

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,480
are you at home?

46
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,590
I'm coming to see you two with your dad.

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
We two?

48
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,150
Where are you now?

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,960
Close to your home.

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,630
He Qiaoyan's home?

51
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,480
Yes,

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,840
but I'd like to call it yours.

53
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
Mom, come back now.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
I have something to tell you.

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
We are almost there. Talk about it later.

56
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,560
It's not my home now.

57
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,590
Do you mean

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,270
you plan to get married

59
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,040
just for Xiaobao's illness,

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,790
don't you?

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,710
Yes, but I don't know

62
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,190
from which moment,

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,560
we gradually fall in love with each other.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
So

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,630
we decided to

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,399
start dating.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,440
And now,

68
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,000
why did you break up?

69
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,269
What's more,

70
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,560
why do you want to go abroad

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
after breaking up with him?

72
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,750
Because of him?

73
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,670
Did he force you?

74
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,190
I'll stand up for you.

75
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,230
Calm down, dad.

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,630
It's not his fault.

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,000
It's mine.

78
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,960
You meet your crush?

79
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,040
No.

80
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,150
But it was I

81
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,480
that want to be unattached.

82
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,960
I hurt him.

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,710
And he was so depressed.

84
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,590
Please don't bother him.

85
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,560
What...

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,670
Alright, Lao Qin.

87
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Girl, if you are not in the mood,

88
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,520
you can vent your depression.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,080
You don't need to pretend to be fine.

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,000
It's OK to be not OK.

91
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,190
I'm fine, mom.

92
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,670
Look at me,

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
I'm happy.

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
And studying in German

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,840
is always my dream.

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,400
Take it easy.

97
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,750
Don't cry.

98
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,520
Yiyue,

99
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,230
we'll support your decision.

100
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,790
But in German,

101
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,960
you should take care of yourself.

102
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,360
If you are bullied,

103
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,840
remember to call us.

104
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
We'll fly to German.

105
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
Come on,

106
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,590
nobody can bully me.

107
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,270
Trust me.

108
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,080
Mr. Wen

109
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,310
please sign here.

110
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,630
Just put there.

111
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,630
By the way,

112
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,750
please get the market director for me.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,840
Alright.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,790
Something wrong with the contract?

115
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,400
I want him to win this market,

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,750
not to bargain with loss.

117
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,080
I was pleased to hear that

118
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,040
you've made a deal with Wenmei Group.

119
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,110
I used to be idle.

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,270
But now that I decide to do it,

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
I'll be responsible.

122
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,040
Anything else?

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,960
Could you please tell me

124
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,270
that what makes you

125
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,790
change so much?

126
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,400
So diligent.

127
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,360
It's surprising.

128
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,080
It's you.

129
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,670
I want you know that

130
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,230
I'm not so bad.

131
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,190
I'm a grown man.

132
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,670
You can trust me.

133
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,480
But I'm not someone.

134
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
You can be yourself.

135
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,400
Why do you care about what I think of you?

136
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,790
I do care about your thoughts.

137
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,920
You rubbished me.

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,670
And you accused me of

139
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,630
a good-for nothing.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,920
It hurt me.

141
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,630
There's no bet,

142
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,150
no joke or performance.

143
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,040
I wanna take everything serious,

144
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,310
including you.

145
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,960
Do you want to

146
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,110
raise my salary?

147
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,080
No.

148
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,670
Well, no way.

149
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,150
I'm fine.

150
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,710
If you can't help taking pills,

151
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,360
you can do something

152
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,590
to distract attention.

153
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,840
It's good for you.

154
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
I'm leaving.

155
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,920
Bye.

156
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,470
Visit the customers with me tonight.

157
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,720
You ought to be hate to

158
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,230
visit customers the most.

159
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,350
At eleven o'clock tonight.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,550
Sorry,

161
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,840
I can't company you.

162
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Why not?

163
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,390
Yiyue is leaving tomorrow.

164
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,080
I've promised to

165
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,640
have dinner with her.

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
Where is she going?

167
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,920
Don't you know

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,350
that Yiyue had broken up with Mr. He.

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,470
She is leaving to German tomorrow.

170
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,080
He said nothing.

171
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,640
It's too late.

172
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,600
I should leave now.

173
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,040
You said you would cook today

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,230
to surprise us.

175
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,230
Just take it, sir.

176
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm too tired to cook.

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm exhausted!

178
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,190
Washing vegetables is tiring enough.

179
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,390
It's called family hotpot.

180
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,600
Just help yourself.

181
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,840
Are you sure

182
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,960
that the ingredients are clean?

183
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,550
Is it safe

184
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,800
to add the raw and cooked together?

185
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,470
What's more,

186
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:23,920
after dinner,

187
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,230
how do we remove

188
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,080
the odour of the hotpot?

189
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,800
We can't eat spicy food today.

190
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,110
Put it away.

191
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,600
Drink more hot water.

192
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,470
Are you alright?

193
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,720
Ummm,

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,600
can we start now?

195
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,550
It's boiled.

196
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,600
Let's dig in!

197
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,110
Why don't you start?

198
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Here you are.

199
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,080
Since you don't want to eat,

200
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,920
shall we have a drink

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,720
to wish my dream come true?

202
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,550
Come on.

203
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,190
Alcohol

204
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,800
cannot bring happiness

205
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,470
nor remove sufferings.

206
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,880
You know that

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,150
we two

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,640
are from different world.

209
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,880
Cheers.

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,920
Toast to our dream.

211
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,040
Qin Yiyue

212
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,600
I agree to break up.

213
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,000
Best wish to your dream.

214
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,430
Let's drink!

215
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,470
Ruowei

216
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,110
the beer is

217
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,150
too spicy!

218
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,550
It's too spicy.

219
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,880
Cheers.

220
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,040
It's done.

221
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:23,350
I'm so sorry

222
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,470
that I live in your house

223
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,960
and often bother you.

224
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,880
It's okay.

225
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,430
After all,

226
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,550
I live on my own.

227
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,470
But you,

228
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,080
do you wanna keep escaping from your families?

229
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,430
Escaping

230
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,800
is not a good solution.

231
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,430
It's my own business.

232
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,550
Please don't comment on it.

233
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,470
Sorry, I just...

234
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,270
You just feel that since you lend me a hand,

235
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,880
you can judge my life.

236
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:56,800
I'll move.

237
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,230
I'll pay you back.

238
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,600
Sorry,

239
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,840
I didn't mean that.

240
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,470
Lin Wei

241
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,270
Sorry,

242
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm not intended.

243
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
I found it

244
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,430
by accident,

245
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,760
and I just got a glimpse.

246
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,000
I swear that I didn't finish it.

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I only read the page

248
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,350
which you wrote down

249
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,430
your preparation to express love to Qin Yiyue.

250
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,350
Please trust me.

251
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,230
It's OK.

252
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
If my words hurt you

253
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
and made you unhappy,

254
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,310
I can apologize.

255
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,040
Just live here.

256
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,470
I have to go.

257
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,110
Good bye.

258
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,310
Let me see you off.

259
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,150
Have you told her?

260
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,040
Nope.

261
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,960
I would like to say

262
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,150
but Zhou Ziyang chased her first.

263
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,599
She was really glad that day.

264
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,550
She said

265
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,310
she had a boyfriend

266
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,960
and she planned to study in German.

267
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,109
They broke up afterwards

268
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,390
and she didn't go to German.

269
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,270
I reckoned that it was a chance,

270
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,960
but I failed to grasp it.

271
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,920
That's He Qiaoyan's style.

272
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,270
Once he's determined, he'll work quickly.

273
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,680
You who hesitates is lost.

274
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,109
They two

275
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,350
will get married soon.

276
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,510
No, they've broken up.

277
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,840
Yiyue is coming to German tomorrow.

278
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,600
It's so weird.

279
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,110
I can tell that

280
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,960
He Qiaoyan is so

281
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,150
obsessed with Qin Yiyue.

282
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,000
Why do they break up?

283
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't know.

284
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,310
Since they are determined to

285
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,470
split with each other,

286
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:47,880
they must

287
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,470
have some reason.

288
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,960
Why don't you go to German with her?

289
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,350
You've missed two opportunities.

290
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,720
Now or never.

291
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,510
Good night.

292
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,920
Yiyue,

293
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,880
feel free to call me

294
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,190
if you meet troubles.

295
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,880
You can rely on us.

296
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,880
Can you come to German

297
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,350
as soon as I call you?

298
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,150
I would

299
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,960
if you need me.

300
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,550
Well, Ning Fang is a friend indeed.

301
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,470
Okay, guys,

302
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm not a kid.

303
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,640
I can handle issues by myself.

304
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,390
And you must take care of yourselves.

305
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,880
Call me when you arrive.

306
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,840
Yiyue, I'll miss you.

307
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,840
I'll miss you, too.

308
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,510
Hello?

309
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
What are you doing?

310
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,390
Seeing off Yiyue.

311
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,510
Call me later.

312
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,190
Is my cousin with you?

313
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,270
Why do you think he's here?

314
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,000
I can't find him.

315
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,190
You can't find him?

316
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,150
What do you mean?

317
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,800
I've called him several times,

318
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,840
but he didn't answer my phone.

319
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,310
I went to his home on this morning.

320
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,310
My aunt said

321
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,390
after last morning

322
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,550
he left from the Heshi Group,

323
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,000
he never contacted her.

324
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,390
He wasn't at home and didn't answer my phone.

325
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,600
I guess

326
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,150
he had some unscheduled work

327
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,230
or took a business trip.

328
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,270
Or he was not in the mood

329
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,150
and went to a bar.

330
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,800
It's usual for a grown man

331
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
to stay out all night.

332
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,880
Take it easy.

333
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,720
I'll hang up.

334
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,110
It's weird.

335
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,310
Never would he

336
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,390
let Xiaobao sleep at home alone.

337
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,310
Hello, aunt.

338
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
Wen Gu said He Qiaoyan disappeared.

339
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,270
What's wrong?

340
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,040
Did he go to visit you?

341
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,150
He didn't.

342
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,680
We just had one talk yesterday.

343
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,150
What did he said?

344
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,390
Nothing important.

345
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,080
What's the matter?

346
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,310
He got it.

347
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,510
Qiaoyan

348
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,470
Qiaoyan, it's not your fault.

349
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,000
There's always something wrong

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,390
with my wearable.

351
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
I've tried many methods

352
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,880
to repair it.

353
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,270
It's not the fault of software upgrade.

354
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,880
Maybe it doesn't work

355
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,550
because of the hardware conflict.

356
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,270
What's wrong?

357
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,760
My algorithm.

358
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
My algorithm is false.

359
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,230
Where's the fault?

360
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,760
It's my fault!

361
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,470
Qiaoyan

362
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,640
Listen,

363
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,270
every perfect product

364
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,600
has to go through thousands of trials

365
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,760
before being marketed.

366
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,470
There are so many products

367
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,960
and techniques in your company,

368
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,680
all can provide health service,

369
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,510
why do you

370
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,080
value the wearable so much?

371
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,840
It concerns me

372
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,190
because the wearable can

373
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,430
monitor people's pulse.

374
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,110
The pulse indicates life.

375
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,880
I wanna grasp the feeling of life.

376
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,800
Got it?

377
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,230
Like this?

378
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,040
Please go home with me.

379
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,270
Xiaobao need you.

380
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,430
So do I.

381
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,110
Qiaoyan

382
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,960
Leave me alone.

383
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,920
You should have been in German.

384
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,000
I canceled the plan.

385
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,430
I won't leave to German.

386
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,150
We've broken up.

387
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,550
Get off my case.

388
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Qiaoyan

389
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,640
Yiyue

390
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,960
I'm worrying about you.

391
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:53,960
Would you please tell me

392
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,550
what happened?

393
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,110
Five years ago,

394
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
He Qiaoyan had a car crash

395
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
when taking his brother' family out.

396
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,470
The couple died on the spot,

397
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,550
while Xiaobao and He Qiaoyan survived.

398
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:10,840
Since then,

399
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,390
he suffered from PTSD

400
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,150
and forgot the crash.

401
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,350
Now he knew the fact.

402
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,270
Ning Fang

403
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,880
As a psychologist,

404
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
you must have met

405
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,230
many similar cases.

406
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
Please tell me

407
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,840
what should I do to help him?

408
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,510
Six years ago, I met a patient

409
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,640
in the same condition.

410
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,430
Even till now,

411
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,230
he didn't recover

412
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,230
and his condition is getting worse.

413
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,270
What I could do

414
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,390
was to watch him

415
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,110
being tortured by the terrible memories.

416
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,920
Qiaoyan won't lose himself.

417
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,110
Yiyue

418
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,390
You are a psychologist, too.

419
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
You know how vulnerable

420
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
a man could be.

421
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
Make it clear.

422
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,640
I agree with He Qiaoyan.

423
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,640
You should go to German.

424
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,510
Now that he's in trouble,

425
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,720
I should support him.

426
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,550
He needs my help.

427
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,880
What could you do?

428
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,110
I...

429
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,230
I'll make it.

430
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:11,960
Er...

431
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,390
Yiyue

432
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,230
It may cost

433
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,190
the rest of your life

434
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,920
to help him.

435
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:18,920
And the results can be worse.

436
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,800
It can ruin your life.

437
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,110
Stop it.

438
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,680
I've made up my mind.

439
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,000
Just for him,

440
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,680
you can give up

441
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,550
your dream.

442
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,880
In my heart

443
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,190
I'm sure that

444
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,760
a future without He Qiaoyan

445
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,110
is awful.

446
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,800
I've explained

447
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,430
to Dr. Huang.

448
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,470
I'll keep working

449
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,390
until someone

450
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,840
take over my role.

451
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,350
But I won't go to German.

452
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,390
Communication technique is advanced now.

453
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,040
Video call is as effective

454
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
as face to face talks.

455
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,430
Wen Gu told me

456
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,720
the accident of Mr. He.

457
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,000
It's really

458
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,640
a horrible experience for him.

459
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,080
He will make it.

460
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,310
I believe him.

461
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,800
Are you sure to be with him?

462
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,920
His pessimism

463
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,550
is like a black hole,

464
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,600
it will devour you

465
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,470
if you approach him.

466
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,680
It's OK.

467
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,270
I'm full of energy.

468
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,680
Devouring me

469
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,470
is not easy.

470
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,430
You can call me

471
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,430
if you need me.

472
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,510
Being with you,

473
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,040
he'll be OK.

474
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,550
I'm hungry. Can you make noodles for me?

475
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,600
Well, sure.

476
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,350
Love ya.

477
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,840
Mommy is back!

478
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,640
Good morning. I made breakfast for you.

479
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:26,760
Xiaobao

480
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,640
she's not you mom.

481
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,350
She's...

482
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,550
Wash up first.

483
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,760
Let's dig in, boy.

484
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,150
Xiaobao,

485
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,040
dad has some troubles recently.

486
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,800
It takes time to solve it.

487
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,270
Let's wait for him.

488
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,760
How is it going?

489
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,800
Today I have something

490
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,350
to discuss with you.

491
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,350
I'm listening.

492
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,430
I overheard

493
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,550
Mr. Zhang's phone.

494
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,230
He said he had sent 10 million yuan

495
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,960
to help his brother pay off debts

496
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,800
on August 11 five years ago.

497
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,760
Ten million yuan?

498
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,760
He's a driver.

499
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,960
Where did he get so much money?

500
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,270
What's more,

501
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,040
that day

502
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,880
happened to be

503
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,510
the day after their car crash.

504
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,470
You mean

505
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,680
that brake failure

506
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,920
was sabotage?

507
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,270
Are you fine?

508
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,640
Are you hungry?

509
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,640
I cooked for you.

510
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,110
But it's cold.

511
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,960
I microwave it now.

512
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,350
You should have some.

513
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,760
Your hand hurts?

514
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,270
I burned it when cooking.

515
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,270
It's OK.

516
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,080
I'll get you medicine.

517
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,510
Don't bother.

518
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,000
Qiaoyan

519
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,470
I have one thing

520
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,680
that want you to do.

521
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,680
It may be difficult for you.

522
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,190
I wish

523
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,310
you can try to

524
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,150
recall the accident.

525
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,800
I don't believe that

526
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,150
it's your fault.

527
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:23,920
Are you not believing the fact,

528
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,350
or unwilling to accept it?

529
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,080
You take it the wrong way.

530
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,150
I've said

531
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,270
I didn't want to see you.

532
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,840
If you continue to come here,

533
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,800
we will move.

534
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,230
It's late.

535
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,230
Come back home.

536
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:14,639
I can get him.

537
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,469
It's wounding for him

538
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,389
to recall the accident.

539
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,040
Yiyue

540
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,880
do you really reckon

541
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,920
that it's not his fault?

542
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,230
The police said the brakes went wrong

543
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,679
and the roads were slick with rain.

544
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,110
But he's a good driver.

545
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:35,920
He had never

546
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,350
sped before.

547
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,679
There must be other reasons

548
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,639
for that accident.

549
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,550
Only by finding out it

550
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,840
can release him for the suffering.

551
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,389
As years passed,

552
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:45,110
we can't find

553
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,510
useful information.

554
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:48,920
Now only He himself

555
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,110
can be his saviour.

556
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,150
But Mr. He

557
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,840
doesn't have the guts to

558
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,639
recall the memories of that day.

559
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,720
You psychologists

560
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,760
should have solutions

561
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,230
to his condition.

562
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,840
It's up to him.

563
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,000
If he doesn't wanna recall it,

564
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,600
we have no solution.

565
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,430
I've told you

566
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,390
that don't come here.

567
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,510
We'll move tomorrow.

568
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,510
It's me.

569
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,470
Dr. Ning, what are you doing here?

570
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,960
Yiyue is so tired

571
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,470
that she's resting at home.

572
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,310
After all,

573
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,720
she's not your wife.

574
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,270
It's not her responsibility

575
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,470
to help you.

576
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,430
What do you mean?

577
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,430
You said you would move.

578
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,920
Then do what you said.

579
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,960
Since you decide

580
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,110
to leave Yiyue,

581
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,470
just do it.

582
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,640
It's none of your business.

583
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,470
This afternoon,

584
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,150
I'll express love to Yiyue

585
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,600
beside the lake in our campus.

586
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,230
Do you think

587
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,110
she will accept?

588
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,270
Accept it or not,

589
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,270
it doesn't matter.

590
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,550
I want to express

591
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,720
my love to her.

592
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,960
I can wait she

593
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,470
to accept me.

594
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,470
If you move,

595
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,600
she can say goodbye to the past

596
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,550
and live a better life.

597
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,350
I'll persuade her to leave to German.

598
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,800
And I'll go with her.

599
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,600
I'll help her

600
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,760
to pursue her dream.

601
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,040
Good for you.

602
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,000
Wish your happiness.

603
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,230
Where are we going?

604
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,110
You'll know when you get here.

605
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,000
Yiyue, would you like to go with me?
