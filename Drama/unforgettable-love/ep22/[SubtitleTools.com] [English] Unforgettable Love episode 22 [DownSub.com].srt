1
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,160
Unforgettable Love

2
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,630
Xiaobao's parents passed away

3
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,630
on the way

4
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,520
to the hospital.

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,590
Then Xiaobao was a baby.

6
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,400
At that time,

7
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,230
no one could help me to handle this.

8
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,630
Then you woke up

9
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,590
but couldn't

10
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,080
recall the accident.

11
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,670
After that we had no clue.

12
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,360
Even the police's investigation stalled.

13
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,710
I could only tell you that

14
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,960
your accident happened

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,000
on the way to visit your brother.

16
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,560
So did it have anything to do

17
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,360
with Yiyue?

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
On that day,

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,630
Dr. Qin passed by

20
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,190
and saved Xiaobao.

21
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,560
At that time you were thrown outside the car,

22
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,880
so she didn't notice you.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,000
But you,

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,840
though drowsy,

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,230
might watched her dark figure

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,230
and heard her voice.

27
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,920
So the reason you want to expel her

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,150
is to prevent her from

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,790
reminding me of this accident.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,150
Qiaoyan,

31
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,520
this is also the reason

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,670
why I've been pestered

33
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,150
by Zhang Cheng in these years.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,270
For our family

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
and Xiaobao,

36
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,630
you should calm down.

37
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,920
Aunt,

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,790
what if Xiaobao knows

39
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,630
that I have something to do

40
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,520
with his parents' death.

41
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,270
Do you really think

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,040
he can regard me as his dad?

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
Hi, mom.

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Yiyue,

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,480
are you at home?

46
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,590
I'm coming to see you two with your dad.

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
We two?

48
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,150
Where are you now?

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Close to your home.

50
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,630
He Qiaoyan's home?

51
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,480
Yes,

52
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,840
but I'd like to call it yours.

53
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
Mom, come back now.

54
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,360
I have something to tell you.

55
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
We are almost there. Talk about it later.

56
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,560
It's not my home now.

57
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,590
Do you mean

58
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,270
you plan to get married

59
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,040
just for Xiaobao's illness,

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,790
don't you?

61
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,710
Yes, but I don't know

62
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,190
from which moment,

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,560
we gradually fall in love with each other.

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,920
So

65
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,630
we decided to

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,399
start dating.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,440
And now,

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,000
why did you break up?

69
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,269
What's more,

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,560
why do you want to go abroad

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
after breaking up with him?

72
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,750
Because of him?

73
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,670
Did he force you?

74
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,190
I'll stand up for you.

75
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,230
Calm down, dad.

76
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,630
It's not his fault.

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,000
It's mine.

78
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,960
You meet your crush?

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,040
No.

80
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,150
But it was I

81
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,480
that want to be unattached.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,960
I hurt him.

83
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,710
And he was so depressed.

84
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,590
Please don't bother him.

85
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,560
What...

86
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,670
Alright, Lao Qin.

87
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,360
Girl, if you are not in the mood,

88
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,520
you can vent your depression.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,080
You don't need to pretend to be fine.

90
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,000
It's OK to be not OK.

91
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,190
I'm fine, mom.

92
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,670
Look at me,

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,480
I'm happy.

94
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
And studying in German

95
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,840
is always my dream.

96
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,400
Take it easy.

97
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,750
Don't cry.

98
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,520
Yiyue,

99
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,230
we'll support your decision.

100
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,790
But in German,

101
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,960
you should take care of yourself.

102
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,360
If you are bullied,

103
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,840
remember to call us.

104
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,440
We'll fly to German.

105
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,520
Come on,

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,590
nobody can bully me.

107
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,270
Trust me.

108
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,080
Mr. Wen

109
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,310
please sign here.

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,630
Just put there.

111
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,630
By the way,

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,750
please get the market director for me.

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,840
Alright.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,790
Something wrong with the contract?

115
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,400
I want him to win this market,

116
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,750
not to bargain with loss.

117
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,080
I was pleased to hear that

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,040
you've made a deal with Wenmei Group.

119
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,110
I used to be idle.

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,270
But now that I decide to do it,

121
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
I'll be responsible.

122
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,040
Anything else?

123
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
Could you please tell me

124
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,270
that what makes you

125
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,790
change so much?

126
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,400
So diligent.

127
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,360
It's surprising.

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,080
It's you.

129
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,670
I want you know that

130
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,230
I'm not so bad.

131
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,190
I'm a grown man.

132
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,670
You can trust me.

133
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,480
But I'm not someone.

134
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,040
You can be yourself.

135
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
Why do you care about what I think of you?

136
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,790
I do care about your thoughts.

137
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
You rubbished me.

138
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,670
And you accused me of

139
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,630
a good-for nothing.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,920
It hurt me.

141
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,630
There's no bet,

142
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,150
no joke or performance.

143
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,040
I wanna take everything serious,

144
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,310
including you.

145
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,960
Do you want to

146
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,110
raise my salary?

147
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,080
No.

148
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,670
Well, no way.

149
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,150
I'm fine.

150
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,710
If you can't help taking pills,

151
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,360
you can do something

152
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,590
to distract attention.

153
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,840
It's good for you.

154
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
I'm leaving.

155
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,920
Bye.

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,470
Visit the customers with me tonight.

157
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
You ought to be hate to

158
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,230
visit customers the most.

159
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,350
At eleven o'clock tonight.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,550
Sorry,

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,840
I can't company you.

162
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Why not?

163
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,390
Yiyue is leaving tomorrow.

164
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,080
I've promised to

165
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,640
have dinner with her.

166
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,080
Where is she going?

167
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,920
Don't you know

168
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,350
that Yiyue had broken up with Mr. He.

169
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,470
She is leaving to German tomorrow.

170
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,080
He said nothing.

171
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,640
It's too late.

172
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,600
I should leave now.

173
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,040
You said you would cook today

174
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,230
to surprise us.

175
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,230
Just take it, sir.

176
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,600
I'm too tired to cook.

177
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm exhausted!

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,190
Washing vegetables is tiring enough.

179
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,390
It's called family hotpot.

180
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,600
Just help yourself.

181
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,840
Are you sure

182
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,960
that the ingredients are clean?

183
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,550
Is it safe

184
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,800
to add the raw and cooked together?

185
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,470
What's more,

186
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:31,920
after dinner,

187
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,230
how do we remove

188
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,080
the odour of the hotpot?

189
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,800
We can't eat spicy food today.

190
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,110
Put it away.

191
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,600
Drink more hot water.

192
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,470
Are you alright?

193
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,720
Ummm,

194
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,600
can we start now?

195
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,550
It's boiled.

196
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,600
Let's dig in!

197
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,110
Why don't you start?

198
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,680
Here you are.

199
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,080
Since you don't want to eat,

200
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,920
shall we have a drink

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
to wish my dream come true?

202
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,550
Come on.

203
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,190
Alcohol

204
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,800
cannot bring happiness

205
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,470
nor remove sufferings.

206
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,880
You know that

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,150
we two

208
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
are from different world.

209
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,880
Cheers.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,920
Toast to our dream.

211
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,040
Qin Yiyue

212
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,600
I agree to break up.

213
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,000
Best wish to your dream.

214
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,430
Let's drink!

215
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,470
Ruowei

216
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,110
the beer is

217
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,150
too spicy!

218
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,550
It's too spicy.

219
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,880
Cheers.

220
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,040
It's done.

221
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,350
I'm so sorry

222
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,470
that I live in your house

223
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,960
and often bother you.

224
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,880
It's okay.

225
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,430
After all,

226
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,550
I live on my own.

227
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,470
But you,

228
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,080
do you wanna keep escaping from your families?

229
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,430
Escaping

230
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,800
is not a good solution.

231
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,430
It's my own business.

232
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,550
Please don't comment on it.

233
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,470
Sorry, I just...

234
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,270
You just feel that since you lend me a hand,

235
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,880
you can judge my life.

236
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:04,800
I'll move.

237
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,230
I'll pay you back.

238
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,600
Sorry,

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,840
I didn't mean that.

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,470
Lin Wei

241
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,270
Sorry,

242
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm not intended.

243
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,080
I found it

244
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,430
by accident,

245
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,760
and I just got a glimpse.

246
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,000
I swear that I didn't finish it.

247
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I only read the page

248
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,350
which you wrote down

249
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,430
your preparation to express love to Qin Yiyue.

250
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,350
Please trust me.

251
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,230
It's OK.

252
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,000
If my words hurt you

253
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,960
and made you unhappy,

254
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,310
I can apologize.

255
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,040
Just live here.

256
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,470
I have to go.

257
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,110
Good bye.

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,310
Let me see you off.

259
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,150
Have you told her?

260
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,040
Nope.

261
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
I would like to say

262
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,150
but Zhou Ziyang chased her first.

263
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,599
She was really glad that day.

264
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,550
She said

265
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,310
she had a boyfriend

266
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,960
and she planned to study in German.

267
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,109
They broke up afterwards

268
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,390
and she didn't go to German.

269
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,270
I reckoned that it was a chance,

270
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,960
but I failed to grasp it.

271
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,920
That's He Qiaoyan's style.

272
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,270
Once he's determined, he'll work quickly.

273
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,680
You who hesitates is lost.

274
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,109
They two

275
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,350
will get married soon.

276
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,510
No, they've broken up.

277
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,840
Yiyue is coming to German tomorrow.

278
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,600
It's so weird.

279
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,110
I can tell that

280
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,960
He Qiaoyan is so

281
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,150
obsessed with Qin Yiyue.

282
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,000
Why do they break up?

283
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know.

284
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,310
Since they are determined to

285
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,470
split with each other,

286
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:55,880
they must

287
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,470
have some reason.

288
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,960
Why don't you go to German with her?

289
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,350
You've missed two opportunities.

290
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,720
Now or never.

291
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,510
Good night.

292
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,920
Yiyue,

293
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,880
feel free to call me

294
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,190
if you meet troubles.

295
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,880
You can rely on us.

296
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,880
Can you come to German

297
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,350
as soon as I call you?

298
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,150
I would

299
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,960
if you need me.

300
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,550
Well, Ning Fang is a friend indeed.

301
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,470
Okay, guys,

302
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm not a kid.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,640
I can handle issues by myself.

304
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,390
And you must take care of yourselves.

305
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,880
Call me when you arrive.

306
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:44,840
Yiyue, I'll miss you.

307
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,840
I'll miss you, too.

308
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,510
Hello?

309
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,920
What are you doing?

310
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,390
Seeing off Yiyue.

311
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,510
Call me later.

312
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,190
Is my cousin with you?

313
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,270
Why do you think he's here?

314
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't find him.

315
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,190
You can't find him?

316
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,150
What do you mean?

317
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,800
I've called him several times,

318
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,840
but he didn't answer my phone.

319
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,310
I went to his home on this morning.

320
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,310
My aunt said

321
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,390
after last morning

322
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,550
he left from the Heshi Group,

323
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,000
he never contacted her.

324
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,390
He wasn't at home and didn't answer my phone.

325
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,600
I guess

326
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,150
he had some unscheduled work

327
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,230
or took a business trip.

328
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,270
Or he was not in the mood

329
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,150
and went to a bar.

330
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,800
It's usual for a grown man

331
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
to stay out all night.

332
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
Take it easy.

333
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,720
I'll hang up.

334
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,110
It's weird.

335
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,310
Never would he

336
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,390
let Xiaobao sleep at home alone.

337
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,310
Hello, aunt.

338
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,080
Wen Gu said He Qiaoyan disappeared.

339
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,270
What's wrong?

340
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,040
Did he go to visit you?

341
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,150
He didn't.

342
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,680
We just had one talk yesterday.

343
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,150
What did he said?

344
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,390
Nothing important.

345
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,080
What's the matter?

346
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,310
He got it.

347
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,510
Qiaoyan

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,470
Qiaoyan, it's not your fault.

349
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,000
There's always something wrong

350
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,390
with my wearable.

351
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
I've tried many methods

352
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,880
to repair it.

353
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,270
It's not the fault of software upgrade.

354
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,880
Maybe it doesn't work

355
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,550
because of the hardware conflict.

356
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,270
What's wrong?

357
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,760
My algorithm.

358
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
My algorithm is false.

359
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,230
Where's the fault?

360
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,760
It's my fault!

361
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,470
Qiaoyan

362
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,640
Listen,

363
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,270
every perfect product

364
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,600
has to go through thousands of trials

365
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,760
before being marketed.

366
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,470
There are so many products

367
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,960
and techniques in your company,

368
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,680
all can provide health service,

369
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,510
why do you

370
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,080
value the wearable so much?

371
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,840
It concerns me

372
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,190
because the wearable can

373
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,430
monitor people's pulse.

374
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,110
The pulse indicates life.

375
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,880
I wanna grasp the feeling of life.

376
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
Got it?

377
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,230
Like this?

378
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,040
Please go home with me.

379
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,270
Xiaobao need you.

380
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,430
So do I.

381
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,110
Qiaoyan

382
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,960
Leave me alone.

383
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
You should have been in German.

384
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,000
I canceled the plan.

385
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,430
I won't leave to German.

386
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,150
We've broken up.

387
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,550
Get off my case.

388
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,840
Qiaoyan

389
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Yiyue

390
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,960
I'm worrying about you.

391
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:01,960
Would you please tell me

392
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,550
what happened?

393
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,110
Five years ago,

394
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,640
He Qiaoyan had a car crash

395
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,080
when taking his brother' family out.

396
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,470
The couple died on the spot,

397
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,550
while Xiaobao and He Qiaoyan survived.

398
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,840
Since then,

399
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,390
he suffered from PTSD

400
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,150
and forgot the crash.

401
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,350
Now he knew the fact.

402
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,270
Ning Fang

403
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,880
As a psychologist,

404
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,880
you must have met

405
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,230
many similar cases.

406
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,920
Please tell me

407
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,840
what should I do to help him?

408
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,510
Six years ago, I met a patient

409
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,640
in the same condition.

410
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,430
Even till now,

411
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,230
he didn't recover

412
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,230
and his condition is getting worse.

413
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,270
What I could do

414
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,390
was to watch him

415
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,110
being tortured by the terrible memories.

416
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,920
Qiaoyan won't lose himself.

417
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,110
Yiyue

418
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,390
You are a psychologist, too.

419
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,000
You know how vulnerable

420
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
a man could be.

421
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
Make it clear.

422
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,640
I agree with He Qiaoyan.

423
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,640
You should go to German.

424
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:07,510
Now that he's in trouble,

425
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,720
I should support him.

426
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,550
He needs my help.

427
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,880
What could you do?

428
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,110
I...

429
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,230
I'll make it.

430
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:19,960
Er...

431
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,390
Yiyue

432
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,230
It may cost

433
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,190
the rest of your life

434
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,920
to help him.

435
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:26,920
And the results can be worse.

436
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,800
It can ruin your life.

437
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,110
Stop it.

438
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,680
I've made up my mind.

439
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,000
Just for him,

440
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,680
you can give up

441
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,550
your dream.

442
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,880
In my heart

443
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,190
I'm sure that

444
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
a future without He Qiaoyan

445
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,110
is awful.

446
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,800
I've explained

447
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,430
to Dr. Huang.

448
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,470
I'll keep working

449
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,390
until someone

450
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,840
take over my role.

451
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,350
But I won't go to German.

452
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,390
Communication technique is advanced now.

453
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,040
Video call is as effective

454
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
as face to face talks.

455
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,430
Wen Gu told me

456
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,720
the accident of Mr. He.

457
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
It's really

458
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,640
a horrible experience for him.

459
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,080
He will make it.

460
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,310
I believe him.

461
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,800
Are you sure to be with him?

462
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,920
His pessimism

463
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,550
is like a black hole,

464
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,600
it will devour you

465
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,470
if you approach him.

466
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,680
It's OK.

467
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,270
I'm full of energy.

468
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,680
Devouring me

469
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,470
is not easy.

470
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,430
You can call me

471
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,430
if you need me.

472
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,510
Being with you,

473
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,040
he'll be OK.

474
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,550
I'm hungry. Can you make noodles for me?

475
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Well, sure.

476
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,350
Love ya.

477
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,840
Mommy is back!

478
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,640
Good morning. I made breakfast for you.

479
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,760
Xiaobao

480
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,640
she's not you mom.

481
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,350
She's...

482
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,550
Wash up first.

483
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,760
Let's dig in, boy.

484
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,150
Xiaobao,

485
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,040
dad has some troubles recently.

486
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,800
It takes time to solve it.

487
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,270
Let's wait for him.

488
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,760
How is it going?

489
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,800
Today I have something

490
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,350
to discuss with you.

491
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,350
I'm listening.

492
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,430
I overheard

493
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,550
Mr. Zhang's phone.

494
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,230
He said he had sent 10 million yuan

495
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,960
to help his brother pay off debts

496
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,800
on August 11 five years ago.

497
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,760
Ten million yuan?

498
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,760
He's a driver.

499
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,960
Where did he get so much money?

500
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,270
What's more,

501
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,040
that day

502
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
happened to be

503
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,510
the day after their car crash.

504
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,470
You mean

505
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,680
that brake failure

506
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,920
was sabotage?

507
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,270
Are you fine?

508
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,640
Are you hungry?

509
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,640
I cooked for you.

510
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:48,110
But it's cold.

511
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,960
I microwave it now.

512
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,350
You should have some.

513
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,760
Your hand hurts?

514
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,270
I burned it when cooking.

515
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,270
It's OK.

516
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
I'll get you medicine.

517
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,510
Don't bother.

518
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,000
Qiaoyan

519
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,470
I have one thing

520
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,680
that want you to do.

521
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,680
It may be difficult for you.

522
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,190
I wish

523
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,310
you can try to

524
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,150
recall the accident.

525
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,800
I don't believe that

526
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,150
it's your fault.

527
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,920
Are you not believing the fact,

528
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,350
or unwilling to accept it?

529
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,080
You take it the wrong way.

530
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,150
I've said

531
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,270
I didn't want to see you.

532
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,840
If you continue to come here,

533
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,800
we will move.

534
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,230
It's late.

535
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,230
Come back home.

536
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,639
I can get him.

537
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:25,469
It's wounding for him

538
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,389
to recall the accident.

539
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,040
Yiyue

540
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,880
do you really reckon

541
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,920
that it's not his fault?

542
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,230
The police said the brakes went wrong

543
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,679
and the roads were slick with rain.

544
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,110
But he's a good driver.

545
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:43,920
He had never

546
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,350
sped before.

547
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,679
There must be other reasons

548
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,639
for that accident.

549
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,550
Only by finding out it

550
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,840
can release him for the suffering.

551
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,389
As years passed,

552
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,110
we can't find

553
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,510
useful information.

554
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:56,920
Now only He himself

555
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,110
can be his saviour.

556
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,150
But Mr. He

557
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,840
doesn't have the guts to

558
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,639
recall the memories of that day.

559
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,720
You psychologists

560
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,760
should have solutions

561
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,230
to his condition.

562
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,840
It's up to him.

563
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,000
If he doesn't wanna recall it,

564
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,600
we have no solution.

565
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,430
I've told you

566
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,390
that don't come here.

567
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,510
We'll move tomorrow.

568
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,510
It's me.

569
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,470
Dr. Ning, what are you doing here?

570
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,960
Yiyue is so tired

571
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,470
that she's resting at home.

572
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,310
After all,

573
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,720
she's not your wife.

574
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,270
It's not her responsibility

575
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,470
to help you.

576
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,430
What do you mean?

577
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,430
You said you would move.

578
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,920
Then do what you said.

579
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,960
Since you decide

580
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,110
to leave Yiyue,

581
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,470
just do it.

582
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,640
It's none of your business.

583
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,470
This afternoon,

584
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,150
I'll express love to Yiyue

585
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,600
beside the lake in our campus.

586
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,230
Do you think

587
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,110
she will accept?

588
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,270
Accept it or not,

589
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,270
it doesn't matter.

590
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,550
I want to express

591
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,720
my love to her.

592
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,960
I can wait she

593
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,470
to accept me.

594
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,470
If you move,

595
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,600
she can say goodbye to the past

596
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,550
and live a better life.

597
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,350
I'll persuade her to leave to German.

598
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,800
And I'll go with her.

599
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,600
I'll help her

600
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,760
to pursue her dream.

601
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:58,040
Good for you.

602
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,000
Wish your happiness.

603
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,230
Where are we going?

604
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,110
You'll know when you get here.

605
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,000
Yiyue, would you like to go with me?
