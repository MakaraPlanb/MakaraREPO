Unforgettable Love
EP20

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,190
Qiaoyan,

3
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,360
You've met that girl.

4
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,190
You just forgot her.

5
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,360
But I hope

6
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,479
you'll never think of her.

7
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,479
I hope you will always

8
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,000
regard her as a person appeared in your dream.

9
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,270
Let's go.

10
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,479
Yiyue,

11
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,520
I've asked for leave for Xiaobao.

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
Today, Xiaobao and I

13
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,840
will go and cheer for you.

14
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,750
Cheer for me?

15
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
How did you forget?

16
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,670
I made an appointment with our aunt.

17
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,110
You're going to play golf today

18
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,840
Right, play golf.

19
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,440
Let's get changed first

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Yiyue

21
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,360
Are you not feeling well?

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,710
If so, we can do it another day

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,790
No, I'm fine.

24
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,040
Sure?

25
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,670
Let's go and get changed.

26
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,840
Good shot, aunt.

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,960
Yiyue, I heard from Qiaoyan that

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,670
you've been practicing lately.

29
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,040
Come on, swing!

30
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,190
Come on!

31
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,710
Remember the action tips.

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
Trust yourself.

33
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,520
Mr. He, the car to pick up Xiaobao has arrived.

34
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
OK.

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,110
Aunt, I'll see Xiaobao off.

36
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,440
Come on.

37
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,079
Come here.

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,190
Let's go!

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,590
They really love you.

40
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,960
You must love them, too.

41
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,520
Am I right?

42
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
Aunt.

43
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,040
Don't worry.

44
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll do what you want.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,080
Leave him.

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,960
I love him.

47
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,150
I wish him well, too.

48
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:29,959
How's it going?

49
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,440
Is she satisfied?

50
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,270
It seems that the result is not satisfactory.

51
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,560
Never say die,

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,110
practice more.

53
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,400
You can do it.

54
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
What's wrong？

55
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,110
Qiaoyan

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Let's break up.

57
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,400
Are you joking with me again?

58
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,040
I'm afraid it will stun Xiaobao.

59
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,880
So,

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
Please.

61
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,560
Slowly

62
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,150
make it clear to Xiaobao.

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm leaving now.

64
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,750
You afraid it will stun Xiaobao.

65
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,440
Aren't you afraid to stun me?

66
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,040
Did aunt say something again?

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Have your dinner.

68
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,310
Dad.

69
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,590
How about giving mom a seat?

70
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,790
Today is the anniversary of her death.

71
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,920
Your mother was a vegetarian.

72
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,480
Look at this.

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,630
Oh, I forgot.

74
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,040
You have filial piety.

75
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,790
Remember to go home every year today.

76
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,750
Of course, I'm very sensible.

77
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,000
Before your mother passed away,

78
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,590
I had a fight with her.

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,230
Now think about it.

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
What for?

81
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,630
There's no estrangement for a family that can't

82
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,710
be tided over.

83
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,000
If I haven't sulk with her,

84
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,150
call her back,

85
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,440
and make her a meal,

86
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,270
under the same roof,

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,560
she would get over it.

88
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,920
As a girl,

89
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,040
I'm more useful

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
than ten boys like you.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
I don't have 100 thousand RMB.

92
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,520
You won't even get 10 RMB.

93
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,190
How can a family like this?

94
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,880
Son, when you're not busy,

95
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,270
You'd better move back home.

96
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,270
Dad,

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,920
Your Lake Villa.

98
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,880
Could you give it to me?

99
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,150
What?

100
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,520
You're tired of the house you live now?

101
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,230
No, it's useful for me.

102
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,920
Look what I brought you.

103
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,110
You scared me!

104
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,230
Why are you crying?

105
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,360
You, in the middle of the night

106
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,310
don't company with your Mr. He.

107
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,190
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,520
I'm here

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,190
holding you a pajama party.

110
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,360
Wait me a minute.

111
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,630
I'll go back to my room first

112
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,750
and change my pajamas.

113
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,190
Last time somebody

114
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
took all your clothes

115
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
away.

116
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,040
You're right.

117
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,440
Good sisters share their pajamas.

118
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,590
I'll put on your pajamas

119
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,190
No!

120
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,720
No, I have to.

121
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,680
Also,

122
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,350
You mask,

123
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,390
Give me one, too.

124
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,000
What happened to you?

125
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,230
Stop pretending.

126
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,190
When you hum,

127
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,350
I'll know what you

128
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,309
want to do.

129
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,309
So,

130
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,799
what you can see

131
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,799
in my eyes?

132
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,510
Smudged eyeliner.

133
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,720
Lovelorn.

134
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,550
You broke up with He Qiaoyan?

135
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,840
Really?

136
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,960
You're going to drive me nuts, aren't you

137
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,840
Why did you suddenly break up？

138
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,550
Two days ago, you two

139
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,310
were close as same

140
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,800
as the conjoined baby,

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
weren't you?

142
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,270
Don't ask.

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,760
Even you ask,

144
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,110
I won't tell you.

145
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,390
You cheated on him.

146
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,110
No.

147
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,350
With you stupid brain,

148
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,270
no way.

149
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,040
He Qiaoyan cheated on you?

150
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,720
Ruowei.

151
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,310
For modern man and woman,

152
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,270
falling in love and breaking up

153
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,230
are normal things.

154
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,080
Does it have to be so vulgar

155
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,880
and dramatic?

156
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
I and He Qiaoyan,

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,800
we are out of step with each other.

158
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,880
It was a very peaceful

159
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,270
and delight break up.

160
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,350
Is it OK?

161
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,150
Come on, Miss.

162
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,760
Just Relax.

163
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,350
How about a bunch of meat?

164
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,550
I'm sleepy, Yue'er.

165
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,510
Let me lie down for a while.

166
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,000
Who is it in the early morning?

167
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,510
Coming!

168
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,230
Good morning.

169
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,390
Don't come to me again.

170
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,310
Let me in,

171
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,310
or you come home with me.

172
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,550
You are own choice.

173
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,880
I've already said what I would say.

174
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,430
Xiaobao

175
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,110
Drunk again.

176
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,680
Were you drunk?

177
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,880
It's none of your business.

178
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,350
Every time you got drunk

179
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,190
are very funny.

180
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,960
Of course.

181
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,600
She's a famous

182
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
performing artist after drinking.

183
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,000
See me a passer-by, please continue,

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:44,880
Let's go.

185
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,840
You arranged it.

186
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,840
Praise each other every day.

187
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,430
Hold me.

188
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,390
You arrange this, too

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,430
Before going out every day,

190
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,190
we all need to give each other a loving hug.

191
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,310
I need to wash.

192
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,550
Please leave.

193
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,960
What's going on?

194
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,470
After breaking up, he came

195
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,550
and brought you breakfast.

196
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,510
How could I know what's going on?

197
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,270
I see, you two,

198
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,110
in a couple of days,

199
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,550
are too boring,

200
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,840
so looking for trouble.

201
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,760
Don't go out.

202
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,510
Why can't I go out?

203
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,110
What can I say to him?

204
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,080
Should I say, we broke up,

205
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,350
but we can be brother?

206
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,390
Do you think he came here today

207
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,150
to be your brother?

208
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,720
I'm really out of your business

209
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,000
I have to go to work.

210
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,270
Don't go out.

211
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,470
Tell me,

212
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,270
Mr. He,

213
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,510
what does he like about you?

214
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,190
I

215
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,080
Isn't that charming?

216
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,600
Glamorous.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,720
Fashionable clothes and charming taste.

218
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,600
Especially these two dark circles

219
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,880
It's almost on the ground.

220
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,230
It's the finishing touch.

221
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,110
I am leaving.

222
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,110
I don't have dark circles.

223
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,310
Mr. He,

224
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,270
I am going to work.

225
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,390
OK.

226
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,600
Qin Yiyue, are you crazy?

227
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,040
What are you doing?

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,080
But it looks pretty good.

229
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,150
We can have breakfast now.

230
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,640
We agreed to have breakfast

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
What do you want on earth?

232
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,150
Bring my girlfriend Breakfast.

233
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,550
We've broken up.

234
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,000
That's what you thought.

235
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,110
I didn't agree.

236
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,430
Does this

237
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,760
still need your consent?

238
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,000
Article 9 of the Love Contract

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,080
clearly defines,

240
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,680
either party

241
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,270
is not allowed to break up unilaterally.

242
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,270
So,

243
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,310
So how you can agree?

244
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
Have breakfast.

245
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,000
If I finish this, you will agree.

246
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,000
Ok.

247
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,270
Take it easy.

248
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,000
Eating too fast is not good for digestion.

249
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,000
Finish breakfast before the sand glass finished.

250
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,150
It can't be early or late

251
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,599
That's the last piece.

252
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,079
Xiaobao Xiaobao

253
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,760
Don't do that.

254
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
Spit it out, spit it out.

255
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,390
You are very good at teaching.

256
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,109
Is it enough?

257
00:17:29,109 --> 00:17:30,310
If it's not enough, I'll make you another breakfast.

258
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,109
You!

259
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,040
Take Xiaobao to school.

260
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,960
I will take the bus.

261
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,430
Go by myself.

262
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,110
Xiaobao is still there.

263
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,150
Say hello to him.

264
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
I walk with you to work.

265
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,110
You go by yourself

266
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,080
You see that, too

267
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,600
My car took Xiaobao to school.

268
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,390
Take a taxi.

269
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,550
I can't.

270
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,960
I'll do it for you.

271
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,350
I never take a taxi.

272
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,680
Online car-hailing is the same.

273
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,960
Stand here by yourself.

274
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,350
Not bad.

275
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,110
What do you want on earth?

276
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,350
Take you to work. What else can I do?

277
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,760
The bike is a little small

278
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,000
But there's no problem for two.

279
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Mr. He, my bike is not suitable for you.

280
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,510
You'd better take your luxury car.

281
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,310
Who said that? No problem.

282
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,390
Move out.

283
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,720
-Get out of the way. -I said I could.

284
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,270
Come on, I'll take you.

285
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,760
Hey,

286
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,720
I'll go first.

287
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
If you want to send me, Mr. He.

288
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,600
Take your time.

289
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,840
How much is your motorbike. I'll buy it.

290
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,150
Are you insane?

291
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,640
How much is your bike, Madam.

292
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
I'll take it.

293
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,000
Twenty thousand.

294
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,840
Good.

295
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,310
I'll transfer it to you.

296
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,550
Transfer.

297
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,470
I want your hat, too.

298
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,040
Buy one and get one free!

299
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,150
Thank you!

300
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,800
Qin Yiyue.

301
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,760
Yiyue, wait for me.

302
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,190
Yiyue!

303
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
If my behavior

304
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,230
could make you happy.

305
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,960
I can keep them all the time.

306
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,040
Don't flatter yourself.

307
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,110
Let me go.

308
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,230
Just one minute.

309
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,800
Qin Yiyue, please listen to me.

310
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,000
I won't let you go.

311
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,510
I won't agree to break up with you.

312
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,720
In recent days,

313
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,390
You can live in Yang Ruowei's house.

314
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,150
It's like taking a vacation for yourself

315
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,310
But for breakfast and dinner,

316
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,680
you have to take with me.

317
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,430
I have to pick you up to and from work.

318
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,600
And the most important thing,

319
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,510
weekly appointment is

320
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,720
as usual.

321
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Why should I listen to you?

322
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,270
You'd better listen to me.

323
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,080
Otherwise it's going to get really troublesome.

324
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,390
Are you threatening me?

325
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,230
All right, go to work.

326
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,720
Don't think too much.

327
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,350
I

328
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,000
You what?

329
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,800
I

330
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,840
Mr. He, I come to meet you.

331
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,230
OK.

332
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,000
Go ahead.

333
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,310
Wait for me to pick you up after work.

334
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,000
Just in time.

335
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,600
I think we should

336
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,310
conduct

337
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,000
an experiment of completely automatic electric vehicle.

338
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,880
-Good morning, Mr, He. -Good morning, Mr, He.

339
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,760
Let's go straight ahead.

340
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,680
It's been investigated

341
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,270
Manager Liu in charge of publicity,

342
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,720
manager Meng in charge of the channel,

343
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,760
and

344
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,880
Hans in charge of docking in Germany,

345
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,510
all have been in touch with Miss Lin recently.

346
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,880
It can be judged

347
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,390
their sudden

348
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,880
leaving from Heshi Group and the project

349
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,230
was influenced by Miss Lin.

350
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,720
What's the situation in Germany?

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,880
Kubo 5, Germany

352
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,920
has known that

353
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,350
we had an accident.

354
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,680
They said to suspend cooperation with us,

355
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,880
and think about it again.

356
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,430
They have time to think about it.

357
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,080
But we can't wait.

358
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
Is there any good news

359
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,680
for me?

360
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,510
President Jia said he would continue to support you,

361
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,270
as long as you keep your promise

362
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,080
launching the Bracelet Project in German market.

363
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,640
But there is one pre-condition,

364
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,350
that's if it's not a super shopping center like

365
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,960
Kubo 5.

366
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
It has to be

367
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,510
top three shopping centers in Europe.

368
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,270
What's more. It must be in accordance with the contract,

369
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,510
launching in a month.

370
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,000
Very good.

371
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,800
His words are encouraging.

372
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,110
German Mazer company

373
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,600
has received

374
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,840
our samples.

375
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,430
Recently,

376
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,720
their director, Mr. Jung,

377
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,470
will come to China.

378
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,470
I'll talk to him directly.

379
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,510
But I heard

380
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,040
Mr. Jung of Mazer company

381
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,350
is known for its preciseness.

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So this time I think

383
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,150
our efficiency must be very high.

384
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,110
The good news is that

385
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,760
Mr. Jung and I are alumni.

386
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,000
In college,

387
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,310
our relationship is not bad.

388
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,510
But everybody,

389
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,760
there're only two days.

390
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
By any means,

391
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,470
Before I meet Mr. Jung

392
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,310
at the meeting,

393
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,190
you guys have to get

394
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,190
ready in advance.

395
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,800
Thank you very much.

396
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,350
Heshi Group

397
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,310
was picked on by Miss Lin.

398
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,470
Do we need to do something?

399
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,390
Don't care about that.

400
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,640
Put all our attention into

401
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,190
the bracelet project.

402
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,430
For this project,

403
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,230
I had given a pledge

404
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,510
to the board.

405
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,880
There must be no mistakes.

406
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,390
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,430
Assistant Manager Wen,

408
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,350
for the file you want,

409
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,310
I've already delivered it.

410
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,920
I'm going back to the company now.

411
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,080
You don't have to go back to the company

412
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,430
Why?

413
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,350
I'll send you a location.

414
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,150
and come over here.

415
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,230
Come in.

416
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,760
You're going to have a villa party.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,230
But there's no one here.

418
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,680
It's too lonely, isn't it?

419
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,840
This is my dad's house.

420
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,080
But it's also mine.

421
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,960
How do you like it?

422
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,040
So much for a bet?

423
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:31,760
A villa for me?

424
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,470
But thanks.

425
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,760
I still like

426
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,110
my little rental house.

427
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,390
This place

428
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,310
is too big for me.

429
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,760
It's frightening to live alone.

430
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,000
You're not living alone.

431
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,760
Get in.

432
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,350
Ruowei,

433
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,800
I haven't seen you for so long.

434
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,190
It looks like you're doing well

435
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,880
No wonder you didn't agree to get married

436
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,720
back hometown.

437
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,640
It turned out to be in a big city

438
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
with a better boyfriend.

439
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,430
You see, Mr. Wen can arrange everything

440
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,510
Why don't you let him

441
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,600
look for a job for your brother?

442
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,960
You see in big cities,

443
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,110
there are so many enterprises.

444
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,800
To be a manager

445
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,680
or something.

446
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,840
It's very simple, isn't it?

447
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,270
Your brother will be back in a moment

448
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,920
Knowing these,

449
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,150
he'll be happy.

450
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,960
Where there's family,

451
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,840
there's home.

452
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,270
You're out on your own,

453
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,040
with no ability to

454
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,000
get them over here.

455
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,640
There's no way for you to

456
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,550
go back and take care of them.

457
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,760
Once and for all,

458
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,430
I took them all.

459
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,550
I found a big house.

460
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,150
Later, when you are busy with work,

461
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,390
your mother can take care of you.

462
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,800
What's wrong?

463
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,270
Yang Ruowei!

464
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,110
What's wrong with you?

465
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,150
Wen Gu, what's your problem?

466
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,960
Are you too idle?

467
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,390
Why did you get them here?

468
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,880
I know.

469
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,040
I know you are not getting along well

470
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,840
with your family.

471
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,390
But I think it's family after all.

472
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,040
Meet and live together.

473
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,080
With life goes on,

474
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,110
there will be a reunion.

475
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,230
More about that,

476
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,190
you're out on your own,

477
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,080
helpless and friendless.

478
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,350
If you could be with your family,

479
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,430
there will be no

480
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,550
difficulties that cannot be overcome.

481
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:24,110
You can also live a more easy life.

482
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,880
I know you and your mother are estranged.

483
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,840
I've seen your brother make trouble for you.

484
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,150
-But... -You know nothing!

485
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,150
I've worked so hard all these years.

486
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,640
Just to get rid of that

487
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,110
broken home.

488
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,310
But,

489
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,510
you got me back.

490
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,680
For sure,

491
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,550
There were no relatives around me these years.

492
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,230
I admit that I envy Qin Yiyue very much.

493
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,150
When she was hurt and wronged,

494
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,040
She takes a taxi,

495
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,510
in one hour,

496
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,640
she can back to her parents.

497
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,600
I can't.

498
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,310
I have no way back.

499
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,270
But I don't need kinship,

500
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,430
nor family.

501
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,550
I have myself, and it's enough.

502
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,680
But you can't be such stiff with your family

503
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,550
all the time.

504
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,640
Why it had to be like this?

505
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,350
You grew up loaded.

506
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,110
You don't understand that

507
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,720
every family has a skeleton in the cupboard.

508
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
But don't be self-righteous

509
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,310
and get involved in other's lives!

510
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,350
Come here and disgust me for no reason.

511
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,470
Disgust you?

512
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,310
Yes.

513
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,680
I admit.

514
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,550
For this matter,

515
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,040
It was thoughtless of me to do such a thing.

516
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,680
But I'm not

517
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,470
that idle to

518
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,840
specially find out the address of your hometown,

519
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,310
and send somebody to pick up your mother here.

520
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,190
And then I went out of my way to ask my dad

521
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,040
for this big house,

522
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
preparing everything

523
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
and waiting to surprise you.

524
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:28,680
Fine.

525
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,760
In the future, you

526
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,150
and your family mess.

527
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,190
You handle it by yourself.

528
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,470
I will be far away from you.

529
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,550
I won't disgust you,

530
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,800
and you don't bother me either.

531
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,640
Yang Ruowei!

532
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,350
If Xiao'an didn't tell me,

533
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:54,040
I would not have known you are sick.

534
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,760
Director,

535
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,510
Did you

536
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,840
forget to rest?

537
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,680
So those old problems

538
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,430
are troubling you again.

539
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,390
I have good news for you.

540
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,880
The project

541
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,840
that was suspended before

542
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,550
got an eye by

543
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,470
a research institute in Germany.

544
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,430
They said they would cooperate with us to

545
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,510
restart the project.

546
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,600
So you've been doing research day and night

547
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,760
for this project.

548
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,270
It's you who should be blamed.

549
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,110
You suddenly resigned,

550
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,390
leaving the project.

551
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,110
Up to now,

552
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,800
I don't have a person helping me.

553
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,190
Your little patient,

554
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,310
I heard he's cured.

555
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,720
Can you

556
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,150
come back and help me?

557
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Don't you want to stay at

558
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,350
the consulting room of Ning Fang all the time.

559
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,080
I respect Ning Fang and

560
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,840
his original intention of running that consulting room.

561
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,550
But you're not like him.

562
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,920
You always want to

563
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,110
do this project well.

564
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,920
And you always want to

565
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,150
make some achievements

566
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,760
in psychological research on children.

567
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,640
Qin Yiyue,

568
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,190
I know you scarcely bear to leave him.

569
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,080
But when you love someone,

570
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,960
you hope he can be happy.

571
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
So you have to make up your mind,

572
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,840
and you can't go back.

573
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
Understand, Qin Yiyue.

574
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,000
Ning Fang

575
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,310
Why are you here at night?

576
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,150
I also want to ask you.

577
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,190
Why are you here?

578
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,800
Hello,

579
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,880
it's me.

580
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,960
Lucheng City?

581
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,190
Tomorrow?

582
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,640
I'll call you later.

583
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,230
Okay?

584
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,510
Thank you.

585
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,600
What's going on? Do you have to go on a business trip?

586
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,720
There's a hotel in Lucheng looking for me

587
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,510
They want me to help the hotel staff

588
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,600
for psychological examination.

589
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,350
What happened?

590
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,550
Don't want to go home?

591
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,680
Are you hiding from He Qiaoyan？

592
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,230
How can I avoid He Qiaoyan?

593
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
I've heard something from Ruowei.

594
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,470
Don't want to talk to me?

595
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,390
If you don't want to talk, I'm leaving.

596
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,000
Ning Fang, let me ask you a question.

597
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,840
Have you ever been in such a situation?

598
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,150
When you see a person,

599
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,390
you just feel nervous,

600
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,470
and want to do something for him.

601
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,350
But you can't do anything.

602
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,310
It seems that leaving him

603
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,960
is the right choice.

604
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes, I had.

605
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,840
But most of my time

606
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,110
is happy.

607
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,080
What you said is still a minority.

608
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,230
I did everything with thinking of her.

609
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,760
Sometimes,

610
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,720
even if I know where she is,

611
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,760
and what is she doing,

612
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,350
I'll be in a better mood.

613
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,150
How about now?

614
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:38,960
After listening to me,

615
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,230
do you feel better？

616
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,040
I never have a bad time.

617
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,390
All right, it's too late.

618
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,430
Let me take you home.

619
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,470
Let's go.

620
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,680
OK, I'll take it myself.

621
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,920
Yiyue, where have you been?

622
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,960
Mr. He has been waiting for you all night.

623
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,920
I didn't ask him to wait.

624
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,960
Cake on the table,

625
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,640
Xiaobao bought it for you.

626
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,390
Go to bed early.

627
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,600
We're leaving now.

628
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,550
Mr. He, safe drive.

629
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,720
Yiyue, I'm leaving, too.

630
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,040
Have an early rest.

631
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,040
Ning Fang.

632
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,640
Let me go to Lucheng City for you tomorrow.

633
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,310
OK, go for a distraction.

634
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,470
I'll arrange for Xiao'an to go with you.

635
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,080
This way, please.

636
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,510
In addition to the catering department

637
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,510
and sales department,

638
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,390
employees in the other five departments

639
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,920
all need to take part in this psychological examination.

640
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
I looked at the list.

641
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,470
In total,

642
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,350
there are 223 persons.

643
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:20,880
Am I right?

644
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,760
Yes.

645
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,080
Dr. Qin.

646
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,430
How long do you think it will take.

647
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,920
So I can make

648
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,390
an adjustment of work arrangement.

649
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,270
The number of people in each of your departments

650
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:27,880
is almost the same.

651
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,270
Each department

652
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,190
will take one and half hours.

653
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,230
Then we follow the order

654
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,080
on the list.

655
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,000
By the way,

656
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,230
Let the employees in lobby department

657
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:34,960
come to the conference room.

658
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,080
OK, Doctor Qin.

659
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,920
Then I'll call

660
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,350
them to the conference room.

661
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,550
This way, please.

662
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,230
Do they live near here?

663
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
I think so.

664
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,390
Today,

665
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,080
we've revenged for Brother Jay.

666
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,920
and taught Zhang a lesson.

667
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,470
Only Yang Ruoqiang is left.

668
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,640
Early this morning,

669
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,800
he took his mother and run away.

670
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,960
Only half a million, can't imagine he was like that.

671
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,389
Come to think of it.

672
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,190
His sister.

673
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,880
What's her name, Yang...

674
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,550
Yang Ruowei.

675
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,310
Ruowei

676
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,840
Yes.

677
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:26,150
You don't know.

678
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,150
Beauty.

679
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,150
Working in a big company,

680
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,960
She's boss's secretary.

681
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,639
Good figure.

682
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,000
If she is encountered by us tonight...

683
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,550
You see,

684
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
we've known each other for such a long time.

685
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,469
Don't be so stiff.

686
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,040
Cheers.

687
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,760
Cheers!

688
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,040
Position has been sent.

689
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,110
I've given you the steps.

690
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,550
Come or not, your choice.

691
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,880
Come and have a drink.

692
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:10,040
drink

693
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,040
Be happy.

694
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,550
Come on.

695
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,390
Come on in, why are you standing here?

696
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,840
The contract is about to be signed.

697
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
It

698
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,390
just wait for your final assist.

699
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,150
Let's go.

700
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,510
Why?

701
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,840
From now on, the two of us

702
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,640
are just leader and member.

703
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,310
The bet or something,

704
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,550
I quit.

705
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm tired.

706
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,350
We were in

707
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,760
leader-member relationship all the time.

708
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,510
What did you think it is?

709
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,760
I'm stupid.

710
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,190
No.

711
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,150
I'm not stupid.

712
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,600
You suck.

713
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,230
Bye.

714
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,510
Eight in the morning,

715
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,080
Xiaobao and I will be in your door way.

716
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:32,190
Don't forget get up and open the door.
