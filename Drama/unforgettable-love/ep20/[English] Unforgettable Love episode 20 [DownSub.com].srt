Unforgettable Love
EP20

2
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,190
Qiaoyan,

3
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,360
You've met that girl.

4
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,190
You just forgot her.

5
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,360
But I hope

6
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,479
you'll never think of her.

7
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,479
I hope you will always

8
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,000
regard her as a person appeared in your dream.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,270
Let's go.

10
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,479
Yiyue,

11
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,520
I've asked for leave for Xiaobao.

12
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
Today, Xiaobao and I

13
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,840
will go and cheer for you.

14
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,750
Cheer for me?

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,840
How did you forget?

16
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,670
I made an appointment with our aunt.

17
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,110
You're going to play golf today

18
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,840
Right, play golf.

19
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,440
Let's get changed first

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,920
Yiyue

21
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,360
Are you not feeling well?

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,710
If so, we can do it another day

23
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,790
No, I'm fine.

24
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,040
Sure?

25
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,670
Let's go and get changed.

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,840
Good shot, aunt.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,960
Yiyue, I heard from Qiaoyan that

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,670
you've been practicing lately.

29
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,040
Come on, swing!

30
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,190
Come on!

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,710
Remember the action tips.

32
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
Trust yourself.

33
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,520
Mr. He, the car to pick up Xiaobao has arrived.

34
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,480
OK.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,110
Aunt, I'll see Xiaobao off.

36
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,440
Come on.

37
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,079
Come here.

38
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,190
Let's go!

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,590
They really love you.

40
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,960
You must love them, too.

41
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,520
Am I right?

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
Aunt.

43
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,040
Don't worry.

44
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll do what you want.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Leave him.

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,960
I love him.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,150
I wish him well, too.

48
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:21,959
How's it going?

49
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,440
Is she satisfied?

50
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,270
It seems that the result is not satisfactory.

51
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,560
Never say die,

52
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,110
practice more.

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,400
You can do it.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
What's wrong？

55
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,110
Qiaoyan

56
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,520
Let's break up.

57
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,400
Are you joking with me again?

58
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,040
I'm afraid it will stun Xiaobao.

59
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,880
So,

60
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,920
Please.

61
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,560
Slowly

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,150
make it clear to Xiaobao.

63
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
I'm leaving now.

64
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,750
You afraid it will stun Xiaobao.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,440
Aren't you afraid to stun me?

66
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,040
Did aunt say something again?

67
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Have your dinner.

68
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,310
Dad.

69
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,590
How about giving mom a seat?

70
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,790
Today is the anniversary of her death.

71
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,920
Your mother was a vegetarian.

72
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,480
Look at this.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,630
Oh, I forgot.

74
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,040
You have filial piety.

75
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,790
Remember to go home every year today.

76
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,750
Of course, I'm very sensible.

77
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,000
Before your mother passed away,

78
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,590
I had a fight with her.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,230
Now think about it.

80
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
What for?

81
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,630
There's no estrangement for a family that can't

82
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,710
be tided over.

83
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,000
If I haven't sulk with her,

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,150
call her back,

85
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,440
and make her a meal,

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,270
under the same roof,

87
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,560
she would get over it.

88
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,920
As a girl,

89
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm more useful

90
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
than ten boys like you.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,960
I don't have 100 thousand RMB.

92
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,520
You won't even get 10 RMB.

93
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,190
How can a family like this?

94
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,880
Son, when you're not busy,

95
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,270
You'd better move back home.

96
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,270
Dad,

97
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Your Lake Villa.

98
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,880
Could you give it to me?

99
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,150
What?

100
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,520
You're tired of the house you live now?

101
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,230
No, it's useful for me.

102
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,920
Look what I brought you.

103
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,110
You scared me!

104
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,230
Why are you crying?

105
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,360
You, in the middle of the night

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,310
don't company with your Mr. He.

107
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,190
What are you doing here?

108
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,520
I'm here

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,190
holding you a pajama party.

110
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,360
Wait me a minute.

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,630
I'll go back to my room first

112
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,750
and change my pajamas.

113
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,190
Last time somebody

114
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
took all your clothes

115
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
away.

116
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,040
You're right.

117
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,440
Good sisters share their pajamas.

118
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,590
I'll put on your pajamas

119
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,190
No!

120
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
No, I have to.

121
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,680
Also,

122
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,350
You mask,

123
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,390
Give me one, too.

124
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,000
What happened to you?

125
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,230
Stop pretending.

126
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,190
When you hum,

127
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,350
I'll know what you

128
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,309
want to do.

129
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,309
So,

130
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,799
what you can see

131
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,799
in my eyes?

132
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,510
Smudged eyeliner.

133
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,720
Lovelorn.

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,550
You broke up with He Qiaoyan?

135
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,840
Really?

136
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,960
You're going to drive me nuts, aren't you

137
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,840
Why did you suddenly break up？

138
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,550
Two days ago, you two

139
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,310
were close as same

140
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,800
as the conjoined baby,

141
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
weren't you?

142
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,270
Don't ask.

143
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,760
Even you ask,

144
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,110
I won't tell you.

145
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,390
You cheated on him.

146
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,110
No.

147
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,350
With you stupid brain,

148
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,270
no way.

149
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,040
He Qiaoyan cheated on you?

150
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,720
Ruowei.

151
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,310
For modern man and woman,

152
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,270
falling in love and breaking up

153
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,230
are normal things.

154
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,080
Does it have to be so vulgar

155
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,880
and dramatic?

156
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
I and He Qiaoyan,

157
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,800
we are out of step with each other.

158
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,880
It was a very peaceful

159
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,270
and delight break up.

160
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,350
Is it OK?

161
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,150
Come on, Miss.

162
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,760
Just Relax.

163
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,350
How about a bunch of meat?

164
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,550
I'm sleepy, Yue'er.

165
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,510
Let me lie down for a while.

166
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,000
Who is it in the early morning?

167
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,510
Coming!

168
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,230
Good morning.

169
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,390
Don't come to me again.

170
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,310
Let me in,

171
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,310
or you come home with me.

172
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,550
You are own choice.

173
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,880
I've already said what I would say.

174
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,430
Xiaobao

175
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,110
Drunk again.

176
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,680
Were you drunk?

177
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,880
It's none of your business.

178
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,350
Every time you got drunk

179
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,190
are very funny.

180
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:28,960
Of course.

181
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,600
She's a famous

182
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,040
performing artist after drinking.

183
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,000
See me a passer-by, please continue,

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,880
Let's go.

185
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,840
You arranged it.

186
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,840
Praise each other every day.

187
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,430
Hold me.

188
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,390
You arrange this, too

189
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,430
Before going out every day,

190
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,190
we all need to give each other a loving hug.

191
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,310
I need to wash.

192
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,550
Please leave.

193
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,960
What's going on?

194
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,470
After breaking up, he came

195
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,550
and brought you breakfast.

196
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,510
How could I know what's going on?

197
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,270
I see, you two,

198
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,110
in a couple of days,

199
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,550
are too boring,

200
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,840
so looking for trouble.

201
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Don't go out.

202
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,510
Why can't I go out?

203
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,110
What can I say to him?

204
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,080
Should I say, we broke up,

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,350
but we can be brother?

206
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,390
Do you think he came here today

207
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,150
to be your brother?

208
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,720
I'm really out of your business

209
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,000
I have to go to work.

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,270
Don't go out.

211
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,470
Tell me,

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,270
Mr. He,

213
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,510
what does he like about you?

214
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,190
I

215
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,080
Isn't that charming?

216
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,600
Glamorous.

217
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,720
Fashionable clothes and charming taste.

218
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,600
Especially these two dark circles

219
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,880
It's almost on the ground.

220
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,230
It's the finishing touch.

221
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,110
I am leaving.

222
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,110
I don't have dark circles.

223
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,310
Mr. He,

224
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,270
I am going to work.

225
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,390
OK.

226
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,600
Qin Yiyue, are you crazy?

227
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
What are you doing?

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,080
But it looks pretty good.

229
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,150
We can have breakfast now.

230
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,640
We agreed to have breakfast

231
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,600
What do you want on earth?

232
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,150
Bring my girlfriend Breakfast.

233
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,550
We've broken up.

234
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
That's what you thought.

235
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,110
I didn't agree.

236
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,430
Does this

237
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,760
still need your consent?

238
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,000
Article 9 of the Love Contract

239
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
clearly defines,

240
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,680
either party

241
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,270
is not allowed to break up unilaterally.

242
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,270
So,

243
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,310
So how you can agree?

244
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,880
Have breakfast.

245
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,000
If I finish this, you will agree.

246
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,000
Ok.

247
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,270
Take it easy.

248
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,000
Eating too fast is not good for digestion.

249
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,000
Finish breakfast before the sand glass finished.

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,150
It can't be early or late

251
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,599
That's the last piece.

252
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,079
Xiaobao Xiaobao

253
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,760
Don't do that.

254
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
Spit it out, spit it out.

255
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,390
You are very good at teaching.

256
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,109
Is it enough?

257
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,310
If it's not enough, I'll make you another breakfast.

258
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,109
You!

259
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,040
Take Xiaobao to school.

260
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,960
I will take the bus.

261
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,430
Go by myself.

262
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,110
Xiaobao is still there.

263
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,150
Say hello to him.

264
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
I walk with you to work.

265
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,110
You go by yourself

266
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,080
You see that, too

267
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,600
My car took Xiaobao to school.

268
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,390
Take a taxi.

269
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,550
I can't.

270
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,960
I'll do it for you.

271
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,350
I never take a taxi.

272
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,680
Online car-hailing is the same.

273
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,960
Stand here by yourself.

274
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,350
Not bad.

275
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,110
What do you want on earth?

276
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,350
Take you to work. What else can I do?

277
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,760
The bike is a little small

278
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,000
But there's no problem for two.

279
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Mr. He, my bike is not suitable for you.

280
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,510
You'd better take your luxury car.

281
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,310
Who said that? No problem.

282
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,390
Move out.

283
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,720
-Get out of the way. -I said I could.

284
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,270
Come on, I'll take you.

285
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,760
Hey,

286
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll go first.

287
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
If you want to send me, Mr. He.

288
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,600
Take your time.

289
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,840
How much is your motorbike. I'll buy it.

290
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,150
Are you insane?

291
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,640
How much is your bike, Madam.

292
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,640
I'll take it.

293
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,000
Twenty thousand.

294
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,840
Good.

295
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,310
I'll transfer it to you.

296
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,550
Transfer.

297
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,470
I want your hat, too.

298
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,040
Buy one and get one free!

299
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,150
Thank you!

300
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,800
Qin Yiyue.

301
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,760
Yiyue, wait for me.

302
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,190
Yiyue!

303
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,960
If my behavior

304
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,230
could make you happy.

305
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,960
I can keep them all the time.

306
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,040
Don't flatter yourself.

307
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,110
Let me go.

308
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,230
Just one minute.

309
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,800
Qin Yiyue, please listen to me.

310
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:39,000
I won't let you go.

311
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,510
I won't agree to break up with you.

312
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,720
In recent days,

313
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,390
You can live in Yang Ruowei's house.

314
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,150
It's like taking a vacation for yourself

315
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,310
But for breakfast and dinner,

316
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,680
you have to take with me.

317
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,430
I have to pick you up to and from work.

318
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,600
And the most important thing,

319
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,510
weekly appointment is

320
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,720
as usual.

321
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Why should I listen to you?

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,270
You'd better listen to me.

323
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,080
Otherwise it's going to get really troublesome.

324
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,390
Are you threatening me?

325
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,230
All right, go to work.

326
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,720
Don't think too much.

327
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,350
I

328
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,000
You what?

329
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,800
I

330
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,840
Mr. He, I come to meet you.

331
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,230
OK.

332
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,000
Go ahead.

333
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,310
Wait for me to pick you up after work.

334
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,000
Just in time.

335
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,600
I think we should

336
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,310
conduct

337
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,000
an experiment of completely automatic electric vehicle.

338
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
-Good morning, Mr, He. -Good morning, Mr, He.

339
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,760
Let's go straight ahead.

340
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,680
It's been investigated

341
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,270
Manager Liu in charge of publicity,

342
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,720
manager Meng in charge of the channel,

343
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,760
and

344
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Hans in charge of docking in Germany,

345
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,510
all have been in touch with Miss Lin recently.

346
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,880
It can be judged

347
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,390
their sudden

348
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,880
leaving from Heshi Group and the project

349
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,230
was influenced by Miss Lin.

350
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,720
What's the situation in Germany?

351
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,880
Kubo 5, Germany

352
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,920
has known that

353
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,350
we had an accident.

354
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,680
They said to suspend cooperation with us,

355
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,880
and think about it again.

356
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,430
They have time to think about it.

357
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,080
But we can't wait.

358
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,920
Is there any good news

359
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,680
for me?

360
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,510
President Jia said he would continue to support you,

361
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,270
as long as you keep your promise

362
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,080
launching the Bracelet Project in German market.

363
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,640
But there is one pre-condition,

364
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,350
that's if it's not a super shopping center like

365
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,960
Kubo 5.

366
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,920
It has to be

367
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,510
top three shopping centers in Europe.

368
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,270
What's more. It must be in accordance with the contract,

369
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,510
launching in a month.

370
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,000
Very good.

371
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,800
His words are encouraging.

372
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,110
German Mazer company

373
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,600
has received

374
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,840
our samples.

375
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,430
Recently,

376
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,720
their director, Mr. Jung,

377
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,470
will come to China.

378
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,470
I'll talk to him directly.

379
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,510
But I heard

380
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,040
Mr. Jung of Mazer company

381
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,350
is known for its preciseness.

382
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So this time I think

383
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,150
our efficiency must be very high.

384
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,110
The good news is that

385
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,760
Mr. Jung and I are alumni.

386
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,000
In college,

387
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,310
our relationship is not bad.

388
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,510
But everybody,

389
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,760
there're only two days.

390
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
By any means,

391
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,470
Before I meet Mr. Jung

392
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,310
at the meeting,

393
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,190
you guys have to get

394
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,190
ready in advance.

395
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
Thank you very much.

396
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,350
Heshi Group

397
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,310
was picked on by Miss Lin.

398
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,470
Do we need to do something?

399
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,390
Don't care about that.

400
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,640
Put all our attention into

401
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,190
the bracelet project.

402
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,430
For this project,

403
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,230
I had given a pledge

404
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,510
to the board.

405
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,880
There must be no mistakes.

406
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,390
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,430
Assistant Manager Wen,

408
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,350
for the file you want,

409
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,310
I've already delivered it.

410
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm going back to the company now.

411
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,080
You don't have to go back to the company

412
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,430
Why?

413
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,350
I'll send you a location.

414
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,150
and come over here.

415
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,230
Come in.

416
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,760
You're going to have a villa party.

417
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,230
But there's no one here.

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,680
It's too lonely, isn't it?

419
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,840
This is my dad's house.

420
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,080
But it's also mine.

421
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,960
How do you like it?

422
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,040
So much for a bet?

423
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,760
A villa for me?

424
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,470
But thanks.

425
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,760
I still like

426
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,110
my little rental house.

427
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,390
This place

428
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,310
is too big for me.

429
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,760
It's frightening to live alone.

430
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,000
You're not living alone.

431
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,760
Get in.

432
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,350
Ruowei,

433
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,800
I haven't seen you for so long.

434
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,190
It looks like you're doing well

435
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,880
No wonder you didn't agree to get married

436
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,720
back hometown.

437
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,640
It turned out to be in a big city

438
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,640
with a better boyfriend.

439
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,430
You see, Mr. Wen can arrange everything

440
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,510
Why don't you let him

441
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,600
look for a job for your brother?

442
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,960
You see in big cities,

443
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,110
there are so many enterprises.

444
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,800
To be a manager

445
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
or something.

446
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,840
It's very simple, isn't it?

447
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,270
Your brother will be back in a moment

448
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,920
Knowing these,

449
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,150
he'll be happy.

450
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,960
Where there's family,

451
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,840
there's home.

452
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:22,270
You're out on your own,

453
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,040
with no ability to

454
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,000
get them over here.

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,640
There's no way for you to

456
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,550
go back and take care of them.

457
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,760
Once and for all,

458
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,430
I took them all.

459
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,550
I found a big house.

460
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,150
Later, when you are busy with work,

461
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,390
your mother can take care of you.

462
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,800
What's wrong?

463
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,270
Yang Ruowei!

464
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,110
What's wrong with you?

465
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,150
Wen Gu, what's your problem?

466
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,960
Are you too idle?

467
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,390
Why did you get them here?

468
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,880
I know.

469
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
I know you are not getting along well

470
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,840
with your family.

471
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,390
But I think it's family after all.

472
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,040
Meet and live together.

473
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,080
With life goes on,

474
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,110
there will be a reunion.

475
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,230
More about that,

476
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,190
you're out on your own,

477
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,080
helpless and friendless.

478
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,350
If you could be with your family,

479
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,430
there will be no

480
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,550
difficulties that cannot be overcome.

481
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,110
You can also live a more easy life.

482
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,880
I know you and your mother are estranged.

483
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,840
I've seen your brother make trouble for you.

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,150
-But... -You know nothing!

485
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,150
I've worked so hard all these years.

486
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,640
Just to get rid of that

487
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,110
broken home.

488
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,310
But,

489
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,510
you got me back.

490
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,680
For sure,

491
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,550
There were no relatives around me these years.

492
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,230
I admit that I envy Qin Yiyue very much.

493
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,150
When she was hurt and wronged,

494
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,040
She takes a taxi,

495
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,510
in one hour,

496
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,640
she can back to her parents.

497
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
I can't.

498
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,310
I have no way back.

499
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,270
But I don't need kinship,

500
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,430
nor family.

501
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,550
I have myself, and it's enough.

502
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,680
But you can't be such stiff with your family

503
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,550
all the time.

504
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,640
Why it had to be like this?

505
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,350
You grew up loaded.

506
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,110
You don't understand that

507
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,720
every family has a skeleton in the cupboard.

508
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
But don't be self-righteous

509
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,310
and get involved in other's lives!

510
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,350
Come here and disgust me for no reason.

511
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,470
Disgust you?

512
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,310
Yes.

513
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,680
I admit.

514
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,550
For this matter,

515
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,040
It was thoughtless of me to do such a thing.

516
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,680
But I'm not

517
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,470
that idle to

518
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,840
specially find out the address of your hometown,

519
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,310
and send somebody to pick up your mother here.

520
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,190
And then I went out of my way to ask my dad

521
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,040
for this big house,

522
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
preparing everything

523
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
and waiting to surprise you.

524
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,680
Fine.

525
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,760
In the future, you

526
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,150
and your family mess.

527
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,190
You handle it by yourself.

528
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,470
I will be far away from you.

529
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,550
I won't disgust you,

530
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,800
and you don't bother me either.

531
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,640
Yang Ruowei!

532
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,350
If Xiao'an didn't tell me,

533
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,040
I would not have known you are sick.

534
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,760
Director,

535
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,510
Did you

536
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,840
forget to rest?

537
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,680
So those old problems

538
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,430
are troubling you again.

539
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,390
I have good news for you.

540
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,880
The project

541
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,840
that was suspended before

542
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,550
got an eye by

543
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,470
a research institute in Germany.

544
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,430
They said they would cooperate with us to

545
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,510
restart the project.

546
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,600
So you've been doing research day and night

547
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,760
for this project.

548
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,270
It's you who should be blamed.

549
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,110
You suddenly resigned,

550
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,390
leaving the project.

551
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,110
Up to now,

552
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,800
I don't have a person helping me.

553
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,190
Your little patient,

554
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,310
I heard he's cured.

555
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,720
Can you

556
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,150
come back and help me?

557
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,680
Don't you want to stay at

558
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,350
the consulting room of Ning Fang all the time.

559
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,080
I respect Ning Fang and

560
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,840
his original intention of running that consulting room.

561
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,550
But you're not like him.

562
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,920
You always want to

563
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,110
do this project well.

564
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,920
And you always want to

565
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,150
make some achievements

566
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,760
in psychological research on children.

567
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,640
Qin Yiyue,

568
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,190
I know you scarcely bear to leave him.

569
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,080
But when you love someone,

570
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,960
you hope he can be happy.

571
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,720
So you have to make up your mind,

572
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,840
and you can't go back.

573
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,680
Understand, Qin Yiyue.

574
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,000
Ning Fang

575
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,310
Why are you here at night?

576
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,150
I also want to ask you.

577
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,190
Why are you here?

578
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,800
Hello,

579
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,880
it's me.

580
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,960
Lucheng City?

581
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,190
Tomorrow?

582
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,640
I'll call you later.

583
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,230
Okay?

584
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,510
Thank you.

585
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,600
What's going on? Do you have to go on a business trip?

586
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,720
There's a hotel in Lucheng looking for me

587
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,510
They want me to help the hotel staff

588
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,600
for psychological examination.

589
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,350
What happened?

590
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,550
Don't want to go home?

591
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,680
Are you hiding from He Qiaoyan？

592
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,230
How can I avoid He Qiaoyan?

593
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I've heard something from Ruowei.

594
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,470
Don't want to talk to me?

595
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,390
If you don't want to talk, I'm leaving.

596
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,000
Ning Fang, let me ask you a question.

597
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,840
Have you ever been in such a situation?

598
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,150
When you see a person,

599
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,390
you just feel nervous,

600
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,470
and want to do something for him.

601
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,350
But you can't do anything.

602
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,310
It seems that leaving him

603
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,960
is the right choice.

604
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,960
Yes, I had.

605
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,840
But most of my time

606
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,110
is happy.

607
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,080
What you said is still a minority.

608
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,230
I did everything with thinking of her.

609
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,760
Sometimes,

610
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,720
even if I know where she is,

611
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,760
and what is she doing,

612
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,350
I'll be in a better mood.

613
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,150
How about now?

614
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,960
After listening to me,

615
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,230
do you feel better？

616
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,040
I never have a bad time.

617
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,390
All right, it's too late.

618
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,430
Let me take you home.

619
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,470
Let's go.

620
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,680
OK, I'll take it myself.

621
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Yiyue, where have you been?

622
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,960
Mr. He has been waiting for you all night.

623
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
I didn't ask him to wait.

624
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,960
Cake on the table,

625
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,640
Xiaobao bought it for you.

626
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,390
Go to bed early.

627
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,600
We're leaving now.

628
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,550
Mr. He, safe drive.

629
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,720
Yiyue, I'm leaving, too.

630
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,040
Have an early rest.

631
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,040
Ning Fang.

632
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,640
Let me go to Lucheng City for you tomorrow.

633
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,310
OK, go for a distraction.

634
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,470
I'll arrange for Xiao'an to go with you.

635
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,080
This way, please.

636
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,510
In addition to the catering department

637
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,510
and sales department,

638
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,390
employees in the other five departments

639
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,920
all need to take part in this psychological examination.

640
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
I looked at the list.

641
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,470
In total,

642
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,350
there are 223 persons.

643
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,880
Am I right?

644
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,760
Yes.

645
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,080
Dr. Qin.

646
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,430
How long do you think it will take.

647
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:15,920
So I can make

648
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,390
an adjustment of work arrangement.

649
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,270
The number of people in each of your departments

650
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:19,880
is almost the same.

651
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,270
Each department

652
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,190
will take one and half hours.

653
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,230
Then we follow the order

654
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,080
on the list.

655
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,000
By the way,

656
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,230
Let the employees in lobby department

657
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,960
come to the conference room.

658
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,080
OK, Doctor Qin.

659
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,920
Then I'll call

660
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,350
them to the conference room.

661
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,550
This way, please.

662
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,230
Do they live near here?

663
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,040
I think so.

664
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,390
Today,

665
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,080
we've revenged for Brother Jay.

666
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,920
and taught Zhang a lesson.

667
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,470
Only Yang Ruoqiang is left.

668
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,640
Early this morning,

669
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,800
he took his mother and run away.

670
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,960
Only half a million, can't imagine he was like that.

671
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,389
Come to think of it.

672
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,190
His sister.

673
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,880
What's her name, Yang...

674
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,550
Yang Ruowei.

675
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,310
Ruowei

676
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,840
Yes.

677
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,150
You don't know.

678
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,150
Beauty.

679
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,150
Working in a big company,

680
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,960
She's boss's secretary.

681
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,639
Good figure.

682
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,000
If she is encountered by us tonight...

683
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,550
You see,

684
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,000
we've known each other for such a long time.

685
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,469
Don't be so stiff.

686
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,040
Cheers.

687
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,760
Cheers!

688
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,040
Position has been sent.

689
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,110
I've given you the steps.

690
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,550
Come or not, your choice.

691
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,880
Come and have a drink.

692
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,040
drink

693
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,040
Be happy.

694
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,550
Come on.

695
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,390
Come on in, why are you standing here?

696
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,840
The contract is about to be signed.

697
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,960
It

698
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,390
just wait for your final assist.

699
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,150
Let's go.

700
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,510
Why?

701
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,840
From now on, the two of us

702
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,640
are just leader and member.

703
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,310
The bet or something,

704
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,550
I quit.

705
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,880
I'm tired.

706
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,350
We were in

707
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,760
leader-member relationship all the time.

708
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,510
What did you think it is?

709
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,760
I'm stupid.

710
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,190
No.

711
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,150
I'm not stupid.

712
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,600
You suck.

713
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,230
Bye.

714
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,510
Eight in the morning,

715
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,080
Xiaobao and I will be in your door way.

716
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,190
Don't forget get up and open the door.
