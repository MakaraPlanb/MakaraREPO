Unforgettable Love
EP11

2
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,960
We're home!

3
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,039
Oh my Gosh! The villa has changed a lot.

4
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,480
Xiaobao

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
Go and see what it is.

6
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,360
Look, Xiaobao.

7
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,710
Isn't it like the small house in the fairy tale

8
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
I told you yesterday?

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,710
It smells good.

10
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,310
Xiaobao, let's go wash our hands.

11
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,790
Come and have dinner after washing your hands.

12
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,079
This is good.

13
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,520
This is your new table?

14
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,360
Didn't you say that

15
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,880
home should enable us feel like home.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,110
Eating is not only about getting food,

17
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,840
but also an opportunity

18
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,630
for family to communicate.

19
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,360
The round table can

20
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,630
draw us closer than the long table.

21
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,560
Sit down, please.

22
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,880
Wait a minute.

23
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,150
Look at these chairs, Xiaobao.

24
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,310
Which color do you like?

25
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,190
Quickly choose one,

26
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,560
and then put on your little sticker

27
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,230
to occupy the seat.

28
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,360
Hey,

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,440
This table is my new...

30
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,079
What's new?

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,520
Nothing.

32
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,040
Furniture

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,630
is for people.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Come on.

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
It's time for dinner.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,230
Which dish do you like?

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,630
I'll pick it up for you.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Eat for yourself.

39
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,710
This is your reward.

40
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,790
The three of us eat together.

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,230
Come on.

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,230
Are you Miss Yang?

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,670
Yeah.

44
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,630
Follow me, please.

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,840
Miss Yang, please have a seat.

46
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you.

47
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,269
Mr. Wen

48
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,190
The file you want,

49
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,480
I've already brought it here.

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,920
Mr. Wen, Good job!

51
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,150
This is the document you want.

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,710
No hurry.

53
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,670
Excuse me,

54
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
Please enjoy your meal.

55
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,150
The grilled Japanese Black Cattle in this restaurant

56
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,110
is very good.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,750
Try it.

58
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,230
Don't beat me.

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,400
At three o'clock direction,

60
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
the person who was secretly photographing

61
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
was arranged by you, right?

62
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,840
How can you be kidding?

63
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,480
Why would I do that?

64
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,400
No reason.

65
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,150
Because you want to find someone

66
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,880
to take a picture of us,

67
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,590
so you can tell Chairman Wen

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,880
that I am

69
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,000
a person with over-weight scheming

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,400
who seduces you.

71
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,590
About Chairman Wen,

72
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,080
hates that there are girls in the company

73
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,270
who deliberately approach you,

74
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,880
so he will fire me.

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,960
When I leave,

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,150
no one will keep an eye on you.

77
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,590
Why don't you think

78
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,560
I really love you?

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,150
Restaurant, violin,

80
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,710
and this.

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,630
Premium Japanese Black Cattle.

82
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,440
Big brother, what era is it?

83
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,190
How can you

84
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,150
say that you really love me.

85
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,670
Want to catch a lady?

86
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,560
I suggest you

87
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
do the whole set when you are acting.

88
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,630
Otherwise, you lose the woman and your face.

89
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,590
Since Miss Yang is so confident,

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,150
dare you make a bet with me?

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,270
What's the bet?

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,790
If I get you tempted,

93
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,150
you'll take the initiative to leave.

94
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,230
Naive.

95
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,750
Why make fun

96
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,360
of my work?

97
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,710
Or I'll tell my dad,

98
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,630
that night...

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,360
we...

100
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,190
Fine.

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Just go ahead.

102
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,360
Enjoy

103
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,310
your time

104
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,360
in Wenshi group.

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,790
I believe

106
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,400
that you

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,310
will leave soon.

108
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,790
What happened?

109
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,230
But I have one condition.

110
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
If I got you tempted,

111
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,750
you'll have to listen to me.

112
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,310
Don't you dare?

113
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,270
What do I dare not do?

114
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,630
Deal.

115
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,630
Go!

116
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Yiyue, Xiaobao.

117
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,110
Xiaobao,

118
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,310
guess what

119
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,840
I'll give you?

120
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
He is shy.

121
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,350
It's OK. Mommy can help you.

122
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:26,640
What is it?

123
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
Look, what's this?

124
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,080
Here you are, OK?

125
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,880
Let's go. Mommy will take you to play.

126
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,039
This guy,

127
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,640
When did he get on so well

128
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,679
with Xiaobao?

129
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,549
Look,

130
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,680
Try to bounce the ball yourself.

131
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,150
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,720
I have seriously considered your suggestion

133
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,310
and decided to make a field trip to see

134
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,680
if it is really suitable for Xiaobao.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
Welcome, Mr. He!

136
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,350
Let me show you around.

137
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,080
Not necessary.

138
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,230
I've known

139
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,470
all the hardware facilities here.

140
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,640
It's mainly about teachers.

141
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,800
I think it's necessary for me

142
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,310
to know about Mr. Ning Fang.

143
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,470
Xiaobao can't wait to play the ball.

144
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,350
Come on, Xiaobao.

145
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,390
You two brothers, please step aside.

146
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,150
No.

147
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,720
Since it's a parent-child activity,

148
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,080
I think it's necessary

149
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,040
to participate in it together.

150
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,270
Xiaobao,

151
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,550
Let's play basketball.

152
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,310
I'll, by myself,

153
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,880
take turns to challenge Mr. Ning Fang

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,960
and your mummy.

155
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,800
If they win,

156
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,640
you can come to this school,

157
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,270
OK?

158
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,720
You against us two alone?

159
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,310
Yes, of course.

160
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,150
Come on, Ning Fang!

161
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,880
Dad scored.

162
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,920
It's a goal!

163
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,350
Dad scored again!

164
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,110
Come on, Ning Fang!

165
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,880
2-2, a draw.

166
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,470
Is it my turn to play?

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
l have to go.

168
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,230
I'm coming.

169
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,190
Yeah!

170
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Hand hurts.

171
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,080
Mr. He.

172
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,270
Well, I will humor you.

173
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,080
We play positioning shots.

174
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't need it.

175
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,720
Yeah!

176
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,510
Goal!

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,190
Great!

178
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,000
Come again.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,150
It's almost a goal. It doesn't matter.

180
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,800
Come again.

181
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,000
It's your turn.

182
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,470
Wow!

183
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,190
Again!

184
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,760
Time's over. Four to two.

185
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,390
We won!

186
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,040
Xiaobao, you can go to school!

187
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,840
You can to go to school.

188
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you happy, Xiaobao?

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
You can to go to school.

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Yeah!

191
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,920
Mr. He, you have to keep your word.

192
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,510
Look,

193
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,960
pencil and eraser,

194
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,800
I've got a lot for you.

195
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,230
At that time,

196
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,760
when some other kids don't bring it,

197
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,840
remember to share with them.

198
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,680
Change and tissue,

199
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,350
I'll put them both

200
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,600
in the side pocket.

201
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,600
Handkerchief.

202
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,880
Xiaobao can go to school finally!

203
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,350
OK.

204
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,110
Let's move on to the next one.

205
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Let's cover the books together.

206
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
You know?

207
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,110
When I was a kid,

208
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,470
What I'm looking forward to most

209
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,080
is the book cover before the beginning of school.

210
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,040
It's usually wrapped by my father.

211
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,510
This is

212
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,550
the sense of ritual when school begins.

213
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,190
Is it pretty?

214
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,080
Shall I put something

215
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,190
on your face?

216
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,800
This is the sense of ritual when school begins.

217
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,600
Excuse me,

218
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,510
This is a great next-gen invention.

219
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,270
The prototype of children's smart schoolbag,

220
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,840
combined with our company's latest technology,

221
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,880
can comprehensively deal with

222
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
all kinds of emergencies

223
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,310
Xiaobao encounter at school.

224
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,230
Let me show you.

225
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,760
Xiaobao, look at me.

226
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,150
In times of danger,

227
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,840
There is a one button

228
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,110
for help on the left.

229
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,150
When you press it,

230
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,470
it will give out a warning sound.

231
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
There's a camera in the middle.

232
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,190
A rangefinder on the right.

233
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,270
How heavy it is!

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've thought about that.

235
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,150
New lightweight design,

236
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,510
in line with the human body mechanics,

237
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,190
can resist the high temperature of 500 degrees

238
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,760
and the water depth of 20 meters.

239
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,350
People who know think he is going to school,

240
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,510
for those who don't know,

241
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,110
they think that he is going to war.

242
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,390
In addition,

243
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,840
Integrated with GPS,

244
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,550
And face recognition to prevent lost.

245
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,310
The data can be synchronized

246
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,110
to the app of parents' mobile phone in real time.

247
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,470
Can it walk on its own?

248
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,470
Is there any need for moving?

249
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,880
You are so powerful,

250
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,080
why don't you just

251
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,920
build a robot to accompany him to school?

252
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,150
Sounds sort of reasonable.

253
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,390
If necessary,

254
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,040
I can arrange

255
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,080
special accompanying staff.

256
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,150
Do you like it?

257
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,800
Come here,

258
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,880
Just save it.

259
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,430
The school

260
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,510
is full of children

261
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,150
of the same age as Xiaobao.

262
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,510
The teachers and the logistics were there all day.

263
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,040
When you make such an exception,

264
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,470
how can he blend in?

265
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,840
Xiaobao is different from

266
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,430
other children.

267
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,350
I have to make sure

268
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,390
he is perfectly safe.

269
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,270
In addition,

270
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,510
This is the first time

271
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,230
for him to face

272
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,470
the strange collective environment alone.

273
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,640
I have to make

274
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,800
a comprehensive assessment and prevention

275
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,310
of this unknown environment.

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,640
Think about it,

277
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,190
there are 20 children in a class.

278
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,190
What kind of children

279
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,390
are the other 19?

280
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,350
Will they hurt him?

281
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
Are classroom facilities

282
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,960
and school activities safe?

283
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,310
I don't know anything about these.

284
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,390
Stop.

285
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,840
If you want Xiaobao

286
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,150
to become a normal child,

287
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,270
at first,

288
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,080
You have to learn

289
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,000
how to be a normal parent.

290
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,390
So you mean,

291
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,470
I'm not normal?

292
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,600
You are the boss,

293
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,150
How dare I say you're not normal.

294
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,080
It's just that I think,

295
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,840
You're really,

296
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,310
in some ways...

297
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,550
too extraordinary.

298
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,430
It's really hard

299
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,680
for a petty little beauty like me

300
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,150
to understand.

301
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,080
Good Bye.

302
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,800
Xiaobao,

303
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
I'll be with you.

304
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,510
So is there

305
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,680
a need for moving?

306
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,080
I'll modify it.

307
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,800
Xiaobao, your father is crazy.

308
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,800
Come on.

309
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,510
Good morning.

310
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:10,960
Bye-bye.

311
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,510
Come on, Xiaobao. I'll take it for you.

312
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,190
Your bag.

313
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,190
Xiaobao, be good and go to school.

314
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,350
Dad and mom,

315
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,270
will pick you up after school.

316
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,190
OK?

317
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,110
I have another meeting this afternoon.

318
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,000
Of course, it can be cancelled.

319
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,600
Xiaobao,

320
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,550
Mom and I

321
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,880
will pick you up from school in the afternoon.

322
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,960
Don't worry,

323
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,880
our Xiaobao, don't be afraid.

324
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,640
This handkerchief

325
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,350
mom put on the side of your schoolbag for you,

326
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,840
mom will always be with you,

327
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,550
OK?

328
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,470
In fact, you don't have to go.

329
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,920
Come and kiss dad.

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,190
Bye, baby. Have a good class.

331
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,880
Good morning teacher.

332
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,270
You can say goodbye

333
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,150
in the way of kiss relay.

334
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,110
Xiaobao kisses his father,

335
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,840
then his father kisses his mother,

336
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
and then his mother kisses Xiaobao,

337
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,720
so the family

338
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,760
will be together forever.

339
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,840
You're a little villain.

340
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,230
You're very enthusiastic

341
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,430
about this kind of thing.

342
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,920
Now it's the mother's turn

343
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,800
to pass on the kiss to the dad.

344
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,430
The good interaction between the parents

345
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,470
also indirectly gives the child a sense of security.

346
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,040
No way.

347
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,640
That's not what I want,

348
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,550
but what Xiaobao want.

349
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Please cooperate.

350
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,640
Stage kiss, OK?

351
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,080
Kiss or not?

352
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Stage kiss.

353
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,880
Do you want

354
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,600
to die?

355
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,150
If you're afraid, go.

356
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,270
Xiaobao, we are kissing now.

357
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,080
Kiss.

358
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,190
OK.

359
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,080
I still have a meeting.

360
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,000
Idiot.

361
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,430
Xiaobao,

362
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,430
Your father is a big fool.

363
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,150
Let him go back,

364
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,040
and practice more.

365
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,760
Can we continue tomorrow?

366
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,190
Xiaobao, Yiyue,

367
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,600
Ning Fang.

368
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,150
Good morning.

369
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,230
Xiaobao,

370
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,840
You and brother Ning Fang,

371
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,270
go to school together, is that OK?

372
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,110
Otherwise,

373
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,430
You go in together.

374
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:42,960
Can I?

375
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,880
Don't worry.

376
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,040
I can tell them.

377
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,390
You're my temporary assistant.

378
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,550
I'll take you in.

379
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,760
That's great!

380
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,720
Thank you.

381
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,470
Let's go, Xiaobao.

382
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
Mom will accompany you in.

383
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,190
Be careful.

384
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
It's time to go to school.

385
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,600
Mr. He,

386
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,270
I won't go to the company today.

387
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,310
Let all the participants,

388
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,190
go to the building directly opposite

389
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,150
the Sunshine Primary School

390
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,720
and find the floor facing the second floor

391
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,880
of the teaching building.

392
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,230
OK, let me check.

393
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,920
But that place

394
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,150
doesn't seem suitable for a meeting.

395
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,800
I don't care.

396
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,230
That,

397
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,800
is the place for today's regular meeting.

398
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,510
Please slow down, sister.

399
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,430
Excuse me.

400
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,310
I've wronged you today.

401
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,880
Today is Junior He's first day at school.

402
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Mr. He is a little uneasy.

403
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,550
So our meeting today...

404
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,350
I'm not worried.

405
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,640
Yes, yes.

406
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,150
This is called the merger of regular meeting

407
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,760
and group building.

408
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,040
How perfect to eat snail rice noodles for it.

409
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,960
By the way, we will test

410
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,150
the quality of the latest telescope

411
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,880
from the Yi En Company.

412
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,000
Xiaobao's situation

413
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,310
looks normal,

414
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:33,680
His mood is stable.

415
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,000
The environment is safe, too.

416
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,600
Nothing unusual.

417
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,190
Well.

418
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,800
Today we're going to start

419
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,350
our new course.

420
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,470
We are going to learn a poem today.

421
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,680
First of all, please read this poem

422
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,510
after me.

423
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,000
Farmers weeding...

424
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,640
Farmers weeding...

425
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,040
You're so worried.

426
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,800
Do you think Xiaobao is OK?

427
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,550
Xiaobao is OK.

428
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,600
He will adapt soon.

429
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,430
Don't you think it's good?

430
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:05,920
Let's go.

431
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,080
Who knows food on a tray,

432
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,230
Thanks to their toiling day.

433
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,920
Mr. He.

434
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,150
Let me report

435
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,880
the sector adjustment in the third quarter.

436
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,270
Jason is in charge of the e-commerce operation

437
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,470
of the Yi En Company.

438
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,800
Now is the profit-making period.

439
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,430
If we take this opportunity,

440
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,920
we can

441
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,310
redistribute the traffic,

442
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,310
reach out to new users

443
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,430
and add value to our products.

444
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,270
Well done!

445
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,760
By the way, Jason...

446
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,150
Why is this guy here?

447
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,430
Jason,

448
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,550
isn't he in the marketing department all the time?

449
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,510
Mr. He,

450
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,760
Do you have a problem with Jason?

451
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,110
Dare you move again!

452
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,080
He didn't listen to the teacher,

453
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,080
and kept playing with handkerchief.

454
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,760
Don't worry.

455
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
Teachers in our school

456
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,550
is very professional.

457
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,470
Soon Xiaobao will get used to it.

458
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,150
Mobile phone.

459
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,800
Hello.

460
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,430
Hang up?

461
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,680
Think about where to go later.

462
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,470
It's such a fine day.

463
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,190
Or,

464
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,310
how about we

465
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,510
playing basketball with Xiaobao?

466
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,230
Call and hang up, over and over again.

467
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,310
Why is he so annoying?

468
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,550
Who is it?

469
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,390
Nothing.

470
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:04,880
Hello.

471
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,680
Are you CEO

472
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,190
and a part-time spammer?

473
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,190
Speak up.

474
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,230
The signal in the meeting room is not very good.

475
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,470
Table 7, one beef brisket rice noodles,

476
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,600
without sour bamboo shoots.

477
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,270
So you're eating rice noodles

478
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,680
in your working time?

479
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,190
What's up?

480
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,190
Go home early.

481
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,920
I promised Xiaobao

482
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,040
to play basketball

483
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,310
with Ning Fang after school,

484
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,000
Is that OK?

485
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,080
Something happened at home.

486
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,150
What can happen at home?

487
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,230
Something serious.

488
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,720
What's the matter?

489
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,800
I'll take you back.

490
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,510
No need. A driver will pick you up.

491
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,350
Hello?

492
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,390
What's up?

493
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,720
Why is he so hot tempered?

494
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,720
He Qiaoyan is really...

495
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Come on, Xiaobao.

496
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,110
Hurry up, There's something wrong with dad.

497
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,310
Something serious happened. Come on.

498
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,230
You're back.

499
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,190
It's urgent, isn't it?

500
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,350
Xiaobao, go back to your room first.

501
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,310
Mom and Dad

502
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,190
have a few words to say.

503
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,960
Go ahead.

504
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,000
What's the matter?

505
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,190
I'm a little hungry.

506
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,640
I beg your pardon?

507
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,470
The seafood noodles you made for Xiaobao

508
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,150
tastes not bad.

509
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,390
I want to try it.

510
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,720
That's what you're talking about.

511
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,600
Isn't that serious enough?

512
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,270
I'm hungry,

513
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,550
which will affect my work.

514
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,430
If I can't work normally,

515
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,230
Heshi Group

516
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,110
won't be able to operate normally.

517
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,470
Heshi's stock price will fall,

518
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,080
employees' income will be affected,

519
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,150
and shareholders' assets will shrink.

520
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,800
Stop.

521
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,270
Seafood noodles, right?

522
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
I'll make it for you right now.

523
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,390
If you can't finish it,

524
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,430
you'll be in big trouble.

525
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,190
Tell you what.

526
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,920
I ordered seafood noodles.

527
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,720
Yes.

528
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,550
Instant noodles with seafood flavor.

529
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,640
If you don't think

530
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
it's enough seafood,

531
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,040
I'll add some more.

532
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,230
Very conscience,

533
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,000
you see.

534
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,350
You don't think

535
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,430
I've seen instant noodles before,

536
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,000
do you?

537
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,550
Do you want to eat it or not?

538
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,680
There's half

539
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,080
food additives in it.

540
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,150
This is the noodles you ordered.

541
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,510
You have to finish it even if you cry.

542
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Friendly Reminder,

543
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,840
Freshly-made noodles

544
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,150
If you don't eat it,

545
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,350
It's going to be soggy in 15 minutes.

546
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,350
Eat it.

547
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,150
Eat.

548
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,230
Hello, Chairman He.

549
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,510
Mrs. Liu, is Qiaoyan in?

550
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,190
Mr. He is in the kitchen.

551
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,110
Take your time. I'm leaving.

552
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,230
Dare you go.

553
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,230
The noodles are getting soggy.

554
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,920
Suddenly I don't feel hungry.

555
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,310
Qiaoyan.

556
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,470
Aunt He, why are you here?

557
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,390
Aunt He?

558
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,040
Aunt He, this is Yiyue.

559
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,390
She's my wife.

560
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Hello, aunt He.

561
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,960
Aunt He, why didn't you tell me in advance

562
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
when you came back this time?

563
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,960
Is she really your wife?

564
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,270
Of course.

565
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:24,920
It's just that we both

566
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,840
keep a low profile,

567
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,920
so we didn't have a wedding.

568
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,470
What's her family like?

569
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,720
and what's her job?

570
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,430
Her parents are ordinary workers.

571
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,350
Yiyue is a

572
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,390
child psychologist

573
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,600
working at Yade hospital.

574
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,550
Why do you choose her?

575
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,390
Because she's good.

576
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,270
Most of all,

577
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
Xiaobao likes her very much.

578
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,040
Just a little psychologist.

579
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,760
What's so good about her?

580
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,040
She...

581
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,470
is very special.

582
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,680
She is unique.

583
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,920
He has a sweet mouth.

584
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,470
Don't forget who you are.

585
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
Your wife

586
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,230
is not only your wife,

587
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,390
she is also the hostess of Heshi Group.

588
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,800
Can she bear it?

589
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,600
What's wrong to be the hostess?

590
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,000
Can it be a thousand pounds?

591
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,390
Is she afraid I can't take it?

592
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,000
Since she talks so much,

593
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,190
she must not be thirsty.

594
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,080
I'll drink it myself.

595
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,000
I'll see Xiaobao.

596
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,600
OK.

597
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Go to the fridge,

598
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,110
put a piece of ice in your mouth.

599
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,310
Go.

600
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,310
OK.

601
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,600
Xiaobao.

602
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,000
Xiaobao.

603
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,470
Xiaobao.

604
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,040
Baby.

605
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,510
I miss you so much.

606
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,190
Xiaobao,

607
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,040
Do you like

608
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,800
the new mommy dad found for you?

609
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,110
I found Mommy.

610
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,470
Why don't you just

611
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,800
tell your aunt

612
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,430
that we are a contractual relationship.

613
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,150
You don't know my aunt.

614
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,310
She never does things

615
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,040
with a success rate of

616
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,510
less than 75%,

617
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,310
and most importantly,

618
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,080
she values my spouse very much.

619
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,230
What happened to your spouse?

620
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,960
It's not a gold mine.

621
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,270
It's worth more than gold mine.

622
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,430
Narcissism.

623
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,000
Are you ready?

624
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
What am I going to do?

625
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,640
Keep your gold mine.

626
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,390
My aunt has doubts

627
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,150
about our marriage.

628
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,550
You should find a way

629
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
to dispel her doubts.

630
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,960
Otherwise,

631
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,840
If we're both exposed,

632
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,960
you will pay the penalty.

633
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,640
Boss, what can I do?

634
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:29,960
Does it hurt?

635
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,230
I told you to be careful.

636
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,350
Look at you, you are so careless.

637
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,270
Aunt.

638
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,920
Blow.

639
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,920
We just need to

640
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,840
show her

641
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,190
something that looks sweet.

642
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,600
You didn't tell me before

643
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,230
that there would be a humanoid monitor at home

644
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,230
to watch us at any time.

645
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,080
My aunt usually lives in the old house

646
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,880
and doesn't come around often.

647
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,510
What kind of job do I have?

648
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,920
Xiaobao still doesn't say anything.

649
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:26,880
It's served.

650
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,880
The taste of Qin's food is superb.

651
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,920
Mommy.

652
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,429
Aunt He might not know that

653
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,880
Xiaobao had already started school.

654
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,270
It was all Yiyue's credit.

655
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,920
Nothing.

656
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,469
Mainly because Xiaobao is brave.

657
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:43,679
And Mr. He...

658
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,679
Qiaoyan is also cooperative.

659
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,800
Xiaobao, are you hungry?

660
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,639
Mommy made

661
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,880
your favorite chicken wings.

662
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:52,310
Let's eat.

663
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,190
OK.

664
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,190
Auntie, please try my specialty.

665
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,640
Mrs. Liu,

666
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,840
Take a pair of public chopsticks to Dr. Qin.

667
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,110
OK.

668
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,760
Give it to me.

669
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,390
Xiaobao also wants to eat it?

670
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
Mommy will pick it up for you.

671
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,960
I want one, too.

672
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,640
OK.

673
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,760
I'll go back first.

674
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,110
Auntie, let me see you off.

675
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,230
You eat first.

676
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,510
Xiaobao, you didn't dare to eat just now, did you?

677
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,760
We can eat now.

678
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,040
Well,

679
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,270
I'll feed you.

680
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,390
I didn't expect Qiaoyan

681
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,190
to get married so suddenly.

682
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,680
This marriage is for Xiaobao.

683
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,270
Why?

684
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,600
In order to treat Xiaobao.

685
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,190
You have seen that already.

686
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,960
Why didn't you say it?

687
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,800
The marital relation is fake.

688
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,800
But I found out that Qiaoyan

689
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,230
seemed to have a crush

690
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,680
on this girl.

691
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,150
How about Miss Lin's?

692
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
Same as usual.

693
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,350
The marriage of Lin's and He's family

694
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
is a must.
