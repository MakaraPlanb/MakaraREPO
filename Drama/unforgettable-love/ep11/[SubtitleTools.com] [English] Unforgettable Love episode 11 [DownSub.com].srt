Unforgettable Love
EP11

2
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,960
We're home!

3
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,039
Oh my Gosh! The villa has changed a lot.

4
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,480
Xiaobao

5
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,880
Go and see what it is.

6
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:19,360
Look, Xiaobao.

7
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,710
Isn't it like the small house in the fairy tale

8
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,920
I told you yesterday?

9
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,710
It smells good.

10
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,310
Xiaobao, let's go wash our hands.

11
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,790
Come and have dinner after washing your hands.

12
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,079
This is good.

13
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,520
This is your new table?

14
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,360
Didn't you say that

15
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,880
home should enable us feel like home.

16
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,110
Eating is not only about getting food,

17
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:42,840
but also an opportunity

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,630
for family to communicate.

19
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,360
The round table can

20
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,630
draw us closer than the long table.

21
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,560
Sit down, please.

22
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,880
Wait a minute.

23
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,150
Look at these chairs, Xiaobao.

24
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,310
Which color do you like?

25
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,190
Quickly choose one,

26
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,560
and then put on your little sticker

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,230
to occupy the seat.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
Hey,

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
This table is my new...

30
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,079
What's new?

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,520
Nothing.

32
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,040
Furniture

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,630
is for people.

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Come on.

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
It's time for dinner.

36
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,230
Which dish do you like?

37
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,630
I'll pick it up for you.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Eat for yourself.

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,710
This is your reward.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,790
The three of us eat together.

41
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,230
Come on.

42
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,230
Are you Miss Yang?

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,670
Yeah.

44
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:53,630
Follow me, please.

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,840
Miss Yang, please have a seat.

46
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you.

47
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,269
Mr. Wen

48
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,190
The file you want,

49
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,480
I've already brought it here.

50
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,920
Mr. Wen, Good job!

51
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,150
This is the document you want.

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,710
No hurry.

53
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,670
Excuse me,

54
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,270
Please enjoy your meal.

55
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,150
The grilled Japanese Black Cattle in this restaurant

56
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,110
is very good.

57
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,750
Try it.

58
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,230
Don't beat me.

59
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,400
At three o'clock direction,

60
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,000
the person who was secretly photographing

61
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
was arranged by you, right?

62
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,840
How can you be kidding?

63
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,480
Why would I do that?

64
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,400
No reason.

65
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,150
Because you want to find someone

66
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,880
to take a picture of us,

67
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,590
so you can tell Chairman Wen

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,880
that I am

69
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
a person with over-weight scheming

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,400
who seduces you.

71
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,590
About Chairman Wen,

72
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,080
hates that there are girls in the company

73
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,270
who deliberately approach you,

74
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,880
so he will fire me.

75
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,960
When I leave,

76
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,150
no one will keep an eye on you.

77
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,590
Why don't you think

78
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,560
I really love you?

79
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,150
Restaurant, violin,

80
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,710
and this.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,630
Premium Japanese Black Cattle.

82
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Big brother, what era is it?

83
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,190
How can you

84
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,150
say that you really love me.

85
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,670
Want to catch a lady?

86
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,560
I suggest you

87
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
do the whole set when you are acting.

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,630
Otherwise, you lose the woman and your face.

89
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,590
Since Miss Yang is so confident,

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,150
dare you make a bet with me?

91
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,270
What's the bet?

92
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,790
If I get you tempted,

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,150
you'll take the initiative to leave.

94
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,230
Naive.

95
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,750
Why make fun

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,360
of my work?

97
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,710
Or I'll tell my dad,

98
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,630
that night...

99
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,360
we...

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,190
Fine.

101
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,520
Just go ahead.

102
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,360
Enjoy

103
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,310
your time

104
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,360
in Wenshi group.

105
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,790
I believe

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,400
that you

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,310
will leave soon.

108
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,790
What happened?

109
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,230
But I have one condition.

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,960
If I got you tempted,

111
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,750
you'll have to listen to me.

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,310
Don't you dare?

113
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,270
What do I dare not do?

114
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,630
Deal.

115
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,630
Go!

116
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Yiyue, Xiaobao.

117
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,110
Xiaobao,

118
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,310
guess what

119
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,840
I'll give you?

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
He is shy.

121
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,350
It's OK. Mommy can help you.

122
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,640
What is it?

123
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
Look, what's this?

124
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,080
Here you are, OK?

125
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,880
Let's go. Mommy will take you to play.

126
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,039
This guy,

127
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,640
When did he get on so well

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,679
with Xiaobao?

129
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,549
Look,

130
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,680
Try to bounce the ball yourself.

131
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,150
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,720
I have seriously considered your suggestion

133
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,310
and decided to make a field trip to see

134
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,680
if it is really suitable for Xiaobao.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,880
Welcome, Mr. He!

136
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,350
Let me show you around.

137
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,080
Not necessary.

138
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,230
I've known

139
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,470
all the hardware facilities here.

140
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,640
It's mainly about teachers.

141
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
I think it's necessary for me

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,310
to know about Mr. Ning Fang.

143
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,470
Xiaobao can't wait to play the ball.

144
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,350
Come on, Xiaobao.

145
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,390
You two brothers, please step aside.

146
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,150
No.

147
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,720
Since it's a parent-child activity,

148
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,080
I think it's necessary

149
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,040
to participate in it together.

150
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,270
Xiaobao,

151
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,550
Let's play basketball.

152
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,310
I'll, by myself,

153
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,880
take turns to challenge Mr. Ning Fang

154
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,960
and your mummy.

155
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,800
If they win,

156
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,640
you can come to this school,

157
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,270
OK?

158
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,720
You against us two alone?

159
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,310
Yes, of course.

160
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,150
Come on, Ning Fang!

161
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,880
Dad scored.

162
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,920
It's a goal!

163
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,350
Dad scored again!

164
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,110
Come on, Ning Fang!

165
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,880
2-2, a draw.

166
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,470
Is it my turn to play?

167
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
l have to go.

168
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,230
I'm coming.

169
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,190
Yeah!

170
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,760
Hand hurts.

171
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,080
Mr. He.

172
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,270
Well, I will humor you.

173
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,080
We play positioning shots.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't need it.

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,720
Yeah!

176
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,510
Goal!

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,190
Great!

178
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,000
Come again.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,150
It's almost a goal. It doesn't matter.

180
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,800
Come again.

181
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,000
It's your turn.

182
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,470
Wow!

183
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,190
Again!

184
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,760
Time's over. Four to two.

185
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,390
We won!

186
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,040
Xiaobao, you can go to school!

187
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,840
You can to go to school.

188
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,000
Are you happy, Xiaobao?

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
You can to go to school.

190
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,600
Yeah!

191
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,920
Mr. He, you have to keep your word.

192
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,510
Look,

193
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,960
pencil and eraser,

194
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
I've got a lot for you.

195
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,230
At that time,

196
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,760
when some other kids don't bring it,

197
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,840
remember to share with them.

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,680
Change and tissue,

199
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,350
I'll put them both

200
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,600
in the side pocket.

201
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,600
Handkerchief.

202
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,880
Xiaobao can go to school finally!

203
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,350
OK.

204
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,110
Let's move on to the next one.

205
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Let's cover the books together.

206
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
You know?

207
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,110
When I was a kid,

208
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,470
What I'm looking forward to most

209
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,080
is the book cover before the beginning of school.

210
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,040
It's usually wrapped by my father.

211
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,510
This is

212
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,550
the sense of ritual when school begins.

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,190
Is it pretty?

214
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,080
Shall I put something

215
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,190
on your face?

216
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,800
This is the sense of ritual when school begins.

217
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,600
Excuse me,

218
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,510
This is a great next-gen invention.

219
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,270
The prototype of children's smart schoolbag,

220
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,840
combined with our company's latest technology,

221
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,880
can comprehensively deal with

222
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
all kinds of emergencies

223
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,310
Xiaobao encounter at school.

224
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,230
Let me show you.

225
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,760
Xiaobao, look at me.

226
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,150
In times of danger,

227
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,840
There is a one button

228
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,110
for help on the left.

229
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,150
When you press it,

230
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,470
it will give out a warning sound.

231
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,040
There's a camera in the middle.

232
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,190
A rangefinder on the right.

233
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,270
How heavy it is!

234
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I've thought about that.

235
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,150
New lightweight design,

236
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,510
in line with the human body mechanics,

237
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,190
can resist the high temperature of 500 degrees

238
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,760
and the water depth of 20 meters.

239
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,350
People who know think he is going to school,

240
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,510
for those who don't know,

241
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,110
they think that he is going to war.

242
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,390
In addition,

243
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,840
Integrated with GPS,

244
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,550
And face recognition to prevent lost.

245
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,310
The data can be synchronized

246
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,110
to the app of parents' mobile phone in real time.

247
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,470
Can it walk on its own?

248
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,470
Is there any need for moving?

249
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,880
You are so powerful,

250
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,080
why don't you just

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,920
build a robot to accompany him to school?

252
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,150
Sounds sort of reasonable.

253
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,390
If necessary,

254
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,040
I can arrange

255
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,080
special accompanying staff.

256
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,150
Do you like it?

257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,800
Come here,

258
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,880
Just save it.

259
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,430
The school

260
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,510
is full of children

261
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,150
of the same age as Xiaobao.

262
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,510
The teachers and the logistics were there all day.

263
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,040
When you make such an exception,

264
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,470
how can he blend in?

265
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,840
Xiaobao is different from

266
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,430
other children.

267
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,350
I have to make sure

268
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,390
he is perfectly safe.

269
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,270
In addition,

270
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,510
This is the first time

271
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,230
for him to face

272
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,470
the strange collective environment alone.

273
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,640
I have to make

274
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,800
a comprehensive assessment and prevention

275
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,310
of this unknown environment.

276
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,640
Think about it,

277
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,190
there are 20 children in a class.

278
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,190
What kind of children

279
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,390
are the other 19?

280
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,350
Will they hurt him?

281
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Are classroom facilities

282
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,960
and school activities safe?

283
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,310
I don't know anything about these.

284
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,390
Stop.

285
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,840
If you want Xiaobao

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,150
to become a normal child,

287
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,270
at first,

288
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,080
You have to learn

289
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,000
how to be a normal parent.

290
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,390
So you mean,

291
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,470
I'm not normal?

292
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,600
You are the boss,

293
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,150
How dare I say you're not normal.

294
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,080
It's just that I think,

295
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,840
You're really,

296
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,310
in some ways...

297
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,550
too extraordinary.

298
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,430
It's really hard

299
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,680
for a petty little beauty like me

300
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,150
to understand.

301
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,080
Good Bye.

302
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,800
Xiaobao,

303
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,040
I'll be with you.

304
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,510
So is there

305
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:02,680
a need for moving?

306
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,080
I'll modify it.

307
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,800
Xiaobao, your father is crazy.

308
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,800
Come on.

309
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,510
Good morning.

310
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:18,960
Bye-bye.

311
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,510
Come on, Xiaobao. I'll take it for you.

312
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,190
Your bag.

313
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,190
Xiaobao, be good and go to school.

314
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,350
Dad and mom,

315
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,270
will pick you up after school.

316
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,190
OK?

317
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,110
I have another meeting this afternoon.

318
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
Of course, it can be cancelled.

319
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,600
Xiaobao,

320
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,550
Mom and I

321
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,880
will pick you up from school in the afternoon.

322
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,960
Don't worry,

323
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,880
our Xiaobao, don't be afraid.

324
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,640
This handkerchief

325
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,350
mom put on the side of your schoolbag for you,

326
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,840
mom will always be with you,

327
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,550
OK?

328
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,470
In fact, you don't have to go.

329
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
Come and kiss dad.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,190
Bye, baby. Have a good class.

331
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,880
Good morning teacher.

332
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,270
You can say goodbye

333
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,150
in the way of kiss relay.

334
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,110
Xiaobao kisses his father,

335
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,840
then his father kisses his mother,

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,600
and then his mother kisses Xiaobao,

337
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,720
so the family

338
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
will be together forever.

339
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,840
You're a little villain.

340
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,230
You're very enthusiastic

341
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,430
about this kind of thing.

342
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,920
Now it's the mother's turn

343
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,800
to pass on the kiss to the dad.

344
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,430
The good interaction between the parents

345
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,470
also indirectly gives the child a sense of security.

346
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,040
No way.

347
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,640
That's not what I want,

348
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,550
but what Xiaobao want.

349
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,960
Please cooperate.

350
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,640
Stage kiss, OK?

351
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,080
Kiss or not?

352
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Stage kiss.

353
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,880
Do you want

354
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,600
to die?

355
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,150
If you're afraid, go.

356
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,270
Xiaobao, we are kissing now.

357
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,080
Kiss.

358
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,190
OK.

359
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,080
I still have a meeting.

360
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,000
Idiot.

361
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,430
Xiaobao,

362
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,430
Your father is a big fool.

363
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,150
Let him go back,

364
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,040
and practice more.

365
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,760
Can we continue tomorrow?

366
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,190
Xiaobao, Yiyue,

367
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,600
Ning Fang.

368
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,150
Good morning.

369
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,230
Xiaobao,

370
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,840
You and brother Ning Fang,

371
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,270
go to school together, is that OK?

372
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,110
Otherwise,

373
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,430
You go in together.

374
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,960
Can I?

375
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,880
Don't worry.

376
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,040
I can tell them.

377
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,390
You're my temporary assistant.

378
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,550
I'll take you in.

379
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
That's great!

380
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,720
Thank you.

381
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,470
Let's go, Xiaobao.

382
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,840
Mom will accompany you in.

383
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,190
Be careful.

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,000
It's time to go to school.

385
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,600
Mr. He,

386
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,270
I won't go to the company today.

387
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,310
Let all the participants,

388
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,190
go to the building directly opposite

389
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,150
the Sunshine Primary School

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,720
and find the floor facing the second floor

391
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,880
of the teaching building.

392
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,230
OK, let me check.

393
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,920
But that place

394
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,150
doesn't seem suitable for a meeting.

395
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,800
I don't care.

396
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,230
That,

397
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,800
is the place for today's regular meeting.

398
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,510
Please slow down, sister.

399
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,430
Excuse me.

400
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,310
I've wronged you today.

401
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Today is Junior He's first day at school.

402
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
Mr. He is a little uneasy.

403
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,550
So our meeting today...

404
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,350
I'm not worried.

405
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,640
Yes, yes.

406
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,150
This is called the merger of regular meeting

407
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,760
and group building.

408
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,040
How perfect to eat snail rice noodles for it.

409
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,960
By the way, we will test

410
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,150
the quality of the latest telescope

411
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
from the Yi En Company.

412
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,000
Xiaobao's situation

413
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,310
looks normal,

414
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,680
His mood is stable.

415
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,000
The environment is safe, too.

416
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,600
Nothing unusual.

417
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,190
Well.

418
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Today we're going to start

419
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,350
our new course.

420
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,470
We are going to learn a poem today.

421
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,680
First of all, please read this poem

422
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,510
after me.

423
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,000
Farmers weeding...

424
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,640
Farmers weeding...

425
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,040
You're so worried.

426
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,800
Do you think Xiaobao is OK?

427
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,550
Xiaobao is OK.

428
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,600
He will adapt soon.

429
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,430
Don't you think it's good?

430
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,920
Let's go.

431
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,080
Who knows food on a tray,

432
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,230
Thanks to their toiling day.

433
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,920
Mr. He.

434
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,150
Let me report

435
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,880
the sector adjustment in the third quarter.

436
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,270
Jason is in charge of the e-commerce operation

437
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,470
of the Yi En Company.

438
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,800
Now is the profit-making period.

439
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,430
If we take this opportunity,

440
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,920
we can

441
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,310
redistribute the traffic,

442
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,310
reach out to new users

443
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,430
and add value to our products.

444
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,270
Well done!

445
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,760
By the way, Jason...

446
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,150
Why is this guy here?

447
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,430
Jason,

448
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,550
isn't he in the marketing department all the time?

449
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,510
Mr. He,

450
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,760
Do you have a problem with Jason?

451
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,110
Dare you move again!

452
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,080
He didn't listen to the teacher,

453
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,080
and kept playing with handkerchief.

454
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,760
Don't worry.

455
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,720
Teachers in our school

456
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,550
is very professional.

457
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,470
Soon Xiaobao will get used to it.

458
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,150
Mobile phone.

459
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,800
Hello.

460
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,430
Hang up?

461
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,680
Think about where to go later.

462
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,470
It's such a fine day.

463
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,190
Or,

464
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,310
how about we

465
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,510
playing basketball with Xiaobao?

466
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,230
Call and hang up, over and over again.

467
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,310
Why is he so annoying?

468
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,550
Who is it?

469
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,390
Nothing.

470
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,880
Hello.

471
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,680
Are you CEO

472
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,190
and a part-time spammer?

473
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,190
Speak up.

474
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,230
The signal in the meeting room is not very good.

475
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,470
Table 7, one beef brisket rice noodles,

476
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,600
without sour bamboo shoots.

477
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,270
So you're eating rice noodles

478
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,680
in your working time?

479
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,190
What's up?

480
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,190
Go home early.

481
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,920
I promised Xiaobao

482
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,040
to play basketball

483
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,310
with Ning Fang after school,

484
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,000
Is that OK?

485
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,080
Something happened at home.

486
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,150
What can happen at home?

487
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,230
Something serious.

488
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,720
What's the matter?

489
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,800
I'll take you back.

490
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,510
No need. A driver will pick you up.

491
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,350
Hello?

492
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,390
What's up?

493
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,720
Why is he so hot tempered?

494
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,720
He Qiaoyan is really...

495
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
Come on, Xiaobao.

496
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,110
Hurry up, There's something wrong with dad.

497
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,310
Something serious happened. Come on.

498
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,230
You're back.

499
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,190
It's urgent, isn't it?

500
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,350
Xiaobao, go back to your room first.

501
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,310
Mom and Dad

502
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,190
have a few words to say.

503
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,960
Go ahead.

504
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
What's the matter?

505
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,190
I'm a little hungry.

506
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,640
I beg your pardon?

507
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,470
The seafood noodles you made for Xiaobao

508
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,150
tastes not bad.

509
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,390
I want to try it.

510
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,720
That's what you're talking about.

511
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:22,600
Isn't that serious enough?

512
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,270
I'm hungry,

513
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,550
which will affect my work.

514
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,430
If I can't work normally,

515
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,230
Heshi Group

516
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,110
won't be able to operate normally.

517
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,470
Heshi's stock price will fall,

518
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,080
employees' income will be affected,

519
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,150
and shareholders' assets will shrink.

520
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,800
Stop.

521
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,270
Seafood noodles, right?

522
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
I'll make it for you right now.

523
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,390
If you can't finish it,

524
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,430
you'll be in big trouble.

525
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,190
Tell you what.

526
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,920
I ordered seafood noodles.

527
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,720
Yes.

528
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,550
Instant noodles with seafood flavor.

529
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,640
If you don't think

530
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,920
it's enough seafood,

531
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,040
I'll add some more.

532
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,230
Very conscience,

533
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,000
you see.

534
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,350
You don't think

535
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,430
I've seen instant noodles before,

536
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,000
do you?

537
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,550
Do you want to eat it or not?

538
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,680
There's half

539
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,080
food additives in it.

540
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,150
This is the noodles you ordered.

541
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,510
You have to finish it even if you cry.

542
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Friendly Reminder,

543
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,840
Freshly-made noodles

544
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,150
If you don't eat it,

545
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,350
It's going to be soggy in 15 minutes.

546
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,350
Eat it.

547
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,150
Eat.

548
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,230
Hello, Chairman He.

549
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,510
Mrs. Liu, is Qiaoyan in?

550
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,190
Mr. He is in the kitchen.

551
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,110
Take your time. I'm leaving.

552
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,230
Dare you go.

553
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,230
The noodles are getting soggy.

554
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,920
Suddenly I don't feel hungry.

555
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,310
Qiaoyan.

556
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,470
Aunt He, why are you here?

557
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,390
Aunt He?

558
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,040
Aunt He, this is Yiyue.

559
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,390
She's my wife.

560
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Hello, aunt He.

561
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,960
Aunt He, why didn't you tell me in advance

562
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,080
when you came back this time?

563
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Is she really your wife?

564
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,270
Of course.

565
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,920
It's just that we both

566
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,840
keep a low profile,

567
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,920
so we didn't have a wedding.

568
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,470
What's her family like?

569
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,720
and what's her job?

570
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,430
Her parents are ordinary workers.

571
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,350
Yiyue is a

572
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,390
child psychologist

573
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,600
working at Yade hospital.

574
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,550
Why do you choose her?

575
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,390
Because she's good.

576
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,270
Most of all,

577
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Xiaobao likes her very much.

578
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,040
Just a little psychologist.

579
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
What's so good about her?

580
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,040
She...

581
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,470
is very special.

582
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,680
She is unique.

583
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,920
He has a sweet mouth.

584
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,470
Don't forget who you are.

585
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,000
Your wife

586
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,230
is not only your wife,

587
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,390
she is also the hostess of Heshi Group.

588
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,800
Can she bear it?

589
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,600
What's wrong to be the hostess?

590
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,000
Can it be a thousand pounds?

591
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,390
Is she afraid I can't take it?

592
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,000
Since she talks so much,

593
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,190
she must not be thirsty.

594
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,080
I'll drink it myself.

595
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,000
I'll see Xiaobao.

596
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,600
OK.

597
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Go to the fridge,

598
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,110
put a piece of ice in your mouth.

599
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,310
Go.

600
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,310
OK.

601
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,600
Xiaobao.

602
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,000
Xiaobao.

603
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,470
Xiaobao.

604
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,040
Baby.

605
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,510
I miss you so much.

606
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,190
Xiaobao,

607
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,040
Do you like

608
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,800
the new mommy dad found for you?

609
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,110
I found Mommy.

610
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,470
Why don't you just

611
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,800
tell your aunt

612
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,430
that we are a contractual relationship.

613
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,150
You don't know my aunt.

614
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,310
She never does things

615
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,040
with a success rate of

616
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,510
less than 75%,

617
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,310
and most importantly,

618
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,080
she values my spouse very much.

619
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,230
What happened to your spouse?

620
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,960
It's not a gold mine.

621
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,270
It's worth more than gold mine.

622
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,430
Narcissism.

623
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,000
Are you ready?

624
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,640
What am I going to do?

625
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,640
Keep your gold mine.

626
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:20,390
My aunt has doubts

627
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,150
about our marriage.

628
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,550
You should find a way

629
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
to dispel her doubts.

630
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,960
Otherwise,

631
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,840
If we're both exposed,

632
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,960
you will pay the penalty.

633
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,640
Boss, what can I do?

634
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,960
Does it hurt?

635
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,230
I told you to be careful.

636
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,350
Look at you, you are so careless.

637
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,270
Aunt.

638
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
Blow.

639
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,920
We just need to

640
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,840
show her

641
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,190
something that looks sweet.

642
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,600
You didn't tell me before

643
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,230
that there would be a humanoid monitor at home

644
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,230
to watch us at any time.

645
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,080
My aunt usually lives in the old house

646
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:05,880
and doesn't come around often.

647
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,510
What kind of job do I have?

648
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,920
Xiaobao still doesn't say anything.

649
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,880
It's served.

650
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,880
The taste of Qin's food is superb.

651
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,920
Mommy.

652
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,429
Aunt He might not know that

653
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,880
Xiaobao had already started school.

654
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,270
It was all Yiyue's credit.

655
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,920
Nothing.

656
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,469
Mainly because Xiaobao is brave.

657
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,679
And Mr. He...

658
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,679
Qiaoyan is also cooperative.

659
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,800
Xiaobao, are you hungry?

660
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,639
Mommy made

661
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:58,880
your favorite chicken wings.

662
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:00,310
Let's eat.

663
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,190
OK.

664
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,190
Auntie, please try my specialty.

665
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,640
Mrs. Liu,

666
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,840
Take a pair of public chopsticks to Dr. Qin.

667
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,110
OK.

668
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,760
Give it to me.

669
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,390
Xiaobao also wants to eat it?

670
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Mommy will pick it up for you.

671
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
I want one, too.

672
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,640
OK.

673
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,760
I'll go back first.

674
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,110
Auntie, let me see you off.

675
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,230
You eat first.

676
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,510
Xiaobao, you didn't dare to eat just now, did you?

677
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,760
We can eat now.

678
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,040
Well,

679
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,270
I'll feed you.

680
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,390
I didn't expect Qiaoyan

681
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,190
to get married so suddenly.

682
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,680
This marriage is for Xiaobao.

683
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,270
Why?

684
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,600
In order to treat Xiaobao.

685
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,190
You have seen that already.

686
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,960
Why didn't you say it?

687
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,800
The marital relation is fake.

688
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,800
But I found out that Qiaoyan

689
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,230
seemed to have a crush

690
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,680
on this girl.

691
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,150
How about Miss Lin's?

692
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Same as usual.

693
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,350
The marriage of Lin's and He's family

694
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
is a must.
