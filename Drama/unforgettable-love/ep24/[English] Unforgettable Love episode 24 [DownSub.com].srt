Unforgettable Love
EP24

2
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,000
Xiaobao

3
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,080
You played tricks.

4
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,750
Look.

5
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,960
We haven't seen each other for years.

6
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,920
Why are you still

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,039
not good at playing basketball?

8
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,789
He Qiaonian

9
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,000
I miss you.

10
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:56,960
Qiaoyan

11
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,840
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,480
Your sister-in-law and I were gone,

13
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,790
leaving Xiaobao for you to take care of.

14
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,360
I know

15
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,310
you have done a lot

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,270
for Xiaobao over the years.

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,789
Thank you.

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
You're his father.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,880
I will play basketball with you

20
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,440
in my next life.

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,360
He Qiaonian

22
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,480
He Qiaonian

23
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,230
He Qiaonian

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,480
He Qiaonian

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
Qiaoyan, what's the matter?

26
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm fine.

27
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,560
You had me scared.

28
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,150
I saw my elder brother just now.

29
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,230
What did he say?

30
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,400
He said that

31
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,400
he hoped us all to be fine.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,000
Come on.

33
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,080
Dad, Mom and Xiaobao

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,480
will be together forever.

35
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,400
We will be together forever.

36
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,000
So

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,670
that's how I have been evicted.

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,190
You can live here first.

39
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,880
No hurry.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,440
Life is a long journey.

41
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,480
Take it easy.

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,440
You can sort your things out.

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,079
You must be hungry.

44
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,270
I'll cook for you.

45
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,270
Thank you.

46
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,750
There are no ingredients at home.

47
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,440
Would you mind a bowl of noodles

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,110
with tomatoes and eggs?

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,079
Yes, please.

50
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,150
Thank you.

51
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,750
What are you drawing?

52
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,520
Is it a trench coat?

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,630
A trench coat?

54
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,040
Sorry.

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,520
I know nothing about design.

56
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,630
Nailed it.

57
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,750
Is it done?

58
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,080
Is it pretty?

59
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

60
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,480
In fact, I always wanted to design

61
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,110
an unique dress.

62
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,040
But I'm not satisfied with what I have drawn.

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,080
What you said just now

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,440
gave me a lot of inspiration.

65
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,360
Look, there are

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,080
three wearing methods.

67
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,560
Three contrast colors are combined.

68
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,440
And I plan to

69
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,750
choose waterproof fabric.

70
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,750
I hope

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,520
the person who wears the dress

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,750
can become unique.

73
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,480
It can be adapted to any occasion

74
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,190
without any constraints.

75
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,840
I hope I can

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,270
see it earlier.

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,790
It is just a preliminary idea.

78
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,520
It is still a long way to go

79
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,150
whether it can be turned into reality.

80
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,880
But before going further

81
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,790
you should have eaten something

82
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,230
right?

83
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,790
I'll cook another bowl of noodles.

84
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:20,710
OK, thank you.

85
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,360
Yummy.

86
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,480
It is so late.

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,400
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,230
As soon as I work

89
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,520
I tend to forget the time.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,670
Do you know what?

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
When a person does

92
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,400
what she likes to do most

93
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,840
she will shine.

94
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:48,520
I believe that

95
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,080
designing

96
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,480
will be the best way

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,360
to relieve your mental worries.

98
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,270
But I think you cured me.

99
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,040
But for you

100
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,790
maybe I unable to be reinvigorated

101
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,960
after a fall.

102
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,310
You don't know,

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:00,750
but I feel alive

104
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,360
when I get back

105
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,150
to work

106
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,270
just now.

107
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,400
It feels good.

108
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,480
So

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,960
thank you so much.

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,790
You really helped me a lot.

111
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,880
Don't thank me.

112
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,790
It's your heart

113
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,080
that doesn't give up what you are.

114
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,630
Now

115
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,110
it's my turn to help you.

116
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,590
Help me?

117
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,440
You should say goodbye to the past

118
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,590
and start a new life.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,880
Dr. Ning

120
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,230
A doctor could not find out his own medical solution.

121
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
You were a good talker

122
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,480
when you persuaded me just now.

123
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,360
But it doesn't work

124
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
when it happens to you.

125
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,710
You're right.

126
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,750
It's time for me to look forward.

127
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,350
OK.

128
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,840
OK, OK.

129
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,000
OK, no problem.

130
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:13,760
Yes.

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,230
I can arrive in France next week.

132
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,840
Bye.

133
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,510
Anything good happened?

134
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,510
I talked with my French friend

135
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,230
about my design we discussed before.

136
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,720
He is interested in it.

137
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,510
And he told his boss.

138
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,040
His boss wants to invite me

139
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,920
to be the cooperative designer of his company.

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,880
You're great.

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,600
Congratulations.

142
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,550
What do you want to eat?

143
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,230
I'll cook for you tonight.

144
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,350
How about western-style food?

145
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,080
OK.

146
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,150
Then you will go back to France soon?

147
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,680
I'm leaving tomorrow.

148
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,430
You're in a hurry.

149
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,720
They want me to participate in

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,760
the design of new products next quarter.

151
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,230
So I have to

152
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,350
go earlier and prepare for it.

153
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,800
That's great.

154
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,110
Qin Yiyue, He Qiaoyan.

155
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,550
He Qiaoyan

156
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,920
Please call me according to the law.

157
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,000
Call me hubby.

158
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,720
H...

159
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,080
Comrade He.

160
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,310
Comrade He?

161
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,680
What do you call me?

162
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,310
He

163
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
He?

164
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Are you sure?

165
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,960
He

166
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,680
He

167
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,960
Hubby.

168
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,190
One more time.

169
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,190
Hubby.

170
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,430
I have realized

171
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,760
my biggest wish.

172
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
Do you have

173
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,350
any wishes unrealized

174
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,550
before going to Germany?

175
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,040
Go to Germany?

176
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,430
I heard that

177
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,390
you called Dr. Huang that day.

178
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,550
I made a decision for you.

179
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,430
I told him that you would go to Germany.

180
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,000
I have told Dr. Huang that I won't go.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm not going.

182
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,350
I don't want to go.

183
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,800
I want to stay with you.

184
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,080
We want to stay with you, too.

185
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,350
But Xiaobao and I

186
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,040
prefer to see that

187
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,760
you are free

188
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,350
to pursue your dream.

189
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,720
You're willing to part with me?

190
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,920
Of course not.

191
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,190
So

192
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,840
it's a part of your plan.

193
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,640
Right?

194
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,470
I was wondering

195
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,640
why you took me to get the marriage certificate

196
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,760
in such a hurry.

197
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,550
It turns out that you want to hold my heart

198
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,350
by the little red book.

199
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,390
But

200
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,040
I'm not willing to part with you and Xiaobao.

201
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,880
I promise you.

202
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,150
Xiaobao and I

203
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,150
will fly to you every month.

204
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,600
Really?

205
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,390
Really.

206
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,310
Then I have another condition.

207
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,270
I want weddings.

208
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,640
OK.

209
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,230
I also want

210
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,390
a long, long

211
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,960
and long floor length bridal gown.

212
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,920
Then I will have a long and long

213
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,040
floor length bridal gown tailored for you.

214
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,270
You know what?

215
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,800
When I was a child,

216
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,960
I'd like nothing better than to play the part of the princess

217
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
by putting on a sheet and mosquito net.

218
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,430
The sheet is like a cape.

219
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,000
The sheet was dragged back and forth.

220
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,760
Mom came in and saw

221
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,920
the clean sheet sweeping the ground.

222
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,680
She almost killed me.

223
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,110
Hang on a sec.

224
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,270
You hang up first.

225
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,430
You first according to old rules.

226
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,510
Tomorrow

227
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,510
is the first day you go back to Heshi Group.

228
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,230
Are you excited?

229
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,150
In fact, it's three days later

230
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,310
than I have expected

231
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,430
to return to Heshi Group.

232
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,960
Although the bracelet is almost perfect

233
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,430
after upgrading.

234
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,230
But it delayed

235
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,150
for three days

236
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,800
to win back the contract of Cooper Five Group.

237
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,600
The company and staff

238
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,000
are not satisfied with the agents

239
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,600
they recommend during this period.

240
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,510
I think now the board of directors

241
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,760
have known that

242
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,680
you are the only leader

243
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,880
to take charge of the overall situation.

244
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,000
It's me who have led them to

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,760
make the achievements of Heshi Group

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,640
over the years.

247
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,110
Your husband is confident.

248
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,080
Nobody can be convincing except me.

249
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,470
Mr. He is not the average.

250
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,350
Is it the time for Mr. He

251
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:24,960
who is not the average

252
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
to go to sleep?

253
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
Your face will be puffy

254
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,270
if you don't sleep now.

255
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,800
Well, stop here.

256
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,960
Dr. Huang needs to see me.

257
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,680
I'm going.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,550
Bye.

259
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,470
Mr. He

260
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,310
Welcome back.

261
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,960
Is it over? Is it over?

262
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,920
Almost, almost.

263
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,680
Hurry up.

264
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
It's really an awful movie.

265
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:35,680
It staggers me that

266
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,550
it's the best horror movie of the year.

267
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,310
I feel so calm.

268
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,840
Boring. I'm going home.

269
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,150
Don't go.

270
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm scared.

271
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,000
Let me go.

272
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,880
Let me go.

273
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,920
What are you afraid of?

274
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:57,680
Look.

275
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,640
Do you see the corner?

276
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,510
As long as you won't see the corner

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,270
when you wake up at midnight

278
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,640
you will be fine.

279
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,680
I, I do not want you to go.

280
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,390
I'm scared.

281
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,880
I.

282
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,150
What are you doing?

283
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,230
I'm scared.

284
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,720
You are a man.

285
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
Wen Gu

286
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,390
Dad.

287
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,150
You, you live together?

288
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,640
No, no.

289
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,150
No no no, Mr. Wen.

290
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,150
Well, I'm going.

291
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,720
She is my girlfriend.

292
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,640
Don't be mischievous.

293
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,680
You are the manager of the company.

294
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,390
She is your secretary.

295
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Aren't you afraid of

296
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,310
being gossiped?

297
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,190
Look.

298
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,110
What's the rank of this one?

299
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,270
What?

300
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,720
She is my secretary

301
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
during work.

302
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,150
She is my girlfriend after work.

303
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,310
Which piece of laws of the universe says

304
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,080
a boss can't fall in love with his secretary.

305
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
And

306
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,110
it's prejudice and discrimination.

307
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,880
You see the career women

308
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,840
through colored glasses.

309
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,150
We are both unmarried.

310
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,550
Why can't we be together?

311
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,350
Why should we be gossiped?

312
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,150
Get into the room.

313
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,960
I will talk to her alone.

314
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,760
No.

315
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
You can talk to her

316
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,880
in my presence.

317
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,600
Don't irritate your father.

318
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
I will have a good talk with Mr. Wen.

319
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,390
No.

320
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,230
Hurry up.

321
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,720
Get into the room.

322
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,640
Please sit down.

323
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,510
What did my Dad say?

324
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,110
Don't give me a hard time.

325
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:07,190
I really cherish this job.

326
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,080
I've just seen a glimmer of hope

327
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,310
in my career.

328
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,310
I don't want to destroy it by myself.

329
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,800
Just stop here.

330
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,190
Your father is right.

331
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,110
I'm just a two-bit secretary.

332
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,000
Please let me disappear

333
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,230
in your world

334
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,680
like Wang Beijin and Wang Miao.

335
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,960
No way.

336
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,800
Calm down.

337
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,880
I can smooth things out.

338
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,110
And

339
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,270
never mind

340
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,470
what he said.

341
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,350
I'm a man and I can bear the burden.

342
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,600
I'm tired, OK?

343
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,000
What's wrong with you?

344
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,960
OK, you won't tell me the truth.

345
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,880
Dad just needs to see me.

346
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,040
I'm going to ask him.

347
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,680
I tell you to come here early.

348
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,110
Are there some misunderstandings

349
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,510
about the word "early"?

350
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,470
Dad, what did you say to Yang Ruowei?

351
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,230
I told her to break up with you.

352
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,960
Then

353
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,920
I allow her to

354
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,880
skip to the management of the group.

355
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
If you want to make a deal with her

356
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,760
you'd better make a deal with me.

357
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,270
50 million yuan.

358
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,150
Only 50 million yuan.

359
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,310
I will leave her immediately.

360
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,430
I will be in a big hurry

361
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,760
and at high speed.

362
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,880
Do you think I'm stupid?

363
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,470
50 million yuan.

364
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,800
25 million yuan

365
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,760
for each.

366
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,190
You will go to somewhere I don't know

367
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,470
to enjoy your unrestrained life.

368
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,640
Do you think your father

369
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,920
is rich but stupid?

370
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,040
No matter.

371
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,310
It doesn't matter if you don't agree

372
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,550
as long as she agrees.

373
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,550
What if I give up

374
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,880
Wenshi Group for her?

375
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,760
Just look up.

376
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Wenshi Group is the group of our Wen family.

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,720
You can't get rid of it.

378
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,040
To give up the company

379
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
is to give up yourself.

380
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,470
I don't care.

381
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,550
I am who I am.

382
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,880
I belong to nobody.

383
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
I have the right to choose

384
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,920
what I want.

385
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,760
OK, I'll count for you.

386
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,510
Look.

387
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,190
Your basic necessities

388
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,800
your car and house

389
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,680
are all a part of

390
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,680
the profit of Wenshi Group.

391
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,640
I have the right to take them back.

392
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,470
And your bar.

393
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,720
Wenshi Group owns all the shares.

394
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,550
I also have the right to take it back.

395
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,550
And your bank account.

396
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,430
I can freeze it

397
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,000
right now.

398
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,190
What do you have left?

399
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,080
Love is more than anything else.

400
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,430
You mean

401
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,310
if I choose her

402
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,800
I will give up everything I have now.

403
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Yang Ruowei

404
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,760
is not right for you.

405
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,230
She is not right for Wen family, either.

406
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,270
I will find another assistant

407
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,720
for you.

408
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,190
The second daughter of the boss

409
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,880
of Linmei Group

410
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,800
has loved you at a young age.

411
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,470
Her academic career is also great.

412
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,510
She's a sophomore now.

413
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,350
And she wants to come for an internship.

414
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,040
Then I ask her to follow you.

415
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,110
Isn't it good?

416
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,640
As long as you break up with Yang Ruowei,

417
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,190
you can do whatever you want in the future.

418
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,510
No work.

419
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,110
E-sports or racing.

420
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,470
You can do

421
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,600
whatever you want.

422
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,040
I see.

423
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,230
Good morning, Mr. Wen.

424
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,110
Yang Ruowei

425
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,600
Are you ready?

426
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,550
If I were nobody

427
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,640
would you like to accept me?

428
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,800
What do you mean?

429
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,600
Would you like to accept me?

430
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,270
You ask me to feed you?

431
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,760
It's impossible.

432
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,150
But I can lend you half a bed.

433
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,760
Come with me and go to see my Dad.

434
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,390
Here are

435
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,190
my house, car, deposit and the bar.

436
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,840
Now I return them to you.

437
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:36,960
And I don't care

438
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,680
the position of CEO.

439
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,550
I quit.

440
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,600
But

441
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,430
you still have to

442
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,350
pay me this month.

443
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,190
After all

444
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,880
I'm shielded by labour laws.

445
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,230
I will not touch

446
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,470
your resources in the future.

447
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,430
Wen Gu, I'm not worth it.

448
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,230
Stop talking.

449
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,110
Don't worry.

450
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,920
I can hold on a little longer.

451
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,640
Then I'll find a way to deal with it.

452
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,510
You are

453
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,190
thinking of

454
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,230
disowning me?

455
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,350
No, that's quite another matter.

456
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,310
You are my Dad forever.

457
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,840
Even if I wanted to

458
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,640
Ruowei can't agree.

459
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,040
You had many

460
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,920
girlfriends before.

461
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,080
As long as I get angry

462
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,510
you'll break up with them.

463
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,760
Why don't you

464
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,040
do so

465
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,720
this time?

466
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,600
It's true that I used to be faithless.

467
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,390
But I'm in deadly earnest this time.

468
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,310
I can give up everything

469
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,390
if she could be mine.

470
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,000
Yang Ruowei, you are really something.

471
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,110
In that case

472
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,040
I feel relieved for the girl.

473
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,190
You know that.

474
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:02,680
Mr. Wen.

475
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,600
He's stayed with you for so long.

476
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,720
He is getting on a lot.

477
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,760
If there is any disadvantage

478
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,080
he has now,

479
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,960
it's the responsibility

480
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,230
for love and choice.

481
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,390
You've been together for a long time.

482
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,310
Do you think

483
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,600
you have no sense of security?

484
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,510
How about this?

485
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,350
It will make you feel wronged.

486
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,840
I'll test him for you.

487
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,880
It's a loss.

488
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,430
Yang Ruowei

489
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,880
You should tell me early.

490
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:40,640
In this way,

491
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,080
I can ask my Dad

492
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,310
for 50 million yuan.

493
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,800
Then I pretend to break up with you.

494
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,110
And I catch you two months later.

495
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,190
Now we have lost 100 million yuan.

496
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,470
What are you thinking about?

497
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,040
Dad.

498
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,430
Can I have my

499
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,720
house and car back?

500
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,600
The word once spoken

501
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,080
can never be recalled.

502
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm your son after all.

503
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,920
Then you can't make me

504
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,110
sleep on the street.

505
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,350
I can sleep on the street.

506
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:09,920
What about Ruowei?

507
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,600
Don't use Ruowei as a bargaining chip.

508
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,190
If our Wen family

509
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,470
is lucky

510
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,680
and you can finally marry Ruowei,

511
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,190
I'll buy you a big house.

512
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,840
No.

513
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,960
I'll earn money on my own

514
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,880
to buy a house for my love.

515
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,920
Then you won't be unconvinced

516
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,080
and take it back.

517
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:28,920
OK.

518
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,430
OK, OK.

519
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,720
Nice.

520
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,000
Be careful.

521
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,880
Don't spoil the flowers for Mom.

522
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,760
OK.

523
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,190
Well.

524
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,000
You can see your Mom later.

525
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Are you happy?

526
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,720
Duh! Of course.

527
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,720
He Weifei

528
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,390
It's getting more and more presumptuous.

529
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,000
Let your Mom give you a lecture

530
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
when we meet later.

531
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,720
Mom won't give me a lecture.

532
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,390
Boy! You've also learned to talk back.

533
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,760
Did you prepare

534
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,600
the test paper

535
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,550
and the certificate of awards in programming contest?

536
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,080
They are in my bag.

537
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,350
That's good.

538
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,960
Remember to give them to your Mommy

539
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,720
when you see her later.

540
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,840
And the most important one

541
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,150
is to tell your Mommy

542
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,230
that you can get them because I usually urge you

543
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,080
to study every day.

544
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,960
Ice cream.

545
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,760
OK, no problem.

546
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,350
As long as you say it

547
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,470
I will buy you ice cream.

548
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,040
Yiyue

549
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,150
Do you arrive earlier?

550
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,350
Qiaoyan, I'm sorry.

551
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,270
There's something wrong.

552
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,080
And I will go back to Germany.

553
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,350
What's up with that?

554
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,230
Is it serious?

555
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,150
No, it's about the project.

556
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:54,760
When will you be back next time?

557
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,920
Maybe over one month.

558
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,880
Maybe...

559
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,800
It doesn't matter.

560
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,960
Xiaobao and I are waiting for you.

561
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,920
By the way, Xiaobao is here.

562
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,110
Would you like to have a chat with him?

563
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,680
No, no.

564
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm in a hurry.

565
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,350
You, you kiss Xiaobao for me.

566
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,080
Bye.

567
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Are you hungry?

568
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,150
I'm going to cook for you.

569
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,600
I'm not hungry.

570
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,720
It seems that

571
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
nobody wants to eat pork ribs.

572
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,110
Mommy.

573
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,920
Xiaobao

574
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,880
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

575
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,800
Do you miss me?

576
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,640
Yes.

577
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,920
I miss you, too.

578
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,230
He Weifei

579
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,190
Wash your hands first.

580
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,470
Go ahead.

581
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,150
Keep control of yourself.

582
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,080
Do you miss me?

583
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,760
It's good that you are back.

584
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,230
I miss you so much.

585
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:51,960
Me too.

586
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,840
He Qiaoyan

587
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,470
Now, I'm leaving my daughter to you.

588
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,350
From now on

589
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
you must treat her well.

590
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,390
Don't worry.

591
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,080
I will treat her well.

592
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,390
Can Xiaobao remember so many words?

593
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,960
He can remember all he has seen and he is calm.

594
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,550
He learns that from me.

595
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,350
It's so long.

596
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,150
He stayed in my study

597
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,800
writing and drawing for a long time last night.

598
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,230
I didn't expect him to prepare so much.

599
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,760
Dear guests and friends

600
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,800
ladies and gentlemen

601
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,470
good afternoon.

602
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
In the moment of golden autumn,

603
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,470
we are pleased

604
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,110
to send best wishes.

605
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,800
Babe, get to the point.

606
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,960
OK, Mom.

607
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,640
What's the point?

608
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,680
It seems that

609
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,350
the ability of reading comprehension of our son

610
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,430
is not good.

611
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,080
Xiaobao

612
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,510
Start with "Do you want".

613
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,800
Groom, do you want...

614
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,640
Yes, I do.

615
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,640
Bride, do you want...

616
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,350
Yes, I do.

617
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,110
Then please exchange the wedding rings.

618
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,550
Do you really want it?

619
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,230
Now the groom may kiss your bride.

620
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,640
What's wrong?

621
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,350
Scratch my back.

622
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,880
Hurry up.

623
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,960
Is it the right time now?

624
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,470
You can't make a bride

625
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,000
scratch her back with everybody present.

626
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

627
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,190
Here?

628
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,800
Left, left, left.

629
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,230
Left.

630
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,920
Left.

631
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,040
Higher, higher.

632
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,190
Thank you, bro.

633
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,470
Bro?

634
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,390
Please throw the bouquet.

635
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,469
Hurry up.

636
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,510
Come on, throw it to me.

637
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,150
Give me that.

638
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:19,639
Hurry up.

639
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,719
Hurry up, hurry up.

640
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,230
Throw it to me.

641
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,679
Bro.

642
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,270
It's useless for you since you're single.

643
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,800
It's the blessing of marriage.

644
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,840
There's not the slightest sign of anything happening yet.

645
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,310
Here is a sister

646
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,550
who is old enough to get married.

647
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,469
Please give me the bouquet.

648
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,679
Who do you say is older?

649
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

650
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,920
Hi.

651
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,040
Hi.

652
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,000
Come on, Ning Fang.

653
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
And Mom.
