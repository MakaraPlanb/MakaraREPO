Unforgettable Love
EP08

2
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,190
Chairman Wen

3
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,560
This is the payment request from the accounting department

4
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
and the briefing from the marketing department.

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,230
There are a few missing points in the meeting

6
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,080
which I've added

7
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,920
with post-it notes.

8
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,360
If there's no problem

9
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
I will ask them to make it up.

10
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,789
There are three nights of dinner this week

11
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,880
and I've done the contact work.

12
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:33,000
And this

13
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,310
is a gift box of baby's first full month from Dr. Qin.

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,440
This is not in a hurry

15
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,560
now I want to see Dr. Qin's grandson.

16
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,400
You tell me

17
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,920
having such a disappointing son

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,230
when

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,270
can I have a grandson?

20
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,039
Chairman Wen, do you want to have a grandson

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,110
or to see vice manager Wen get married?

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,040
The boy's heart hasn't settled yet

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,790
how can he be a father?

24
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,150
I noticed that he got on well

25
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,710
with Mr. He's son.

26
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,920
Think about it

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,310
even Mr. He's son

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
he adore him so much

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
when he get his own children

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,480
he must take the responsibilities.

31
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,310
I should go back to work.

32
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,150
Dr. Qin, you...

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,000
What can I do for you, Boss He?

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,000
Dr. Qin, are you going to

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,310
blow up my bathroom?

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,400
The tooth cup is used to hold the toothbrush

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,040
not for putting

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,400
your cell phone and comb.

39
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,310
And

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,360
the towel should be placed on

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,270
the sweater stand

42
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,360
don't put it on the water tap.

43
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,150
In the dirty clothes basket

44
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
your clothes and mine

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
should be placed separately

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
and my outwear and underwear

47
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
should be placed separately, too.

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,790
The clothes in the dirty basket

49
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,440
when putting in the washing machine

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,710
they will be washed together, won't they?

51
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,920
I don't dislike you.

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,440
It's not the matter you dislike me or not

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,230
different clothes

54
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,920
should be washed in different ways.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,270
What else

56
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,440
if you don't take toothpaste with you

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,360
you can tell me

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,670
then I'll prepare a new one for you.

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,150
Are you an iron cock?

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,560
Just use a little toothpaste.

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,480
You can use my toothpaste

62
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,230
but please use it in my way

63
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,750
squeezing from the tail.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,150
No matter how to squeeze this toothpaste

65
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,750
isn't it the same?

66
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,630
I have my rules.

67
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,110
Go to the cupboard

68
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,400
to get some multivitamins.

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,880
That's kind of human of you

70
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,630
to consider the hardness of your employees.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,480
It's obvious that your nutrition imbalance

72
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,520
has caused hair loss.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
In the bathroom

74
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,710
your hair is all over the place.

75
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Since your life

76
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,960
is so arbitrary

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,790
and out of order

78
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,080
for Xiaobao's safety

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,790
before you two go out in the future

80
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,710
you have to submit to me

81
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,790
the itinerary of the day.

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,670
Only after my approval

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,790
can it be executed.

84
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,360
What's more

85
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,230
please clean up the bathroom.

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
I've been prepared for this.

87
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,630
Xiaobao

88
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
mommy is making breakfast.

89
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,520
No, no

90
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,630
I absolutely didn't

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,270
mean to poison your father.

92
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,670
And your father is absolutely not

93
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,110
force me to eat this.

94
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,710
Would you like to have a taste?

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Is it delicious?

96
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Mrs. Liu

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,920
is the toilet blocked?

98
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,670
Mrs. Liu?

99
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,960
Where's Mrs. Liu?

100
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,080
Have you smelled

101
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,880
something bad?

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,880
Xiaobao farts.

103
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,520
It stinks.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,560
Really stinky.

105
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,670
That may due to poor digestion.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,670
It seems that I need to

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,670
update his recipe.

108
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,360
Are you sure you haven't seen Mrs. Liu?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
I'm scared to death.

110
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,440
Go on eating.

111
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,790
Is it delicious?

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,230
Don't worry

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,790
just follow me

114
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,520
and there will be more delicious food in the future.

115
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,790
Enjoy delicious food, don't be afraid of him.

116
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,110
Go on.

117
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,400
Boss He, please, have a look.

118
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,880
The amusement park is too dangerous

119
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,960
the zoo is not safe

120
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,560
and it's not healthy to have a picnic

121
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,400
so I pick the last one

122
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,360
museum.

123
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,040
Xiaobao, I'm sorry

124
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
your dad said that

125
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,040
we can only go to the museum today.

126
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,960
But don't worry

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
I have other ways.

128
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,440
Oh my god.

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,630
I'm starting to hallucinate.

130
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,790
Mr. Wen

131
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,310
the meeting room is ready to use.

132
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Am I hallucinating?

133
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,110
This is the meeting report

134
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,630
about sales planning of new products

135
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,480
please have a look.

136
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,310
This is the customer opinion questionnaire

137
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,270
for the product department tomorrow

138
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
please have a look.

139
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,080
Why are you all back?

140
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,480
I don't know.

141
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Secretary Yang called us and said that

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,640
the chairman withdrew

143
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,920
our personnel transfer order

144
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,310
and let us all come back.

145
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,230
Yang Ruowei?

146
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,470
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,799
Look!

148
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,350
Is mountain climbing fun?

149
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Are you tired?

150
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,230
Don't worry about your dad

151
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,920
he just told me

152
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
to take you to the museum

153
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
but he didn't say what kind of museum.

154
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
We are now in

155
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,270
the nature museum

156
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,920
it's for free and no need to queue.

157
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,510
Give me five!

158
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,760
Let's go

159
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,150
I'll show you over there.

160
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,390
Come on.

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,390
Get ready to report

162
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,080
the briefing on

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
Xiaobao's activities in the museum today.

164
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,680
Did Dr. Qin take Xiaobao

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
to the museum?

166
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:18,960
Yeah.

167
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,110
But today is Monday

168
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,600
all museums are closed.

169
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,920
To express my

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,390
sincere thanks and true respect

171
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,510
I'll take you back.

172
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,960
No, thanks.

173
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm sure that

174
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,080
you'll miss it soon

175
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
the beauty of being single.

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,230
Absolutely impossible.

177
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,880
But I'm curious about

178
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,510
how you made it.

179
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,960
Chairman Wen wants to have a grandson.

180
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,600
Do you think I'll give in?

181
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,550
I don't know

182
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,040
whether you will give in.

183
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,080
The only thing I know is that

184
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,720
he has issued a marriage order.

185
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,350
She who can capture your heart first

186
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
will be the Wen's daughter-in-law.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,150
And he promised that

188
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,190
he will tie you up

189
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,390
and send you to the marriage registration office.

190
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Yang Ruowei

191
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,350
do you know

192
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,600
What you've done?

193
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,680
I gave them

194
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,150
the hope of marrying into the Wen's family

195
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,270
How about tonight?

196
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,880
You may be busy, bye.

197
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,430
Did you realize your fault?

198
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,840
Yes, I see.

199
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,000
You not only break the rules

200
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,840
but also deceive parents.

201
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,230
Qin Yiyue, as an adult...

202
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,600
Sir.

203
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,550
The adult wants to blow her nose

204
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,510
is that OK?

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,880
This is what you gave Xiaobao this morning

206
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
isn't it?

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
As a punishment

208
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,270
there would be no more

209
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,720
uncensored food

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,510
to be taken home

211
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,880
do you understand?

212
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,640
Though Xiaobao can't eat this

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,470
can I eat this?

214
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,800
What do you think?

215
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,600
Sure I can.

216
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,880
Of course not.

217
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,150
Handing in unacceptable food voluntarily

218
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,800
can be given a lighter punishment.

219
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,960
Hurry up.

220
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,000
Goodbye, source of joy.

221
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
Go back to your room and review yourself.

222
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,470
Xiaobao.

223
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:29,920
Xiaobao.

224
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,720
Those are two different things.

225
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,080
I did something wrong

226
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,800
but snacks are innocent, aren't they?

227
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,150
You are innocent, too.

228
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,760
I have to teach him a lesson.

229
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,230
Xiaobao!

230
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,840
Oh, no, I'm in big trouble!

231
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,600
I told you to teach him a lesson

232
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,430
and you really

233
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,880
do this?

234
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,550
Come here.

235
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,310
Morning.

236
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,430
Morning.

237
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,230
One step later again.

238
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,510
Hurry up.

239
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
You win, you go first.

240
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,839
Thank you.

241
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,760
Help! I forgot to wash this again.

242
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,550
Here is mommy's alma mater

243
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,040
Qincheng Medical University.

244
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,840
I haven't been back for a long time.

245
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,110
Today

246
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,510
there is a parent-child activity here.

247
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,190
Thanks to Xiaobao

248
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,680
mommy has the opportunity to come back to have a look.

249
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,840
Later, there will be

250
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,430
a lot of children and parents.

251
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,600
You just need to relax

252
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,430
and have fun

253
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,720
with everyone.

254
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,550
If you want to go home, just tell mommy

255
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,600
don't force yourself

256
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,510
mommy will always be there

257
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,920
with you, ok?

258
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,040
My Xiaobao is so brave.

259
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,390
Let's go.

260
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,510
Go ahead, go to play with other kids.

261
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,390
You're really

262
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,840
like your father.

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
Tougher than anyone else when angry

264
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,270
and go back on your word soon.

265
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,230
Alright

266
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,430
shall we go home?

267
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,680
Fine

268
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,390
mommy will play football with you.

269
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,640
You go there.

270
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,550
Please catch my ball.

271
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,230
Get it back.

272
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,000
Kick it to me.

273
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Kick hard.

274
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,680
Yiyue.

275
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,680
Ning Fang, why are you here?

276
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,270
I have just met Professor Lin

277
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,270
to discuss some matters.

278
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,510
I find here so kicking

279
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,920
and come here for a walk.

280
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,350
Well, brother won't touch you.

281
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,350
Let's keep this distance

282
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,080
is it cool?

283
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:17,840
Is Xiaobao's defect

284
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,150
congenital or acquired?

285
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,880
No family history

286
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,920
as far as I know

287
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,230
it should be acquired after he was born

288
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,430
called traumatic stress sequelae.

289
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,920
But thanks to

290
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,430
timely professional intervention

291
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,000
there is no personality bias yet.

292
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,510
Having such a professional

293
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,510
and patient doctor like you

294
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,310
by his side

295
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,470
it's his good luck.

296
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,470
Although Xiaobao still resist

297
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,880
being contacted with strangers

298
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,080
but when in the face of

299
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,920
children of the same age

300
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,510
he will be relaxed.

301
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,680
On the other hand

302
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,720
I have to choose for him

303
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,000
a suitable school.

304
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,840
I have a recommendation.

305
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,150
It's called Sunshine Primary School.

306
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,150
It's a specialized school

307
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,600
for children in special need.

308
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
The purpose I come to college today

309
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,190
is to invite Professor Lin

310
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,720
to be the specially engaged teacher of this school.

311
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm going over there.

312
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,600
How about taking Xiaobao with me?

313
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,510
Good.

314
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,390
But I can't take Xiaobao with me

315
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,680
to anywhere strange

316
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,190
or I'll be scolded when go back home.

317
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,000
It doesn't matter. I'm here with you.

318
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,000
What's more,

319
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,720
this is also for Xiaobao's school life.

320
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,760
It's only a dozen minutes away.

321
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,080
Ok.

322
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,110
Children usually have class

323
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,760
just in this building.

324
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,640
After class they can play the piano

325
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,390
play ball games or something.

326
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,600
I think Xiaobao

327
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,000
will like here.

328
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,720
Please follow me.

329
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,760
Come on, the children behind please keep up with the line.

330
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,680
Hello, Mr. Ning.

331
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,110
Good morning.

332
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,510
Brother Ning Fang.

333
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,840
Thank you.

334
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,600
Enjoy your class.

335
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,760
That's great.

336
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,720
Actually, I have a problem.

337
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,550
Why must you

338
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,550
work by yourself?

339
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,510
Psychological problems

340
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,150
need the attention of the society.

341
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,080
But now

342
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,640
Some parents don't pay much attention to

343
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,040
psychotherapy for children

344
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,920
or even not mean it

345
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,270
to see a psychologist.

346
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,550
My studio now

347
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,550
is not about making money.

348
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,840
It is patient-oriented.

349
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,110
That's great.

350
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,470
This is also my ideal.

351
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,600
I particularly acknowledge

352
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,040
the educational philosophy of this school.

353
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,800
Entering a higher school is not supposed to be

354
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,600
the only indicator of children's childhood

355
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,190
not to mention

356
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,000
these children in special need.

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,880
Fate has given them

358
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,110
obstacles in life,

359
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,430
they shouldn't be allowed to

360
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,510
bear more.

361
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,110
I really hope that

362
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,920
in the environment like this

363
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,230
a free one

364
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,510
he can grow up happily.

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
This primary school

366
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,760
is the most suitable for Xiaobao

367
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
after my investigation.

368
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,270
All teachers here hold

369
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,550
the qualification certificate of

370
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,230
child psychological counselor.

371
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,040
It is specifically for

372
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,600
children in special need like Xiaobao.

373
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,310
Xiaobao, show it to dad.

374
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,040
Dr. Qin

375
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,430
I think I need to remind you that

376
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,110
your identity is Mrs. He.

377
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,880
For married lady and single men

378
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,760
it's best to keep a proper distance.

379
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,640
I can tell from the photos that

380
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,920
the straight distance between you two

381
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,760
is less than 0.8 meters.

382
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,550
0.8 meters?

383
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,960
Are your eyeballs

384
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,310
installed with a scale?

385
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,880
According to your standard,

386
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,600
I cannot even

387
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,640
take buses and subways.

388
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,680
You are arguing for the sake of arguing.

389
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,310
For Xiaobao,

390
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,600
attending school is very important

391
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,190
I need to comprehensively

392
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,390
gather all the information

393
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,190
and make a comparative consideration.

394
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,600
Trust me

395
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,230
the recommendation from Dr. Ning Fang

396
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,190
is trustworthy.

397
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,550
I don't think so.

398
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,960
For a school

399
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,430
when choosing teachers and experts

400
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,640
if there is no high standard

401
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,920
and strict threshold

402
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,720
chances are that

403
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,350
its background funds are average

404
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,270
or

405
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,760
its professional standard is not high enough.

406
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,040
In short,

407
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,920
I can't trust this school.

408
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,080
Dr. Ning Fang has a high degree

409
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,150
and rich experience.

410
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,960
Major organizations at home and abroad

411
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,350
both are eager for him.

412
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,230
His purpose in Sunshine Primary School

413
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,430
is totally

414
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:15,430
for non-profit public welfare.

415
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,190
So capable and caring a person

416
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:18,150
how rare he is!

417
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,040
And Dr. Ning Fang

418
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,550
is my good friend for many years.

419
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,840
If Xiaobao goes to this school

420
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,150
he can also take care of Xiaobao

421
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,800
in another word

422
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,640
you will get another personal doctor.

423
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
You even don't know

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,880
how happy Xiaobao is with him this afternoon.

425
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,720
Wait a minute.

426
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,550
When did I allow

427
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,310
you take Xiaobao to

428
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,800
somewhere I don't permit?

429
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,150
Even let him contact intimately

430
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:37,190
with a stranger.

431
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,000
If something unexpected happens

432
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
will you bear the consequences?

433
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,000
Xiaobao

434
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,680
go back to your room

435
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,920
mommy and dad have something to say

436
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
OK?

437
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,000
Go ahead.

438
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
Do you want to protect him like a nanny

439
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,880
until he become 27?

440
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,080
Put him into

441
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,550
the normal life

442
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,800
isn't that your wish?

443
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,470
You're forcing his talent.

444
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,470
Xiaobao now

445
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,800
hasn't fully recovered

446
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,800
and you want to throw him in

447
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,040
the collective life.

448
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,150
If simple and crude way

449
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,430
is your treatment

450
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,270
then anyone can be a doctor.

451
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,470
Are you the doctor

452
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,510
or am I?

453
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,720
You are the doctor

454
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,640
but I'm his father.

455
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,110
OK,I see.

456
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,760
You still question my ability.

457
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,270
Since you don't trust me

458
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,270
no matter how much work I do

459
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,040
it's in vain.

460
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,960
The premise of cooperation is mutual trust.

461
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,270
Let's cancel the contract.

462
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,880
I've never questioned

463
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,960
our cooperation.

464
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,720
I just don't agree with

465
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,760
your choice.

466
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,640
My job is to help Xiaobao

467
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,760
make choices, arrangements, and plans.

468
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,550
If you don't agree with

469
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,470
my choices

470
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,080
I can't go on with this job.

471
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,110
If you have to think this way

472
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,080
I can do nothing.

473
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
Calm down and go out for a walk

474
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,510
When your mood calms down

475
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,640
come back for dinner.

476
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,000
Go ahead.

477
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,960
Dr. Ning Fang.

478
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,470
Mrs. Liu, please call Dr. Qin back

479
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,390
to have dinner.

480
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,110
I did.

481
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,840
Mrs. Qin seems to be still angry

482
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
and she said she won't have dinner.

483
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Still angry.

484
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
What are you mad at?

485
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,550
Have your meal.

486
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,510
Coax her.

487
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
I tell you

488
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,000
if you don't reply my message

489
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,040
I'll leave.

490
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,880
One, two.

491
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,080
We'll discuss the matter at the meeting. Come and have dinner now.

492
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,000
All right, it's done.

493
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,800
Please eat.

494
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,550
Discuss the matter at the meeting?

495
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,880
Have your own meeting!

496
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,470
Where are you going?

497
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,920
I need to calm down.

498
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,640
The suitcase means...

499
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,190
Doesn't Boss He suggest me

500
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,040
to go for more walks

501
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,640
and calm down?

502
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,510
I'm doing weight-bearing aerobic exercises.

503
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,110
Dr. Qin's walk equipment

504
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,510
seems to be a little heavy.

505
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,190
I need to put down my work

506
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,080
and leave home.

507
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,270
That's what you said.

508
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,270
Sorry for the disturbance these days.

509
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,080
See you.

510
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,880
It suddenly occurred to me

511
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,800
do you want to think about it...

512
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,800
Now you know to retain me

513
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,390
but it's too late.

514
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,110
This year you own

515
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,680
seven days of paid annual leave.

516
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,350
Do you want to ask for leave?

517
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,110
I am so angry!

518
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,310
What are you doing here?

519
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,510
Even cola is against me.

520
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,150
Wait.

521
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,760
How did he bully you?

522
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:30,720
Let me see.

523
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,550
You know what?

524
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,390
I tried my best and found

525
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,880
the most suitable school for Xiaobao

526
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,640
which Ning Fang is there.

527
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,310
As a result, He Qiaoyan just disagreed

528
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,110
and said it's not good this way, or that way.

529
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,840
If he dislikes any decision I made

530
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,510
why didn't he just

531
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,680
cancel the contract with me?

532
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,840
Forget it. I don't want to worry about it.

533
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,110
I gave up. Whatever.

534
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,310
In my opinion

535
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,040
you should hang in.

536
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,040
If this is in the hospital

537
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,720
are you going to give up your patient

538
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,960
just because disagreement with Director Huang

539
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,110
in the views of treatment?

540
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,230
I will definitely not give up Xiaobao.

541
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,230
That's it.

542
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,550
Xiaobao, why don't you sleep?

543
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,600
Mommy.

544
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,350
Mommy is here.

545
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,960
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

546
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,390
Our Xiaobao is an adult-like child

547
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,600
who are going to primary school.

548
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,510
You can sleep by yourself

549
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,350
can't you?

550
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,800
My heart

551
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,470
is almost melted.

552
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,150
Xiaobao

553
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,640
Mommy goes to the bedroom

554
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,430
to sleep with you, ok?

555
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,720
Assistant Yang

556
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Could you please

557
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,920
have lunch with me?

558
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,680
If you want to have lunch with me

559
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,470
please get the number first.

560
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,960
Excuse me,  sir

561
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,190
we are fully booked

562
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,760
you don't have to queue any more.

563
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,390
Excuse me

564
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,270
when else can I make a reservation?

565
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,550
Sorry

566
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,960
we don't receive

567
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,680
proud pet dog.

568
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,430
You...

569
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm coming.

570
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,000
Coming.

571
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,880
Mommy.

572
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
Xiaobao?

573
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,550
What are you doing here?

574
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,760
Are you come here alone?

575
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,080
Does dad know?

576
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,880
I really don't want to talk with him, so irritating.

577
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,150
I have your son

578
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,150
come and get him now.

579
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,880
No waiting for overdue.

580
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,000
That tone

581
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,760
sounds like kidnapping.

582
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,230
I'm here to pick up Xiaobao.

583
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,880
Let me make it clear in advance

584
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,150
Xiaobao came to me by himself.

585
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,310
So you want to quit

586
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,760
not to take annual leave?

587
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,190
Unbelievable, dude

588
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,000
your reflection arc

589
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,960
is long enough to go around the earth three times.

590
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,000
Awesome.

591
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,880
The contract is very clear

592
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,920
either party proposes to terminate the contract before expiration

593
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,230
should not just pay the previous debt

594
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,510
but also have to pay liquidated damages.

595
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,550
Stop, stop, stop.

596
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,640
Don't tell me anything

597
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,310
about liquidated damages.

598
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,760
It really troubled me.

599
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,720
How about this?

600
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,110
You just fire me; let me go

601
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,230
and let yourself go, ok?

602
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,080
Impossible.

603
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,960
Why impossible?

604
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,310
Xiaobao needs you.

605
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,150
You're temporarily

606
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,310
irreplaceable.

607
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,600
I won't fire you.

608
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
I can get you another doctor.

609
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,510
I don't want to do this anyway.

610
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,110
and I don't want to see you again.

611
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,840
Think about it.

612
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,310
How could you!

613
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,800
I even haven't finish my word.

614
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,080
Xiaobao

615
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,720
dad is coming to take you home.

616
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,880
Xiaobao

617
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,270
Xiaobao

618
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,390
dad is coming to take you home

619
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,960
please come home with dad, ok?

620
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,680
Be a good boy!

621
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,720
Don't let dad repeat it.

622
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,080
Xiaobao!

623
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,920
Why are you so serious?

624
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,600
If Xiaobao doesn't want to go back

625
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,270
isn't it nice to be here with me?

626
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,080
Xiaobao, dad is gone.

627
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,270
Let's watch TV.

628
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Hello, Dr. Ning.

629
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,510
Hello.

630
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,720
Hello, Dr. Ning.

631
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,430
Small as here is

632
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,960
but our function is complete.

633
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,680
Partners working here

634
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,000
are of like mind.

635
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,680
The salary is not high

636
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,430
but everyone works with love and enthusiasm.

637
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,960
What a cozy place.

638
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,680
I like it.

639
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,600
Aren't you going to suspend?

640
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,510
Why don't you come here and have a try?

641
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
If you come

642
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,470
the department of child psychology

643
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,800
will be in your full charge.

644
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,270
I'm afraid He Qiaoyan won't let me go.

645
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,880
Then I'll play hardball.

646
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,150
Relax, that's kidding.

647
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,190
I respect your choice.

648
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,469
But I personally think that

649
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,000
leaving him is good for

650
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
your career development.

651
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,080
Not only can you help

652
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,310
more kids in need

653
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,920
but Xiaobao can also continue his treatment.

654
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:22,960
I even keep an office

655
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
empty for you.

656
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,800
Please join us.

657
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,679
Alright.

658
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm sorry. I have to answer the phone call.

659
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,429
Hello, Dr. Huang.

660
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,270
Here comes Dr. Qin.

661
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,840
Sister Qin.

662
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,429
Xiao An

663
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,510
What are you doing here?

664
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,000
Dr. Huang said Dr. Zhu wasn't here

665
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,719
there are shorthanded.

666
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,469
I happen to be free

667
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:51,350
so I came here.

668
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,840
By the way

669
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,389
Dr. Zhu's appointment today

670
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,350
is Shenghuai.

671
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,310
I have no problem with Shenghuai

672
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,840
he is an old friend of mine

673
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
and two days ago

674
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,720
we happened to meet each other, what's wrong?

675
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,350
You'd better be careful.

676
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,000
I heard his mother

677
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,310
is in bad mood recently.

678
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,960
Ok, I see.

679
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,000
Let's go to work.

680
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,270
Our Shenghuai is a good painter.

681
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Baby

682
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,960
when dad comes with you at the weekend

683
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,110
you can show these pictures

684
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,110
to dad.

685
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,350
Forget it.

686
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,350
My dad must not be interested.

687
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,270
Good boy

688
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,840
mommy loves Shenghuai

689
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,640
and Shenghuai stay with mommy, that's enough.

690
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,960
Dr. Qin, thank you.

691
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
We should go.

692
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,190
Shenghuai.

693
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,840
Goodbye, Dr. Qin.

694
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,510
Bye.

695
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,350
Mr. He, this way please.

696
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,510
That's the situation.

697
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,960
She said she would resign

698
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,080
and now she ran away from home

699
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,760
even Xiaobao is in her favor.

700
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
We have trouble every day.

701
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,840
During the night you quarreled

702
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,230
did you say anything else?

703
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,960
I said

704
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,470
if you have to think that way

705
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,510
I can't help it.

706
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,640
I suggest you go out for a walk

707
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,150
to calm down.

708
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,430
to calm down.

709
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,230
Stop.

710
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,390
Say it again.

711
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,840
Go out for a walk and calm down.

712
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,230
Not this, the last sentence.

713
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,720
Last sentence?

714
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,880
If you have to think that way

715
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,840
I can't help it..

716
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,640
Come on!

717
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,960
The danger of this sentence

718
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,760
is only second to drink more hot water

719
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,880
spend less money.

720
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,150
What kind of danger?

721
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,510
It's rational consumption to spend less money

722
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,390
Drink plenty of hot water

723
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,680
is for promoting metabolism.

724
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
Any problems?

725
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,470
Your mouth is as hard as a diamond.

726
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,550
Although you two are not real couple

727
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,190
you shall adapt to each other

728
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,960
in the couple's way

729
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,350
right?

730
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,840
Relationship is not a debate game

731
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,960
there's no need to distinguish right from wrong.

732
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,190
Continue.

733
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,760
Seeing each other will enhance the relationship.

734
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,310
Coaxing is all you need to retrieve her.

735
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,190
What you need to do now

736
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,000
is to find a step

737
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,720
to make her come back.

738
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,080
Today's case consultation

739
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,270
is finished.

740
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,150
Finally, congratulations to Dr. Qin

741
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,270
Happy wedding.

742
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,960
Thank you.

743
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,430
By the way, Dr. Qin

744
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,840
did Yang Shenghuai

745
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,600
get better recently?

746
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,840
I just met him this afternoon.

747
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Shenghuai's situation

748
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
is optimistic.

749
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,000
But compared with Shenghuai

750
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,640
I think his mother's situation

751
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
is more serious.

752
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,880
She's under great pressure

753
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,550
there is a tendency for serious anxiety.

754
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,310
But she herself

755
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
doesn't seem to realize

756
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,310
this issue.

757
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,080
So I suggest to

758
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,960
prepare a medical record for her first

759
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,760
then arrange for her

760
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,150
a consultation in psychological consultation department.

761
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,430
Dr. Qin

762
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,920
you are the doctor

763
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,390
in psychological department

764
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,840
as for diagnosis of adult cases

765
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,550
I'm afraid you don't have enough experience.

766
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,680
Anxiety disorder of Shenghuai's mother

767
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,600
is very bad.

768
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
In my several contacts

769
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,110
with her

770
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,000
it's obvious to see

771
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,190
the impact on her child.

772
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,350
So I think that

773
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,510
we should intervene in time.

774
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,000
Whether she have anxiety disorder or not

775
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,920
requires strict

776
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,040
and professional testing.

777
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,510
As Yang Shenghuai's

778
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,510
acting doctor

779
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:29,390
all you need to do is

780
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,350
to be responsible for Shenghuai.

781
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,840
There's no need to step in

782
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,640
diagnosis and treatment of patient's family members.

783
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,800
For children who suffer from

784
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
severe mental disorders

785
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,600
parents are critical entry points

786
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,800
in the process of treatment.

787
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,310
Dr. Huang

788
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,430
I still insist on.

789
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,640
When Dr. Zhu come back

790
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,920
I will communicate with him

791
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,230
then arrange a psychotherapy for her mother

792
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,110
as soon as possible.

793
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:56,920
Ok.

794
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
I will contact his mother

795
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,390
to have a chat.

796
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,960
Good. That's all.

797
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,470
I don't need any counseling.

798
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

799
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,110
Shenghuai's mother

800
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,230
please take it easy.

801
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I heard about you and your son

802
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,640
from Dr. Qin.

803
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,840
She felt that

804
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,350
you may be under too much pressure

805
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,310
so that feel anxious.

806
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,230
This is also for Shenghuai's sake.

807
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,390
Dr. Qin?

808
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,040
Yeah.

809
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,040
Dr. Qin has already told your conditions

810
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,470
to me in detail.

811
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,270
If you believe in her

812
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,680
you can also trust me.

813
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,270
I just came out from home after dinner.

814
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,190
Ok, wait a minute, I'll be right there.

815
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,840
Shenghuai's mother

816
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,960
Dr. Qin

817
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,080
do you think I'm sick

818
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,880
so when we in the consultation room

819
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,310
you try to sound me out directly and indirectly?

820
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,000
That isn't true.

821
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,800
I just want to know more about

822
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,040
the situation of you and Shenghuai.

823
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,720
You're still lying.

824
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,640
You wrote that, didn't you?

825
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,350
I got it!

826
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,000
You must be sent

827
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,800
by my husband

828
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,920
to get my diagnosis

829
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,110
then force me to give up Shenghuai

830
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:21,960
aren't you?

831
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,640
No!

832
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,080
You're the same as them who

833
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,350
don't believe that

834
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,600
I can take good care of Shenghuai

835
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,840
do you?

836
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,110
Don't get excited, Shenghuai's mother.

837
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,150
As for the details

838
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,800
you can ask Dr. Zhu when he comes back.

839
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,350
I'm just covering for him.

840
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,040
I don't want to listen to you!

841
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,640
Shenghuai's mother

842
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,080
I know Shenghuai's father's leave

843
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,680
brought you pain.

844
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,390
But if you

845
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,270
refuse help and treatment

846
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,510
your panic and anxiety disorders

847
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,800
are going to get worse.

848
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,550
You say I have panic and anxiety disorders?

849
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,920
Yes.

850
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,230
No!

851
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,800
It is Shenghuai who is sick, not me!

852
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
It is Shenghuai who is sick

853
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,760
not me!

854
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,920
You must get it wrong.

855
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,550
Be careful!
