Unforgettable Love
EP08

2
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,190
Chairman Wen

3
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
This is the payment request from the accounting department

4
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,480
and the briefing from the marketing department.

5
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,230
There are a few missing points in the meeting

6
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,080
which I've added

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,920
with post-it notes.

8
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,360
If there's no problem

9
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,560
I will ask them to make it up.

10
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,789
There are three nights of dinner this week

11
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,880
and I've done the contact work.

12
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,000
And this

13
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,310
is a gift box of baby's first full month from Dr. Qin.

14
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
This is not in a hurry

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,560
now I want to see Dr. Qin's grandson.

16
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,400
You tell me

17
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,920
having such a disappointing son

18
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,230
when

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,270
can I have a grandson?

20
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,039
Chairman Wen, do you want to have a grandson

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,110
or to see vice manager Wen get married?

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,040
The boy's heart hasn't settled yet

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,790
how can he be a father?

24
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,150
I noticed that he got on well

25
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,710
with Mr. He's son.

26
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,920
Think about it

27
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,310
even Mr. He's son

28
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,360
he adore him so much

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,960
when he get his own children

30
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,480
he must take the responsibilities.

31
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,310
I should go back to work.

32
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,150
Dr. Qin, you...

33
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,000
What can I do for you, Boss He?

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,000
Dr. Qin, are you going to

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,310
blow up my bathroom?

36
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,400
The tooth cup is used to hold the toothbrush

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,040
not for putting

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
your cell phone and comb.

39
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,310
And

40
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,360
the towel should be placed on

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,270
the sweater stand

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,360
don't put it on the water tap.

43
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,150
In the dirty clothes basket

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
your clothes and mine

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,440
should be placed separately

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,920
and my outwear and underwear

47
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
should be placed separately, too.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,790
The clothes in the dirty basket

49
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,440
when putting in the washing machine

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,710
they will be washed together, won't they?

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,920
I don't dislike you.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
It's not the matter you dislike me or not

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,230
different clothes

54
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,920
should be washed in different ways.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,270
What else

56
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,440
if you don't take toothpaste with you

57
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,360
you can tell me

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,670
then I'll prepare a new one for you.

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,150
Are you an iron cock?

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,560
Just use a little toothpaste.

61
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,480
You can use my toothpaste

62
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,230
but please use it in my way

63
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,750
squeezing from the tail.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,150
No matter how to squeeze this toothpaste

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,750
isn't it the same?

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,630
I have my rules.

67
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,110
Go to the cupboard

68
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,400
to get some multivitamins.

69
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
That's kind of human of you

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,630
to consider the hardness of your employees.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,480
It's obvious that your nutrition imbalance

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
has caused hair loss.

73
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,360
In the bathroom

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,710
your hair is all over the place.

75
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,920
Since your life

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,960
is so arbitrary

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,790
and out of order

78
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,080
for Xiaobao's safety

79
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,790
before you two go out in the future

80
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,710
you have to submit to me

81
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,790
the itinerary of the day.

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,670
Only after my approval

83
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,790
can it be executed.

84
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,360
What's more

85
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,230
please clean up the bathroom.

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I've been prepared for this.

87
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,630
Xiaobao

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
mommy is making breakfast.

89
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,520
No, no

90
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,630
I absolutely didn't

91
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,270
mean to poison your father.

92
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,670
And your father is absolutely not

93
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,110
force me to eat this.

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,710
Would you like to have a taste?

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,840
Is it delicious?

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Mrs. Liu

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
is the toilet blocked?

98
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,670
Mrs. Liu?

99
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,960
Where's Mrs. Liu?

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,080
Have you smelled

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,880
something bad?

102
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
Xiaobao farts.

103
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,520
It stinks.

104
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,560
Really stinky.

105
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,670
That may due to poor digestion.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,670
It seems that I need to

107
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,670
update his recipe.

108
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,360
Are you sure you haven't seen Mrs. Liu?

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm scared to death.

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,440
Go on eating.

111
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,790
Is it delicious?

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,230
Don't worry

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,790
just follow me

114
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,520
and there will be more delicious food in the future.

115
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,790
Enjoy delicious food, don't be afraid of him.

116
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,110
Go on.

117
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,400
Boss He, please, have a look.

118
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,880
The amusement park is too dangerous

119
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,960
the zoo is not safe

120
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,560
and it's not healthy to have a picnic

121
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,400
so I pick the last one

122
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,360
museum.

123
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:38,040
Xiaobao, I'm sorry

124
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
your dad said that

125
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,040
we can only go to the museum today.

126
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,960
But don't worry

127
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,000
I have other ways.

128
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,440
Oh my god.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,630
I'm starting to hallucinate.

130
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,790
Mr. Wen

131
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,310
the meeting room is ready to use.

132
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
Am I hallucinating?

133
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,110
This is the meeting report

134
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,630
about sales planning of new products

135
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,480
please have a look.

136
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,310
This is the customer opinion questionnaire

137
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,270
for the product department tomorrow

138
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,110
please have a look.

139
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,080
Why are you all back?

140
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,480
I don't know.

141
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Secretary Yang called us and said that

142
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,640
the chairman withdrew

143
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,920
our personnel transfer order

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,310
and let us all come back.

145
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,230
Yang Ruowei?

146
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,470
I'm leaving.

147
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,799
Look!

148
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,350
Is mountain climbing fun?

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Are you tired?

150
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,230
Don't worry about your dad

151
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,920
he just told me

152
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
to take you to the museum

153
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,760
but he didn't say what kind of museum.

154
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
We are now in

155
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,270
the nature museum

156
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,920
it's for free and no need to queue.

157
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,510
Give me five!

158
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,760
Let's go

159
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,150
I'll show you over there.

160
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,390
Come on.

161
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,390
Get ready to report

162
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,080
the briefing on

163
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,840
Xiaobao's activities in the museum today.

164
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,680
Did Dr. Qin take Xiaobao

165
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,800
to the museum?

166
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,960
Yeah.

167
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,110
But today is Monday

168
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,600
all museums are closed.

169
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,920
To express my

170
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,390
sincere thanks and true respect

171
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,510
I'll take you back.

172
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,960
No, thanks.

173
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm sure that

174
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
you'll miss it soon

175
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
the beauty of being single.

176
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,230
Absolutely impossible.

177
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,880
But I'm curious about

178
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,510
how you made it.

179
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,960
Chairman Wen wants to have a grandson.

180
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,600
Do you think I'll give in?

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,550
I don't know

182
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,040
whether you will give in.

183
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,080
The only thing I know is that

184
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
he has issued a marriage order.

185
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,350
She who can capture your heart first

186
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
will be the Wen's daughter-in-law.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,150
And he promised that

188
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,190
he will tie you up

189
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,390
and send you to the marriage registration office.

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
Yang Ruowei

191
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,350
do you know

192
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,600
What you've done?

193
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,680
I gave them

194
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,150
the hope of marrying into the Wen's family

195
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,270
How about tonight?

196
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,880
You may be busy, bye.

197
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,430
Did you realize your fault?

198
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Yes, I see.

199
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,000
You not only break the rules

200
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,840
but also deceive parents.

201
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,230
Qin Yiyue, as an adult...

202
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,600
Sir.

203
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,550
The adult wants to blow her nose

204
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,510
is that OK?

205
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,880
This is what you gave Xiaobao this morning

206
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,720
isn't it?

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
As a punishment

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,270
there would be no more

209
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,720
uncensored food

210
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,510
to be taken home

211
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,880
do you understand?

212
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,640
Though Xiaobao can't eat this

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,470
can I eat this?

214
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,800
What do you think?

215
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,600
Sure I can.

216
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Of course not.

217
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,150
Handing in unacceptable food voluntarily

218
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,800
can be given a lighter punishment.

219
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:23,960
Hurry up.

220
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,000
Goodbye, source of joy.

221
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,800
Go back to your room and review yourself.

222
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,470
Xiaobao.

223
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,920
Xiaobao.

224
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,720
Those are two different things.

225
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,080
I did something wrong

226
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,800
but snacks are innocent, aren't they?

227
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,150
You are innocent, too.

228
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,760
I have to teach him a lesson.

229
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,230
Xiaobao!

230
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,840
Oh, no, I'm in big trouble!

231
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,600
I told you to teach him a lesson

232
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,430
and you really

233
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,880
do this?

234
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,550
Come here.

235
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,310
Morning.

236
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,430
Morning.

237
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,230
One step later again.

238
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,510
Hurry up.

239
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
You win, you go first.

240
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,839
Thank you.

241
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,760
Help! I forgot to wash this again.

242
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,550
Here is mommy's alma mater

243
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,040
Qincheng Medical University.

244
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:37,840
I haven't been back for a long time.

245
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,110
Today

246
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,510
there is a parent-child activity here.

247
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,190
Thanks to Xiaobao

248
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,680
mommy has the opportunity to come back to have a look.

249
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,840
Later, there will be

250
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,430
a lot of children and parents.

251
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,600
You just need to relax

252
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,430
and have fun

253
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,720
with everyone.

254
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,550
If you want to go home, just tell mommy

255
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,600
don't force yourself

256
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,510
mommy will always be there

257
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,920
with you, ok?

258
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,040
My Xiaobao is so brave.

259
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,390
Let's go.

260
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,510
Go ahead, go to play with other kids.

261
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,390
You're really

262
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,840
like your father.

263
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,680
Tougher than anyone else when angry

264
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,270
and go back on your word soon.

265
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,230
Alright

266
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,430
shall we go home?

267
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,680
Fine

268
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,390
mommy will play football with you.

269
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,640
You go there.

270
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,550
Please catch my ball.

271
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,230
Get it back.

272
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,000
Kick it to me.

273
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
Kick hard.

274
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,680
Yiyue.

275
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,680
Ning Fang, why are you here?

276
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,270
I have just met Professor Lin

277
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,270
to discuss some matters.

278
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,510
I find here so kicking

279
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,920
and come here for a walk.

280
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,350
Well, brother won't touch you.

281
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,350
Let's keep this distance

282
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,080
is it cool?

283
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,840
Is Xiaobao's defect

284
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,150
congenital or acquired?

285
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,880
No family history

286
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,920
as far as I know

287
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,230
it should be acquired after he was born

288
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,430
called traumatic stress sequelae.

289
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,920
But thanks to

290
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,430
timely professional intervention

291
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:40,000
there is no personality bias yet.

292
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,510
Having such a professional

293
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,510
and patient doctor like you

294
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,310
by his side

295
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,470
it's his good luck.

296
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,470
Although Xiaobao still resist

297
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,880
being contacted with strangers

298
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,080
but when in the face of

299
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,920
children of the same age

300
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,510
he will be relaxed.

301
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,680
On the other hand

302
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,720
I have to choose for him

303
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
a suitable school.

304
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,840
I have a recommendation.

305
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,150
It's called Sunshine Primary School.

306
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,150
It's a specialized school

307
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,600
for children in special need.

308
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
The purpose I come to college today

309
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,190
is to invite Professor Lin

310
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,720
to be the specially engaged teacher of this school.

311
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,840
I'm going over there.

312
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,600
How about taking Xiaobao with me?

313
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,510
Good.

314
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,390
But I can't take Xiaobao with me

315
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,680
to anywhere strange

316
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,190
or I'll be scolded when go back home.

317
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,000
It doesn't matter. I'm here with you.

318
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,000
What's more,

319
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,720
this is also for Xiaobao's school life.

320
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,760
It's only a dozen minutes away.

321
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,080
Ok.

322
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,110
Children usually have class

323
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,760
just in this building.

324
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,640
After class they can play the piano

325
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,390
play ball games or something.

326
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,600
I think Xiaobao

327
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,000
will like here.

328
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,720
Please follow me.

329
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,760
Come on, the children behind please keep up with the line.

330
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,680
Hello, Mr. Ning.

331
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,110
Good morning.

332
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,510
Brother Ning Fang.

333
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,840
Thank you.

334
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,600
Enjoy your class.

335
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,760
That's great.

336
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,720
Actually, I have a problem.

337
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,550
Why must you

338
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,550
work by yourself?

339
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,510
Psychological problems

340
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,150
need the attention of the society.

341
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,080
But now

342
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,640
Some parents don't pay much attention to

343
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,040
psychotherapy for children

344
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,920
or even not mean it

345
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,270
to see a psychologist.

346
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,550
My studio now

347
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,550
is not about making money.

348
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,840
It is patient-oriented.

349
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,110
That's great.

350
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,470
This is also my ideal.

351
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
I particularly acknowledge

352
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,040
the educational philosophy of this school.

353
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,800
Entering a higher school is not supposed to be

354
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
the only indicator of children's childhood

355
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,190
not to mention

356
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,000
these children in special need.

357
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,880
Fate has given them

358
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,110
obstacles in life,

359
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,430
they shouldn't be allowed to

360
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,510
bear more.

361
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,110
I really hope that

362
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,920
in the environment like this

363
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,230
a free one

364
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,510
he can grow up happily.

365
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,880
This primary school

366
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,760
is the most suitable for Xiaobao

367
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,880
after my investigation.

368
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,270
All teachers here hold

369
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,550
the qualification certificate of

370
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,230
child psychological counselor.

371
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,040
It is specifically for

372
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
children in special need like Xiaobao.

373
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,310
Xiaobao, show it to dad.

374
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,040
Dr. Qin

375
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,430
I think I need to remind you that

376
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,110
your identity is Mrs. He.

377
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,880
For married lady and single men

378
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,760
it's best to keep a proper distance.

379
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,640
I can tell from the photos that

380
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,920
the straight distance between you two

381
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,760
is less than 0.8 meters.

382
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,550
0.8 meters?

383
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,960
Are your eyeballs

384
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,310
installed with a scale?

385
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,880
According to your standard,

386
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
I cannot even

387
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,640
take buses and subways.

388
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,680
You are arguing for the sake of arguing.

389
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,310
For Xiaobao,

390
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,600
attending school is very important

391
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,190
I need to comprehensively

392
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,390
gather all the information

393
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,190
and make a comparative consideration.

394
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,600
Trust me

395
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,230
the recommendation from Dr. Ning Fang

396
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,190
is trustworthy.

397
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,550
I don't think so.

398
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,960
For a school

399
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,430
when choosing teachers and experts

400
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,640
if there is no high standard

401
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,920
and strict threshold

402
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,720
chances are that

403
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,350
its background funds are average

404
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,270
or

405
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,760
its professional standard is not high enough.

406
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,040
In short,

407
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,920
I can't trust this school.

408
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,080
Dr. Ning Fang has a high degree

409
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,150
and rich experience.

410
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,960
Major organizations at home and abroad

411
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,350
both are eager for him.

412
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,230
His purpose in Sunshine Primary School

413
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,430
is totally

414
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,430
for non-profit public welfare.

415
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,190
So capable and caring a person

416
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,150
how rare he is!

417
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,040
And Dr. Ning Fang

418
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,550
is my good friend for many years.

419
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,840
If Xiaobao goes to this school

420
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,150
he can also take care of Xiaobao

421
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,800
in another word

422
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,640
you will get another personal doctor.

423
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,000
You even don't know

424
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,880
how happy Xiaobao is with him this afternoon.

425
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,720
Wait a minute.

426
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,550
When did I allow

427
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,310
you take Xiaobao to

428
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,800
somewhere I don't permit?

429
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,150
Even let him contact intimately

430
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,190
with a stranger.

431
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,000
If something unexpected happens

432
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
will you bear the consequences?

433
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,000
Xiaobao

434
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,680
go back to your room

435
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
mommy and dad have something to say

436
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,760
OK?

437
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,000
Go ahead.

438
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,640
Do you want to protect him like a nanny

439
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,880
until he become 27?

440
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,080
Put him into

441
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,550
the normal life

442
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,800
isn't that your wish?

443
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,470
You're forcing his talent.

444
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,470
Xiaobao now

445
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,800
hasn't fully recovered

446
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,800
and you want to throw him in

447
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
the collective life.

448
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,150
If simple and crude way

449
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,430
is your treatment

450
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,270
then anyone can be a doctor.

451
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,470
Are you the doctor

452
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,510
or am I?

453
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,720
You are the doctor

454
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,640
but I'm his father.

455
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,110
OK,I see.

456
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,760
You still question my ability.

457
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,270
Since you don't trust me

458
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,270
no matter how much work I do

459
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,040
it's in vain.

460
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,960
The premise of cooperation is mutual trust.

461
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,270
Let's cancel the contract.

462
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,880
I've never questioned

463
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
our cooperation.

464
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,720
I just don't agree with

465
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,760
your choice.

466
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,640
My job is to help Xiaobao

467
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,760
make choices, arrangements, and plans.

468
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,550
If you don't agree with

469
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,470
my choices

470
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,080
I can't go on with this job.

471
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,110
If you have to think this way

472
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,080
I can do nothing.

473
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,600
Calm down and go out for a walk

474
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,510
When your mood calms down

475
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,640
come back for dinner.

476
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,000
Go ahead.

477
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,960
Dr. Ning Fang.

478
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,470
Mrs. Liu, please call Dr. Qin back

479
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,390
to have dinner.

480
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,110
I did.

481
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,840
Mrs. Qin seems to be still angry

482
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
and she said she won't have dinner.

483
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
Still angry.

484
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
What are you mad at?

485
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,550
Have your meal.

486
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,510
Coax her.

487
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
I tell you

488
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,000
if you don't reply my message

489
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,040
I'll leave.

490
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,880
One, two.

491
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,080
We'll discuss the matter at the meeting. Come and have dinner now.

492
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,000
All right, it's done.

493
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,800
Please eat.

494
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,550
Discuss the matter at the meeting?

495
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,880
Have your own meeting!

496
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,470
Where are you going?

497
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,920
I need to calm down.

498
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,640
The suitcase means...

499
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,190
Doesn't Boss He suggest me

500
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,040
to go for more walks

501
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,640
and calm down?

502
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,510
I'm doing weight-bearing aerobic exercises.

503
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,110
Dr. Qin's walk equipment

504
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,510
seems to be a little heavy.

505
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,190
I need to put down my work

506
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,080
and leave home.

507
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,270
That's what you said.

508
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,270
Sorry for the disturbance these days.

509
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,080
See you.

510
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,880
It suddenly occurred to me

511
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,800
do you want to think about it...

512
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,800
Now you know to retain me

513
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,390
but it's too late.

514
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,110
This year you own

515
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,680
seven days of paid annual leave.

516
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,350
Do you want to ask for leave?

517
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,110
I am so angry!

518
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,310
What are you doing here?

519
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,510
Even cola is against me.

520
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,150
Wait.

521
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,760
How did he bully you?

522
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,720
Let me see.

523
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,550
You know what?

524
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,390
I tried my best and found

525
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,880
the most suitable school for Xiaobao

526
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,640
which Ning Fang is there.

527
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,310
As a result, He Qiaoyan just disagreed

528
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,110
and said it's not good this way, or that way.

529
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,840
If he dislikes any decision I made

530
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,510
why didn't he just

531
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,680
cancel the contract with me?

532
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,840
Forget it. I don't want to worry about it.

533
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,110
I gave up. Whatever.

534
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,310
In my opinion

535
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,040
you should hang in.

536
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,040
If this is in the hospital

537
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,720
are you going to give up your patient

538
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,960
just because disagreement with Director Huang

539
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,110
in the views of treatment?

540
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,230
I will definitely not give up Xiaobao.

541
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,230
That's it.

542
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,550
Xiaobao, why don't you sleep?

543
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,600
Mommy.

544
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,350
Mommy is here.

545
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,960
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.

546
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,390
Our Xiaobao is an adult-like child

547
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:36,600
who are going to primary school.

548
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,510
You can sleep by yourself

549
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,350
can't you?

550
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,800
My heart

551
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,470
is almost melted.

552
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,150
Xiaobao

553
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,640
Mommy goes to the bedroom

554
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,430
to sleep with you, ok?

555
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,720
Assistant Yang

556
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,800
Could you please

557
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,920
have lunch with me?

558
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,680
If you want to have lunch with me

559
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,470
please get the number first.

560
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,960
Excuse me,  sir

561
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,190
we are fully booked

562
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,760
you don't have to queue any more.

563
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,390
Excuse me

564
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,270
when else can I make a reservation?

565
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,550
Sorry

566
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,960
we don't receive

567
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,680
proud pet dog.

568
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,430
You...

569
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
I'm coming.

570
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,000
Coming.

571
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
Mommy.

572
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,880
Xiaobao?

573
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,550
What are you doing here?

574
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,760
Are you come here alone?

575
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Does dad know?

576
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,880
I really don't want to talk with him, so irritating.

577
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,150
I have your son

578
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,150
come and get him now.

579
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,880
No waiting for overdue.

580
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,000
That tone

581
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,760
sounds like kidnapping.

582
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,230
I'm here to pick up Xiaobao.

583
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,880
Let me make it clear in advance

584
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,150
Xiaobao came to me by himself.

585
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,310
So you want to quit

586
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,760
not to take annual leave?

587
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,190
Unbelievable, dude

588
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,000
your reflection arc

589
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,960
is long enough to go around the earth three times.

590
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,000
Awesome.

591
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,880
The contract is very clear

592
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,920
either party proposes to terminate the contract before expiration

593
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,230
should not just pay the previous debt

594
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,510
but also have to pay liquidated damages.

595
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,550
Stop, stop, stop.

596
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,640
Don't tell me anything

597
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,310
about liquidated damages.

598
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,760
It really troubled me.

599
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,720
How about this?

600
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:20,110
You just fire me; let me go

601
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,230
and let yourself go, ok?

602
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,080
Impossible.

603
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,960
Why impossible?

604
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,310
Xiaobao needs you.

605
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,150
You're temporarily

606
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,310
irreplaceable.

607
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,600
I won't fire you.

608
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
I can get you another doctor.

609
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,510
I don't want to do this anyway.

610
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,110
and I don't want to see you again.

611
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,840
Think about it.

612
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,310
How could you!

613
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,800
I even haven't finish my word.

614
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,080
Xiaobao

615
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,720
dad is coming to take you home.

616
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,880
Xiaobao

617
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,270
Xiaobao

618
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,390
dad is coming to take you home

619
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,960
please come home with dad, ok?

620
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,680
Be a good boy!

621
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,720
Don't let dad repeat it.

622
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,080
Xiaobao!

623
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,920
Why are you so serious?

624
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,600
If Xiaobao doesn't want to go back

625
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,270
isn't it nice to be here with me?

626
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,080
Xiaobao, dad is gone.

627
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,270
Let's watch TV.

628
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,840
Hello, Dr. Ning.

629
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,510
Hello.

630
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,720
Hello, Dr. Ning.

631
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,430
Small as here is

632
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:49,960
but our function is complete.

633
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,680
Partners working here

634
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,000
are of like mind.

635
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,680
The salary is not high

636
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,430
but everyone works with love and enthusiasm.

637
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,960
What a cozy place.

638
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,680
I like it.

639
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
Aren't you going to suspend?

640
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,510
Why don't you come here and have a try?

641
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,720
If you come

642
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,470
the department of child psychology

643
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,800
will be in your full charge.

644
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,270
I'm afraid He Qiaoyan won't let me go.

645
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,880
Then I'll play hardball.

646
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,150
Relax, that's kidding.

647
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,190
I respect your choice.

648
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,469
But I personally think that

649
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,000
leaving him is good for

650
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
your career development.

651
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,080
Not only can you help

652
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,310
more kids in need

653
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,920
but Xiaobao can also continue his treatment.

654
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,960
I even keep an office

655
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,080
empty for you.

656
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,800
Please join us.

657
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,679
Alright.

658
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:41,080
I'm sorry. I have to answer the phone call.

659
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,429
Hello, Dr. Huang.

660
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,270
Here comes Dr. Qin.

661
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,840
Sister Qin.

662
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,429
Xiao An

663
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,510
What are you doing here?

664
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,000
Dr. Huang said Dr. Zhu wasn't here

665
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,719
there are shorthanded.

666
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,469
I happen to be free

667
00:34:58,469 --> 00:34:59,350
so I came here.

668
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,840
By the way

669
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,389
Dr. Zhu's appointment today

670
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,350
is Shenghuai.

671
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,310
I have no problem with Shenghuai

672
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,840
he is an old friend of mine

673
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,680
and two days ago

674
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,720
we happened to meet each other, what's wrong?

675
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,350
You'd better be careful.

676
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,000
I heard his mother

677
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,310
is in bad mood recently.

678
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,960
Ok, I see.

679
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,000
Let's go to work.

680
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,270
Our Shenghuai is a good painter.

681
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Baby

682
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,960
when dad comes with you at the weekend

683
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,110
you can show these pictures

684
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,110
to dad.

685
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,350
Forget it.

686
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,350
My dad must not be interested.

687
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,270
Good boy

688
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,840
mommy loves Shenghuai

689
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,640
and Shenghuai stay with mommy, that's enough.

690
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,960
Dr. Qin, thank you.

691
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,920
We should go.

692
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,190
Shenghuai.

693
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,840
Goodbye, Dr. Qin.

694
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,510
Bye.

695
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,350
Mr. He, this way please.

696
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,510
That's the situation.

697
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,960
She said she would resign

698
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,080
and now she ran away from home

699
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,760
even Xiaobao is in her favor.

700
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,760
We have trouble every day.

701
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,840
During the night you quarreled

702
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,230
did you say anything else?

703
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:27,960
I said

704
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,470
if you have to think that way

705
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,510
I can't help it.

706
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,640
I suggest you go out for a walk

707
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,150
to calm down.

708
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,430
to calm down.

709
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,230
Stop.

710
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,390
Say it again.

711
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
Go out for a walk and calm down.

712
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,230
Not this, the last sentence.

713
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,720
Last sentence?

714
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,880
If you have to think that way

715
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,840
I can't help it..

716
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,640
Come on!

717
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,960
The danger of this sentence

718
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,760
is only second to drink more hot water

719
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,880
spend less money.

720
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,150
What kind of danger?

721
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,510
It's rational consumption to spend less money

722
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,390
Drink plenty of hot water

723
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,680
is for promoting metabolism.

724
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Any problems?

725
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,470
Your mouth is as hard as a diamond.

726
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,550
Although you two are not real couple

727
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,190
you shall adapt to each other

728
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,960
in the couple's way

729
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,350
right?

730
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,840
Relationship is not a debate game

731
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,960
there's no need to distinguish right from wrong.

732
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,190
Continue.

733
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,760
Seeing each other will enhance the relationship.

734
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,310
Coaxing is all you need to retrieve her.

735
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,190
What you need to do now

736
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,000
is to find a step

737
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,720
to make her come back.

738
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,080
Today's case consultation

739
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,270
is finished.

740
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,150
Finally, congratulations to Dr. Qin

741
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,270
Happy wedding.

742
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,960
Thank you.

743
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,430
By the way, Dr. Qin

744
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,840
did Yang Shenghuai

745
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,600
get better recently?

746
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,840
I just met him this afternoon.

747
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Shenghuai's situation

748
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,040
is optimistic.

749
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,000
But compared with Shenghuai

750
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,640
I think his mother's situation

751
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
is more serious.

752
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,880
She's under great pressure

753
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,550
there is a tendency for serious anxiety.

754
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,310
But she herself

755
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
doesn't seem to realize

756
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,310
this issue.

757
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,080
So I suggest to

758
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,960
prepare a medical record for her first

759
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,760
then arrange for her

760
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,150
a consultation in psychological consultation department.

761
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,430
Dr. Qin

762
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,920
you are the doctor

763
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,390
in psychological department

764
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,840
as for diagnosis of adult cases

765
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,550
I'm afraid you don't have enough experience.

766
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,680
Anxiety disorder of Shenghuai's mother

767
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,600
is very bad.

768
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,760
In my several contacts

769
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,110
with her

770
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,000
it's obvious to see

771
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,190
the impact on her child.

772
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,350
So I think that

773
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,510
we should intervene in time.

774
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,000
Whether she have anxiety disorder or not

775
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,920
requires strict

776
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,040
and professional testing.

777
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,510
As Yang Shenghuai's

778
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,510
acting doctor

779
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,390
all you need to do is

780
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,350
to be responsible for Shenghuai.

781
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,840
There's no need to step in

782
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,640
diagnosis and treatment of patient's family members.

783
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,800
For children who suffer from

784
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,960
severe mental disorders

785
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,600
parents are critical entry points

786
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,800
in the process of treatment.

787
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,310
Dr. Huang

788
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,430
I still insist on.

789
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,640
When Dr. Zhu come back

790
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,920
I will communicate with him

791
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,230
then arrange a psychotherapy for her mother

792
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,110
as soon as possible.

793
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:04,920
Ok.

794
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I will contact his mother

795
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,390
to have a chat.

796
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,960
Good. That's all.

797
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,470
I don't need any counseling.

798
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,600
There's nothing wrong with me.

799
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,110
Shenghuai's mother

800
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,230
please take it easy.

801
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
I heard about you and your son

802
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,640
from Dr. Qin.

803
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,840
She felt that

804
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,350
you may be under too much pressure

805
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:34,310
so that feel anxious.

806
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,230
This is also for Shenghuai's sake.

807
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,390
Dr. Qin?

808
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,040
Yeah.

809
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,040
Dr. Qin has already told your conditions

810
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,470
to me in detail.

811
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,270
If you believe in her

812
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,680
you can also trust me.

813
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,270
I just came out from home after dinner.

814
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,190
Ok, wait a minute, I'll be right there.

815
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,840
Shenghuai's mother

816
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,960
Dr. Qin

817
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,080
do you think I'm sick

818
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
so when we in the consultation room

819
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,310
you try to sound me out directly and indirectly?

820
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,000
That isn't true.

821
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,800
I just want to know more about

822
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,040
the situation of you and Shenghuai.

823
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,720
You're still lying.

824
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,640
You wrote that, didn't you?

825
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,350
I got it!

826
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
You must be sent

827
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,800
by my husband

828
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,920
to get my diagnosis

829
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,110
then force me to give up Shenghuai

830
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,960
aren't you?

831
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,640
No!

832
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,080
You're the same as them who

833
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,350
don't believe that

834
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,600
I can take good care of Shenghuai

835
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,840
do you?

836
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,110
Don't get excited, Shenghuai's mother.

837
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,150
As for the details

838
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,800
you can ask Dr. Zhu when he comes back.

839
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,350
I'm just covering for him.

840
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,040
I don't want to listen to you!

841
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,640
Shenghuai's mother

842
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,080
I know Shenghuai's father's leave

843
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,680
brought you pain.

844
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,390
But if you

845
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,270
refuse help and treatment

846
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,510
your panic and anxiety disorders

847
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,800
are going to get worse.

848
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,550
You say I have panic and anxiety disorders?

849
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:58,920
Yes.

850
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,230
No!

851
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,800
It is Shenghuai who is sick, not me!

852
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,840
It is Shenghuai who is sick

853
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,760
not me!

854
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,920
You must get it wrong.

855
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,550
Be careful!
