Unforgettable Love
EP05

2
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,840
Tonight,

3
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,880
I'll sleep on the couch.

4
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,630
You two will sleep in my bedroom.

5
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,310
Let's break up the meeting.

6
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:20,789
Wait.

7
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,960
Dear, don't break up the meeting.

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,750
I just saw

9
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,360
a storage room over there.

10
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,440
You clean it up.

11
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,480
I'll just live there with your dad.

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,750
Lao Qin,

13
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,400
Let's

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,880
stay more days

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,840
with our daughter.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,039
No problem.

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:33,840
I

18
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,310
Stop. It's settled.

19
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,110
Yes.

20
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,520
You.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,480
Stop talking about it.

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,110
You help clean up the room, right?

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,310
Yeah.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,150
Oh, my god!

25
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,479
I'll clean up the room.

26
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,710
Go ahead.

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,919
Arrhythmia.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,750
Shortness of breath.

29
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:27,960
Hello, brother.

30
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,480
A man

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,710
sent a woman home.

32
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,230
What does that mean?

33
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,150
Love couples.

34
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,000
According to the information I have,

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,840
Dr. Qin is single.

36
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,400
And

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,670
there has never been anything

38
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,110
about this man before.

39
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,360
Then you need to

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
cheer up.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,190
I tell you that

42
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,000
this person

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,750
is likely to be

44
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,960
a roadblock

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,840
in your cooperation.

46
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,960
The name of this kind of people

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,079
is called rivals in love.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,590
Hello, sir.

49
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you have an appointment?

50
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,960
It's you, Mr. He.

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
Do you come here today

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,790
especially to see Yiyue's cat?

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,400
Yiyue.

54
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
When does my fiancée

55
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,790
have a cat?

56
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,750
Well, I'll bring it out

57
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,840
for you to see.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,230
Mr. He, sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm coming.

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,110
Touch it.

61
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,110
Mr. He, you're here, too.

62
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,880
I am just passing by.

63
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,630
Hi.

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,310
Did you sleep well?

65
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,270
Did it sleep well?

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,560
It rested well

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,040
after my check yesterday.

68
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,670
It's fine now.

69
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Do you have a cold?

70
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,190
You should get some rest.

71
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,840
Brother,

72
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,590
in order to welcome you,

73
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,150
I'll treat you to a slap-up meal in the evening.

74
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,400
I know that

75
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
there is the No.1 popular hot pot restaurant near here.

76
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,560
OK.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,270
Are you with us?

78
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,190
-Well.  -He won't go.

79
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,190
How can Mr. He get into

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,670
such a dirty and noisy

81
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,110
public hot pot restaurant?

82
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,080
Mr. He, right?

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,270
It is Yiyue who understands me better.

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Hot pot

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,590
is both high in calories and fat.

86
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,000
It is full of grease

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
and food that

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,400
have not been professionally handled.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,710
In addition,

90
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,519
meat, the raw and the cold are in the same pot.

91
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,269
I, He Qiaoyan,

92
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,709
have never eaten this type of diet.

93
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,560
You see.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,750
I just said he never eats this type of food.

95
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,440
Let's go and put the cat back.

96
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,790
Hi.

97
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,000
Navigate to

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,360
the No.1 popular hot pot restaurant.

99
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,270
This one is delicious.

100
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,190
Then take more.

101
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,560
I'm surprised you remember what I love to eat.

102
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
Of course.

103
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,310
Hello, sir.

104
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,790
Are you alone?

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,710
Yes, only me.

106
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,880
Would you like to order a medium pot?

107
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,110
Yes.

108
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,440
Would you like to order a double combo?

109
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,520
Yes.

110
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Waiter, a rubber band, please.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,920
No need.

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,230
I have one.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,710
Thank you.

114
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,590
There is also a free birthday celebration.

115
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,880
If necessary...

116
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,590
Anything is ok.

117
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,230
Please hurry up.

118
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,670
Roll up your sleeves.

119
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,670
I forgot. Thank you for reminding me.

120
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,590
I saw that

121
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,400
the online articles that insult you

122
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,480
seem to have disappeared.

123
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,560
What's going on?

124
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,670
He Qiaoyan made it.

125
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,230
It seems that

126
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,750
he is not as unkind

127
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,790
as you described.

128
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,590
I admit

129
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,040
he really

130
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,670
isn't that annoying either.

131
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,790
After we learned that your birthday is today,

132
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,710
we have customized

133
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,750
a free birthday celebration especially for you.

134
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,590
I wish you

135
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,230
happy birthday,

136
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,560
everything going well,

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
good health,

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,270
getting rich soon,

139
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,590
and getting thinner.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,310
Is there anything else you need?

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,190
No, thanks.

142
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,040
This is not a birthday celebration at all.

143
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,790
This is embarrassing situation.

144
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,630
It's really embarrassing.

145
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,710
Distinguished guests.

146
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,560
Today is our third anniversary.

147
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,670
There are activities in our restaurant.

148
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,400
Music will be played soon.

149
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
After the music stops,

150
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,230
if a customer

151
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,480
can embrace a person of the opposite sex

152
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,710
as quickly as possible,

153
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,790
she/he can enjoy a 50% discount.

154
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,560
If they can kiss,

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
it's free for them.

156
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,670
Kiss?

157
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,270
Great.

158
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,000
It's another show of love.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,310
Don't look. Let's eat.

160
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,630
First level risk warning.

161
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,670
The precursor of the crash.

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Take a selfie.

163
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,110
This scene

164
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,150
is really beautiful.

165
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,360
Let's

166
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,190
give you applause.

167
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,080
Brave and handsome men.

168
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,360
Table Six and Table Fifteen

169
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,310
will be treated free of charge.

170
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,040
Why are you here?

171
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:28,960
I came to see if this restaurant

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
could be acquired.

173
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,040
So do you want to

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,400
sit down and eat some?

175
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,440
Great.

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
Eat more.

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,840
Here you are.

178
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,880
Thank you.

179
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,590
I'm tired.

180
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
Do you want to get married by capture?

181
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,310
You must be a shortage of people.

182
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,520
Get these people

183
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,230
out of here.

184
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
I'm very upset.

185
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,230
They are here,

186
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,390
so no beautiful girls will come over.

187
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,470
Do you think

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,190
my charm has gone down?

189
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,760
I'm not interested in you.

190
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,080
But I love you.

191
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,040
Don't always

192
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,080
push people around you away.

193
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,230
No wonder Lin Wei went abroad.

194
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,190
Why do you mention her?

195
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,230
Don't you want to know

196
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,840
why she left?

197
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,309
She must had some reason.

198
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,549
I don't care.

199
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,510
That's right.

200
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,350
There are so many people who like you.

201
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,640
It doesn't matter if one person doesn't like you, does it?

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,000
Then you should try your best to

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,350
get married

204
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,150
to Dr. Qin soon.

205
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,510
I see

206
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,190
the man named He

207
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,600
coming with his child.

208
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,470
I'm going to a meeting.

209
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,960
You play with the Rubik's Cube here

210
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
by yourself for a while.

211
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,960
All right.

212
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,550
Here you are.

213
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,040
Wait for me here.

214
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,270
Hello.

215
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,720
You're

216
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,310
so cute.

217
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,800
What's your name?

218
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,230
I can't talk.

219
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
What a pity.

220
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,080
Why can't such a lovely child

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,720
talk?

222
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,270
Is that your father just now?

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,190
Where is your mother?

224
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,000
This is your...

225
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,190
Is this your mother?

226
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,000
Uncle Qin, Aunt Qin.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please eat pomegranate.

228
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,640
You're welcome.

229
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,310
Finally you are back.

230
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,190
Mom, dad, have you eaten yet?

231
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,230
If you haven't eat...

232
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,680
Finally you are back.

233
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,080
They just kept asking me

234
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,600
about the He Qiaoyan.

235
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,720
Don't betray me.

236
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,960
I didn't say anything.

237
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,880
I really can't stand it.

238
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,760
I'll leave first.

239
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,000
Uncle Qin, Aunt Qin.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm going for a run.

241
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,680
Please take your time.

242
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,880
Okay.

243
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,960
I put my handbag down first.

244
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,430
Don't do anything else.

245
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,310
Come here.

246
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,880
Why are you

247
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,920
so serious?

248
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,640
Make me very nervous.

249
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,600
We've been to see

250
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,960
He Qiaoyan.

251
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,550
What?

252
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,310
Take it easy.

253
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,840
We just looked at him,

254
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
and did not do anything else.

255
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,960
Do you still want to cheat us?

256
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,080
His son has said

257
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,510
that you are his mother.

258
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,310
If you want to fall in love, we will not interfere.

259
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,190
We have no objection to your marriage.

260
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,880
But he has a child.

261
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,470
Do you know

262
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,230
the pressure and responsibility behind this?

263
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
And

264
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,190
do you know about his past,

265
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:00,840
his family

266
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,080
and his real situation?

267
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,470
According to you,

268
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,920
He Qiaoyan looks like a liar.

269
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Your mom is right.

270
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,800
Tomorrow,

271
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,040
We'll meet him.

272
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,470
Let's see what kind of person he really is.

273
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,150
We'll ask him what he's going to do with you.

274
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,720
You have to make it clear to us.

275
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,350
Right.

276
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,310
You get him to come

277
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,920
and give us

278
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,230
a clear picture of what's going on.

279
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,430
I have nothing to do with He Qiaoyan.

280
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,550
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

281
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,080
What's up?

282
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,960
How can I have a sudden heart ache?

283
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,600
Are you OK?

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,760
You made you mom so angry

285
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,080
that she had a heart attack.

286
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,800
This is my daughter.

287
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,960
You've grown up,

288
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,040
so you've started hiding everything from me

289
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,680
She doesn't tell me about her relationships.

290
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,510
She doesn't tell me about her breakup.

291
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,270
Now she even doesn't

292
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,110
tell me about her marriage.

293
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,920
She makes me so sad.

294
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,310
I'd rather die.

295
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,430
All right, mom.

296
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,230
Stop pretending.

297
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,390
I didn't pretend.

298
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,470
I'm so sad now.

299
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,270
I feel like I'm going to die.

300
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,150
Oh no.

301
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,680
I can't enjoy being a grandma.

302
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,110
Stop saying that.

303
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,960
Let's die together.

304
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,350
I'll see you in heaven.

305
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,600
Are you OK?

306
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,550
So sad.

307
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,470
Take it easy.

308
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,640
It's over.

309
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,310
Ruowei broke her foot.

310
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,310
I'll take a look.

311
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,600
Pomegranates and grapes are especially delicious.

312
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,470
Have some more.

313
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,150
I must

314
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,760
figure it out.

315
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,040
Come on.

316
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,230
My God.

317
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,550
Thank you for saving me.

318
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,350
He just tried to come to your home.

319
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,840
I managed to find a reason

320
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,080
to stop him.

321
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,550
Good job.

322
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,390
Never let him

323
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,840
run into my parents.

324
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,040
Now I'll

325
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,550
leave you two to talk.

326
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,430
Goodbye, Mr. He.

327
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,430
Don't you invite me in?

328
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Oh no.

329
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,640
Help me shade from the sun.

330
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,840
It's too sunny.

331
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,680
Can't you see the light?

332
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,230
It's too sunny.

333
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
You'll get a tan.

334
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,270
Qin Yiyue.

335
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,600
Are you afraid of something?

336
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,350
I'm not afraid.

337
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,550
Mr. He.

338
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,640
What can I do for you?

339
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,840
You're right.

340
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,150
What did I say?

341
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,310
You said we don't know each other very well.

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,230
You are right.

343
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,840
So I decide

344
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
to give you some time

345
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,080
to get you know me better.

346
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,510
That's all?

347
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,880
OK, I see.

348
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,150
Mr. He, please leave.

349
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,720
How long do you need?

350
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,720
In your past

351
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,230
twenty-nine years,

352
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,430
there must have been filled with stories

353
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,350
and bits of knowledge.

354
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,430
It's comparable to

355
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,390
a wonderful epic game.

356
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,760
To get through this game,

357
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,600
I need two years.

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
Two weeks at most.

359
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:07,800
Two weeks

360
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,640
is not enough for me to get through a mini-game.

361
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,270
I have all my information

362
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,230
organized for you

363
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,230
according to the timeline.

364
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,310
Remember to look carefully.

365
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,680
If there's anything unclear

366
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,550
or missed,

367
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
Let me know.

368
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,150
I will answer you truthfully.

369
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,080
OK, Mr. He.

370
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,600
I will definitely

371
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,270
learn from your glorious past.

372
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,110
Goodbye, Mr. He.

373
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,110
Does she hide

374
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,640
another man in the house?

375
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,270
It's over.

376
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,110
Do you tell him about your parents?

377
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,720
Of course not.

378
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,680
I think

379
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,230
you should just let your parents

380
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,600
meet He Qiaoyan.

381
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,230
Don't make your parents

382
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,270
really angry.

383
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
Absolutely not.

384
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,470
And from my experience,

385
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,270
He Qiaoyan

386
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,190
is definitely a trouble maker.

387
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,510
I want to get as far away from him as possible.

388
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,920
What else can you do?

389
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,110
Are you really not afraid

390
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,720
that they will go to He Qiaoyan on their own?

391
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,760
Or

392
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,960
He Qiaoyan once again rushes into our house.

393
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,600
Yes, I do.

394
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,110
So I have to

395
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,960
get them both back tomorrow

396
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:21,880
anyway.

397
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,270
I think this time

398
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,080
they are determined to meet him

399
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,550
before they leave.

400
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,230
Stop playing with your phone.

401
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,390
Let's sleep.

402
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,960
When does Mommy move in?

403
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,470
Xiaobao.

404
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,960
Our plans

405
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,680
may have to be postponed by two weeks.

406
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,550
When Dr. Qin comes,

407
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,840
remember to take this pillow away.

408
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,640
She's not Dr. Qin, she's Mommy.

409
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
OK, I see.

410
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,680
Turn off your cell phone and sleep.

411
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,310
Give it to me.

412
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,640
Just lie down.

413
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,680
Mommy, I miss you.

414
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,310
Are you sending a message to He Qiaoyan?

415
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,430
Why do you stop?

416
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,190
Ok, I send

417
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,310
it right now.

418
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,270
My parents said

419
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,080
they want to meet you.

420
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,040
My God, I have a stomachache.

421
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,150
I need to go to the bathroom.

422
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,390
Lao Qin,

423
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,510
Let's take a look at her phone.

424
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,840
You shouldn't do that.

425
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,000
Why not?

426
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,840
One,two,three.

427
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,350
The fish has taken the bait.

428
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,600
Get ready.

429
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,920
Dr. Qin.

430
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
Dr. Qin.

431
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,150
Hello, Mr. He.

432
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,510
I'm Qin Yiyue's mother,

433
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,880
Luo Mingmei.

434
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,270
Hello, Aunt Luo.

435
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,040
He replied.

436
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,350
If you have time,

437
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,310
can you meet with us?

438
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,760
Of course.

439
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,470
I will visit you personally

440
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,840
right away.

441
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,960
He said he would visit in person.

442
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,190
You want me to pretend to be He Qiaoyan

443
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,080
to talk with your mother?

444
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,840
Yes.

445
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,720
You should promise to meet my mom.

446
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,110
And you should say you are young.

447
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,350
You should visit them in person to their home.

448
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,350
In that case,

449
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,960
you would be reasonable

450
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
to send them back.

451
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,510
You're right.

452
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,310
You are so smart.

453
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,470
Mom.

454
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,470
What are you talking about with He Qiaoyan?

455
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,230
I say I am your mother.

456
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,110
I want to see him.

457
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,040
He Qiaoyan

458
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
is pretty straightforward.

459
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,920
He agreed.

460
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,150
He also said that he would visit in person to our home.

461
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
You rush to buy tickets for us.

462
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,840
There is a train at two o'clock.

463
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,760
We should be able to catch that train.

464
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,680
Come on.

465
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,510
Mom, stay a few more days.

466
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,390
No.

467
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:33,640
Stay a few more days.

468
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,080
No.

469
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,640
Mom.

470
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,080
My mother is leaving soon.

471
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,230
I'm so sad.

472
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,390
Great job.

473
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,550
I'll treat you to dinner as a reward.

474
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,390
Lao Qin.

475
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,550
Hello.

476
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,600
Hello.

477
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,920
After I drop off my stuff,

478
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,800
I'm going to get my hair styled.

479
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,040
My hair is so ugly.

480
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,640
OK.

481
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,720
I will also buy a dress.

482
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,920
The red dress you chose last time

483
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,720
is quite nice.

484
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,880
Then I'll buy that one.

485
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,640
Great.

486
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
The danger is over.

487
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,080
Just now my phone suddenly broke down.

488
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,640
I just got my phone fixed.

489
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,110
What do you mean

490
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,640
by "Great job"?

491
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,760
I haven't sent a message to your mother yet.

492
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,390
It's over.

493
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,110
It's over.

494
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,080
Is this

495
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,600
to go for wool and come home shorn?

496
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,800
It's over.

497
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
Dr. Qin.

498
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,640
Thank you for being willing to

499
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,510
let me come to your hometown.

500
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,230
Does this mean

501
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,230
that you are trying to accept me?

502
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,920
No.

503
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,110
This matter

504
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,350
can not be said clearly in one or two sentences.

505
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,150
Anyway.

506
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,430
This is a mistake.

507
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,310
A big mistake.

508
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,000
You go back first.

509
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,190
I will explain to you later, OK?

510
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:35,350
Go.

511
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,510
Lao Qin, I'm going to buy a dress.

512
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,350
You hurry to buy some fruits.

513
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,600
You buy some good ones.

514
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,470
Don't worry. I buy imported ones.

515
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,110
Yueyue?

516
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,800
Mom.

517
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,880
Visiting the parents

518
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,680
is a crucial step

519
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
in determining your marriage relationship.

520
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,430
Let the father-in-law and mother-in-law satisfied.

521
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,550
You will win.

522
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,080
Mom, dad.

523
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,430
I'm Yiyue's fiance,

524
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,190
He Qiaoyan.

525
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,760
What are you talking about?

526
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,190
Xiaohe, hello.

527
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,040
I am Yueyue's father, Qin Qiuyang.

528
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,270
Just call me Uncle Qin.

529
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,920
It's a little early

530
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,270
to call mom and dad.

531
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,510
All right, dad.

532
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,550
It's pretty good.

533
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,760
You

534
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,840
should show

535
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,430
that you are rich.

536
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,550
And you are able to

537
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,150
give her daughter a good life.

538
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
So many gifts.

539
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,430
Are you paying tribute to the emperor?

540
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,600
No one will slap (over) the smiler.

541
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,920
And no one will blame politeness.

542
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,040
There is

543
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,510
another crucial step

544
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,150
that can achieve two things at one stroke.

545
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,550
Don't say anything else.

546
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,920
Just boast them about being so young.

547
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,190
You look so young.

548
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,390
Is it?

549
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,840
I have learned that

550
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,680
although you are fifty years old this year,

551
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,230
it looks like

552
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,270
you are only forty-nine years old.

553
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,040
I said I'd better go for a facial first,

554
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,080
but you wouldn't let me go.

555
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,960
I don't know what do you like.

556
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,230
So I buy

557
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,080
a lot of kinds of things.

558
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,080
Please sit first.

559
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,600
Yes.

560
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,270
No need.

561
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,840
You have sent gifts.

562
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,720
You also visit.

563
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,470
Well, then, we'll go.

564
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,310
Why do you go?

565
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,550
You just sit there.

566
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,880
No interruptions.

567
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,760
Come in and sit down.

568
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,720
Lao Qin, come here.

569
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,510
Sit down.

570
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,680
Sit down.

571
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,680
Why are you sitting here?

572
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,430
You sit over there.

573
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,880
Xiaohe.

574
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,800
I always hear Yueyue talk about you.

575
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,430
She said you are exceptionally good.

576
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,760
Very reliable.

577
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,150
When did I say that?

578
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,190
Our daughter

579
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,000
is indeed

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,270
the apple of our eye.

581
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,920
For marriage,

582
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,230
how do you think?

583
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,920
Please wait a moment.

584
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,760
For the project of marriage,

585
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,680
I set up

586
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,720
a special project team.

587
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,190
I made a most detailed

588
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,110
and complete plan.

589
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,760
The engagement,

590
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,000
wedding preparations

591
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,470
and post-wedding matters

592
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,190
are all listed in detail.

593
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,190
Please review.

594
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,720
If there is anything

595
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
unclear,

596
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,000
please tell me at any time.

597
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,430
Mom, do you see that?

598
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,190
I told you that

599
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,880
our marriage is fake.

600
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,800
We're just for our benefit.

601
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,920
Just a fake marriage.

602
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,840
Mom.

603
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,230
He's reliable.

604
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:48,150
Although he looks silly,

605
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,000
I didn't expect

606
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,550
him to be a practical entrepreneur.

607
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,920
It seems that he is also serious about marriage.

608
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:53,880
Sure enough,

609
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,270
men are the most attractive

610
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,800
when they are serious.

611
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,190
I can forgive

612
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,390
whatever he just said about me.

613
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,350
Xiaohe.

614
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
Do you

615
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,390
have a son?

616
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,920
What about his mother?

617
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,760
Dad, it's a private matter.

618
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:13,920
We have to

619
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,350
figure this thing out.

620
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,080
Xiaohe.

621
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,310
In fact, we are very open-minded.

622
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,080
We will never

623
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,390
be prejudiced

624
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,550
against this marriage

625
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,840
just because you have a child.

626
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,840
You can relax.

627
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,600
We are just worried

628
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,840
that Yueyue will be wrongly treated in the future.

629
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,880
Xiaobao's mother passed away.

630
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,150
I have raised him by myself.

631
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,840
Mom, dad.

632
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
You've asked what you want to know,

633
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,800
so we'll leave.

634
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,150
So let me ask you last question

635
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,960
have you completely

636
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,510
let go of the mother of your child now?

637
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,430
Mom.

638
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,150
My information based on timeline is ready for you.

639
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,470
Remember to look carefully.

640
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,550
If there's anything unclear,

641
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,470
or missed,

642
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,470
let me know.

643
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,040
I will answer you truthfully.

644
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,350
Xiaobao's mother

645
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:06,720
is the closest family member

646
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,920
to me.

647
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,470
A virtuous elder sister-in-law is comparable to a mother.

648
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,110
It turns out that Xiaobao

649
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,270
is your brother's child.

650
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,000
I thought

651
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,350
Xiaobao is your child.

652
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,080
Except for those close to me,

653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,470
no one knows

654
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,350
who Xiaobao's biological father and mother are.

655
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,350
I don't want any people to know.

656
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,040
It's not easy for you.

657
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,470
You are so young,

658
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,000
and responsible.

659
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
But your brother and sister-in-law

660
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,080
must be

661
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,800
very grateful to you.

662
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,760
Xiaohe.

663
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,550
I am especially good at taking care of children.

664
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,760
Moreover,

665
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,190
We've seen that kid.

666
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,510
He's a sensible and smart boy.

667
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,960
If you're busy,

668
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,640
you can leave him to us.

669
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,680
Don't make yourself so hard.

670
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,080
Have you met Xiaobao?

671
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,880
Yueyue.

672
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,470
You sent me a picture,

673
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,430
it's like I've seen him.

674
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,760
You must be hungry.

675
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,040
I will cook for you.

676
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,040
Please have some fruit first.

677
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,110
Do something.

678
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,000
It'll be ready in a minute.

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
Come on.

680
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,390
This is "Braised Steak Fillet",

681
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,230
one of my culinary specialit.

682
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,550
Try it.

683
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,510
And try this.

684
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,920
Thank you.

685
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,960
Eat more vegetables.

686
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,720
Mom.

687
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,470
Let's get another pair of serving chopsticks.

688
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,680
It doesn't matter.

689
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,000
I haven't had dinner

690
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
with family members like this

691
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,080
for a long time.

692
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,040
Great.

693
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,000
Let's have a drink.

694
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,840
You can't drink.

695
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,720
I should take care of

696
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,640
your "Three highs".

697
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,310
I'm happy today.

698
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,000
Xiaohe.

699
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,960
You must drink with me.

700
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,350
You can

701
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,920
only drink a little.

702
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,040
All right, that's enough.

703
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,760
You see, more and more.

704
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
All right.

705
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,760
You have to take care of me.

706
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,190
You have to take care of me for the rest of your life.

707
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,310
In your dreams.

708
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,350
Who cares about your life?

709
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,390
Come on.

710
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,000
Cheers!

711
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,040
Drink slowly.

712
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,190
Well.

713
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,840
You drink it all.

714
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,270
If you can't drink,

715
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,920
don't drink.

716
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,720
You are so sincere.

717
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,110
Take some food.

718
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,080
Come on.

719
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,080
The fish is still stewing in the pot.

720
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,230
I forgot.

721
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,600
One more please.

722
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,430
Come and eat.

723
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,920
Well.

724
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,150
Here comes

725
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:41,510
the fish.

726
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,640
Here comes the fish.

727
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,960
You don't serve it, it's too hot.

728
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:44,960
Move it.

729
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,430
Slow down.

730
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,550
Are you hurt?

731
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,150
You should use a towel.

732
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,230
This is

733
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,800
cold, you will be better

734
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,880
if you hold it.

735
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,680
Well.

736
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,390
Don't use this.

737
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,600
There's toothpaste in the bathroom.

738
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,350
Apply some toothpaste,

739
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,080
it will be better.

740
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,470
You should use it.

741
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,080
Should be soy sauce.

742
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,880
Not soy sauce.

743
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,640
Toothpaste.

744
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Soy sauce.

745
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,800
Toothpaste.

746
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,880
Soy sauce.

747
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,920
Toothpaste.

748
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,190
I'll go and

749
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,550
apply some toothpaste first.

750
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,680
Go ahead.

751
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,840
It's amazing so many stuff

752
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
in such a small space.

753
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,600
But

754
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,680
why does

755
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,600
it feel so warm?

756
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,800
Have some more.

757
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:58,000
Uncle Qin, let's have another drink.

758
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,230
Okay.

759
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,920
Come on.

760
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Stop drinking

761
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,270
and have some soup.

762
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,640
Just a little.

763
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,230
Just a little.

764
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,840
Come on.

765
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,190
Drink it slowly.

766
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,960
Well.

767
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,920
You should drink it slowly.

768
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,680
You made it spilled.

769
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,680
You see what you did.

770
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,680
I'm sorry

771
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,040
for the interruption today.

772
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,600
It's getting late.

773
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,550
I just asked the driver

774
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,760
to go back to take care of Xiaobao.

775
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,040
I wonder if it is convenient for you

776
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
to let me stay here

777
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,110
tonight?

778
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,040
What?

779
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,880
Yes.

780
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,720
Yes.

781
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,080
You can share a room with me.

782
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,470
You don't say anymore.

783
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:44,960
Xiaohe.

784
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
We only have the couch

785
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
for you to sleep on.

786
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,110
I'll clean up first.

787
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,230
Don't bother, Aunt.

788
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,470
If so,

789
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,110
I can share a room

790
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,190
with Yiyue.

791
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,840
Do you have facial cleanser?

792
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,880
I forgot to bring it.

793
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,960
This guy comes prepared.

794
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,350
Actually, I'm used to sleeping alone.

795
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Because your mom

796
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,390
cooks really good,

797
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,190
I want to have another breakfast tomorrow.

798
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,190
He smells like a bar.

799
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,720
All right.

800
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,110
You sleep on the sofa.

801
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,550
I sleep on the sofa?

802
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,000
Why?

803
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,640
I haven't slept on the sofa.

804
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Then I'll sleep on the sofa.

805
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,470
You sleep on the bed.

806
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,550
Talk to me for a while.

807
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,230
You may not know

808
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,960
I envy you so much.

809
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,600
You have the home.

810
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,110
You have family.

811
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,720
Your towels hang together.

812
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,550
Your toothbrushes are put together.

813
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,880
You eat together

814
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,800
and sleep together.

815
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,040
But I have nothing.
