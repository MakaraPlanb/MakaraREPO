Unforgettable Love
EP05

2
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,840
Tonight,

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
I'll sleep on the couch.

4
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,630
You two will sleep in my bedroom.

5
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,310
Let's break up the meeting.

6
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,789
Wait.

7
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:13,960
Dear, don't break up the meeting.

8
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,750
I just saw

9
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,360
a storage room over there.

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,440
You clean it up.

11
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,480
I'll just live there with your dad.

12
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,750
Lao Qin,

13
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,400
Let's

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,880
stay more days

15
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,840
with our daughter.

16
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,039
No problem.

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,840
I

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,310
Stop. It's settled.

19
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,110
Yes.

20
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,520
You.

21
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,480
Stop talking about it.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,110
You help clean up the room, right?

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,310
Yeah.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,150
Oh, my god!

25
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,479
I'll clean up the room.

26
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:38,710
Go ahead.

27
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,919
Arrhythmia.

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,750
Shortness of breath.

29
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,960
Hello, brother.

30
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,480
A man

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,710
sent a woman home.

32
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,230
What does that mean?

33
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,150
Love couples.

34
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,000
According to the information I have,

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,840
Dr. Qin is single.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,400
And

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,670
there has never been anything

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,110
about this man before.

39
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,360
Then you need to

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
cheer up.

41
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,190
I tell you that

42
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,000
this person

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,750
is likely to be

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,960
a roadblock

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,840
in your cooperation.

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,960
The name of this kind of people

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,079
is called rivals in love.

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,590
Hello, sir.

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you have an appointment?

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,960
It's you, Mr. He.

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,480
Do you come here today

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,790
especially to see Yiyue's cat?

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,400
Yiyue.

54
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,960
When does my fiancÃ©e

55
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,790
have a cat?

56
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,750
Well, I'll bring it out

57
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,840
for you to see.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,230
Mr. He, sorry to keep you waiting.

59
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,360
I'm coming.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,110
Touch it.

61
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,110
Mr. He, you're here, too.

62
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,880
I am just passing by.

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,630
Hi.

64
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,310
Did you sleep well?

65
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,270
Did it sleep well?

66
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,560
It rested well

67
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
after my check yesterday.

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,670
It's fine now.

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Do you have a cold?

70
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,190
You should get some rest.

71
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,840
Brother,

72
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,590
in order to welcome you,

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,150
I'll treat you to a slap-up meal in the evening.

74
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,400
I know that

75
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,560
there is the No.1 popular hot pot restaurant near here.

76
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,560
OK.

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,270
Are you with us?

78
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,190
-Well.  -He won't go.

79
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,190
How can Mr. He get into

80
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,670
such a dirty and noisy

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,110
public hot pot restaurant?

82
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,080
Mr. He, right?

83
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,270
It is Yiyue who understands me better.

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,360
Hot pot

85
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,590
is both high in calories and fat.

86
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,000
It is full of grease

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
and food that

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,400
have not been professionally handled.

89
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:14,710
In addition,

90
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,519
meat, the raw and the cold are in the same pot.

91
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,269
I, He Qiaoyan,

92
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,709
have never eaten this type of diet.

93
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:19,560
You see.

94
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,750
I just said he never eats this type of food.

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,440
Let's go and put the cat back.

96
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,790
Hi.

97
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,000
Navigate to

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
the No.1 popular hot pot restaurant.

99
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,270
This one is delicious.

100
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,190
Then take more.

101
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,560
I'm surprised you remember what I love to eat.

102
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,480
Of course.

103
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,310
Hello, sir.

104
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,790
Are you alone?

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,710
Yes, only me.

106
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,880
Would you like to order a medium pot?

107
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,110
Yes.

108
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,440
Would you like to order a double combo?

109
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,520
Yes.

110
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
Waiter, a rubber band, please.

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,920
No need.

112
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,230
I have one.

113
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,710
Thank you.

114
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,590
There is also a free birthday celebration.

115
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:22,880
If necessary...

116
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,590
Anything is ok.

117
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,230
Please hurry up.

118
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,670
Roll up your sleeves.

119
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,670
I forgot. Thank you for reminding me.

120
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,590
I saw that

121
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,400
the online articles that insult you

122
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,480
seem to have disappeared.

123
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,560
What's going on?

124
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,670
He Qiaoyan made it.

125
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,230
It seems that

126
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,750
he is not as unkind

127
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,790
as you described.

128
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,590
I admit

129
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
he really

130
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,670
isn't that annoying either.

131
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,790
After we learned that your birthday is today,

132
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,710
we have customized

133
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,750
a free birthday celebration especially for you.

134
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,590
I wish you

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,230
happy birthday,

136
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,560
everything going well,

137
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
good health,

138
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,270
getting rich soon,

139
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,590
and getting thinner.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,310
Is there anything else you need?

141
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,190
No, thanks.

142
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,040
This is not a birthday celebration at all.

143
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,790
This is embarrassing situation.

144
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,630
It's really embarrassing.

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,710
Distinguished guests.

146
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,560
Today is our third anniversary.

147
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,670
There are activities in our restaurant.

148
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,400
Music will be played soon.

149
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
After the music stops,

150
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,230
if a customer

151
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,480
can embrace a person of the opposite sex

152
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,710
as quickly as possible,

153
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,790
she/he can enjoy a 50% discount.

154
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,560
If they can kiss,

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,520
it's free for them.

156
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,670
Kiss?

157
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,270
Great.

158
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,000
It's another show of love.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,310
Don't look. Let's eat.

160
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,630
First level risk warning.

161
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,670
The precursor of the crash.

162
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Take a selfie.

163
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,110
This scene

164
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,150
is really beautiful.

165
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,360
Let's

166
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,190
give you applause.

167
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,080
Brave and handsome men.

168
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
Table Six and Table Fifteen

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,310
will be treated free of charge.

170
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
Why are you here?

171
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,960
I came to see if this restaurant

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
could be acquired.

173
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,040
So do you want to

174
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,400
sit down and eat some?

175
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,440
Great.

176
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
Eat more.

177
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,840
Here you are.

178
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,880
Thank you.

179
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,590
I'm tired.

180
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
Do you want to get married by capture?

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,310
You must be a shortage of people.

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Get these people

183
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,230
out of here.

184
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm very upset.

185
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,230
They are here,

186
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,390
so no beautiful girls will come over.

187
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,470
Do you think

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,190
my charm has gone down?

189
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,760
I'm not interested in you.

190
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,080
But I love you.

191
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,040
Don't always

192
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,080
push people around you away.

193
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,230
No wonder Lin Wei went abroad.

194
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,190
Why do you mention her?

195
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,230
Don't you want to know

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,840
why she left?

197
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,309
She must had some reason.

198
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,549
I don't care.

199
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,510
That's right.

200
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,350
There are so many people who like you.

201
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,640
It doesn't matter if one person doesn't like you, does it?

202
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,000
Then you should try your best to

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,350
get married

204
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,150
to Dr. Qin soon.

205
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,510
I see

206
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,190
the man named He

207
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,600
coming with his child.

208
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,470
I'm going to a meeting.

209
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,960
You play with the Rubik's Cube here

210
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
by yourself for a while.

211
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:19,960
All right.

212
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:20,550
Here you are.

213
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,040
Wait for me here.

214
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,270
Hello.

215
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
You're

216
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,310
so cute.

217
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,800
What's your name?

218
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,230
I can't talk.

219
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,960
What a pity.

220
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Why can't such a lovely child

221
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,720
talk?

222
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,270
Is that your father just now?

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,190
Where is your mother?

224
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,000
This is your...

225
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,190
Is this your mother?

226
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,000
Uncle Qin, Aunt Qin.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Please eat pomegranate.

228
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,640
You're welcome.

229
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,310
Finally you are back.

230
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,190
Mom, dad, have you eaten yet?

231
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,230
If you haven't eat...

232
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,680
Finally you are back.

233
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
They just kept asking me

234
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,600
about the He Qiaoyan.

235
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
Don't betray me.

236
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,960
I didn't say anything.

237
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,880
I really can't stand it.

238
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,760
I'll leave first.

239
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
Uncle Qin, Aunt Qin.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm going for a run.

241
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Please take your time.

242
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,880
Okay.

243
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,960
I put my handbag down first.

244
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,430
Don't do anything else.

245
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,310
Come here.

246
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,880
Why are you

247
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,920
so serious?

248
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,640
Make me very nervous.

249
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,600
We've been to see

250
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,960
He Qiaoyan.

251
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,550
What?

252
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,310
Take it easy.

253
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,840
We just looked at him,

254
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,040
and did not do anything else.

255
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,960
Do you still want to cheat us?

256
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,080
His son has said

257
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,510
that you are his mother.

258
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,310
If you want to fall in love, we will not interfere.

259
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,190
We have no objection to your marriage.

260
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,880
But he has a child.

261
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,470
Do you know

262
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,230
the pressure and responsibility behind this?

263
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
And

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,190
do you know about his past,

265
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,840
his family

266
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,080
and his real situation?

267
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,470
According to you,

268
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,920
He Qiaoyan looks like a liar.

269
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,040
Your mom is right.

270
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,800
Tomorrow,

271
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,040
We'll meet him.

272
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,470
Let's see what kind of person he really is.

273
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,150
We'll ask him what he's going to do with you.

274
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,720
You have to make it clear to us.

275
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,350
Right.

276
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,310
You get him to come

277
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,920
and give us

278
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,230
a clear picture of what's going on.

279
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,430
I have nothing to do with He Qiaoyan.

280
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,550
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

281
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,080
What's up?

282
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,960
How can I have a sudden heart ache?

283
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,600
Are you OK?

284
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,760
You made you mom so angry

285
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,080
that she had a heart attack.

286
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
This is my daughter.

287
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,960
You've grown up,

288
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,040
so you've started hiding everything from me

289
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,680
She doesn't tell me about her relationships.

290
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,510
She doesn't tell me about her breakup.

291
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,270
Now she even doesn't

292
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,110
tell me about her marriage.

293
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,920
She makes me so sad.

294
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,310
I'd rather die.

295
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,430
All right, mom.

296
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,230
Stop pretending.

297
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,390
I didn't pretend.

298
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,470
I'm so sad now.

299
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,270
I feel like I'm going to die.

300
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,150
Oh no.

301
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,680
I can't enjoy being a grandma.

302
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,110
Stop saying that.

303
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,960
Let's die together.

304
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,350
I'll see you in heaven.

305
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,600
Are you OK?

306
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,550
So sad.

307
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,470
Take it easy.

308
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,640
It's over.

309
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,310
Ruowei broke her foot.

310
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,310
I'll take a look.

311
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,600
Pomegranates and grapes are especially delicious.

312
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,470
Have some more.

313
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,150
I must

314
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,760
figure it out.

315
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,040
Come on.

316
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,230
My God.

317
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,550
Thank you for saving me.

318
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,350
He just tried to come to your home.

319
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,840
I managed to find a reason

320
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
to stop him.

321
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,550
Good job.

322
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,390
Never let him

323
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,840
run into my parents.

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,040
Now I'll

325
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,550
leave you two to talk.

326
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,430
Goodbye, Mr. He.

327
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,430
Don't you invite me in?

328
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Oh no.

329
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,640
Help me shade from the sun.

330
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,840
It's too sunny.

331
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
Can't you see the light?

332
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,230
It's too sunny.

333
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,080
You'll get a tan.

334
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,270
Qin Yiyue.

335
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,600
Are you afraid of something?

336
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,350
I'm not afraid.

337
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,550
Mr. He.

338
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,640
What can I do for you?

339
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,840
You're right.

340
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,150
What did I say?

341
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,310
You said we don't know each other very well.

342
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,230
You are right.

343
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,840
So I decide

344
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,040
to give you some time

345
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,080
to get you know me better.

346
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,510
That's all?

347
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,880
OK, I see.

348
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,150
Mr. He, please leave.

349
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,720
How long do you need?

350
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,720
In your past

351
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,230
twenty-nine years,

352
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,430
there must have been filled with stories

353
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,350
and bits of knowledge.

354
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,430
It's comparable to

355
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,390
a wonderful epic game.

356
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,760
To get through this game,

357
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,600
I need two years.

358
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,080
Two weeks at most.

359
00:14:59,390 --> 00:14:59,800
Two weeks

360
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,640
is not enough for me to get through a mini-game.

361
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,270
I have all my information

362
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,230
organized for you

363
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,230
according to the timeline.

364
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,310
Remember to look carefully.

365
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,680
If there's anything unclear

366
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,550
or missed,

367
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
Let me know.

368
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,150
I will answer you truthfully.

369
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,080
OK, Mr. He.

370
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,600
I will definitely

371
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,270
learn from your glorious past.

372
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,110
Goodbye, Mr. He.

373
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,110
Does she hide

374
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,640
another man in the house?

375
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,270
It's over.

376
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,110
Do you tell him about your parents?

377
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,720
Of course not.

378
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,680
I think

379
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,230
you should just let your parents

380
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,600
meet He Qiaoyan.

381
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,230
Don't make your parents

382
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,270
really angry.

383
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
Absolutely not.

384
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,470
And from my experience,

385
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,270
He Qiaoyan

386
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,190
is definitely a trouble maker.

387
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,510
I want to get as far away from him as possible.

388
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,920
What else can you do?

389
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,110
Are you really not afraid

390
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,720
that they will go to He Qiaoyan on their own?

391
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,760
Or

392
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,960
He Qiaoyan once again rushes into our house.

393
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,600
Yes, I do.

394
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,110
So I have to

395
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,960
get them both back tomorrow

396
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,880
anyway.

397
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,270
I think this time

398
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,080
they are determined to meet him

399
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,550
before they leave.

400
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,230
Stop playing with your phone.

401
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,390
Let's sleep.

402
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,960
When does Mommy move in?

403
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,470
Xiaobao.

404
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
Our plans

405
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,680
may have to be postponed by two weeks.

406
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,550
When Dr. Qin comes,

407
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,840
remember to take this pillow away.

408
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,640
She's not Dr. Qin, she's Mommy.

409
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,080
OK, I see.

410
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,680
Turn off your cell phone and sleep.

411
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,310
Give it to me.

412
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,640
Just lie down.

413
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,680
Mommy, I miss you.

414
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,310
Are you sending a message to He Qiaoyan?

415
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,430
Why do you stop?

416
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,190
Ok, I send

417
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,310
it right now.

418
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,270
My parents said

419
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,080
they want to meet you.

420
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,040
My God, I have a stomachache.

421
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,150
I need to go to the bathroom.

422
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,390
Lao Qin,

423
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,510
Let's take a look at her phone.

424
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,840
You shouldn't do that.

425
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
Why not?

426
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,840
One,two,three.

427
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,350
The fish has taken the bait.

428
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,600
Get ready.

429
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,920
Dr. Qin.

430
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,960
Dr. Qin.

431
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,150
Hello, Mr. He.

432
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,510
I'm Qin Yiyue's mother,

433
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,880
Luo Mingmei.

434
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,270
Hello, Aunt Luo.

435
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,040
He replied.

436
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,350
If you have time,

437
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,310
can you meet with us?

438
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,760
Of course.

439
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,470
I will visit you personally

440
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,840
right away.

441
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,960
He said he would visit in person.

442
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,190
You want me to pretend to be He Qiaoyan

443
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,080
to talk with your mother?

444
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,840
Yes.

445
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,720
You should promise to meet my mom.

446
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,110
And you should say you are young.

447
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,350
You should visit them in person to their home.

448
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,350
In that case,

449
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,960
you would be reasonable

450
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
to send them back.

451
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,510
You're right.

452
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,310
You are so smart.

453
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,470
Mom.

454
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,470
What are you talking about with He Qiaoyan?

455
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,230
I say I am your mother.

456
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,110
I want to see him.

457
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,040
He Qiaoyan

458
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,880
is pretty straightforward.

459
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
He agreed.

460
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,150
He also said that he would visit in person to our home.

461
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,000
You rush to buy tickets for us.

462
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
There is a train at two o'clock.

463
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,760
We should be able to catch that train.

464
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,680
Come on.

465
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,510
Mom, stay a few more days.

466
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,390
No.

467
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,640
Stay a few more days.

468
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,080
No.

469
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,640
Mom.

470
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,080
My mother is leaving soon.

471
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,230
I'm so sad.

472
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,390
Great job.

473
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,550
I'll treat you to dinner as a reward.

474
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,390
Lao Qin.

475
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,550
Hello.

476
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,600
Hello.

477
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,920
After I drop off my stuff,

478
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
I'm going to get my hair styled.

479
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,040
My hair is so ugly.

480
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,640
OK.

481
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,720
I will also buy a dress.

482
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,920
The red dress you chose last time

483
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,720
is quite nice.

484
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,880
Then I'll buy that one.

485
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,640
Great.

486
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
The danger is over.

487
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,080
Just now my phone suddenly broke down.

488
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,640
I just got my phone fixed.

489
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,110
What do you mean

490
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,640
by "Great job"?

491
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,760
I haven't sent a message to your mother yet.

492
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,390
It's over.

493
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,110
It's over.

494
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,080
Is this

495
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
to go for wool and come home shorn?

496
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,800
It's over.

497
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Dr. Qin.

498
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,640
Thank you for being willing to

499
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,510
let me come to your hometown.

500
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,230
Does this mean

501
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,230
that you are trying to accept me?

502
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,920
No.

503
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,110
This matter

504
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,350
can not be said clearly in one or two sentences.

505
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,150
Anyway.

506
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,430
This is a mistake.

507
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,310
A big mistake.

508
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,000
You go back first.

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,190
I will explain to you later, OK?

510
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:27,350
Go.

511
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,510
Lao Qin, I'm going to buy a dress.

512
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,350
You hurry to buy some fruits.

513
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,600
You buy some good ones.

514
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,470
Don't worry. I buy imported ones.

515
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,110
Yueyue?

516
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,800
Mom.

517
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,880
Visiting the parents

518
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,680
is a crucial step

519
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,840
in determining your marriage relationship.

520
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,430
Let the father-in-law and mother-in-law satisfied.

521
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,550
You will win.

522
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,080
Mom, dad.

523
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,430
I'm Yiyue's fiance,

524
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,190
He Qiaoyan.

525
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,760
What are you talking about?

526
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,190
Xiaohe, hello.

527
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,040
I am Yueyue's father, Qin Qiuyang.

528
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,270
Just call me Uncle Qin.

529
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,920
It's a little early

530
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,270
to call mom and dad.

531
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,510
All right, dad.

532
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,550
It's pretty good.

533
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,760
You

534
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,840
should show

535
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,430
that you are rich.

536
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,550
And you are able to

537
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,150
give her daughter a good life.

538
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
So many gifts.

539
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,430
Are you paying tribute to the emperor?

540
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,600
No one will slap (over) the smiler.

541
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,920
And no one will blame politeness.

542
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,040
There is

543
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,510
another crucial step

544
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,150
that can achieve two things at one stroke.

545
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,550
Don't say anything else.

546
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,920
Just boast them about being so young.

547
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,190
You look so young.

548
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,390
Is it?

549
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,840
I have learned that

550
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,680
although you are fifty years old this year,

551
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,230
it looks like

552
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,270
you are only forty-nine years old.

553
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,040
I said I'd better go for a facial first,

554
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,080
but you wouldn't let me go.

555
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,960
I don't know what do you like.

556
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,230
So I buy

557
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,080
a lot of kinds of things.

558
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,080
Please sit first.

559
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,600
Yes.

560
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,270
No need.

561
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,840
You have sent gifts.

562
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
You also visit.

563
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,470
Well, then, we'll go.

564
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,310
Why do you go?

565
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,550
You just sit there.

566
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,880
No interruptions.

567
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,760
Come in and sit down.

568
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,720
Lao Qin, come here.

569
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,510
Sit down.

570
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,680
Sit down.

571
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,680
Why are you sitting here?

572
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,430
You sit over there.

573
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Xiaohe.

574
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,800
I always hear Yueyue talk about you.

575
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,430
She said you are exceptionally good.

576
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,760
Very reliable.

577
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,150
When did I say that?

578
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,190
Our daughter

579
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,000
is indeed

580
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,270
the apple of our eye.

581
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,920
For marriage,

582
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,230
how do you think?

583
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,920
Please wait a moment.

584
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,760
For the project of marriage,

585
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,680
I set up

586
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
a special project team.

587
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,190
I made a most detailed

588
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,110
and complete plan.

589
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,760
The engagement,

590
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,000
wedding preparations

591
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,470
and post-wedding matters

592
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,190
are all listed in detail.

593
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,190
Please review.

594
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:19,720
If there is anything

595
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
unclear,

596
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,000
please tell me at any time.

597
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,430
Mom, do you see that?

598
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,190
I told you that

599
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,880
our marriage is fake.

600
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,800
We're just for our benefit.

601
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920
Just a fake marriage.

602
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,840
Mom.

603
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,230
He's reliable.

604
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,150
Although he looks silly,

605
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,000
I didn't expect

606
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,550
him to be a practical entrepreneur.

607
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,920
It seems that he is also serious about marriage.

608
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,880
Sure enough,

609
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,270
men are the most attractive

610
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,800
when they are serious.

611
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,190
I can forgive

612
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,390
whatever he just said about me.

613
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,350
Xiaohe.

614
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,960
Do you

615
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,390
have a son?

616
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,920
What about his mother?

617
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,760
Dad, it's a private matter.

618
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,920
We have to

619
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,350
figure this thing out.

620
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,080
Xiaohe.

621
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,310
In fact, we are very open-minded.

622
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,080
We will never

623
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,390
be prejudiced

624
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,550
against this marriage

625
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,840
just because you have a child.

626
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
You can relax.

627
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,600
We are just worried

628
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,840
that Yueyue will be wrongly treated in the future.

629
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,880
Xiaobao's mother passed away.

630
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,150
I have raised him by myself.

631
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
Mom, dad.

632
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
You've asked what you want to know,

633
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,800
so we'll leave.

634
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,150
So let me ask you last question

635
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,960
have you completely

636
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,510
let go of the mother of your child now?

637
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,430
Mom.

638
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,150
My information based on timeline is ready for you.

639
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,470
Remember to look carefully.

640
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,550
If there's anything unclear,

641
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,470
or missed,

642
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,470
let me know.

643
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,040
I will answer you truthfully.

644
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,350
Xiaobao's mother

645
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:58,720
is the closest family member

646
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,920
to me.

647
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,470
A virtuous elder sister-in-law is comparable to a mother.

648
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,110
It turns out that Xiaobao

649
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,270
is your brother's child.

650
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,000
I thought

651
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,350
Xiaobao is your child.

652
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,080
Except for those close to me,

653
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,470
no one knows

654
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,350
who Xiaobao's biological father and mother are.

655
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,350
I don't want any people to know.

656
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,040
It's not easy for you.

657
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,470
You are so young,

658
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,000
and responsible.

659
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
But your brother and sister-in-law

660
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,080
must be

661
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,800
very grateful to you.

662
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,760
Xiaohe.

663
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,550
I am especially good at taking care of children.

664
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:46,760
Moreover,

665
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,190
We've seen that kid.

666
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,510
He's a sensible and smart boy.

667
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,960
If you're busy,

668
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,640
you can leave him to us.

669
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,680
Don't make yourself so hard.

670
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,080
Have you met Xiaobao?

671
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,880
Yueyue.

672
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,470
You sent me a picture,

673
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,430
it's like I've seen him.

674
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,760
You must be hungry.

675
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,040
I will cook for you.

676
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,040
Please have some fruit first.

677
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,110
Do something.

678
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,000
It'll be ready in a minute.

679
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
Come on.

680
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,390
This is "Braised Steak Fillet",

681
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,230
one of my culinary specialit.

682
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,550
Try it.

683
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,510
And try this.

684
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,920
Thank you.

685
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,960
Eat more vegetables.

686
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,720
Mom.

687
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,470
Let's get another pair of serving chopsticks.

688
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,680
It doesn't matter.

689
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,000
I haven't had dinner

690
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
with family members like this

691
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,080
for a long time.

692
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,040
Great.

693
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,000
Let's have a drink.

694
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,840
You can't drink.

695
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
I should take care of

696
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,640
your "Three highs".

697
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,310
I'm happy today.

698
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,000
Xiaohe.

699
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,960
You must drink with me.

700
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,350
You can

701
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,920
only drink a little.

702
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,040
All right, that's enough.

703
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,760
You see, more and more.

704
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,720
All right.

705
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,760
You have to take care of me.

706
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:59,190
You have to take care of me for the rest of your life.

707
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,310
In your dreams.

708
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,350
Who cares about your life?

709
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,390
Come on.

710
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,000
Cheers!

711
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,040
Drink slowly.

712
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,190
Well.

713
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,840
You drink it all.

714
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,270
If you can't drink,

715
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,920
don't drink.

716
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,720
You are so sincere.

717
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,110
Take some food.

718
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,080
Come on.

719
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,080
The fish is still stewing in the pot.

720
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,230
I forgot.

721
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
One more please.

722
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,430
Come and eat.

723
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,920
Well.

724
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,150
Here comes

725
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:33,510
the fish.

726
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,640
Here comes the fish.

727
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,960
You don't serve it, it's too hot.

728
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:36,960
Move it.

729
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,430
Slow down.

730
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,550
Are you hurt?

731
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,150
You should use a towel.

732
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,230
This is

733
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,800
cold, you will be better

734
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,880
if you hold it.

735
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,680
Well.

736
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,390
Don't use this.

737
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,600
There's toothpaste in the bathroom.

738
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,350
Apply some toothpaste,

739
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,080
it will be better.

740
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,470
You should use it.

741
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:57,080
Should be soy sauce.

742
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Not soy sauce.

743
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,640
Toothpaste.

744
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Soy sauce.

745
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,800
Toothpaste.

746
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
Soy sauce.

747
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
Toothpaste.

748
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,190
I'll go and

749
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,550
apply some toothpaste first.

750
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,680
Go ahead.

751
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,840
It's amazing so many stuff

752
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,760
in such a small space.

753
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,600
But

754
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,680
why does

755
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,600
it feel so warm?

756
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,800
Have some more.

757
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,000
Uncle Qin, let's have another drink.

758
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,230
Okay.

759
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,920
Come on.

760
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Stop drinking

761
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,270
and have some soup.

762
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,640
Just a little.

763
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,230
Just a little.

764
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,840
Come on.

765
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,190
Drink it slowly.

766
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,960
Well.

767
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:03,920
You should drink it slowly.

768
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,680
You made it spilled.

769
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
You see what you did.

770
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,680
I'm sorry

771
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,040
for the interruption today.

772
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,600
It's getting late.

773
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,550
I just asked the driver

774
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,760
to go back to take care of Xiaobao.

775
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,040
I wonder if it is convenient for you

776
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
to let me stay here

777
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,110
tonight?

778
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,040
What?

779
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,880
Yes.

780
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,720
Yes.

781
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,080
You can share a room with me.

782
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,470
You don't say anymore.

783
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,960
Xiaohe.

784
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,000
We only have the couch

785
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
for you to sleep on.

786
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,110
I'll clean up first.

787
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,230
Don't bother, Aunt.

788
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,470
If so,

789
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,110
I can share a room

790
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,190
with Yiyue.

791
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,840
Do you have facial cleanser?

792
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,880
I forgot to bring it.

793
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,960
This guy comes prepared.

794
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:18,350
Actually, I'm used to sleeping alone.

795
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Because your mom

796
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,390
cooks really good,

797
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,190
I want to have another breakfast tomorrow.

798
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,190
He smells like a bar.

799
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,720
All right.

800
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,110
You sleep on the sofa.

801
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,550
I sleep on the sofa?

802
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,000
Why?

803
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,640
I haven't slept on the sofa.

804
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Then I'll sleep on the sofa.

805
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,470
You sleep on the bed.

806
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,550
Talk to me for a while.

807
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,230
You may not know

808
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,960
I envy you so much.

809
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,600
You have the home.

810
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,110
You have family.

811
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,720
Your towels hang together.

812
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,550
Your toothbrushes are put together.

813
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,880
You eat together

814
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,800
and sleep together.

815
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,040
But I have nothing.
