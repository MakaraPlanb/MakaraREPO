Unforgettable Love
EP18

2
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,150
Don't worry.

3
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,000
These snakes are not poisonous.

4
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,880
Your wife is fainting.

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,190
Are you sure?

6
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,789
At that time she was confused

7
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:17,630
and short of breath.

8
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,000
It's like being poisoned.

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,920
I've seen those two snakes.

10
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,190
I am sure that they are not poisonous.

11
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,270
Your wife was frightened.

12
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,310
What's going on?

13
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,920
If they are poisonous,

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,670
your wife should be experiencing

15
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,840
the symptom of near death.

16
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,840
So

17
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,039
she was really too frightened.

18
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:46,920
Yes

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,670
She did faint in fright.

20
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,670
Fainted in fright.

21
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,479
Am I that weak?

22
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,590
Such an adult

23
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,560
can still be fainted in fright?

24
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,040
Maybe your wife is rather delicate.

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,310
How could someone as tough as her

26
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,190
can faint in fright.

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,270
You've had enough, He Qiaoyan.

28
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,190
I am indeed fainted in fright.

29
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,880
Do you mind?

30
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
In front of so many people, do you have to

31
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
laugh at me?

32
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,480
Thank you all.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
It scared me.

34
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,480
I thought

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,880
at this young age

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,110
I was going to die.

37
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,750
If you are going to die,

38
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,670
before death,

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,710
what do you want to say to me?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,790
Terminating the contract.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,190
Give me back my reputation as a beautiful single girl,

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,150
or I'll go on chasing you

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,079
even after I die to be a ghost

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,840
Six hours to go.

45
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,520
That's the end of the day.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,000
We have agreed before

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,040
as soon as the Parent-Child Day is over

48
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,110
we would terminate the contract.

49
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,230
I promise you.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,310
Thank you for today.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,840
It's me who wants to thank you.

52
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,710
During this period

53
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,440
you have brought a lot to my family

54
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,710
more than I expected.

55
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,710
Have an early rest.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,080
And from today on

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,310
you don't have to hide from me anymore.

58
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,630
Ok.

59
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,960
You can leave now.

60
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,790
Okay.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
You have serious dark circles under your eyes.

62
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Did you not sleep well last night?

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,110
I was more used to my own bed.

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,670
Let's go.

65
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,110
Mommy

66
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,270
Xiaobao

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,480
Mommy

68
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,150
What's up?

69
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,840
Mommy goes home in daddy's car.

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,399
Xiaobao

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,110
Mommy has to go back to work.

72
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,750
Therefore

73
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,520
I have to go with Uncle Ning Fang first.

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,440
You're going home with daddy,

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,150
OK?

76
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,920
Mommy comes with us.

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,710
How about this?

78
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,270
Let Xiaobao go back in my car.

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,920
We'll talk about the rest later.

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,270
Mr. He, what do you think?

81
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,880
Ok.

82
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,440
I'll take care of Xiaobao.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,360
Take it easy.

84
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,840
All right.

85
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,270
Take care!

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,400
Let's go.

87
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,750
Why are you alone?

88
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,110
Where's my sister-in-law?

89
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,150
Where's Xiaobao?

90
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,670
What's your matter?

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,230
What?

92
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,360
I thought

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
you went there in a hurry

94
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,270
would bring my sister-in-law back.

95
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,790
As a result you not only don't get your wife back

96
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,150
but also left your son there.

97
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,880
If you have nothing to do,

98
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,750
just go.

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,400
Take your time.

100
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,670
I have business with you.

101
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,270
Well

102
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,880
Let me ask you a question first.

103
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,310
You have to answer me honestly.

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm not interested.

105
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,880
Not interested, right?

106
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,790
If you are not interested,

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,670
forget it, I'll go.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,080
The similarity can be 80 percent.

109
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,040
Right?

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,920
I had a feeling that this girl

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,750
could be

112
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,960
your dream girl.

113
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,110
I'd like to see

114
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,790
if your dream girl

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,270
is actually a real person.

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,230
The view of this back has appeared for countless times

117
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,520
in my dream.

118
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,000
Now you can make your dream come true.

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,750
But I just don't know why

120
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,440
when I look at this picture

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,790
I feel a little strange.

122
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,840
Strange?

123
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,190
I don't understand what you're talking about.

124
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,400
I don't have to check on her.

125
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,480
Why?

126
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,480
You always said she was my first girlfriend.

127
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,630
I don't know either

128
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,710
if she was my first girlfriend.

129
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,960
I just think

130
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,000
I should go and find her.

131
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,670
Even sometimes

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,670
she is the motivation

133
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,710
that keeps me going.

134
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,360
You don't want your motivationï¼Ÿ

135
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,150
My motivation is not here.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,630
Not here?

137
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,840
Yiyue

138
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,440
Where are you? I'll come to you.

139
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,000
I have a surprise for you.

140
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,920
OK, I'm at home.

141
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,310
Xiaobao

142
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,880
Come on, mommy do it for you.

143
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,790
Is it good?

144
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,480
After the meal,

145
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,360
I'll ask the driver to take you back.

146
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,190
With mommy.

147
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,230
Mommy has a lot of work to do.

148
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,960
Our Xiaobao

149
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,630
is the most sensible boy.

150
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,230
You'll listen to mommy, won't you?

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,150
Why isn't this bubbling?

152
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,350
There's water.

153
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,110
You help Mommy have a look

154
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,390
why can't it make bubbles,

155
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,350
ok?

156
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,510
Come on

157
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
You shoot me, don't you?

158
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,110
Well

159
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,960
I will revenge.

160
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,640
Waiting for me.

161
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,150
I'm coming. Don't run.

162
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,430
Xiaobao

163
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,310
There are no bubbles?

164
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,510
Let me have a look.

165
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,430
There's no water.

166
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,600
All right,

167
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,960
You can put some

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,150
water we just filled in it,

169
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,000
ok?

170
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,000
Go ahead.

171
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,150
Go ahead.

172
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,270
How did you get in here?

173
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:03,960
Do you think we

174
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,550
still need secrets?

175
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,800
Are you here to pick up Xiaobao?

176
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,390
He's in the bathroom.

177
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,680
I'll get him.

178
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,920
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,270
The last contract was automatically terminated.

180
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,310
This is a new contract.

181
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,390
I thought about it for a long time.

182
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,080
I want to start with you

183
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,390
a new partnership.

184
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,270
What?

185
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
As for the concrete content,

186
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,760
you can take a look at the contract.

187
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,310
Your contract is so lengthy.

188
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,550
I don't care to look at it.

189
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,230
Then I'll read it to you.

190
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,270
Party A He Qiaoyan,

191
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,550
during the main contract

192
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,270
for Party B Qin Yiyue

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,550
had feelings beyond the regulations.

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,920
Therefore, I hereby supplement the term which

195
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,040
proposes further in-depth cooperation.

196
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,000
I would like to start a relationship with Part B

197
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,110
in formal.

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
After relationship confirmation,

199
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,800
if Party B has no comments,

200
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,310
the contract period

201
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,640
can be extended indefinitely,

202
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,920
for example, a lifetime.

203
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,110
What did you say?

204
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:40,960
You have said that

205
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,110
you have no reason

206
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,430
to stay with me.

207
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,640
Then I'll give you a reason

208
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
to stay with me forever.

209
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,110
Are you satisfied with this reason?

210
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,680
Have a guess.

211
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,270
I guess?

212
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,840
Xiaobao, Xiaobao

213
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,680
You've come at a bad time.

214
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,800
Here.

215
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,550
Dad made it.

216
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,960
â™ª My heart is melting â™ª

217
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,880
Oh, I nearly forgot.

218
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,800
Ning Fang wants to see me for something.

219
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,510
I'll be back in a minute.

220
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,350
Wait for me. Wait for me.

221
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:00,760
Xiaobao

222
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,430
Why does Dr. Ning come to your mommy?

223
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,640
Giving her a surprise.

224
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,840
A surprise?

225
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,150
Ning Fang

226
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,150
-Yiyue  -What's the matter?

227
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
I tell you...

228
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,880
Why are you blushing?

229
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,230
Do you have a fever?

230
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,150
A fever?

231
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,470
Where do you touch?

232
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,920
Okay

233
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,600
Let's go home.

234
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,840
Go home?

235
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,960
Let's go.

236
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,000
Wait a minute.

237
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,680
I haven't finished talking with Ning Fang.

238
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,800
You can talk about it at home.

239
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,600
Get in the car.

240
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,190
In the future such thing

241
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,510
will not bother you.

242
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,150
Mr. He, Yiyue is a simple girl.

243
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,190
If you don't think about it clearly,

244
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:53,960
I hope you...

245
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
I know better than ever.

246
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,510
From today,

247
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,880
Yiyue and I are officially dating.

248
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,920
I hope Dr. Ning

249
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,470
can keep the necessary distance.

250
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,040
You are a smart man.

251
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,600
Why did we go home suddenly?

252
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,390
The conversation between me and Ning Fang

253
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,470
haven't been finished yet.

254
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,000
Ning Fang came here

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
just to tell you

256
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,040
your idol's concert has been cancelled.

257
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,230
My idol has a concert?

258
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,720
He came here specially

259
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,270
just to tell me that?

260
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:27,920
Of course.

261
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,270
But don't worry,

262
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,960
I and Xiaobao

263
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,270
will go a concert with you when we go back.

264
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,680
Ning Fang,

265
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,880
thank you for your kindness.

266
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,310
It's fine if I don't see the concert.

267
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:41,960
Bye

268
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,430
welcome

269
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,470
I'm back again.

270
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,920
welcome back.

271
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,350
Let me show you something.

272
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,110
Come here.

273
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,080
The room has been rearranged for you.

274
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,110
A new TV

275
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,350
and a refrigerator.

276
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,350
There are masks and snacks in the fridge.

277
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,350
When did you prepare these?

278
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,040
Yesterday at the mountain villa,

279
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,800
I prepared it in advance. Go ahead and have a look.

280
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,600
So many snacks I love.

281
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,800
I don't know if you are satisfied.

282
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,310
Very satisfied.

283
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,920
This kind of surprise can be more in the future.

284
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,470
It's getting late.

285
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,470
How about a break?

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,920
I'll go back first.

287
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,720
Let's watch TV together.

288
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,190
Great.

289
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,760
Sit here.

290
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,840
Come.

291
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,350
Do you eat...

292
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,760
I forget that

293
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,150
you don't like

294
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,760
eating this junk food.

295
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,680
Would you like this?

296
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,040
Ok.

297
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,000
I've seen this episode.

298
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,270
I can tell you

299
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,920
if the hero

300
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,430
stay or not tonight.

301
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,550
I'd better watch it myself.

302
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,080
All right.

303
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,110
Here you are

304
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,640
Good night.

305
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,150
What are you all doing?

306
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,230
Witnessing the wonders of human civilization.

307
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,550
The millennial iron tree has blossomed.

308
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,470
Do you think that to love someone

309
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,920
is to be assimilated by that person?

310
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,880
All right.

311
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,960
Don't even stand here.

312
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,110
Do what you should do.

313
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,350
Wait. Watch it for another while.

314
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,880
Mr. He

315
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,550
Go, go, go

316
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,270
I come to tell you

317
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,390
today's arrangement.

318
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,640
At three p.m.

319
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
you will have a meeting with Mr. Xu.

320
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,270
Then is the Company

321
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,720
Internal R & D meeting.

322
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,760
What seems to be the problem?

323
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,110
Nothing.

324
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,350
Go on.

325
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,350
Dr. Qin is in such a good mood.

326
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,880
What did you say?

327
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,040
I said today you

328
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,190
look so happy.

329
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
Is it so obvious?

330
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,760
Did you win a prize on Sina Weibo?

331
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,510
I would not tell you.

332
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,040
Not prize.

333
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,680
I think she has been

334
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,510
shot.

335
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,310
Cupid's arrow.

336
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,470
Miss Lin, Miss Lin

337
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,720
Wait a minute, Miss Lin.

338
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,190
Mr. He, I'm sorry.

339
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,430
You asked someone to write this, right?

340
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,350
Is there anything wrong with that?

341
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,470
The two of us

342
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,390
discord in work philosophy.

343
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,600
You offered to resign.

344
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,920
I think for us it's

345
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
the best choice.

346
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,880
You don't want to get married with me, do you?

347
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,920
It's just on the spouse column

348
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,000
a name.

349
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,760
You and me are people

350
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,720
who have a scale in our hearts

351
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,040
and know best what is important.

352
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,080
My last name

353
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,110
add your first name

354
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,390
will be far more than two.

355
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,960
Thank you for your approval.

356
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,040
But I hope

357
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,640
I won't hear

358
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,600
such words again.

359
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,720
Because my girlfriend will get angry.

360
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,510
Girlfriend?

361
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,270
Yes.

362
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,840
I have a formal relationship with Yiyue.

363
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,390
He Qiaoyan, you have to think about it clearly.

364
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,310
Your refusal

365
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,550
equals to reject the whole Lin family.

366
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,150
Marriage is love.

367
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,800
Business is profit.

368
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,880
I didn't harm your profits

369
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,040
and I will not be your enemy.

370
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,510
He Qiaoyan, don't be

371
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,720
too cocky.

372
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,040
Not everything

373
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,270
can be what you want.

374
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,840
People like us

375
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,920
can not have a free relationship.

376
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,110
Our love contract

377
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,350
has not been officially signed yet.

378
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,270
Come to the company today,

379
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,510
With the witness of the legal personnel, we will

380
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,310
sign it.

381
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,080
I can't sign the contract yet.

382
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,960
Why?

383
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
Don't answer him!

384
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,190
At this time,

385
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,550
You should make him

386
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,230
flurried because of you.

387
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,470
Turn back.

388
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,600
Turn right and go out.

389
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

390
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,600
You are one to talk.

391
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,430
What's the matter again?

392
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,310
We have agreed.

393
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
Yes? No? Yes? No?

394
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,800
Yes? No? Yes? No?

395
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,110
Qin Yiyue. Qin Yiyue

396
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,470
If you don't like the contract

397
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,350
then don't sign.

398
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,150
If you don't like me,

399
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,230
just say it.

400
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,110
No.

401
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,390
If you don't like me,

402
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,230
who else can you like?

403
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Who else can you like?

404
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:15,960
Mr. He

405
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,800
Who?

406
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,470
It's me.

407
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,600
Just in time.

408
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,040
Inform the legal personnel

409
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,550
no one is allowed to leave after work.

410
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,640
Go.

411
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,230
Ok.

412
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,430
Fight with me?

413
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,190
It's all because our before

414
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,510
successful cooperation,

415
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,680
so I think it should be the most suitable

416
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,760
and acceptable

417
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,640
way.

418
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,270
He Qiaoyan

419
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:44,840
You're a bonehead.

420
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,150
Dating is such a personal thing.

421
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,960
How to be said

422
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,310
in front of so many people?

423
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
People around me

424
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,800
are all my legal personnel.

425
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,190
For the love contract, if you

426
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,550
have any comments,

427
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,720
we can modify it on the spot.

428
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,080
After confirmation,

429
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,150
We do formal signing.

430
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,470
Meanwhile,

431
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,510
the relationship takes effect immediately.

432
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,470
I think before signing

433
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:05,000
this love contract,

434
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,190
I need to know

435
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,920
your true feeling.

436
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,150
Ok.

437
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,920
My true feeling is

438
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,310
I don't want you to

439
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,150
with anyone but me

440
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,960
have similar cooperation intention.

441
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,550
So sweet.

442
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,110
Go on, go on.

443
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,760
It seems that

444
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
you are not satisfied with the contract.

445
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,600
You want to add conditions?

446
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,640
Yes.

447
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,470
I want more initiative.

448
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,230
Then you will be Party A.

449
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,840
All conditions are yours.

450
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,110
Now you can just mention it.

451
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
I have only one condition.

452
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,190
I need Part B to clearly

453
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,110
and formally express to Part A

454
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,760
his feeling.

455
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,040
What I just expressed

456
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,190
isn't clear?

457
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,470
I got it!

458
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,680
You want a gift.

459
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,960
This is very simple.

460
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,110
Do you want a car or a house?

461
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,000
Just say it.

462
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,390
I'll buy it for you tomorrow.

463
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,310
Or do you like

464
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,510
which car in my name

465
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,640
or which house?

466
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,840
Don't worry.

467
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,080
These are all yours.

468
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,680
I don't want these.

469
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,350
I got it!

470
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,720
You want me to praise you.

471
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,680
Although these words have been said before,

472
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,510
now again,

473
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,190
no problem.

474
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:46,840
You are a

475
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,550
very good psychologist.

476
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,840
At the same time, you are nice to Xiaobao.

477
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,720
Of course, you are nice to me too.

478
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,430
You helped me a lot.

479
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,550
When you at home

480
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll be at ease.

481
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,600
I don't want to hear that.

482
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,800
You like me?

483
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,640
So you hope

484
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,600
to hear I say

485
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,680
I

486
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,920
I

487
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,310
I

488
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,600
Since Party B cannot

489
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,720
meet the requirements of Party A,

490
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,470
then Party A announces the suspension of signing.

491
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:09,960
Don't worry.

492
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,720
Not a big deal.

493
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,390
What's your problem?

494
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,190
How did you driveï¼Ÿ

495
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,390
It's your garageï¼Ÿ

496
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,390
For this shopping mall,

497
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,110
my dad is one of the shareholdersã€‚

498
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,430
This garage

499
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,470
is really mine.

500
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,190
It's you again.

501
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,080
Following me all day.

502
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,600
You're so free.

503
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,800
You have to figure it out

504
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,150
who's following who?

505
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,310
Lily,

506
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,190
Amy and Xiaoxue,

507
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,920
You took my girls.

508
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,390
Those old grudges

509
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,470
I don't even bother to mention to you.

510
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,880
But Yang Ruowei is an exception.

511
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,600
You'd better stay away from her.

512
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,760
I've provoked you so many times before.

513
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,110
I haven't seen you act like this.

514
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,150
Why? This time is real?

515
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
If you do this again,

516
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,080
I'm really serious.

517
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,550
Ok, ok, ok.

518
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,350
The girl is too tough.

519
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,190
I, Wang Cheng,

520
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,190
for the first time see

521
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,550
such a girl who is being disrespectful!

522
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Her brother,

523
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,720
the person who was downstairs that night

524
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,080
ask you for 50,000 yuan.

525
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,720
It's really annoying.

526
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,430
What's up?

527
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,920
I don't know what he thinks.

528
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,230
These two days

529
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,080
he spent all day downstairs of my company

530
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,230
and told the receptionist he wanted to see me

531
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,800
and he called me brother-in-law.

532
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,680
Having such a relative,

533
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,550
no matter how beautiful the girl is,

534
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,920
I'm not interested in.

535
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,600
If he does become my relative,

536
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,190
there's no end of trouble for the future.

537
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,510
You octopus.

538
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,680
Be careful of being killed by thunder.

539
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,720
Slow down.

540
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,430
Mr. Wen

541
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,760
This is a document that needs your signature.

542
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,920
Anything else?

543
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,760
Is it time to admit defeat?

544
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,679
For what?

545
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,270
Yesterday, the heart number

546
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,230
I have seen it.

547
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,150
That doesn't mean anything.

548
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,150
I just

549
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,960
Just out of a boss's

550
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,350
care for his subordinate.

551
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,880
I'm just worried about what's wrong with you.

552
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,389
By the way,

553
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,760
the man yesterday

554
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,960
is your brother?

555
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,230
None of your business.

556
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,920
What happened?

557
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,230
Mr. Wen. You ordered so much delicious food.

558
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
Why come to me?

559
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,470
I got it!

560
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,510
He Qiaoyan asked you to come.

561
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,600
Why did he ask me to come?

562
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
What's going on?

563
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,720
Aren't you two already...

564
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,190
Look at this.

565
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,760
Broke up but still connected.

566
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,960
I didn't expect your relations are so exciting.

567
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,000
I can't explain it to you in a couple of words.

568
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,680
In short,

569
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,230
we've made up.

570
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,840
Aren't you going to be surprised?

571
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:34,190
Forget it. Forget it

572
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,310
It was a terrible performance.

573
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,150
Don't be surprised.

574
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,230
He Qiaoyan's feeling for you

575
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,310
has been found by me for a long time.

576
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,680
You're those closely involved cannot see clearly.

577
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,840
He Qiaoyan didn't ask you to come.

578
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,960
Let me guess.

579
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,310
Who's on your mind?

580
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,960
To be honest,

581
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,040
Yang Ruowei's brother,

582
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,840
do you know him?

583
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,640
No, no, no.

584
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,720
It's not what you think.

585
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Don't get me wrong.

586
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,960
You scared me.

587
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,000
Here's the deal.

588
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,390
Recently, her brother

589
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,310
always looking for Yang Ruowei's trouble.

590
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,110
I ran into it.

591
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,310
I saw the way he reached out

592
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,840
to his sister for money

593
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,510
was quite rude,

594
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,390
and also he made a clamor to Yang Ruowei.

595
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,960
They don't look like brother and sister anyway.

596
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,150
He's too much of a bully.

597
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,110
What's going on?

598
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,310
Do you really want to care about Ruowei?

599
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,680
Of course, I want to help her.

600
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:30,040
Ruowei's private affairs are rarely mentioned.

601
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,840
I've known her for such a long time,

602
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,040
but I just know a little.

603
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,550
Her brother

604
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Speaking of her brother

605
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,640
I get angry.

606
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,230
He not only does nothing all day,

607
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,640
but also often asks Ruowei for money.

608
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,190
It seems that she

609
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,430
doesn't care about the past,

610
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,040
bur she has suffered so much.

611
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,190
Yeah

612
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,110
She is pretending all day

613
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,190
that she doesn't care about feelings.

614
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,720
But actually she hasn't

615
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,840
really been in love.

616
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,310
I can see that

617
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,550
she was carefully

618
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,720
protecting herself.

619
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,840
No giving, no harming.

620
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,270
Has she had a relationship?

621
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,720
She had a boyfriend.

622
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,840
But as far as I know

623
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,430
She has not even been touched.

624
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:11,880
Okay.

625
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,920
That's all I can tell you.

626
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,040
Ruowei is a person who hates most that others

627
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,000
know her past

628
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,040
and her fragility.

629
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,000
It is because I

630
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,470
think you care about her,

631
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,600
I told these to you.

632
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,430
But in my past experience,

633
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,080
I can tell you,

634
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,350
if you really care about someone,

635
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,920
be brave enough to protect her.

636
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,720
No matter how thick her heart wall is

637
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,880
as long as you try

638
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,960
there will be a way to follow.

639
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,190
What way?

640
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,000
Please, the beautiful fairy,

641
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,550
show me the way.

642
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,390
The way is

643
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,310
giving up tricks.

644
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,190
This is delicious.

645
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,760
Try this one.

646
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,110
It's potato.

647
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,430
Giving up tricks.

648
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,040
This roast chicken is also delicious.

649
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,510
What's up?

650
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,310
I just want to tell you

651
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,430
I was at the place where we last

652
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,510
had wine.

653
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,040
Don't tell me where you are.

654
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,600
I'm not your husband.

655
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,920
Fine.

656
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,230
It's me who flatter myself.

657
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,840
I thought someone

658
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,760
needed a military division urgently

659
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,270
to answer his questions.

660
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,840
Well

661
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,110
I'll be there in half an hour.

662
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,600
Welcome Mr. He.

663
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Welcome Mr. He.

664
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,390
You are quite on time.

665
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,110
Sit down.

666
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,190
The decanter of wine has been served.

667
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,880
I need to drive a car.

668
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,080
But the deal is that

669
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,960
you pay today.

670
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:04,960
How did you know that

671
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,350
I need to be answered questions today.

672
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,270
I went to see Dr. Qin today.

673
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,960
Even though she said you made up

674
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,960
it's obviously you two have some questions.

675
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,270
Come on, what's the problem?

676
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,040
Nothing.

677
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,230
Why did you come to my girlfriend?

678
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,760
You're so jealous.

679
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,150
Don't worry.

680
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,880
I came to her today

681
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,720
just for a few questions

682
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,840
about Yang Ruowei.

683
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,150
Go ahead.

684
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,430
Your life mentor is in place.

685
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,470
Talk about your dream.

686
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,760
Oh no, talk about your confusion.

687
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,190
Your last time,

688
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,960
last time said to a girl that

689
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
you like her,

690
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,600
When was it?

691
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,000
Last month

692
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,350
or last week? I don't remember it.

693
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:46,350
Why do you ask this?

694
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
Don't waste my time.

695
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,230
Say something useful.

696
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,680
What are you doing?

697
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,430
What Dr. Qin wants

698
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,470
is just the

699
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,080
moment of saying your true feeling

700
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,760
and unabashed language expression.

701
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,270
You can create this opportunity

702
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,470
and the moment.

703
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,310
Tell me the way.

704
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,190
It's easy.

705
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,880
Appointment.

706
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,640
Appointment?

707
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,510
A perfect date.

708
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,040
A perfect date...

709
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Keep it down.

710
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,550
You will scare the fish away.

711
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,040
Why did I come with you

712
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
to this damn place.

713
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,390
Don't you just want to learn fishing?

714
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,350
Wear such a short skirt.

715
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,230
Do you feel cold?

716
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,880
No.

717
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,880
Then why is your face so red?

718
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,190
This is my blush.

719
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,270
Blush.

720
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,000
What's wrong?

721
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,350
Swatting mosquitoes!

722
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,190
What's your feeling?

723
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,550
Isn't it obvious enough?

724
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,110
This is my feeling.

725
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,840
Be careful.

726
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,600
New shoes.

727
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,640
Wen Gu told me

728
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,510
I can arrange a

729
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,640
perfect date

730
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,190
so that you can

731
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,310
see my feeling.

732
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
I specifically searched for

733
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,350
what is a perfect date.

734
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,640
A perfect date

735
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,040
can make us

736
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,350
enhance mutual affection

737
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:07,920
and also

738
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,600
impress us.

739
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,000
And fishing can help us

740
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,800
stay together quietly for a long time

741
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
and focus on each other.

742
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:17,430
Uncle, have you caught any fish?

743
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,350
Not yet.

744
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,510
Come on!

745
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,110
That's it?

746
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,760
It moved!

747
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,960
Take it up! Come on!

748
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,470
No.

749
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,840
Don't you want to learn?

750
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,760
No.

751
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,880
Xiaobao likes fish best.

752
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,960
If he know the fish

753
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,550
was caught by his mommy,

754
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,720
he is going to be very happy.

755
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,840
Hurry up!

756
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,960
There is a fish on the hook.
