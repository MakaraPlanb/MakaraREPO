Unforgettable Love
EP21

2
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:31,880
Mommy

3
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,190
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,310
Sit here.

5
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,229
Have a seat.

6
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,360
See what you want to eat.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,360
What's this for?

8
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,039
I have told you

9
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
we will have dinner together every day.

10
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,190
What's up?

11
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,880
Eat while it's hot.

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
I like eating it this way.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Any problem?

14
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
If you don't like my way,

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,630
you can go back,

16
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,960
and leave me and Xiaobao alone.

17
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,079
You eat first,

18
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,079
I need to take a call.

19
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,880
Mr. Rong

20
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:15,840
Qiao Yan

21
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,920
I have a terrible news for you.

22
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,630
I need to inform you that

23
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,400
our contract

24
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,750
can't be signed.

25
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,360
Why?

26
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,840
I was just informed from headquarters that

27
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,920
three days agoï¼Œ

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,790
Linshi Group and our headquarters

29
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,360
signed a long-term contract.

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
And in China this contract

31
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,670
is exclusive.

32
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,190
In other words,

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,440
in China our company

34
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,360
is only allowed to cooperate with Linshi.

35
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,630
OK, I see.

36
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,750
Thanks.

37
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,630
Well, sorry for that.

38
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
You are born with a silver spoon,

39
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,790
so you may not have much feeling

40
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,880
for the problems of other families.

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
But don't be self-righteous

42
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,040
to interfere in others' lives.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,959
Do not come here for no reason and disgust me!

44
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,040
Our relationship

45
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,440
is pure superior and subordinate.

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,560
What's in your mind?

47
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,560
I'm stupid.

48
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,750
No,

49
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm not stupid.

50
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,110
but you a douchebag.

51
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,670
Am I, Wen gu

52
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,520
a douchebag?

53
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,710
I am not a douchebag.

54
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,190
I'm not going to the party tonight,

55
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,960
and you guys have fun.

56
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,480
Besides,

57
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,440
Don't call me for

58
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,440
any party this month.

59
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,310
And don't introduce

60
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,310
new girls to me.

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,480
They all look the same.

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
I don't want to play Linkup?

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
I got a girl in my mind.

64
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,480
It's not about a playboy becoming a good man.

65
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,750
but a good boy showing determination.

66
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,710
No eating in the office area.

67
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,840
One hour later,

68
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
all business departments come for meeting.

69
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,110
Assistant Yang had a fever,

70
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,040
and asked for leave today.

71
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,110
What, what happenedï¼Ÿ

72
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,310
Is that true?

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,920
Today our Boss comes to the office

74
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,790
at ten o'clock a.m.

75
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,880
Did I hear it wrong?

76
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
he said all the departments what?

77
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,110
He will preside over the meeting,

78
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,150
and let us

79
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,560
inform all business departments.

80
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Does he know the business scope

81
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,440
of our company?

82
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,360
Forget it, just forget it.

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Inform them, inform!

84
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,040
Hurry up!

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,270
Get busy, get busy!

86
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,750
Xu, you came just in time

87
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,480
I checked the

88
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,960
financial report for the first half of the year.

89
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,440
Combined with market and industry trend,

90
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,230
our growth rate fell 12%

91
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,310
from that of last year.

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,520
The company now

93
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,110
is in the important third stage of development,

94
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,110
but the benefits are not satisfactory.

95
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,520
In this case decision makers

96
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,630
need to make changes.

97
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,110
I'll make an appointment with the board of directors.

98
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,630
You come up with me.

99
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,110
No problem.

100
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,360
This quarter is the key to development.

101
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,880
From now on,

102
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,310
I will fix a daily process.

103
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,630
Before ten o'clock a.m.,

104
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,400
Make sure I receive

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,710
the executive report from middle managers.

106
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,920
and the handling process of key affairs.

107
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,480
In the noon,

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,110
I will discuss plans

109
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,270
with branches and agents.

110
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,880
Time for lunch break

111
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,110
can be utilized to deal with minor problems.

112
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,000
In the afternoon, we will take stock

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
of financial data of the day

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,960
as well as key projects.

115
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,150
And we will have a meeting with

116
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,840
core executive departments

117
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,560
By the way,

118
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,840
Before knocking off work,

119
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
ask the Department of Administration

120
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,710
to report the company's system.

121
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,960
It needs optimizing.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,590
One more thing,

123
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,230
sort out and bring me

124
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,360
a big channel data

125
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,310
for the last year.

126
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,840
Did Chairman Wen press you again?

127
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm not a toddler,

128
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,230
who need to be pushed

129
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,520
to walk.

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,310
I don't do something,

131
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,790
but it doesn't mean I can not do it.

132
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,360
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,670
Mr. Wen

134
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,750
This is the strategic cooperation agreement of products.

135
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,880
Please have a look when you are free.

136
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,670
OK.

137
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,150
Get to work.

138
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,150
Seriously?

139
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
He Qiaoyan hasn't taken a stand?

140
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,520
Right.

141
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,150
Your father has

142
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,110
spread the message.

143
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,440
He shouldn't be so calm.

144
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,680
Heshi Group

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,800
is the whole world of He Qiaoyan.

146
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,270
He will compromise.

147
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,640
This time,

148
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,470
you asked your father

149
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,960
to make such a big movement,

150
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,310
in order to capture He.

151
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,150
In this case,

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
if he's still

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,310
that much into Qin Yiyue,

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,550
then he literally

155
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,760
look down his nose at

156
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,039
our family.

157
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,080
In the appreciation banquet tonight,

158
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,919
everyone in business connection

159
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,080
with my father

160
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,039
will be present.

161
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,640
I'll bring He Qiaoyan there,

162
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,799
and let him make a statement.

163
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,080
Good.

164
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
The German hospital

165
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,510
could be so supportive

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,640
to our project,

167
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,470
and offered to invite

168
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,550
all members of our research group

169
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,390
to their country,

170
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,190
which is much beyond my expectation.

171
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,720
We have reached an agreement that

172
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,150
you and

173
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,550
your two senior sister apprentice

174
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,840
can work there with me.

175
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,470
In due course,

176
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,080
when we are settled down,

177
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,510
I'll be busy working both at home and abroad,

178
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,430
and business in the German hospital

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,840
will be in charge of you three.

180
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,960
Sign the contract now,

181
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,800
and we will go to Germany soon.

182
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,720
Why is it so sudden?

183
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,640
It's said that Heshi Group

184
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,350
has Cooperation with the German hospital.

185
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,150
And Heshi gave us a strong recommendation.

186
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,800
Yiyue

187
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,840
before I was worried that

188
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,190
you may not able to work

189
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,920
after marriage.

190
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,110
Now it seems that

191
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,760
the He family treat you well.

192
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,270
You have to be there for a year,

193
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
which didn't trigger their opposition,

194
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,190
but won their supports.

195
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,310
I am so sorry.

196
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
I let all of you down.

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,110
I failed to introduce the bracelet

198
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,390
to European and American market as scheduled.

199
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,960
And now for various reasons,

200
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,150
the project was shelved,

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,390
leaving considerable products overstocked.

202
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,640
Later on,

203
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,510
the board will certainly

204
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,550
hold accountability.

205
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,640
But all of you here

206
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,550
have no need to be anxious.

207
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,470
Because the whole matter

208
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,960
and the subsequent consequences

209
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,110
will be shouldered

210
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,840
by myself.

211
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,880
I know exactly the significance

212
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,800
of the bracelet to you.

213
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,760
It represents the hard work of us.

214
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,390
I will never

215
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,350
give it up.

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
Even if the board of directors

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,390
depose me as

218
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,470
the Chief Executive Officer,

219
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,150
I will not give up or transfer

220
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,640
my shares.

221
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,470
Instead I will apply

222
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,040
to work in R&D Center

223
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,920
and forward the bracelet project.

224
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,510
It's the Clinic of Children's Psychology.

225
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,960
Miss Lin, you've grown up, right?

226
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,270
You may already know about

227
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,800
things happening between me and Qiao.

228
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,230
With all due respect,

229
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,510
you can never

230
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,150
win his heart

231
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,230
in this way.

232
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,880
I don't need his heart.

233
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,000
All I need is the person himself.

234
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,430
Specifically,

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
I just need

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
the position he represents,

237
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,800
CEO of Heshi Group,

238
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,470
the sole son of He family.

239
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,880
Linshi Group

240
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,110
has an appreciation banquet tonight.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,150
As long as he shows up,

242
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,600
I can have an account with my father,

243
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,550
no matter if he will marry me.

244
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,680
It's none of my business.

245
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
But you're the only one who can make him

246
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,040
show up there.

247
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,800
Miss Lin, you've come to a wrong person.

248
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,310
I'm not qualified or capable.

249
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,390
You are, and only you are.

250
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:51,390
At nine o'clock p.m.,

251
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,230
on the second floor of this hotel.

252
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,510
I know it's hard for you to do that.

253
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,840
But only in this way

254
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,110
can he give up

255
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,510
thoughts of you.

256
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,470
Once he makes it,

257
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,840
he can make a wise choice.

258
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,840
What he will face

259
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
in the following days,

260
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,110
is all up to you.

261
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,920
Come on.

262
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,270
Take some medicine.

263
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,190
Come on.

264
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,920
Ah, Get up, come on.

265
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,800
That's good.

266
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,080
Treating cold and having sauna,

267
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,040
I did both at once.

268
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,110
Can you tell me now

269
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,310
what's going on between you two?

270
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,760
He brought my mother and brother here

271
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,470
without informing me first.

272
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,960
Who is he to get involved in my family

273
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,350
and decide things for me?

274
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,110
It is his fault

275
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,800
to do this.

276
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,270
However,

277
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,470
It's not the first day you've known him.

278
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,080
You should know that he didn't mean to hurt you.

279
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,470
I know he meant no harm,

280
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,080
but he really hurt me.

281
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you doing?

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,040
Let me have a touch.

283
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,000
Touch of your heartbeat.

284
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,720
Dong dong, dong,

285
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,390
dong dong dong dong dong...

286
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,190
I've diagnosed it.

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,600
In your rage

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
hides a trace of anxiety;

289
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,840
in anxiety hides a trace of uneasiness;

290
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,800
in uneasiness,

291
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,350
hides a little bit doubt;

292
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,920
In doubt hides a trace of...

293
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,550
What is it?

294
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,190
Love.

295
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,430
How's it possible?

296
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,110
You are into Wengu.

297
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,270
Impossible.

298
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,550
What do you want to do?

299
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Make a phone call.

300
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
No.

301
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,680
I said it that

302
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm not going to call him.

303
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,800
I took an oath yesterday.

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,350
No.

305
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,800
See, see, see.

306
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,550
Did I say who I will call?

307
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,760
Qin Yiyue, you take advantage of a patient!

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,640
I've known you for such a long time,

309
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,720
and I never saw you

310
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
in such a big mood

311
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,190
in front of outsiders.

312
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,310
Anger signals concern.

313
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,230
Disappointment arises from expectations.

314
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,110
It's uneasy to meet someone you like so much.

315
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,600
Have a try, or you would never know.

316
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,510
Understand meï¼Ÿ

317
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,920
You're willing

318
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,720
to be bullied by Lin?

319
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,230
It's not bullying.

320
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,110
She came out on top,

321
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,920
and I should admit defeat.

322
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,310
Have you ever thought about

323
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,230
obedience.

324
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,150
Connected with Linshi,

325
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,430
you'll be a winged tiger.

326
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,430
Didn't you

327
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,550
brush your teeth today?

328
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,390
Fine, my mouth stinks.

329
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,150
Lin's move,

330
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:55,960
is disgusting.

331
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,840
I can never stand it.

332
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,190
But,

333
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,510
isn't Qin greatly touched?

334
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
What's in her mind,

335
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,880
I really don't know.

336
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,800
What are you doing?

337
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,080
Lie down.

338
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,920
Although you called me a douchebag,

339
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,470
I still answered your call.

340
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,390
How generous I am.

341
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,920
Ruowei is ill.

342
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,920
Yiyue

343
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,390
You, as Ruowe's boss,

344
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,110
whether or not

345
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:34,840
should come

346
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,880
to visit her?

347
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,390
You won't come?

348
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,390
OK, I see.

349
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,350
Pissed off?

350
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,000
Badly pissed off?

351
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,960
He will come.

352
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,880
Qin Yiyue, you are so annoying!

353
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,800
Does a boss have the duty

354
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,190
to take care of sick staff?

355
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,230
Of course.

356
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,270
Pseudo pure makeup, maiden makeup,

357
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,190
Red-lip makeup...

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,350
are all lame.

359
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,470
I'll show you

360
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,150
what patient makeup is.

361
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,310
Snot, snot, snot.

362
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,000
He's coming.

363
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,600
I drove him here.

364
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,190
Could you two please, leave us alone?

365
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,800
Or I can't play it well.

366
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,190
Let's go.

367
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,550
It seems that you are very ill.

368
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,550
I don't need your care.

369
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:34,800
What are you coming for?

370
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,230
I'm here to prove it to you that

371
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,720
I am a

372
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,350
magnanimous person.

373
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,430
No need to have psychological burden.

374
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,310
Have a good rest for recovery.

375
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,470
Although you call me a douchebag,

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,880
but

377
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,190
I'm not going to fire you.

378
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,430
Besides,

379
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,390
drinking hot ginger decoction

380
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,720
may cure a cold from wind.

381
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,510
I'll cook it for you.

382
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,430
You can make ginger decoction?

383
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,600
Slow down.

384
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,430
This is He.

385
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,640
Hello, Mr. He.

386
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,430
Just now Mr. Li's and Mr. Ou's assistant

387
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,190
called me,

388
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,550
saying tomorrow's meeting will be cancelled.

389
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,190
For what?

390
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,840
It may probably

391
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,150
for rumors about your

392
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,880
leaving the group.

393
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,230
I see.

394
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,310
Get in the car.

395
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,760
Are you really going to leave Heshi?

396
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,230
I just stepped down

397
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,270
as Chief Executive Officer.

398
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:40,880
In another position,

399
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,430
I'll still push forward the bracelet project.

400
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,960
That's nice,

401
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,230
for I can save more time

402
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,270
for you and Xiaobao.

403
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,800
You always said that

404
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,760
I was occupied with work

405
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,800
and ignored you.

406
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,840
Now I can make up lessons I missed.

407
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,550
Please, do me a favor.

408
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,640
I didn't expect that you can really cook this.

409
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Of course I can.

410
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,230
You thought I was kidding you?

411
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,880
Watch out.

412
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,430
It's burning hot.

413
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,430
And, tell you a secret.

414
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,430
My mother was worried

415
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,000
that I can't find a girlfriend when I grew up,

416
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,680
so

417
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
she wrote down

418
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,430
all methods

419
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,550
to coax girls.

420
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,350
So your mother told you

421
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,190
to make a girl's heart chill first

422
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,920
and then make ginger decoction to warm it

423
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,150
so that you can capture her.

424
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,680
Is it?

425
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,270
No, What's wrong with you recently?

426
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,430
You're acting like a hedgehog.

427
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,000
Get out.

428
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,310
Get out.

429
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,040
Yang Ruowei,

430
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,550
Cancel it.

431
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,640
What?

432
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,310
Release my hand.

433
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,720
Our bet, cancel it.

434
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,920
I don't want to bet anymore.

435
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,800
Why?

436
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,840
Because I found that

437
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,760
I'm kind of...

438
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,310
Alright!

439
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:15,600
No bet, alright.

440
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,470
Come here.

441
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,510
Assume that you lose.

442
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,760
You have to accept the defeat

443
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,550
and keep your word.

444
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,080
Get out.

445
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,840
Yang Ruo...

446
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,760
Yang Ruo...

447
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,080
Yang Ruowei.

448
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,800
Room 888 on the second floor,

449
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,310
you'll know when you get there.

450
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,800
Qiao Yan

451
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,310
don't you want to know

452
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,190
why Dr. Qin

453
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,190
ask you to come here?

454
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,390
The banquet hasn't started yet.

455
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,760
Let's have a rest here.

456
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,550
I have arrived.

457
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm going to study abroad.

458
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,230
It's tentatively one year.

459
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,110
If it goes well,

460
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,920
I will stay there and settle down.

461
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:27,960
You know,

462
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,760
it's my dream

463
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,080
to study in Germany.

464
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,760
You are my term

465
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,040
for qualification

466
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
of studying in Germany.

467
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,800
It doesn't make sense.

468
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,680
If you want to study abroad,

469
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,000
I can help you.

470
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,550
I can also take Xiaobao

471
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,760
to accompany you.

472
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,310
Forget it.

473
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm tired of dating you.

474
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,760
I don't want to live like this,

475
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,430
and I don't think it worthy.

476
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,840
I don't worth it,

477
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,800
or Xiaobao not?

478
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,350
Both of you.

479
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,840
So do I.

480
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,310
Thank you for your sacrifice to me.

481
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,040
And for the reason I broke up with you,

482
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,720
which you've been eager to know,

483
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,080
let me tell you.

484
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,110
The reason is,

485
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,390
my love for you

486
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,840
is not as much as you think.

487
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,430
That's it, bye.

488
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,880
On the appreciation banquet tonight,

489
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,230
you just need to show up

490
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,840
and take a stand.

491
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,720
It won't take you long time.

492
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,310
I know that I have no position

493
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,000
in your heart.

494
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,880
Don 't worry,

495
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,640
I won't push you too hard.

496
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,760
Lin Wei

497
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,470
You know I used to be like you.

498
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,390
To get something,

499
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,960
I used to do anything I can.

500
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,550
But now I know

501
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,720
what are the things

502
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,390
that truly worth guarding.

503
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,920
I'll offer to quit the job

504
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
on the meeting of the board.

505
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,510
You will renounce Heshi

506
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:48,720
just for her?

507
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,840
Right.

508
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,310
Unexpectedly that the president of Heshi,

509
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,270
He Qiaoyan

510
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,760
is such a childish person.

511
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
I know you.

512
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,640
Only real benefits

513
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,080
and success in career

514
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,270
can satisfy you continuously.

515
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,110
Qin Yiyue

516
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,230
is just a passer-by in your life

517
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:11,920
with freshness.

518
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,720
You don't know me at all.

519
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,390
She has given up on you.

520
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,760
Are you still going to be crazy for her?

521
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,040
Love

522
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,110
can make one lose all dignity, right?

523
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,760
That's between me and her.

524
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,310
It's none of your business.

525
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,720
Everything you own,

526
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,550
plus me and the whole Linshi Group,

527
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,000
fail to amount to her?

528
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,270
Right.

529
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,760
What are you up to?

530
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,190
Don't you say that

531
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,550
all over the world,

532
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,470
you only care about one woman,

533
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,600
Qin Yiyue.

534
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,960
I'd like to see,

535
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,080
if you have no feeling

536
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,190
toward anyone else.

537
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,600
Miss. Lin, please respect yourself.

538
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,640
Chill yourself.

539
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Medicine.

540
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,510
Hello.

541
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,110
Medicine, medicine.

542
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,080
Where are you?

543
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,760
Come and save me, hurry up.

544
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,040
Send me the address.

545
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,960
Are you all right?

546
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,680
Can you walk by yourself?

547
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,800
I cooked porridge.

548
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,230
Come out and have some,

549
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,960
after you changed your clothes.

550
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,840
Thank you.

551
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,190
Where are you going?

552
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:30,840
Let me bring you there.

553
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,880
Thanks, but...

554
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,230
Do you have a place to stay?

555
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,230
Well, I mean,

556
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,760
you came out with a cell phone only.

557
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,800
You have no ID card,

558
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,110
so you can't live in hotel.

559
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,390
But of course,

560
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,800
if you went to your friend's home,

561
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,600
that's okay.

562
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,840
I have no friends.

563
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,720
I don't know

564
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,080
what happened to you.

565
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,640
But you can stay in my home,

566
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
if you don't mind.

567
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,150
I can stay at the clinic these days.

568
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,680
Have some porridge while it's hot.

569
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,920
Have an early rest!

570
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,000
It's me.

571
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,040
Mr. He

572
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,550
You asked me to check

573
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,000
if something happened

574
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,350
over the golf course.

575
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,040
I found It.

576
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,390
What happened?

577
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,760
Surveillance shows

578
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,270
your wife Ms. He and Mr. Zhang

579
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,720
walked into an alley together.

580
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,760
Few minutes later,

581
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,430
they went out of the alley separately.

582
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,310
Is there

583
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,150
anything else?

584
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,470
Not yet.

585
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
Mr. Zhang has been hiding himself well.

586
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,550
There must be someone supporting him

587
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,680
in this city.

588
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,680
You are right in your analysis.

589
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,270
This person not only supports him,

590
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,430
and probably

591
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,760
he also knows me well.

592
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,920
So over the years,

593
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,310
I have not

594
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,510
found any clue.

595
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,110
From tomorrow,

596
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,800
check Ms. He

597
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,040
for me.

598
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,190
No problem.

599
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,000
Qiaoyan

600
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,430
Qiaoyan

601
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,920
I thought you were with Lin Wei.

602
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,760
Aunt

603
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,470
Why didn't you tell me that

604
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,600
you've been in touch with Mr. Zhang

605
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
in recent years.

606
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,880
What are you saying?

607
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,680
You were captured,

608
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,190
outside the stadium

609
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,190
the night you met him.

610
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,080
If it is related to him

611
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,350
that you are so strongly against

612
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
me being together with Yiyue?

613
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,720
If it is because she knows

614
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,800
the secret between you two

615
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,080
so that you threatened her

616
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,960
to break up with me?

617
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,390
I do have connection with him,

618
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,110
but it is normal

619
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,430
for he had worked in Heshi for so many years.

620
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,310
And the reason why she left you

621
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,310
is that she didn't want you

622
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,150
to be entangled in the past anymore.

623
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,880
No further investigation,

624
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,920
just for her sake, okay?

625
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,600
Qiaoyan

626
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Qiaoyan, no.

627
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,960
Qiaoyan

628
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,680
After all these years,

629
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,080
I found you finally.

630
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,960
Bastard!

631
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,150
The other way round, Mr. He.

632
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,600
You were the driver that day.

633
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,960
Shut up, you!
