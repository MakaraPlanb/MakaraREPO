Unforgettable Love
EP21

2
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:39,880
Mommy

3
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,190
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:51,310
Sit here.

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,229
Have a seat.

6
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:02,360
See what you want to eat.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,360
What's this for?

8
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,039
I have told you

9
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,080
we will have dinner together every day.

10
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,190
What's up?

11
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,880
Eat while it's hot.

12
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,960
I like eating it this way.

13
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,480
Any problem?

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
If you don't like my way,

15
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,630
you can go back,

16
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,960
and leave me and Xiaobao alone.

17
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,079
You eat first,

18
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,079
I need to take a call.

19
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,880
Mr. Rong

20
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,840
Qiao Yan

21
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
I have a terrible news for you.

22
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,630
I need to inform you that

23
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,400
our contract

24
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,750
can't be signed.

25
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,360
Why?

26
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,840
I was just informed from headquarters that

27
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,920
three days ago，

28
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,790
Linshi Group and our headquarters

29
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,360
signed a long-term contract.

30
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
And in China this contract

31
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,670
is exclusive.

32
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,190
In other words,

33
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,440
in China our company

34
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,360
is only allowed to cooperate with Linshi.

35
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,630
OK, I see.

36
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,750
Thanks.

37
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,630
Well, sorry for that.

38
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
You are born with a silver spoon,

39
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,790
so you may not have much feeling

40
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,880
for the problems of other families.

41
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
But don't be self-righteous

42
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,040
to interfere in others' lives.

43
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,959
Do not come here for no reason and disgust me!

44
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:30,040
Our relationship

45
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,440
is pure superior and subordinate.

46
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,560
What's in your mind?

47
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,560
I'm stupid.

48
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,750
No,

49
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm not stupid.

50
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,110
but you a douchebag.

51
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,670
Am I, Wen gu

52
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,520
a douchebag?

53
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,710
I am not a douchebag.

54
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,190
I'm not going to the party tonight,

55
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,960
and you guys have fun.

56
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,480
Besides,

57
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,440
Don't call me for

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
any party this month.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,310
And don't introduce

60
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,310
new girls to me.

61
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,480
They all look the same.

62
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,880
I don't want to play Linkup?

63
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
I got a girl in my mind.

64
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,480
It's not about a playboy becoming a good man.

65
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,750
but a good boy showing determination.

66
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,710
No eating in the office area.

67
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:49,840
One hour later,

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,440
all business departments come for meeting.

69
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,110
Assistant Yang had a fever,

70
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,040
and asked for leave today.

71
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,110
What, what happened？

72
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,310
Is that true?

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,920
Today our Boss comes to the office

74
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,790
at ten o'clock a.m.

75
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,880
Did I hear it wrong?

76
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,000
he said all the departments what?

77
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,110
He will preside over the meeting,

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,150
and let us

79
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,560
inform all business departments.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,520
Does he know the business scope

81
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,440
of our company?

82
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,360
Forget it, just forget it.

83
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,040
Inform them, inform!

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,040
Hurry up!

85
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,270
Get busy, get busy!

86
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,750
Xu, you came just in time

87
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,480
I checked the

88
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
financial report for the first half of the year.

89
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,440
Combined with market and industry trend,

90
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,230
our growth rate fell 12%

91
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,310
from that of last year.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
The company now

93
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,110
is in the important third stage of development,

94
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,110
but the benefits are not satisfactory.

95
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,520
In this case decision makers

96
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,630
need to make changes.

97
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,110
I'll make an appointment with the board of directors.

98
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,630
You come up with me.

99
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,110
No problem.

100
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,360
This quarter is the key to development.

101
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,880
From now on,

102
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,310
I will fix a daily process.

103
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,630
Before ten o'clock a.m.,

104
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,400
Make sure I receive

105
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,710
the executive report from middle managers.

106
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,920
and the handling process of key affairs.

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,480
In the noon,

108
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,110
I will discuss plans

109
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,270
with branches and agents.

110
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,880
Time for lunch break

111
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,110
can be utilized to deal with minor problems.

112
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,000
In the afternoon, we will take stock

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,840
of financial data of the day

114
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
as well as key projects.

115
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,150
And we will have a meeting with

116
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,840
core executive departments

117
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,560
By the way,

118
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,840
Before knocking off work,

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
ask the Department of Administration

120
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,710
to report the company's system.

121
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,960
It needs optimizing.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,590
One more thing,

123
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,230
sort out and bring me

124
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,360
a big channel data

125
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,310
for the last year.

126
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,840
Did Chairman Wen press you again?

127
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm not a toddler,

128
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,230
who need to be pushed

129
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,520
to walk.

130
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,310
I don't do something,

131
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,790
but it doesn't mean I can not do it.

132
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,360
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,670
Mr. Wen

134
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,750
This is the strategic cooperation agreement of products.

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,880
Please have a look when you are free.

136
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,670
OK.

137
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,150
Get to work.

138
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,150
Seriously?

139
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
He Qiaoyan hasn't taken a stand?

140
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:16,520
Right.

141
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,150
Your father has

142
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,110
spread the message.

143
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,440
He shouldn't be so calm.

144
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,680
Heshi Group

145
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,800
is the whole world of He Qiaoyan.

146
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,270
He will compromise.

147
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,640
This time,

148
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,470
you asked your father

149
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,960
to make such a big movement,

150
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,310
in order to capture He.

151
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,150
In this case,

152
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,600
if he's still

153
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,310
that much into Qin Yiyue,

154
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,550
then he literally

155
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,760
look down his nose at

156
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,039
our family.

157
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,080
In the appreciation banquet tonight,

158
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,919
everyone in business connection

159
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,080
with my father

160
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,039
will be present.

161
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,640
I'll bring He Qiaoyan there,

162
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,799
and let him make a statement.

163
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,080
Good.

164
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
The German hospital

165
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,510
could be so supportive

166
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,640
to our project,

167
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,470
and offered to invite

168
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,550
all members of our research group

169
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,390
to their country,

170
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,190
which is much beyond my expectation.

171
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,720
We have reached an agreement that

172
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,150
you and

173
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,550
your two senior sister apprentice

174
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,840
can work there with me.

175
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,470
In due course,

176
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,080
when we are settled down,

177
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,510
I'll be busy working both at home and abroad,

178
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,430
and business in the German hospital

179
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,840
will be in charge of you three.

180
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,960
Sign the contract now,

181
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,800
and we will go to Germany soon.

182
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,720
Why is it so sudden?

183
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,640
It's said that Heshi Group

184
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,350
has Cooperation with the German hospital.

185
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,150
And Heshi gave us a strong recommendation.

186
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,800
Yiyue

187
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,840
before I was worried that

188
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,190
you may not able to work

189
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,920
after marriage.

190
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,110
Now it seems that

191
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,760
the He family treat you well.

192
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,270
You have to be there for a year,

193
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,040
which didn't trigger their opposition,

194
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,190
but won their supports.

195
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,310
I am so sorry.

196
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,960
I let all of you down.

197
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,110
I failed to introduce the bracelet

198
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,390
to European and American market as scheduled.

199
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,960
And now for various reasons,

200
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,150
the project was shelved,

201
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,390
leaving considerable products overstocked.

202
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,640
Later on,

203
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,510
the board will certainly

204
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,550
hold accountability.

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
But all of you here

206
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,550
have no need to be anxious.

207
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,470
Because the whole matter

208
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,960
and the subsequent consequences

209
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,110
will be shouldered

210
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,840
by myself.

211
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,880
I know exactly the significance

212
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,800
of the bracelet to you.

213
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,760
It represents the hard work of us.

214
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,390
I will never

215
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,350
give it up.

216
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Even if the board of directors

217
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,390
depose me as

218
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,470
the Chief Executive Officer,

219
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,150
I will not give up or transfer

220
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,640
my shares.

221
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,470
Instead I will apply

222
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,040
to work in R&D Center

223
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,920
and forward the bracelet project.

224
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,510
It's the Clinic of Children's Psychology.

225
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,960
Miss Lin, you've grown up, right?

226
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,270
You may already know about

227
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,800
things happening between me and Qiao.

228
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,230
With all due respect,

229
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,510
you can never

230
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,150
win his heart

231
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,230
in this way.

232
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,880
I don't need his heart.

233
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,000
All I need is the person himself.

234
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,430
Specifically,

235
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
I just need

236
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,720
the position he represents,

237
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,800
CEO of Heshi Group,

238
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,470
the sole son of He family.

239
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,880
Linshi Group

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,110
has an appreciation banquet tonight.

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,150
As long as he shows up,

242
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,600
I can have an account with my father,

243
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,550
no matter if he will marry me.

244
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,680
It's none of my business.

245
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,080
But you're the only one who can make him

246
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,040
show up there.

247
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,800
Miss Lin, you've come to a wrong person.

248
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,310
I'm not qualified or capable.

249
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,390
You are, and only you are.

250
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,390
At nine o'clock p.m.,

251
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,230
on the second floor of this hotel.

252
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,510
I know it's hard for you to do that.

253
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,840
But only in this way

254
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,110
can he give up

255
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,510
thoughts of you.

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,470
Once he makes it,

257
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,840
he can make a wise choice.

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
What he will face

259
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
in the following days,

260
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,110
is all up to you.

261
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:25,920
Come on.

262
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,270
Take some medicine.

263
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,190
Come on.

264
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,920
Ah, Get up, come on.

265
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,800
That's good.

266
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,080
Treating cold and having sauna,

267
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,040
I did both at once.

268
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,110
Can you tell me now

269
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,310
what's going on between you two?

270
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,760
He brought my mother and brother here

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,470
without informing me first.

272
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,960
Who is he to get involved in my family

273
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,350
and decide things for me?

274
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,110
It is his fault

275
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,800
to do this.

276
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,270
However,

277
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,470
It's not the first day you've known him.

278
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,080
You should know that he didn't mean to hurt you.

279
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,470
I know he meant no harm,

280
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,080
but he really hurt me.

281
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you doing?

282
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,040
Let me have a touch.

283
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,000
Touch of your heartbeat.

284
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,720
Dong dong, dong,

285
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,390
dong dong dong dong dong...

286
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,190
I've diagnosed it.

287
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
In your rage

288
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,760
hides a trace of anxiety;

289
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,840
in anxiety hides a trace of uneasiness;

290
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,800
in uneasiness,

291
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,350
hides a little bit doubt;

292
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,920
In doubt hides a trace of...

293
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,550
What is it?

294
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,190
Love.

295
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,430
How's it possible?

296
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,110
You are into Wengu.

297
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,270
Impossible.

298
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,550
What do you want to do?

299
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,190
Make a phone call.

300
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,800
No.

301
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,680
I said it that

302
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
I'm not going to call him.

303
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,800
I took an oath yesterday.

304
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,350
No.

305
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,800
See, see, see.

306
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,550
Did I say who I will call?

307
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,760
Qin Yiyue, you take advantage of a patient!

308
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,640
I've known you for such a long time,

309
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,720
and I never saw you

310
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,760
in such a big mood

311
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,190
in front of outsiders.

312
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:26,310
Anger signals concern.

313
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,230
Disappointment arises from expectations.

314
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,110
It's uneasy to meet someone you like so much.

315
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,600
Have a try, or you would never know.

316
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,510
Understand me？

317
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,920
You're willing

318
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,720
to be bullied by Lin?

319
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,230
It's not bullying.

320
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,110
She came out on top,

321
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,920
and I should admit defeat.

322
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,310
Have you ever thought about

323
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,230
obedience.

324
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,150
Connected with Linshi,

325
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,430
you'll be a winged tiger.

326
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,430
Didn't you

327
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,550
brush your teeth today?

328
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,390
Fine, my mouth stinks.

329
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,150
Lin's move,

330
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,960
is disgusting.

331
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,840
I can never stand it.

332
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,190
But,

333
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,510
isn't Qin greatly touched?

334
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,920
What's in her mind,

335
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,880
I really don't know.

336
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
What are you doing?

337
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,080
Lie down.

338
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,920
Although you called me a douchebag,

339
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,470
I still answered your call.

340
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,390
How generous I am.

341
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,920
Ruowei is ill.

342
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,920
Yiyue

343
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,390
You, as Ruowe's boss,

344
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,110
whether or not

345
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,840
should come

346
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,880
to visit her?

347
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,390
You won't come?

348
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,390
OK, I see.

349
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,350
Pissed off?

350
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,000
Badly pissed off?

351
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,960
He will come.

352
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,880
Qin Yiyue, you are so annoying!

353
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,800
Does a boss have the duty

354
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:17,190
to take care of sick staff?

355
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,230
Of course.

356
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,270
Pseudo pure makeup, maiden makeup,

357
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,190
Red-lip makeup...

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,350
are all lame.

359
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,470
I'll show you

360
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,150
what patient makeup is.

361
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,310
Snot, snot, snot.

362
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,000
He's coming.

363
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I drove him here.

364
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,190
Could you two please, leave us alone?

365
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,800
Or I can't play it well.

366
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,190
Let's go.

367
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,550
It seems that you are very ill.

368
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,550
I don't need your care.

369
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,800
What are you coming for?

370
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm here to prove it to you that

371
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,720
I am a

372
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,350
magnanimous person.

373
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,430
No need to have psychological burden.

374
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,310
Have a good rest for recovery.

375
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,470
Although you call me a douchebag,

376
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
but

377
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,190
I'm not going to fire you.

378
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,430
Besides,

379
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,390
drinking hot ginger decoction

380
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,720
may cure a cold from wind.

381
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,510
I'll cook it for you.

382
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,430
You can make ginger decoction?

383
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Slow down.

384
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,430
This is He.

385
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,640
Hello, Mr. He.

386
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,430
Just now Mr. Li's and Mr. Ou's assistant

387
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,190
called me,

388
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,550
saying tomorrow's meeting will be cancelled.

389
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,190
For what?

390
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,840
It may probably

391
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,150
for rumors about your

392
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,880
leaving the group.

393
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,230
I see.

394
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,310
Get in the car.

395
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,760
Are you really going to leave Heshi?

396
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,230
I just stepped down

397
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,270
as Chief Executive Officer.

398
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:48,880
In another position,

399
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,430
I'll still push forward the bracelet project.

400
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:51,960
That's nice,

401
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,230
for I can save more time

402
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,270
for you and Xiaobao.

403
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,800
You always said that

404
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,760
I was occupied with work

405
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,800
and ignored you.

406
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,840
Now I can make up lessons I missed.

407
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,550
Please, do me a favor.

408
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,640
I didn't expect that you can really cook this.

409
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Of course I can.

410
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,230
You thought I was kidding you?

411
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Watch out.

412
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,430
It's burning hot.

413
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,430
And, tell you a secret.

414
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,430
My mother was worried

415
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,000
that I can't find a girlfriend when I grew up,

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,680
so

417
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,680
she wrote down

418
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,430
all methods

419
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,550
to coax girls.

420
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,350
So your mother told you

421
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,190
to make a girl's heart chill first

422
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,920
and then make ginger decoction to warm it

423
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,150
so that you can capture her.

424
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,680
Is it?

425
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,270
No, What's wrong with you recently?

426
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,430
You're acting like a hedgehog.

427
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,000
Get out.

428
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,310
Get out.

429
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,040
Yang Ruowei,

430
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,550
Cancel it.

431
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,640
What?

432
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,310
Release my hand.

433
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,720
Our bet, cancel it.

434
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't want to bet anymore.

435
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,800
Why?

436
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,840
Because I found that

437
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm kind of...

438
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,310
Alright!

439
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,600
No bet, alright.

440
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,470
Come here.

441
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,510
Assume that you lose.

442
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,760
You have to accept the defeat

443
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,550
and keep your word.

444
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,080
Get out.

445
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,840
Yang Ruo...

446
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,760
Yang Ruo...

447
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,080
Yang Ruowei.

448
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,800
Room 888 on the second floor,

449
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,310
you'll know when you get there.

450
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,800
Qiao Yan

451
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,310
don't you want to know

452
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,190
why Dr. Qin

453
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,190
ask you to come here?

454
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,390
The banquet hasn't started yet.

455
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,760
Let's have a rest here.

456
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,550
I have arrived.

457
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm going to study abroad.

458
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,230
It's tentatively one year.

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,110
If it goes well,

460
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,920
I will stay there and settle down.

461
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,960
You know,

462
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,760
it's my dream

463
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,080
to study in Germany.

464
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,760
You are my term

465
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,040
for qualification

466
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
of studying in Germany.

467
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,800
It doesn't make sense.

468
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,680
If you want to study abroad,

469
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,000
I can help you.

470
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,550
I can also take Xiaobao

471
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,760
to accompany you.

472
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,310
Forget it.

473
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm tired of dating you.

474
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,760
I don't want to live like this,

475
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,430
and I don't think it worthy.

476
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,840
I don't worth it,

477
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,800
or Xiaobao not?

478
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,350
Both of you.

479
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,840
So do I.

480
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,310
Thank you for your sacrifice to me.

481
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,040
And for the reason I broke up with you,

482
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,720
which you've been eager to know,

483
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
let me tell you.

484
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,110
The reason is,

485
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,390
my love for you

486
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,840
is not as much as you think.

487
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,430
That's it, bye.

488
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,880
On the appreciation banquet tonight,

489
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,230
you just need to show up

490
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
and take a stand.

491
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,720
It won't take you long time.

492
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,310
I know that I have no position

493
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,000
in your heart.

494
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,880
Don 't worry,

495
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,640
I won't push you too hard.

496
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,760
Lin Wei

497
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,470
You know I used to be like you.

498
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,390
To get something,

499
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,960
I used to do anything I can.

500
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,550
But now I know

501
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,720
what are the things

502
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,390
that truly worth guarding.

503
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,920
I'll offer to quit the job

504
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
on the meeting of the board.

505
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,510
You will renounce Heshi

506
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,720
just for her?

507
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,840
Right.

508
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,310
Unexpectedly that the president of Heshi,

509
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,270
He Qiaoyan

510
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,760
is such a childish person.

511
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I know you.

512
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,640
Only real benefits

513
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,080
and success in career

514
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,270
can satisfy you continuously.

515
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,110
Qin Yiyue

516
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,230
is just a passer-by in your life

517
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,920
with freshness.

518
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,720
You don't know me at all.

519
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,390
She has given up on you.

520
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,760
Are you still going to be crazy for her?

521
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,040
Love

522
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,110
can make one lose all dignity, right?

523
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,760
That's between me and her.

524
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,310
It's none of your business.

525
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,720
Everything you own,

526
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,550
plus me and the whole Linshi Group,

527
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,000
fail to amount to her?

528
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,270
Right.

529
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,760
What are you up to?

530
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,190
Don't you say that

531
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,550
all over the world,

532
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,470
you only care about one woman,

533
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,600
Qin Yiyue.

534
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,960
I'd like to see,

535
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,080
if you have no feeling

536
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,190
toward anyone else.

537
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,600
Miss. Lin, please respect yourself.

538
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,640
Chill yourself.

539
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Medicine.

540
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,510
Hello.

541
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,110
Medicine, medicine.

542
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,080
Where are you?

543
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,760
Come and save me, hurry up.

544
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,040
Send me the address.

545
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,960
Are you all right?

546
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,680
Can you walk by yourself?

547
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,800
I cooked porridge.

548
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,230
Come out and have some,

549
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,960
after you changed your clothes.

550
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
Thank you.

551
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,190
Where are you going?

552
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:38,840
Let me bring you there.

553
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,880
Thanks, but...

554
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,230
Do you have a place to stay?

555
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,230
Well, I mean,

556
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,760
you came out with a cell phone only.

557
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,800
You have no ID card,

558
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,110
so you can't live in hotel.

559
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,390
But of course,

560
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,800
if you went to your friend's home,

561
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,600
that's okay.

562
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,840
I have no friends.

563
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,720
I don't know

564
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,080
what happened to you.

565
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,640
But you can stay in my home,

566
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
if you don't mind.

567
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,150
I can stay at the clinic these days.

568
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,680
Have some porridge while it's hot.

569
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,920
Have an early rest!

570
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,000
It's me.

571
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,040
Mr. He

572
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,550
You asked me to check

573
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,000
if something happened

574
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,350
over the golf course.

575
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,040
I found It.

576
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,390
What happened?

577
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,760
Surveillance shows

578
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,270
your wife Ms. He and Mr. Zhang

579
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,720
walked into an alley together.

580
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
Few minutes later,

581
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,430
they went out of the alley separately.

582
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,310
Is there

583
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,150
anything else?

584
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,470
Not yet.

585
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,600
Mr. Zhang has been hiding himself well.

586
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,550
There must be someone supporting him

587
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,680
in this city.

588
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,680
You are right in your analysis.

589
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,270
This person not only supports him,

590
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,430
and probably

591
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,760
he also knows me well.

592
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,920
So over the years,

593
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,310
I have not

594
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,510
found any clue.

595
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,110
From tomorrow,

596
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,800
check Ms. He

597
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,040
for me.

598
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,190
No problem.

599
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,000
Qiaoyan

600
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,430
Qiaoyan

601
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,920
I thought you were with Lin Wei.

602
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,760
Aunt

603
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,470
Why didn't you tell me that

604
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,600
you've been in touch with Mr. Zhang

605
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
in recent years.

606
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,880
What are you saying?

607
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,680
You were captured,

608
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,190
outside the stadium

609
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,190
the night you met him.

610
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,080
If it is related to him

611
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,350
that you are so strongly against

612
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,600
me being together with Yiyue?

613
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,720
If it is because she knows

614
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,800
the secret between you two

615
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,080
so that you threatened her

616
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,960
to break up with me?

617
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,390
I do have connection with him,

618
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,110
but it is normal

619
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,430
for he had worked in Heshi for so many years.

620
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,310
And the reason why she left you

621
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,310
is that she didn't want you

622
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,150
to be entangled in the past anymore.

623
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,880
No further investigation,

624
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,920
just for her sake, okay?

625
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,600
Qiaoyan

626
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Qiaoyan, no.

627
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,960
Qiaoyan

628
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,680
After all these years,

629
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
I found you finally.

630
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,960
Bastard!

631
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,150
The other way round, Mr. He.

632
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,600
You were the driver that day.

633
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,960
Shut up, you!
