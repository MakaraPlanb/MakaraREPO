[Unforgettable Love]

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,070
Go.

4
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:07,920
What?

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,400
Hurry up!

6
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,510
How dare you sneak pictures!

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,000
-Mr. Jia.
 -Mr. Jia.

8
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,580
Yiyue, let him go.

9
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,100
What are you doing?

10
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,270
This way, please.

11
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,100
Mr. Jia refused to cooperate with He's Group.

12
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,700
The cooperation with Mr. Jia

13
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,020
is a crucial step to

14
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,430
promote bands.

15
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,060
For this cooperation,

16
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,060
He Qiaoyan has been busy

17
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,310
for over half a month.

18
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,790
I'm so sorry.

19
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,310
I never expected

20
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,540
it would happen.

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,020
We had had an appointment with Mr. Jia

22
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,660
at 10 a.m. last Monday.

23
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,350
But because Qiaoyan was

24
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,500
concerned about your father's surgery,

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,220
the meeting was canceled.

26
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,350
Then, Qiaoyan

27
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,660
made lots of efforts to persuade Mr. Jia

28
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,540
to give us another chance to meet.

29
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,700
But again, you...

30
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,500
Qin Yiyue, don't you think

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,579
you've always been making Qiaoyan

32
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,750
a lot of trouble?

33
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,140
I know you're not a real couple,

34
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,020
but merely a contractual one.

35
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,540
How did you know?

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,579
Never mind how I knew it.

37
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,350
I had wanted to give you

38
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,870
more time for this show,

39
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,220
but right now, you've

40
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,180
severely affected Qiaoyan's work.

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,180
I just can't ignore it.

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,310
Even if we're in a contractual relationship,

43
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,020
that's our own business.

44
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,910
Stop deceiving yourself.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,310
You clearly know

46
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,830
my relationship with Qiaoyan.

47
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,580
We have an engagement.

48
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,830
He has told me that your baby engagement

49
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,140
is just a joke.

50
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,790
It's a business of the two families.

51
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,540
Whether it's a joke or not

52
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,430
can't be defined by He Qiaoyan.

53
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,790
Besides, for Qiaoyan, He's Group

54
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,100
is more important than anything.

55
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
Do you think

56
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,829
you can compete with the whole He family?

57
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,140
Besides, I can help Qiaoyan run He's Group.

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,829
Can you do it?

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,020
Keep it real,

60
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,390
you are from totally different classes.

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,480
[Ep16]

62
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,660
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,500
All right, I'll drive you home.

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,140
No, thanks.

65
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,100
I can go back by myself.

66
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,750
How can you go back by yourself in this?

67
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,700
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

68
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,350
What were you thinking when

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,620
you dressed yourself like that?

70
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,700
Let me drive her back.

71
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,310
Did you come here with him?

72
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,310
I'll take her home.

73
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,220
Let's go, Yiyue.

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,950
I'll go now.

75
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,700
What happened?

76
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,020
I want to drink.

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,750
Had a quarrel?

78
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,750
No.

79
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,140
It's just...

80
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,500
I did something wrong.

81
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,830
If you do, just apologize.

82
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,830
If you don't speak up,

83
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,220
nothing will be solved.

84
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,390
Ning Fang,

85
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,790
Do you know that feeling?

86
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:11,500
It's like God suddenly knocking my head,

87
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,470
to make me realize

88
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,100
all the precious things I thought I owned

89
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,910
are nothing but an illusion.

90
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,500
They'll be taken back at twelve o'clock

91
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,790
to their original owner.

92
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,750
You little fool, you are the best.

93
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,470
No one can take them away.

94
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,909
I'm not pretty nor good.

95
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,310
I can only affect his work

96
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,350
and hold him back.

97
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,990
I...

98
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,180
What are they doing here?

99
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,060
My brother must be cheated, isn't he?

100
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,750
I must tell him now.

101
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,830
Bro, what's the matter with you?

102
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,700
How can you allow Yiyue

103
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,060
to drink with another man?

104
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:20,990
Did she drink?

105
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,390
You've offended her, haven't you?

106
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,310
Where is she?

107
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,500
Inside.

108
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,350
Why are you here?

109
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,500
Isn't it time for you to go?

110
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,830
Ning Fang.

111
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,870
No matter what happens,

112
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,830
I'll make it clear.

113
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,180
Wait for me outside.

114
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,390
You must be Dr. Ning Fang, right?

115
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,500
I've heard of you from Ruowei.

116
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,390
Go, go, go.

117
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,060
I haven't formally introduced myself.

118
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm Wen Gu.

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,060
Ruowei's boss.

120
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,020
Go home.

121
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,630
Go home?

122
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,590
Go home with me.

123
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,790
Back to our home.

124
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,340
Qiaoyan, where are you?

125
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,870
Since it doesn't work with Mr. Jia,

126
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,950
we have to quickly figure out Plan B.

127
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,550
OK, I see.

128
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,630
Don't be silly,

129
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll take you home first.

130
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,710
There's another meeting in the evening.

131
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,910
He Qiaoyan, I have no reason to stand by your side.

132
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,460
What do you mean?

133
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:39,950
Let's

134
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,180
terminate the contract.

135
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,510
Terminate the contract?

136
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,630
Why do you want to do that?

137
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,020
The validity of our contract lasts for one year.

138
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,790
There's still much time left.

139
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,140
Xiaobao, he...

140
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,870
he's been able to go to school without crying.

141
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,140
His language ability

142
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,550
is also recovering.

143
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,950
He no longer needs my all-time companionship.

144
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,670
I want to devote more energy and time

145
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,870
to my own career.

146
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,380
And I don't want to affect your work anymore.

147
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,300
I think what you need to do now is to calm down.

148
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,020
I'll give you two weeks.

149
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,630
Two-week paid vacation.

150
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,020
It's me who cannot uphold the principle

151
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,220
to be a fake couple with you.

152
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,420
A fake couple?

153
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,710
I'm telling you the last time:

154
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,060
go home with me.

155
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,420
I've told you, terminate the contract.

Sit down.

What on earth can't I let go of?

163
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,420
Do you mean

164
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,750
I can't let go of the mansion or limousine?

165
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,460
I'm not superficial, OK?

166
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,710
Am I that kind of superficial person?

167
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,340
Let me tell you,

168
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,910
what I can't let go of is Xiaobao.

169
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,060
Xiaobao and I are good mates forever.

170
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,990
What?

171
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,710
Did you say I can't let go is He Qiaoyan?

172
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,990
You are the one who can't let him go, OK?

173
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,790
He's as cheap as you.

174
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,950
I won't even pay a dime to buy him!

175
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,630
Turn the light off and go to bed!

176
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,990
It's already midnight,

177
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,420
and what are you doing again at my house?

178
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,910
Well, eat melons.

179
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,750
Eat melons for what?

180
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,300
Fruit contains too much sugar.

181
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,590
It's not for bedtime.

182
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,220
Come on,

183
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,910
why did Yiyue burst into temper?

184
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,990
Is she cheating on you?

185
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,380
Do you think everyone else is like you?

186
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,260
You bastard!

187
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,870
I came here to comfort you,

188
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,260
but you are doing nothing but attacking me.

189
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,180
Or it's because of Lin Wei.

190
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,420
It has nothing to do with Lin Wei.

191
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,830
You and Lin Wei

192
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,260
once had a baby engagement.

193
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,510
About that, I've explained it to Yiyue.

194
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,870
I've told her

195
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,380
those were just nonsense from the elders,

196
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,550
so don't take it seriously.

197
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:21,950
I'm so relieved then.

198
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,220
Relieved? Why?

199
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,060
Neither Yiyue nor you cheated.

200
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,990
What's left is not a big deal.

201
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,380
Women, women.

202
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
Find out the cause and remedy the problem.

203
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,510
It's so easy to coax women.

204
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,830
Yiyue, what's going on?

205
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,670
Haven't I told you to declare sovereignty?

206
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,420
How come it was flipped around?

207
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,990
Good news travels slowly;

208
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,710
bad news has wings.

209
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,060
He Qiaoyan also agreed with it?

210
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,180
Maybe he also realized it.

211
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,420
Since Lin Wei came back,

212
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,870
I am becoming unnecessary.

213
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,180
Come on in.

214
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,510
Mr. He,

215
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,670
this is Pediatric Psychology Consulting Room.

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,300
Of course I know.

217
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,990
Tell me, why do you want to leave?

218
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,020
I've finished my work!

219
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:44,340
Besides, for my career,

220
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,910
I have a clearer vision and higher pursuit.

221
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,380
I want to do something extraordinary out there.

222
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,790
OK, I see.

223
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,750
But I hope these are not your excuses.

224
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,990
The title of Mrs. He is no longer what I want.

225
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,260
Pretending to be in love every day

226
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,990
is just driving me crazy!

227
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,670
And there are so many people who like you.

228
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,140
So I don't want to be regarded as

229
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,630
the one squatting on a toilet without...

230
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,100
What did you call me?

231
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,020
A toilet.

232
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,990
Squatting for a long time

233
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,300
would easily numb my legs.

234
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,020
So I'll leave it to others in the queue.

235
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,950
Let's put it this way,

236
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,510
I disagree.

237
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,990
Why?

238
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,180
The contract has made it clear.

239
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,300
Stage three,

240
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,420
Party B should, within the term of the Contract,

241
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,510
help Xiaobao successfully enter the primary school

242
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,380
and adapt to social life.

243
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,100
Yes, I'm doing fine.

244
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,340
Xiaobao is now gradually

245
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,180
adapting to school life.

246
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,670
And he's getting along with kids

247
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,060
without any discomfort.

248
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,630
I think I have finished the work successfully.

249
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,140
It seems that Dr. Qin isn't fully aware of

250
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,910
the definition of social life.

251
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,420
It seems I need to popularize to you

252
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,220
what social life is.

253
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,670
Social life is linked by social relations,

254
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,180
which means building relationships with others.

255
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,550
In the field of psychology,

256
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,950
"interpersonal relationship"

257
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,220
refers to the direct psychological

258
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,460
connection among individuals.

259
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,630
In terms of that,

260
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,060
Xiaobao hasn't achieved it yet.

261
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,870
In simple words,

262
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,300
Xiaobao just peacefully

263
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,910
entered the social environment,

264
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,300
but didn't let down his defense

265
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,590
to make friends with others.

266
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,950
Mr. He,

267
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,340
are you educating a professional

268
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,380
about their profession?

269
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,630
It seems that Dr. Qin also agrees with me.

270
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,590
I, He Qiaoyan,

271
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,300
never fail in business.

272
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,340
How about that: as long as you help Poppet

273
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,510
find a friend,

274
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,460
I'll deem all your work as done completely.

275
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
With the contract void and debts cleared,

276
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,220
you'll be free at that time.

277
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,339
What are we doing here?

278
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:09,829
Meeting parents.

279
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,220
Of course I'm a parent.

280
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,220
I mean,

281
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,020
meeting parents for what?

282
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,099
It's just a casual meeting.

283
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,020
What were you thinking about?

284
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,790
Poppet,

285
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,060
This is...

286
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,460
Guoguo.

287
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,420
Hello, Guoguo.

288
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,910
Hello, Uncle...

289
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,550
Uncle?

290
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,260
Brother.

291
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,950
My name is Cheng Guoguo.

292
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,420
I'm six years old.

293
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,460
I'm an Aries; my blood type is A,

294
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,020
and I live in Xinyang District.

295
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,550
I like painting and dancing.

296
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,830
I serve as the art commissary in the class.

297
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,140
Xiaobao and I have fun all the time.

298
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,910
He takes care of me and helps me,

299
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,990
and he can do the magic of physics.

300
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,460
I really like playing with him.

301
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
Okay.

302
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,870
Now that we're here,

303
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,420
if no one opposes,

304
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,260
we'll make an exchange.

305
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,180
Dr. Qin, they are just children.

306
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,140
Don't mess around.

307
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,340
Exchange friend cards.

308
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,790
Friend cards?

309
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,460
Now we can exchange hugs!

310
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,670
Xiaobao, you've done a good job!

311
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,380
Guoguo,

312
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,670
thank you for being good friends with Xiaobao.

313
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,510
The little skirt you are wearing today

314
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,790
is so beautiful!

315
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,180
I love it!

316
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:06,950
From now on,

317
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,830
You can play with toys.

318
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,420
What's going on with them?

319
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,180
To help Xiaobao,

320
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,750
I made a set of friend cards

321
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,340
to encourage him to make friends in this way.

322
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,630
It was a one-week

323
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,670
challenge of making friends.

324
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,220
Unexpectedly, he succeeded.

325
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,910
By the way,

326
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,830
just now, did Xiaobao say Guoguo's name?

327
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,420
Yeah.

328
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,670
Now he's able to say other names except for "Mom"?

329
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,060
When he encounters a special situation,

330
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,550
or when he meets someone he likes,

331
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,380
he can use very simple expressions.

332
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,380
So far,

333
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,420
the upper limit I've heard is five words.

334
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,990
Then why does he

335
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,670
still need to use cards or

336
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,550
a word-pad in front of me?

337
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,180
That means you should keep going.

338
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,630
After my departure, he'll only rely on you.

339
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,420
Come on, "Daddy"!

340
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,260
All right, I'm leaving.

341
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,790
Let me give you a ride.

342
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,100
No, thanks.

343
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,510
I'll find another time

344
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:37,870
to come back and pack up.

345
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,860
You've really made up your mind
 to terminate the contract.

346
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,550
Our contract is temporary in the first place.

347
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,790
No matter it's sooner or later,

348
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,140
all of it will be terminated eventually.

349
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,910
Even if it's terminated,

350
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:53,750
we can still sign a new one.

351
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,300
The workload and working hours

352
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,460
will depend on your needs.

353
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,550
In addition,

354
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,750
benefits and the salary can be doubled.

355
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,060
It has nothing to do with money.

356
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,100
It's out of my career plan.

357
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:06,260
Fine.

358
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,220
If you have a higher career pursuit,

359
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
I can arrange a specialized

360
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,460
scientific research laboratory

361
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,300
and the best researchers.

362
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,870
You can do any research you want.

363
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,550
Thank you,

364
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,420
but that's not what I really need.

365
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,340
You should find a chance to explain it to Poppet.

366
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,630
And I should end

367
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,910
this ridiculous experience to start my own life.

368
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,060
Do you think this period

369
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
has been ridiculous?

370
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,990
Don't distort what I mean.

371
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,100
In a few days,

372
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,590
Xiaobao' school will hold a Parent-Child Day.

373
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,630
I'll accompany him to take part in the activity.

374
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,300
After this,

375
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,260
our contract will be completely terminated.

376
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,510
Here you are.

377
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,990
OK.

378
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,750
You can leave now.

379
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:36,440
♫All those mornings, laughing in bed♫

380
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:44,780
♫I thought laughter can get us far♫

381
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,460
♫It must be a dream♫

382
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:52,330
♫The man I used to hug, where is he now♫

383
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:01,030
♫The sun just rose, and I'm waiting in tears♫

384
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,590
I'm so sorry that Qianyan and you have to

385
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,420
make do with a restaurant near He's Group.

386
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,830
I do apologize for your inconvenience.

387
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,100
It's OK.

388
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,670
I know Qiaoyan is busy.

389
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,220
Young people should focus on the career.

390
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,420
All these years, the prosperity of He's Group

391
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,260
is thanks to Qiaoyan.

392
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,100
He's Group is really

393
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,180
striding forward year by year.

394
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,460
Wei is excellent, too.

395
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,060
Young as she is,

396
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,750
she's a famous designer already.

397
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,870
It's just her hobby,

398
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,990
and also her part-time job.

399
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,220
In the future,

400
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,220
she will eventually focus on the family business.

401
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,100
Aunt, Mrs. Lin.

402
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,830
There will be a meeting later.

403
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,710
I need to go first.

404
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,420
Enjoy yourselves.

405
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,260
Wait a minute.

406
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,790
We haven't mentioned the most important thing.

407
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,510
Qiaoyan,

408
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,950
both you and Wei are not kids anymore.

409
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,750
So you should discuss the time to get married.

410
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,020
Get married?

411
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,870
Qiaoyan, we all know that

412
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,020
you've always wanted to

413
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,510
run He's Group well at first,

414
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,830
but marrying Wei won't affect your plan.

415
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,100
It will help you, instead.

416
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,670
Wei is such a diligent girl.

417
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,420
Aunt, you must be aware that I won't

418
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,220
marry for the family interest.

419
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,340
Qiaoyan, you are very smart.

420
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,220
You should know that the marriage between

421
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,140
the Lin and He families means a lot to He's Group.

422
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,300
Of course I know,

423
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,100
but I won't sacrifice myself for the business.

424
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,750
Excuse me.

425
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,910
Excuse me for a minute.

426
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,510
As for Dr. Qin's personal information,

427
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,060
I looked through it again.

428
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,910
Anything special?

429
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,670
We looked up all Qin Yiyue's

430
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,670
experiences from birth till now,

431
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,870
as well as her social relations.

432
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,870
She was born in a working-class family.

433
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,670
From childhood till now,
 she is well-behaved and excellent.

434
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,710
There's only one doubt in her experience.

435
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,870
When Qin Yiyue was in the university,

436
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,020
she wanted to be a surgeon.

437
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,670
But then,

438
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:25,020
she abruptly changed her major to psychology.

439
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,260
Why?

440
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,180
According to her teacher,

441
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,830
it's because Qin Yiyue saved a child in a car accident,

442
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,380
and got her hand injured.

443
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,550
A car accident?

444
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,100
When?

445
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,460
On the same day as Xiaobao's car accident.

446
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,870
Where was it?

447
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,950
It was probably on Huanshan Road.

448
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,550
Xiaobao's car accident

449
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,830
also occurred on Huanshan Road.

450
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,300
Qin Yiyue might be that person.

451
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,420
That's why Xiaobao has a special affection for her.

452
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,750
Does Qin Yiyue know the truth of the accident?

453
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,060
Mommy.

454
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,100
Your Mommy's not here.

455
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:19,990
Mommy.

456
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,260
Told you, Mommy's not here.

457
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,990
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy...

458
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,300
Can't you say something else?

459
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:33,830
Xiaobao!

460
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,550
Mommy!

461
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,060
Xiaobao!

462
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,910
Xiaobao, mommy is here today

463
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,910
to prepare for the show with you

464
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,060
for Parent-Child Day.

465
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,260
So, do you have anything

466
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,340
to show to your classmates and teachers?

467
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,830
I'm here to help Xiaobao

468
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:08,910
prepare for his performance

469
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,830
on Parent-Child Day.

470
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,260
I...

471
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,140
I know you're busy,

472
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,300
don't worry.

473
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,460
When I rehearse with Xiaobao,

474
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,790
I'll give you a simple role.

475
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,710
You just need to practice

476
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,710
right before the performance.

477
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,460
♫Blows the wind, shines the moon♫

478
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,630
♫Where is the boat floating to ♫

479
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:40,550
♫Take the long journey with me ♫

480
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,630
♫Blows the wind, shines the moon ♫

481
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,790
♫Where is the boat floating to ♫

482
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,710
♫Take the long journey with me ♫

483
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,020
Secretary Zhong,

484
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,020
Mr. Jia asked me to discuss

485
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,750
the band face to face tomorrow.

486
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,590
Well,

487
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,910
send all materials about the band to me.

488
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,990
All of them.

489
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,170
I'll have further discussions

490
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,140
on your improvement plan with my colleagues

491
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,060
in the R&D Department.

492
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,990
Although there's some difficulty,

493
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,180
it's not impossible.

494
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,630
Excellent!

495
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,630
As soon as your samples are produced,

496
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,180
we can sign the contract right away.

497
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,670
I'm looking forward to your good news.

498
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,630
No problem.

499
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,020
Well then, I'll go now.

500
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,870
There are other arrangements.

501
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,630
Mr. Jia, wait a minute.

502
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,790
May I ask what changed your mind?

503
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,060
Well, I didn't change my mind all of a sudden.

504
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,990
Actually, I've always been

505
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,790
very interested in your band.

506
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,990
But last time...

507
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,750
Last time...

508
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,750
Last time, Yiyue didn't mean it.

509
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,710
No, no, no, you misunderstood me.

510
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,550
Refusing to cooperate with you last time

511
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,340
had nothing to do with Miss Qin.

512
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,710
It was because you and Miss Lin

513
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,710
kept talking about data.

514
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,060
In the end, I just couldn't stand it.

515
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,750
Maybe you don't know much about me.

516
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,420
In the business,

517
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,830
what I value most is the user experience of products,

518
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,460
instead of something like data.

519
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,790
Mr. Jia, you are right.

520
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,380
Now it's because...

521
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,910
Thanks to Miss Qin,

522
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,870
I'm here to meet with you today.

523
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,100
The day before yesterday, she managed to find me.

524
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,380
She convinced me.

525
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,790
How can you go back by yourself in this?

526
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,670
Do you want to beat a pervert again?

527
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,510
If any other accident happens today,

528
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,590
how can you deal with it, Yiyue?

529
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:32,870
Poppet,

530
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,460
I've recorded the song in it in advance.

531
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,220
You can

532
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,590
just listen to the song in it.

533
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,870
Get familiar with it.

534
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,590
Tomorrow, mommy can't practice with you.

535
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,140
Because I'm going to the villa in advance

536
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
with Brother Ning Fang

537
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,380
to set up the venue.

538
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,020
Take it.

539
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,870
Yiyue.

540
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,220
Ning Fang, you are here.

541
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,950
Xiaobao!

542
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,750
Ning Fang.

543
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,020
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

544
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,340
Brother.

545
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,670
Good boy.

546
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,710
Give me a hug.

547
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,100
Look at the present brought you.

548
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,870
Do you like it?

549
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,460
Take it.

550
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,510
Go and play.

551
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,140
Packed up your luggage?

552
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,990
Not yet.

553
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,750
I'll think about it later.

554
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,060
Can't let it go?

555
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,060
I just can't let go of Xiaobao.

556
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,020
Where's my phone?

557
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,670
It's on this Sunday.

558
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,380
Do you still remember

559
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,060
the concert we missed when we were in college?

560
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,180
I'll make it up to you.

561
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,100
Lin, are you busy?

562
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,060
Do me a favor.

563
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,420
Is there any way to buy

564
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,660
tickets for Xie Ming's concert?

565
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,060
Cindy,

566
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,870
is it possible to get me two

567
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,060
VIP tickets for Xie Ming's concert?

568
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,460
♫Blows the wind, shines the moon ♫

569
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,630
♫Where is the boat floating to ♫

570
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:15,550
♫Take the long journey with me ♫

571
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,710
Ning Fang, you are here.

572
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,420
Xiaobao!

573
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,020
Ning Fang.

574
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,870
You should call him Brother Ning Fang.

575
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,179
Brother.

576
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,139
I forgot to bring my phone.

577
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,219
Did you see that?

578
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,909
Look for it.

579
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,510
Can't let him go?

580
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,300
I just can't let go of Xiaobao.

581
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,460
Don't be so sad.

582
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,179
You like He Qiaoyan,

583
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,179
which should be a wonderful thing.

584
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,060
Even if you end up with a breakup,

585
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,060
you've also gained happiness while it lasted.

586
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,100
That's enough.

587
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,340
You're right.

588
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,020
Process counts more than the result.

589
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,630
Let's go.
