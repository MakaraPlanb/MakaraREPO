Unforgettable Love
EP01

2
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,310
Scientific experiments,

3
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,190
search engines,

4
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,190
business growth,

5
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,039
and population migration

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,270
all depend on

7
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,190
the scientific analysis of data.

8
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Heshi Group

9
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,270
has adopted the most advanced

10
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,590
artificial intelligence data analysis system.

11
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,150
It can not only protect the

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,000
privacy that customers are most worried about,

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,630
but also ensure the

14
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,480
scientificalness of the statistics.

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
So that it can better serve the society.

16
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,560
The data service of Heshi Group

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,440
will open the intelligent world that

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,270
analyzes every detail of your life.

19
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,920
OK, here's the free questioning time.

20
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:14,960
Mr. He,

21
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,840
there's a rumor on the internet that

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,310
you have been secretly married

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,000
and

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
had a son.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,040
How do you explain that

26
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
to the reporters?

27
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,440
Please pay attention to your wording.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,590
My son has his name, registered permanent residence

29
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,520
and legal guardian.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
Please remove the word "secretly".

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,000
Bullshit,

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,960
it's not only about RMB 300,000 yuan.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,960
I know.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,440
You must be mad at me for

35
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,360
taking Ziyang away.

36
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,150
RMB 500,000 yuan.

37
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,920
I paid his rent,

38
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,590
the down payment for the car,

39
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,560
and the agency fee for studying abroad.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,590
I wrote most of the

41
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,190
winning papers.

42
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,360
I even gave him the place to

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,520
study abroad.

44
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,310
Furthermore,

45
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,790
This person is not the one you take away,

46
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,920
but the garbage and waste

47
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want.

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,360
Qin Yiyue.

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,750
Thank you

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,270
for solving the problem for me.

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,670
Sister,

52
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,040
your recycling habits

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,110
really impressed me.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,560
The rest RMB 200,000 yuan

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
is my red envelope

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,790
for you.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,880
My pleasure.

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,440
By the way,

59
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,960
wish the two of you get old together.

60
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,630
That's good for the people.

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Mr. He,

62
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,920
your father is in a meeting

63
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
so he can't return now.

64
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,149
Mr. He, be careful.

65
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,790
This, this,

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,080
this is your father's computer!

67
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,520
Mr. He,

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,310
Could you please come down?

69
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,590
It's too dangerous for you to stand on it.

70
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,110
Don't worry, don't worry.

71
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,480
Mr. He, I'll call up right away,

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Right away, right away.

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,310
He Weifei, get down.

74
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,150
Mr. He, here you are at last.

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,750
Dad told you before

76
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,960
that I was working.

77
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,310
Of course I know

78
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,310
your three principles.

79
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,110
If Xiaobao gets angry, I have to apologize.

80
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,270
If Xiaobao needs me, I have to show up.

81
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,360
If Xiaobao wants something, he can have it.

82
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But not now.

83
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,840
Call the doctor.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,000
Mr. He, I was in such a hurry that

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,110
I forgot to tell you that

86
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:40,880
Dr. Kozak

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,040
had resigned

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
10 minutes ago.

89
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,670
He said Xiaobao

90
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,480
could let him have a heart attack at any time.

91
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,000
So he said

92
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,080
life is more important than money.

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
Call another doctor.

94
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,440
We've been looking for a doctor.

95
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
On average, one resigns every 3 days.

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,110
Dr. Kozak

97
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,960
is the longest serving doctor.

98
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,790
At least he persisted for ten days.

99
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,480
That's not what I want to hear.

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
Figure it out.

101
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,000
Mr. He,

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,750
Mr. Xu of R&D department

103
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,960
is still waiting for you for a meeting.

104
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,440
In addition,

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,400
there is a live broadcast

106
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
before the awards ceremony in the evening.

107
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,630
We have to go.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,230
He Weifei, listen to me.

109
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,400
I never bluff.

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,040
If you want to make a scene,

111
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,440
you can tear down the office.

112
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,670
My time is for work,

113
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,880
not for you.

114
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,270
Mr. He, what about Xiaobao?

115
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,630
I can't hold him.

116
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,880
If I take care of him,

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,960
maybe the next one to jump

118
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,790
is me.

119
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,520
Prepare a car for Xiaobao.

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,080
That's great!

121
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,590
Eat something and don't drink all the time.

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
Apart from appearance,

123
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,750
there is no difference in function

124
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,880
from the previous generation.

125
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,040
What's really special about it

126
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,750
is that we've created

127
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,000
Catch Love application.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,400
It can record

129
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
the heartbeat of every date.

130
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,710
It is more in line with young people's

131
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,560
intuitive feelings for love.

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,590
What about the market survey data?

133
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,480
Our main customers of the second generation

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,560
are young people

135
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,310
under the age of 35.

136
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,310
As for female consumers,

137
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,150
84 percent from

138
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,880
14 to 40 years old

139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,750
are particularly interested.

140
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,400
84 percent

141
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,270
are particularly interested.

142
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,750
Where is the sample?

143
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,230
Put it on for me.

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,110
Members of R & D department,

145
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,520
please continue to advance your work.

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,190
In addition,

147
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,190
I'll get involved in the testing phase.

148
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,560
Are you tired?

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The protest is of no avail.

150
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,920
I should never

151
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
have made these cards for you.

152
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,840
Continue.

153
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,400
You gotta be kidding me!

154
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,790
Others lovelorn people

155
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,680
would rather cry and lose weight.

156
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,510
But you are different.

157
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,720
You eat, drink and dance.

158
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,880
The appearance of love is just

159
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,350
a physical phenomenon

160
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,550
because the brain receives chemical stimulations

161
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,270
that occur in order to reproduce.

162
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,880
After two months,

163
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,470
the oxytocin,

164
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,310
dopamine,

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,390
and norepinephrine

166
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,679
have completely clear out of your body

167
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,039
and you will be fine.

168
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,600
Zhou Ziyang

169
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,429
won the Heshi Group's

170
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,760
Outstanding Youth Award.

171
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,880
The prize will be presented at

172
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Qincheng Hotel at 20:30 tonight.

173
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,470
Why did he win the prize?

174
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,430
Is it because he's a first-class cheating artist?

175
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,470
Is it because he's a first-class cheating artist?

176
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,150
The news says

177
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,550
it is the Tesn's academic research achievements.

178
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,600
The 90 percent of that paper

179
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,640
was my work.

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
The first author is not you.

181
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,720
Wow, that's going too far.

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,270
Grabbing your credit and fame.

183
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
He is so shameless.

184
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,110
Ruowei, you go back first.

185
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,920
I have one more thing to do.

186
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,600
Where are you going?

187
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,430
Get even with him.

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,960
He is so handsome.

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,190
The most handsome man in Qincheng

190
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,550
and won't take a rebuttal.

191
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,510
My husband! Please look at me!

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,960
Mr. He, I want to be your girlfriend.

193
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,510
Is this the live interface?

194
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,390
Yes.

195
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:37,760
This is

196
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,920
our pre-event

197
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,640
live stream.

198
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,080
You have come to the studio.

199
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,470
I had learned about live streaming before,

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,310
but I haven't studied it carefully.

201
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Actually, it's easy.

202
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
This is

203
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,110
the number of people live online.

204
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,800
And then you see these flowers

205
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,720
and airplanes

206
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,270
are the gifts.

207
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,110
That's the money they spend for you.

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,430
Mr. He,

209
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,230
if you don't want to accept it.

210
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,150
It's kind of interesting.

211
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,720
It turns real-time interaction

212
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,310
into data and flow.

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,550
Again...

214
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,510
Let's get started.

215
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,390
You guys get out.

216
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:12,920
This is

217
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,430
an interactive live broadcast,

218
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,040
and for a while

219
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,920
there will be a lucky draw

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,190
and interactive Q & A.

221
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,190
I'm going to start looking at

222
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,190
the data

223
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,960
and flow on this platform.

224
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,920
Let's get out of here,

225
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,230
there seems to be some technical problems.

226
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
The reception is very unstable,

227
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,880
so we may have to change a room.

228
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,800
Xiaobao,

229
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,800
Xiaobao,

230
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,510
Kiddy,

231
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,880
Why are you here alone?

232
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,840
Where are you going?

233
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,230
What a lovely child!

234
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,150
Where are your parents?

235
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,680
Kiddy, you can't touch that.

236
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,270
Don't run away, kiddy.

237
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,800
Kiddy,

238
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,230
you've trampled this display card.

239
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,430
Could you give me the sticky notes?

240
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,310
I can take you to eat delicious food.

241
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,680
Kiddy,

242
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,190
Look at the display card you've trampled on.

243
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,920
Could you give me the sticky notes?

244
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,920
Call security. There's something wrong in the lobby.

245
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,310
I didn't notice that.

246
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,720
We've been focusing on the live broadcast.

247
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,680
This is the eighth floor.

248
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,920
There are three suites on this floor.

249
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,310
Only mine has staff.

250
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,390
It won't be more than

251
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,190
five minutes,

252
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,310
so he is not far away.

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,230
Are you OK, kiddy?

254
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,310
Didn't hurt you, did you?

255
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,880
It is OK.

256
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,720
It's OK, kiddy.

257
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,680
Don't worry, I am here.

258
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,230
You go to the first floor

259
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,110
and I'll go to the third floor.

260
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,390
Miss Zhong, go back to the room.

261
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,840
By the way, inform the medical staff.

262
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,390
Will Xiaobao suffer something?

263
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,230
Be prepared against danger.

264
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,920
It's too strange for him here.

265
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,110
His situation is very special.

266
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,880
I'll go back and wait.

267
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,720
Kiddy, please look at me.

268
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,800
It's all right.

269
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,040
Let me guess.

270
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,510
Your name is Xiaobao,

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,920
right?

272
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,680
OK, don't talk if you don't want to.

273
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,150
Well, let me ask you questions.

274
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,270
You can nod,

275
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,430
or shake your head,

276
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,390
OK?

277
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,680
"Stay away from me"

278
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,000
Is that what you want to say to everyone?

279
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,430
"I'm sorry"

280
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,040
Let me guess again.

281
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,230
"I'm sorry"

282
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,310
means that you're trying to tell us

283
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,430
you didn't mean to

284
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,720
cause this mess,

285
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,550
right?

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Xiaobao is really a

287
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,310
polite child.

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,110
Ok, let me look at it.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,920
"thank you"

290
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,270
Can I have this card?

291
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,640
So now

292
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,110
can you tell me in whisper

293
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,960
why you

294
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,310
want it?

295
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,550
"dad"

296
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,430
Are you angry with your dad?

297
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Don't be afraid.

298
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,310
They're not here to arrest you.

299
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,150
They're just

300
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,760
the guardian of the poster.

301
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,960
So,

302
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,550
is your father in this hotel?

303
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,880
I give you a small gift

304
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,080
in exchange.

305
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,510
Shall we return this poster

306
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,550
to these

307
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,600
two staff members?

308
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,880
The handkerchief and the little pumpkin

309
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,230
are all my favorite

310
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,150
presents.

311
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,800
Now I give them to you.

312
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,470
Xiaobao, you are so good.

313
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,510
It's good that Xiaobao is fine.

314
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,430
Who are you?

315
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,510
I'm his father's secretary.

316
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,920
You should tell his father

317
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,190
to take good care of his child.

318
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,150
Miss, who are you?

319
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,150
It doesn't matter who I am.

320
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,720
Kiddy,

321
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,880
I have something important to do.

322
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,510
I'm going to go.

323
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,599
Bye-bye.

324
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I just had a fall,

325
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,510
why is my head dizzy?

326
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,880
Xiaobao,

327
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,190
Xiaobao,

328
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,840
Xiaobao,

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,760
Xiaobao,

330
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,230
Xiaobao,

331
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,800
Zhou Ziyang, you jerk!

332
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Xiaobao,

333
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,920
Zhou Ziyang,

334
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,110
jerk!

335
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,000
You big jerk!

336
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,270
Jerk!

337
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,510
I've been waiting for you for three years.

338
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,720
Is that what you've been doing to me

339
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,230
for the three years?

340
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,080
The Tesn's paper is that

341
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,550
I worked around the clock,

342
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,270
with jet lag,

343
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,880
and spent most of the year writing for you.

344
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,760
From data analysis to topic selection,

345
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,640
how much did you

346
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,310
contribute to this paper,

347
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,880
and how much have you done to me?

348
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,270
Miss, you have mistaken me for the wrong person.

349
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,510
I am like

350
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,390
a piece of rag to you.

351
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,640
Use me when you need me

352
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,840
and leave me

353
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,390
alone when you don't.

354
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,190
And,

355
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,680
I tell you

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,600
that the study of medicine is sacred,

357
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,230
and I have enough evidence

358
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,470
to prove that

359
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,640
the first signature of that paper does not belong to you.

360
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,350
I'm going to

361
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,920
make it all public.

362
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,350
If only the boss Mr. He

363
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,470
had any sense,

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,640
he would withdraw the award.

365
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,600
He will

366
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,190
The boss Mr. He is very wise.

367
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,310
Who are you?

368
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,000
I should have

369
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,270
asked you that question.

370
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,880
Help me untie it.

371
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,190
Why me?

372
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,000
I...

373
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,270
Do it yourself.

374
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,310
Hurry up.

375
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,470
Please be gentle.

376
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,110
It's so hot.

377
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,270
There's a reason Mr. He

378
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,270
let us leave.

379
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,800
Host,

380
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,110
can we turn this off now?

381
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,310
Wait a minute!

382
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,550
What do you want to do?

383
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,110
Can't you see that?

384
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,390
I'm going to bring this tie

385
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,080
to the stage

386
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,110
later.

387
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,080
Isn't that solved?

388
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,840
So much nonsense.

389
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,310
And... I'm sorry

390
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,270
If you get hurt,

391
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,430
I'll take the blame.

392
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,800
I don't need it.

393
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,110
That's the best.

394
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,230
It's baffling.

395
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you

396
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,840
for coming to my celebration party.

397
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,350
Congratulations!

398
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,720
Thank you,

399
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,550
we are here to learn.

400
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,230
Thank you.

401
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,040
Ziyang, the party is about to begin.

402
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,880
We...

403
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,350
Now let's welcome

404
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,190
Mr. He Qiaoyan,

405
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,310
CEO of Heshi Group,

406
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,040
to announce

407
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,720
the next winner.

408
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,430
Ladies and gentlemen,

409
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,880
the winner of outstanding young people

410
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,150
in medicine 2020 is...

411
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,880
Tesn's paper is that

412
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,390
I worked around the clock,

413
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,080
with jet lag,

414
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,470
and spent most of the year writing for you.

415
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,960
And,

416
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,640
I tell you

417
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,390
that the study of medicine is sacred,

418
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,310
and I have enough evidence

419
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,150
to prove that

420
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,470
the first signature of that paper does not belong to you.

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,680
No one.

422
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,880
What's going on?

423
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,800
What's going on?

424
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:37,880
What happened?

425
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,110
Doesn't it belong to Ziyang?

426
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,720
Mr. He

427
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,470
This is the new doctors to be chosen

428
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,600
for Xiaobao.

429
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,430
Please have a look.

430
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,230
I don't know who's left to choose.

431
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,920
I'm going to bring this tie

432
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,510
to the stage

433
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,510
later.

434
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,600
Isn't that solved?

435
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,230
So much nonsense.

436
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,640
And... I'm sorry

437
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,640
If you get hurt,

438
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,720
I will take the blame.

439
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,190
This woman

440
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
turns out to be a

441
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,350
child psychologist.

442
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,720
He Weifei!

443
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,000
You should have been down

444
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,110
43 minutes ago.

445
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,110
You should have fallen asleep

446
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,760
28 minutes ago.

447
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,760
Go to sleep.

448
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,000
Your IQ

449
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,110
is far beyond the children of your age.

450
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,190
I'm not going to say

451
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,430
the same thing twice.

452
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,430
Good night.

453
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,230
Come back.

454
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,080
Come back.

455
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,510
Come back

456
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
Don't go.

457
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,430
Don't go.

458
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,430
Don't go.

459
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,310
Don't go.

460
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,040
Don't go.

461
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,720
What are you doing here?

462
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,640
Dude, you're awesome.

463
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,880
Put your feet down.

464
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,640
Who is that girl?

465
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
How come I haven't seen her before?

466
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,230
You two are so close to each other,

467
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:10,760
and I didn't see

468
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,960
any discomfort with you.

469
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,350
Tell me the truth,

470
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,680
where's the girl from?

471
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,310
Is she from your company,

472
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,310
or a hospital,

473
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,880
or someone's daughter?

474
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,230
A mysterious woman.

475
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,190
It's all happened,

476
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,350
and you are still protecting her.

477
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,350
What nonsense are you talking about this morning?

478
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,040
Didn't anyone tell you?

479
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,470
See it.

480
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,390
Please be gentle.

481
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,350
Over there.

482
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,470
Congratulations, Mr. He,

483
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,960
happy to get hot search again.

484
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,760
It is the sixth time this year.

485
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,840
Twice more than me.

486
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,760
As Qingcheng’s famous

487
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,880
handsome boy,

488
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,600
the position of the top stream is not guaranteed.

489
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,350
I'm losing some exposure here.

490
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,510
Has she been exposed?

491
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,230
No one knows who she is.

492
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,800
Are you worried about her?

493
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,270
I'm afraid that this woman

494
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,040
would get me into trouble.

495
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,600
No,

496
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,680
I will ask the data department to

497
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,190
sort out public opinion report in time.

498
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,310
The disturbance may affect our group,

499
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,920
so we need to control it in time.

500
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,600
Who is that woman?

501
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,800
Trash.

502
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,600
How can you

503
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,960
describe a girl like that?

504
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,040
I mean

505
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,550
her files are in the trash can.

506
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,110
You like this type.

507
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,000
You've been in my room

508
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,470
for four minutes and 35 seconds.

509
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,840
You are seriously affecting

510
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,270
my schedule for today.

511
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,470
In addition,

512
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,080
That means

513
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,550
I couldn’t stagger the morning rush hour,

514
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,430
There will be

515
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,720
two more unnecessary traffic lights

516
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,110
and a congested section.

517
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,550
The arrival time

518
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,760
will also be seven minutes and 35 seconds

519
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,150
later than the expectation.

520
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:50,680
Company...

521
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,920
Okay, okay,

522
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
I got it.

523
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,350
I'm leaving now.

524
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,680
Qin Yiyue.

525
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,390
Gee, the dancing queen is awake.

526
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,080
I drank too much yesterday.

527
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,190
Could you please

528
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,720
throw trash away on the spot

529
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,720
after you finish picking it up?

530
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:44,040
Trash left for a long time will affect your mood.

531
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,270
Got it.

532
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,190
Look at your state.

533
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,840
Take the day off.

534
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,110
No!

535
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
I have a very important patient today.

536
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,640
You're dizzy right now.

537
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,550
Which patient doesn't matter to you?

538
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,350
Let another doctor

539
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,920
take your place.

540
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,840
You just take a day off.

541
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,760
Otherwise,

542
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,310
if your

543
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,880
these two big black circles

544
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,080
let the children see,

545
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,270
all have to call you auntie.

546
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,430
Auntie?

547
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,330
I am little sister.

548
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,960
The people in the hospital call me little sister.

549
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,390
I am little sister.

550
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,040
Auntie Qin,

551
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,800
you had a great time

552
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,230
last night.

553
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,510
Look at it.

554
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,600
A mysterious woman

555
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,880
dating with Mr. He in the private space.

556
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,680
The prospective mother of Mr. He's son appeared.

557
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,230
What the hell!

558
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,270
Isn't that me?

559
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,430
What the hell!

560
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,150
He was

561
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,310
an hour and a half behind his

562
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,270
normal bedtime.

563
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,150
It's abnormal.

564
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,680
36 degrees.

565
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,840
It's normal.

566
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,800
Room temperature is normal at 26 degrees.

567
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,310
Three meals a day

568
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,640
is okay

569
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,230
and normal.

570
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,680
What's the matter, Xiaobao?

571
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,430
What's the matter, Mrs. Liu?

572
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,720
What wrong with you, Xiaobao?

573
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,270
Is this one?

574
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,600
Mr. He,

575
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,720
when I was doing the laundry this morning,

576
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,080
I saw it in the dirty clothes basket,

577
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,720
so I just washed it.

578
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:06,390
Mrs. Liu,

579
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,510
Where did this handkerchief come from?

580
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,920
I don't know.

581
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,040
I just saw it yesterday.

582
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,080
It's not ours.

583
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,230
You can go about your business.

584
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,389
Miss Zhong,

585
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,230
please go to Yade hospital and register

586
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,679
at the hospital for Xiaobao.

587
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,600
And chose child psychology department.

588
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,040
Mr. He,

589
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,679
don't worry,

590
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,719
Dr. Hu will take care of Xiaobao.

591
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,310
The building you donated to the hospital

592
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,389
has been completed.

593
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,230
We're planning to

594
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,960
hold a completion ceremony these days.

595
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,040
You are usually busy with your work.

596
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,429
You're just coming here today.

597
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:46,639
Why don't you have a look

598
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,639
and give me some advice.

599
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Ok.

600
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,430
After a while,

601
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,110
please bring me the

602
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,190
re-inspection result of

603
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,960
Guoguo and Xiaobing.

604
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,680
And,

605
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,230
it's time for Niuniu to come for a follow-up visit today.

606
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,720
Don't forget to contact her.

607
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:13,920
Sister,

608
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
you really love children.

609
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,150
I'll give the case to Director Huang

610
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,430
and then show you the results later.

611
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,390
Xiaobao, Xiaobao.

612
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,880
Take it easy!

613
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,040
Xiaobao, Xiaobao,

614
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,600
Xiaobao,

615
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,150
Take it easy!

616
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,150
How beautiful the color of the car is!

617
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,960
Isn't it?

618
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,680
Look,

619
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,150
Three, two, one.

620
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,470
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

621
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,230
Xiaobao,

622
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,680
I'll call Mr. He right now.

623
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,600
I'll call your dad now,

624
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,310
OK?

625
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,550
Xiaobao, don't be afraid.

626
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,230
Take it easy.

627
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,080
Excuse me.

628
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,800
Xiaobao, don't be afraid.

629
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,000
Dr. Hu, what's the matter with this child?

630
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,110
He was fine just now.

631
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,270
Why is he...

632
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,640
Xiaobao, don't be afraid.

633
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,880
Kiddy,

634
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,470
If I guess right,

635
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,840
your name is

636
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,110
Xiaobao,

637
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,080
right?

638
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,680
It seems

639
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,000
Xiaobao

640
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,470
doesn't like these cars,

641
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:24,430
does it?

642
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,310
All right, no more for you,

643
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,880
I will take you

644
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,680
to a more fun place.

645
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,510
OK?

646
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,110
Come

647
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,270
"I want to be friends with you"

648
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,680
Seven words, right?

649
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,920
OK, I'll take it.

650
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:24,110
My name is Guoguo.

651
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,640
What's your name?

652
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,840
You are so cold.

653
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,920
Boys shouldn't be shy.

654
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,600
If you

655
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,550
want more toys,

656
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,510
I'll tell you,

657
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,110
no problem.

658
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,680
Considering you

659
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,270
are new here.

660
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,350
Let's play together, little boy!

661
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,350
As long as you like,

662
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,720
you can play with

663
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,230
all the toys here.

664
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,080
Be my good friend!

665
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,600
You're talking nonsense.

666
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,600
Did you

667
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,840
watch a romance with grandma again?

668
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:56,270
Dr. Qin, here you are at last!

669
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,720
I miss you so much.

670
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,150
I miss you too.

671
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:01,310
Come and sit here.

672
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,800
Here.

673
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,920
Xiaobao,

674
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,190
I bought you water.

675
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,760
Here.

676
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,110
Stop!

677
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,640
If you want to play with him,

678
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,760
you have to let me agree.

679
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,350
Sit down.

680
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,150
Well,

681
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,110
let's discuss,

682
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,390
you go to that room first

683
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,350
and hide for me.

684
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,150
I'll find you later.

685
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,840
OK?

686
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,920
Three, two, one, run!

687
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,150
I declare

688
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,470
that you are mine

689
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,840
from now on.

690
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,680
This is a token

691
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,960
of our agreement.

692
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,000
You have one.

693
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
I have one.

694
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,720
Let's hook the pinkie finger

695
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,920
and make a promise.
