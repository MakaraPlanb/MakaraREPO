Unforgettable Love
EP06

2
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,150
A home

3
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,440
Family.

4
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,400
Your towels hung together.

5
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,080
Your toothbrushes put together.

6
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,440
You eat together

7
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,480
and sleep together.

8
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,480
But I have nothing.

9
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,000
I just have a house.

10
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,080
It doesn't mean family.

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,440
You still have Xiaobao.

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,920
I am

13
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,560
a terrible dad.

14
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,670
I can't even give him

15
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,710
a complete family.

16
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,960
Don't say that.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,520
I think

18
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,400
in fact

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,039
you have been very nice to Xiaobao.

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,960
What's the matter?

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,670
OK

22
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,710
I'll be right back.

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,590
What's wrong?

24
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,880
Xiaobao got a fever.

25
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,750
You had a drink.

26
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,670
I'll go with you.

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,400
Mr. He, you are back.

28
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,590
How's it going?

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,190
The ER doctor has come to see him.

30
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,920
Not a big issue.

31
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
The doctor has prescribed the medicine.

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,480
But Xiaobao doesn't take it.

33
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,040
Dear

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,310
the doctor said

35
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,670
you should take the medicine first.

36
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,310
Come on.

37
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,480
Then you will get better.

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,230
I told you before

39
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,520
if you're disobedient

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,880
I'll be angry.

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,710
Come on.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,480
Xiaobao, you should be obedient.

43
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:16,960
Take the medicine.

44
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,270
Let me try.

45
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,630
Xiaobao

46
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,480
look, who am I?

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,480
I'm Dr. Qin.

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,790
I heard

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,840
Look, little dinosaur is sick.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,440
I will

51
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,040
treat the little patient.

52
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,480
The little dinosaur

53
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,310
should take medicine.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
Patients should take medicine.

55
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,079
Good boy

56
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,360
Good boy

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,480
Gulu Gulu

58
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Gulu Gulu

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,400
Finished.

60
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,110
It feels comfortable.

61
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:20,520
Look, Dad's sick.

62
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,840
Dad should take medicine, too.

63
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,750
Is it bitter?

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,839
It is not bitter at all.

65
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,670
Who's the next?

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,110
Right, come on.

67
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,400
Come on

68
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,400
Take the medicine

69
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,590
Good boy

70
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,590
Xiaobao is so brave.

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Have a cup of coffee.

72
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
Assistant Ma said

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,360
Xiaobao had caught a cold

74
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,630
this morning.

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,840
Didn't you notice that?

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
There was an important meeting

77
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,920
this morning

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
so I left a little earlier.

79
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,520
Normally

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
Xiaobao stays at home alone?

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
If circumstances permit,

82
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,190
I'll try to keep him along with me.

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,270
But in most cases,

84
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,360
Xiaobao

85
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,480
stays at home alone.

86
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,520
He refuses to talk

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,000
and communicate with strangers.

88
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
Over the years

89
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,040
you are the first one

90
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,190
to make Xiaobao feel dependent.

91
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,670
It's getting late.

92
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,630
I'll ask the driver to send you back.

93
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,360
What's the matter?

94
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,230
Xiaobao, he never

95
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,440
shares snacks with others.

96
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,040
He never asks anyone else to

97
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,190
sleep with him.

98
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,560
You want me to be here

99
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,710
with you tonight

100
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,440
don't you?

101
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,920
Then

102
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,150
I'll stay with him tonight.

103
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,310
In case he has a fever again

104
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,590
at least I am a doctor.

105
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,190
Xiaobao

106
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,790
I'll stay here with you tonight.

107
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,750
OK?

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,190
Mom

109
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,310
He Weifei

110
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,110
What did you just call her?

111
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,360
Mom

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,150
Xiaobao

113
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,630
I'll stay with you tonight

114
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,440
OK

115
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,880
Mom

116
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,670
He Weifei

117
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,630
What did you just call her?

118
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,000
Mom

119
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
I can do nothing

120
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,920
except get myself into deep trouble.

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,000
Going away is the best policy.

122
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,840
Where are you going?

123
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,720
Go home

124
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,470
Whose home?

125
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
Isn't that asking the question knowingly?

126
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm going back to my home, of course.

127
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,679
OK

128
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,679
I'll let someone go back with you.

129
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,760
to pack up your things

130
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,190
by the way.

131
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,720
So you can move in tonight.

132
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,720
I said it last night

133
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
I will not move.

134
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,430
I'm not going to make a deal with you either.

135
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,080
Bye

136
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,350
You promised Xiaobao.

137
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:05,880
Children's words

138
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,310
are all jokes.

139
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,550
If he wants a giraffe

140
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,600
to be her mom,

141
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,270
are you going to

142
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,430
satisfy him?

143
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,470
Then

144
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,470
I'll buy the zoo.

145
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,350
I'm not a zoo.

146
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:16,920
Bye

147
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,310
Last night, it was the first time

148
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
that Xiaobao had talked over the five years.

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
If it's a joke,

150
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,760
you should tell Xiaobao by yourself.

151
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,880
Tell him you're not his mom.

152
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,640
OK

153
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Anyway

154
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm not his real mom.

155
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,110
I see UNIFON

156
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,720
is recruiting mask experience officers.

157
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,110
It also provides awards.

158
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,230
I want to try.

159
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,110
Would you like to come with me?

160
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,920
I give you full power

161
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,190
to sign up for me.

162
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,270
I just want to rest.

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,310
So tired

164
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,600
What happened last night?

165
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,550
You stayed out all night.

166
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,080
Nothing.

167
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,270
Stop acting.

168
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,000
You said

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,310
you would send your parents back last night.

170
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,270
Why did He Qiaoyan go with you?

171
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,880
I had enough bad luck.

173
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,110
Did your parents beat him up?

174
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,350
Are my parents like that?

175
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,550
My parents are very enthusiastic.

176
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,000
I even felt that

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,510
I took a concubine

178
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,150
fighting for their attention home.

179
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,310
Can you be serious?

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,550
Let me ask you a question.

181
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,270
Were you two together

182
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,640
last night?

183
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,550
I'm sorry to tell you.

184
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,150
Yes.

185
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,190
Qin Yiyue, you're really something.

186
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,470
You've served out your apprenticeship.

187
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,640
I didn't teach you in vain.

188
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:58,960
It seems that

189
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm going to lose weight again.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,880
What does this have to do with your weight loss?

191
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,430
I'm going to be your bridesmaid.

192
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,760
Losing weight is imminent.

193
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,840
What's your opinion?

194
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
What should I do?

195
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,350
In my opinion

196
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,600
there are only two ways.

197
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,960
The first is

198
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,310
to tell Xiaobao directly.

199
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,310
What you said before

200
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,080
is a white lie.

201
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,110
Let him just forget it.

202
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,510
I can't tell Xiaobao like that.

203
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,800
Xiaobao's condition has just stabilized.

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,080
I can't hurt him.

205
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,640
Then you tell He Qiaoyan

206
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,000
to find a way out himself.

207
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's impossible.

208
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,000
I think

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,720
no one can help him.

210
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,640
I remind you that

211
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
sympathy

212
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
is one of predictors of falling for a guy.

213
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,640
What?

214
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,680
Even if I fall for a stone

215
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,270
I will not fall for

216
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,800
He Qiaoyan.

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,190
I'll call Xiaobao now.

218
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,190
You had better.

219
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,720
I hope your phone

220
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,040
is not out of credit.

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Bye

222
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,230
I just topped up.

223
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,600
Goodbye

224
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,800
Mommy

225
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,640
Mommy

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,230
Mommy

227
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,430
Mommy, mommy

228
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't call me Mommy.

229
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,310
OK?

230
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,760
Mommy, mommy

231
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,880
Mommy

232
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,150
Mommy

233
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't call me Mommy.

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,110
Mommy

235
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,510
Did your father

236
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,270
feed you a repeater

237
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,600
as breakfast?

238
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,550
So this is a switch?

239
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,080
Mom

240
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,680
Don't call me mom.

241
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Then you tell me.

242
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,920
Where's your power supply?

243
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,310
This is the power supply?

244
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,080
Out of power?

245
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,960
Xiaobao is out of power.

246
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,510
Isn't Xiaobao's fever gone

247
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,430
and left hospital?

248
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,430
Why did you bring him to the hospital again?

249
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,000
Emergency examination is hasty.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,960
I can't rest easy.

251
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,880
So I take him

252
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,430
to undergo a thorough examination.

253
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,920
Besides,

254
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,550
Xiaobao cares more about you

255
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,920
doesn't he?

256
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,880
Mr. He

257
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,920
You can't do this.

258
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,880
Now everybody here

259
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,230
known about our rumors.

260
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,880
Mr. He

261
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,920
Now everybody here

262
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,270
known about our rumors.

263
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,640
If they hear

264
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,040
that Xiaobao calls me Mommy,

265
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,680
it's hard to explain.

266
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,720
It used to be a rumor

267
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,920
but not anymore.

268
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,310
Because you are

269
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,230
Xiaobao's mother now.

270
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,270
No

271
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,040
And

272
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,760
Mommy's breakfast

273
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,230
Mommy

274
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,720
Xiaobao prepared it

275
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,550
for you personally.

276
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,110
I

277
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,640
I'll have a good breakfast.

278
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,110
You should go to the doctor with Dad.

279
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,040
OK?

280
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,270
Repeater

281
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,000
I gotta get to work.

282
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,310
Qin Yiyue

283
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,760
Really?

284
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,960
Ridiculous

285
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,080
Qin Yiyue

286
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,080
You're just

287
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,760
the treasure of medical community

288
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,430
and the creator of human miracle.

289
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,310
I'm so moved

290
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,230
Everyone has thought

291
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,110
Xiaobao is

292
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,390
incurably ill.

293
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Xiaobao's sickness is not serious.

294
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,040
It's just nobody can

295
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,230
open his heart.

296
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,310
It seems that

297
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,080
you're the key.

298
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,960
Qin Yiyue

299
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,680
Dr. Huang

300
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,310
We have a patient

301
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,550
needs your help.

302
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,230
Mr. He

303
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
Dr. Qin you mentioned

304
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,920
is coming.

305
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,680
For the follow-up treatment

306
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,430
of patient He Weifei,

307
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,510
we will take it seriously.

308
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,350
Thank you, Dr. Huang.

309
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,840
Dr. Qin, please.

310
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:33,920
Mr. He

311
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,000
You did it on purpose, right?

312
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,270
You're mistaken.

313
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,550
Xiaobao's personal doctor is not at home.

314
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,230
You know about him.

315
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,110
He never

316
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,430
communicates with strangers,

317
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,470
let alone accept them.

318
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,080
I have no choice,

319
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,310
so I can only come to you.

320
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,150
Don't worry.

321
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,880
Dr. Huang has already told me.

322
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,040
Xiaobao's sickness

323
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,960
is not serious enough

324
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,470
to be hospitalized.

325
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,350
Dr. Huang is right.

326
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,430
It's getting better.

327
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,270
So the treatment should be continued

328
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
until recovery.

329
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,430
Right?

330
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,510
I got plans, so I have to go.

331
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,599
Go? Where are you going?

332
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,230
There are some problems with the project.

333
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,839
I need to be away for a few days.

334
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,599
But don't worry

335
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,550
I'll be back as soon as I can.

336
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,079
You're his father, aren't you?

337
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:32,109
Your son is in hospital

338
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,079
but you're going on a business trip.

339
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,720
Everything has its priorities.

340
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,800
And compared to me,

341
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,840
Xiaobao needs you more.

342
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,350
You speak as if

343
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,840
only you have a job.

344
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,230
Mommy

345
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,270
Xiaobao

346
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,960
Stop calling me Mommy here.

347
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,800
Come on

348
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,080
I'm with you today.

349
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,190
Are you happy?

350
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,350
Yes

351
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,960
Let's

352
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
make a deal

353
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,880
OK?

354
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,150
Pinkie promise

355
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,760
You can't call me Mommy

356
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,600
here today.

357
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,150
You want to ask me why

358
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,080
right?

359
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,510
Because this is where I work

360
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,550
just like your dad's office

361
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,720
In the office

362
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,150
people can only call each other

363
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,350
the name at work.

364
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,190
For example,

365
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,190
Doctor and Teacher.

366
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,470
Understand?

367
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,640
Great.

368
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,310
Good boy.

369
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,190
Dr. Huang

370
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,110
I've given Xiaobao medicine and an injection

371
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,720
according to what you told me.

372
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,430
And this is the record.

373
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,310
His fever is gone.

374
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,150
There is nothing wrong with other indicators.

375
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,150
In my opinion

376
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,470
it's time for Mr. He

377
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,600
to take Xiaobao home.

378
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,000
OK.

379
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,190
I see, Dr. Huang.

380
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,040
Thank you so much.

381
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,430
By the way,

382
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,880
is there any other work

383
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,960
today?

384
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,550
After you go back

385
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,310
and pick up Xiaobao

386
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,470
you can go home to rest.

387
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,310
I'll deal with

388
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,350
other works.

389
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,270
OK

390
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,600
Tomorrow morning

391
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,960
we have an appointment with Mr. Lin.

392
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,000
Just a moment

393
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,470
These are for my boyfriend.

394
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,550
The specialty here

395
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,920
Do you buy those for your boyfriend

396
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,000
every time you're on a business trip?

397
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,230
Mr. He

398
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,000
I absolutely didn't

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,510
take up work hours

400
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,550
to buy these things.

401
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,960
Buy me one before you go back.

402
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
OK

403
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,760
Mom

404
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,680
Mom

405
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,640
Mom, Mom

406
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,430
Mom, Mom, Mom

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,640
Can you

408
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,600
share your toys with him

409
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,270
OK?

410
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,430
Even just for a while?

411
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,390
Hey, how could you?

412
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,430
Whose kid is this?

413
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,760
Impolite

414
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,310
Xiaobao

415
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,190
Are you all right, my dear?

416
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,920
Does your mom know

417
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,000
you have such a bad temper?

418
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,550
A mute

419
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:02,150
It's okay.

420
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,150
Doctor, wait a minute.

421
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,040
Is he a mute?

422
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,600
He doesn't know any manners.

423
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,190
Look what he had done to my son.

424
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,920
Call his mom

425
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
here now.

426
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,720
Damn!

427
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,350
Hey, stop.

428
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,840
Call his mom here now.

429
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm telling you

430
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:24,880
his mother must

431
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,190
apologize to my son.

432
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,430
Can you hear me?

433
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,110
A spoiled brat without any family education.

434
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I'm telling you.

435
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm his mother.

436
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,550
You're his mother?

437
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,920
Your kids are impolite.

438
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,760
Why can't I teach him?

439
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,720
I told my son

440
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,190
don't be polite

441
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,110
to the impolite.

442
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,270
Please be kind.

443
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,350
Don't send a bad message

444
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,430
to your son.

445
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,270
And here is the hospital,

446
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,880
the children's activity center.

447
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,150
Behave yourself.

448
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,230
Is the kid

449
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,720
Mr. He's son?

450
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,190
Yes

451
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,510
It seems that someone

452
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,600
is madly keen to be Mr. He's wife,

453
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,080
so she shows off here.

454
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,880
She is flattering a six-year-old boy

455
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,310
Does he regard you as his mother?

456
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
Yes, Dr. Qin

457
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,080
You are in

458
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,510
a bit of a hurry.

459
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,960
Xiaobao, don't worry.

460
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,720
I'll stay with you.

461
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
Mommy

462
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,800
Get out of my way

463
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:43,510
Congratulations, Dr. Qin.

464
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,640
You have a son

465
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,390
at a young age.

466
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
Your future

467
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,110
must be hard, right?

468
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,720
Congratulations, you have a jerk

469
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,190
as your boyfriend at a young age.

470
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,880
Your future

471
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,110
must be harder.

472
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,470
Xiaobao

473
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,720
I'll take you back.

474
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,550
Xiaobao, come on.

475
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,800
I thought you had gone.

476
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,310
I'm here with Xiaobao today

477
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,880
without going anywhere, OK?

478
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,800
All the time?

479
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,550
Xiaobao

480
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,840
I'll be with you all the time.

481
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,720
Maybe in different ways

482
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,920
at different times.

483
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,150
Just like your real mother.

484
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,150
Come on

485
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,720
Look at the sky.

486
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,040
Isn't it beautiful?

487
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,550
Actually, your Mommy

488
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,550
didn't leave.

489
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,680
She just changed the way

490
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,390
of accompanying you.

491
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,110
Maybe your Mommy

492
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,310
is watching you

493
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,600
on a cloud.

494
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Look

495
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,310
Look at that cloud.

496
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,310
That cloud is beautiful

497
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
It's like Mommy, isn't it?

498
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
Come on

499
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,470
I'll take a picture with Xiaobao and the cloud.

500
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,640
Did you see that?

501
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,960
Qin Yiyue

502
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,640
was flattering He Weifei

503
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,190
in order to please him.

504
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,350
What kind of women

505
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,960
has Mr. He not met?

506
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,960
Why did he choose Qin Yiyue?

507
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,880
It must be because

508
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,310
Qin Yiyue can do everything to attach the rich.

509
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Exactly.

510
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,600
Otherwise, how can Mr. He

511
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,190
choose her?

512
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,880
What she thinks is obvious.

513
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,190
Look how she treats He Weifei.

514
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,150
It's known to all.

515
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,680
Too smelly.

516
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,920
Why is it so smelly?

517
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,720
None of you brush your teeth?

518
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,470
The smell is similar to

519
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,960
public toilets.

520
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,270
What?

521
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
Qin Yiyue dared to do it

522
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,150
She's afraid to be talked about?

523
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,760
That's it.

524
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,390
Shameless when she did it

525
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,720
Now she thinks of quieting others.

526
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,640
What did Qin Yiyue do?

527
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,720
I'm asking you what she did.

528
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,960
Do you have any evidence?

529
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,150
Then you're talking rubbish here.

530
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,880
I think you're jealous, right?

531
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,190
Because

532
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,310
no man

533
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,880
will choose you

534
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,840
due to your faces

535
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,640
and foul mouths.

536
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,960
Of course, normal girls

537
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,000
will not be as open as

538
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,040
you?

539
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,000
Change boyfriend so fast.

540
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
So this is the reason

541
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,510
why Dr. Ye choose

542
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,150
a jerk as boyfriend.

543
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,430
You

544
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,920
I'm warning you.

545
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,350
If you have enough time

546
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,270
you'd better spend time with your boyfriend

547
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,960
rather than slander Dr. Qin.

548
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,190
Maybe

549
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,640
he will get

550
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,040
a richer one.

551
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,800
Then

552
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,640
blow you off.

553
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,470
Yang Ruowei

554
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,310
Dr. Ye, are you OK?

555
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,270
Miss Yang, how can you do this?

556
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,350
I didn't mean to do this.

557
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,350
Are you ok?

558
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,840
Go to clean it.

559
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,840
It burns.

560
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,230
Xiaobao's fever is gone.

561
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,550
All indicators are normal.

562
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,080
And

563
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,840
by the way, the medicine is in this cabinet.

564
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,510
You remember

565
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,270
to give him the medicine properly.

566
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,960
OK

567
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,510
Then I'm leaving.

568
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,960
OK

569
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,270
Well

570
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,110
I prepared the specialty.

571
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,920
For you two.

572
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
At last you're of conscience.

573
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,640
Thank you

574
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,760
The adventure of stepmother is over.

575
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,230
Let's go to barbecue.

576
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,680
Don't you know?

577
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,110
Miss Yang gets troubles.

578
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,350
Ruowei

579
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,430
You have known it?

580
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,430
What did the hospital director say?

581
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,190
He said

582
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,390
he didn't fire me

583
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,680
for the sake of my hard work

584
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,760
over the years.

585
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,800
I have to leave by myself.

586
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,310
I'll talk to him.

587
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,470
It's true that

588
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,840
I have broken the rules of the hospital.

589
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,720
The hospital director

590
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,880
did according to the rules.

591
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,430
I'm sorry, Ruowei.

592
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,150
It's my fault.

593
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,800
Don't blame yourself

594
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,510
OK?

595
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,390
How can you be blamed?

596
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,550
I don't like those people.

597
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,760
Let's go home.

598
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,110
But

599
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,040
I

600
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,110
Get rid of yourself.

601
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,080
You know that

602
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,720
I want to change my job for a long time.

603
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,550
Go

604
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,040
Go

605
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,190
We two

606
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,350
go back home

607
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,080
and get dressed.

608
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,960
Then put on a wonderful make-up.

609
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,230
Let's go to the bar

610
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,760
to celebrate for my freedom.

611
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,430
Come on

612
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,760
For my short freedom

613
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,880
Cheers, cheers, cheers

614
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,270
We will not return home before getting drunk, OK?

615
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,600
Drink up, drink up, drink up

616
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,230
Drink it.

617
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,470
You're cheating, Ning Fang.

618
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,310
Ruowei said we would not go home till we get drunk.

619
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,680
You'll get drunk.

620
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,920
I have to stay awake

621
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,000
to send you home.

622
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,350
Look, he doesn't drink

623
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,430
but we should.

624
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,080
Cheers

625
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,110
How to drink?

626
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,310
Old rules

627
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,150
OK

628
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,550
Best of three games.

629
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,640
Three two one

630
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
I win

631
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,720
Drink up, drink up

632
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,270
Good, Qin Yiyue

633
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,040
Another one

634
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,720
I'll go to the bathroom.

635
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,510
Sir

636
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,800
get me a tomato juice.

637
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,920
Wait till I get back from the bathroom

638
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,110
You drink it up

639
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,470
we continue when I get back.

640
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
Be careful.

641
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,110
OK

642
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,230
OK

643
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,230
What is this?

644
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,719
Tomato juice.

645
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,310
You're drinking too fast.

646
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,040
You'll have a headache tomorrow.

647
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,719
You are considerate.

648
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,510
If I could be like you.

649
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,510
I'll not make my life

650
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,679
a mess.

651
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,110
You don't have to blame yourself.

652
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,760
Ruowei won't blame you either.

653
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,960
But I know

654
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,080
Ruowei worked hard

655
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,000
to come to Yade hospital.

656
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,350
I feel like

657
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,310
I'm useless.

658
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,230
I make the trouble

659
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,040
He Qiaoyan brings to me bigger

660
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,000
and more and more people are involved.

661
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,719
Do you know how poor I am?

662
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,270
I lost

663
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,230
the ancestral ring.

664
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,270
My parents think I am going to get married.

665
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,040
They are happy for me.

666
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,960
I can't explain it clearly

667
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,040
I

668
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,310
have given a poor child hope

669
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,310
but I can't admit it bravely.

670
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Now, my best friend lost her job

671
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,310
because of me.

672
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,800
Am I useless?

673
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,510
You're not useless

674
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,920
You're just too kind.

675
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,000
But Yiyue

676
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,110
sometimes hesitance

677
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,640
is not a good solution.

678
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,800
It not only hurt yourself

679
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,230
but get others into trouble.

680
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,310
OK

681
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,430
Don't think so much

682
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,470
Cut the knot.

683
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,000
OK

684
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,080
Cut the knot.

685
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,040
Come on

686
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,310
Get up

687
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,720
Hurry up

688
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,470
What are you doing?

689
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,270
My beauty sleep.

690
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,680
I found these on the Internet.

691
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,230
These are companies looking for assistants.

692
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,470
Have a look.

693
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,550
We're going to look and choose

694
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,230
on Internet.

695
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,040
Breakfast is coming.

696
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,880
Look

697
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,310
After eating the lucky breakfast I made

698
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,080
you will pass the interview.

699
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
Two extra spoons

700
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,080
of your favorite.

701
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,040
Dear

702
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,390
I really can't drink any more.

703
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,920
Every interview I failed

704
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,470
you just let me have a cup of milk tea.

705
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,110
I feel like I have drunk up

706
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,510
all the milk tea in my life.

707
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,680
OK

708
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,720
Then we won't drink it.

709
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,960
Let's change to the hot pot.

710
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,800
OK?

711
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,430
Yue'er

712
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,190
will I

713
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,800
become an unemployed

714
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,310
in the future?

715
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,230
Don't worry.

716
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,680
Last night

717
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,150
fortune-telling has

718
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,960
told me that

719
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,680
good news will come in three days.

720
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,430
Trust me.

721
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,760
My god!

722
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,760
Look

723
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,110
Hey girl

724
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,270
You scared me.

725
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,840
What's the matter?

726
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,680
I'm hired.

727
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,040
Look

728
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,270
Wenshi Group

729
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,720
Wenshi asks me to the last interview tomorrow.

730
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,080
Hired

731
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,800
Wenshi

732
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,840
Did you see that?

733
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,800
It's the group that

734
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,080
has its branches even to Europe?

735
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,190
Do you know

736
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,040
many people want to

737
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,470
work in that company?

738
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
My God

739
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,350
My luck is on the turn.

740
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,150
I've identified it.

741
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,470
It's not fake information.

742
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,040
What's the matter?

743
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,000
No

744
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,430
I remember

745
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,840
I haven't taken part in

746
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,430
the first interview.

747
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,040
Why it asks me to the last?

748
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,760
You can't understand this?

749
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:21,350
It's the unique recruitment habits of large enterprises.

750
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,270
Similar to mystery boxes.

751
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,190
Understand?

752
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
These are all jobs

753
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:46,350
that fit you at present.

754
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,190
You choose one.

755
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,680
Chairman Assistant

756
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,920
Come to work on Monday.

757
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,040
Mr. Wen,

758
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,550
can I ask you

759
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,430
the last question?

760
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,150
Please

761
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,640
Your real reason for choosing me.

762
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,350
You are not confident

763
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,840
about yourself.

764
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm confident

765
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,310
I'm absolutely capable

766
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:37,110
for the job.

767
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,920
But I know with my resume.

768
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
I have no chance

769
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,640
since you're looking through

770
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,110
the resumes.

771
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,230
But now I can

772
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,350
come to the last interview directly.

773
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,960
There must be a reason.

774
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,080
Is this important to you?

775
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,190
Very important

776
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,000
You're right.

777
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,510
There's a real reason

778
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,920
Someone asks me to give you a chance.

779
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,000
But after I talk to you

780
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I think

781
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,110
I am right

782
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,840
for that.

783
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,110
I guess

784
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,510
the person should be Mr. He.

785
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,960
He Qiaoyan?

786
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,800
Are you sure it's He Qiaoyan

787
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,470
to help you for the interview?

788
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
Mr. Wen told me personally.

789
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
My God.

790
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,510
Dedicate and ask none in return.

791
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,600
Mr. He

792
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,270
loves you so much.

793
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,640
Hurry up

794
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,230
By the way, Yang Ruowei

795
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,310
will you join Wenshi?

796
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,720
Let me think about it.

797
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,600
That's Wenshi.

798
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,080
And I heard that Mr. Wen

799
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,150
who is the Deputy Chairman Assistant in Wenshi

800
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,600
is also a handsome guy.

801
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,040
There are many handsome guys.

802
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,230
But,

803
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,430
there's only one best friend.

804
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,230
Don't worry, Yue'er.

805
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,390
If you really want to

806
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:15,920
cut the knots

807
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,470
with He Qiaoyan

808
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,080
I will support you.

809
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,840
Anyway,

810
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,760
with my beauty and talent,

811
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
I can find a job sooner or later.

812
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,080
But why did I hear that

813
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,880
you have sent hundreds of resumes.

814
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,470
Just take it.

815
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,350
Mr. He,

816
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,510
thank you for your help to Ruowei.

817
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,430
No, not my style.

818
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,510
Thanks for your help.

819
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,150
What are you doing here?

820
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:55,550
Mr. He

821
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:55,760
I...

822
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,350
Xiaobao is missing.
