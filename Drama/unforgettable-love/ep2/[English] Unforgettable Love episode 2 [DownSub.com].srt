Unforgettable Love
EP02

2
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,310
Here's one for you.

3
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
This is mine.

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,190
Let's make a pinky promise,

5
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,270
and it'll never change.

6
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,190
Let go of his hands.

7
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,520
Aunt, please excuse me.

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,630
Aunt?

9
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,080
Hey, you...

10
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,960
It's you!

11
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,630
What a small world.

12
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,310
What happened last night

13
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,630
was planned by you, right?

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,479
It is a

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,080
very subtle plan.

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,400
From live to offline,

17
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,229
Until Xiaobao disappeared,

18
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,270
you showed up by chance.

19
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,479
Nothing more nor less,

20
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,229
the video is nearly a minute in length,

21
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,229
and spread on the Internet.

22
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,080
From last night to today,

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,670
you haven't lost anything.

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,590
But my company

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,190
has taken on

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,400
heavy financial losses

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
and immense public pressure.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
What are you drivelling about?

29
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,150
Come on, how much do you want?

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,000
You've suffered a loss?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,310
I've also suffered losses.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,480
I have been unaccountably implicated.

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,230
Just name your price.

34
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,110
Two hundred.

35
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,590
I'm right.

36
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,229
Check.

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,310
Don't be like in the TV series.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,560
Two hundred yuan.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,670
Two hundred yuan?

40
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,440
Are you taunting me?

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,710
For us girls,

42
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,520
you can kill me,

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
but you can't mess up my haircut.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,440
Look,

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,110
what you've done

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,360
to this hair!

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm going to ask the best hairdresser

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,190
to cut my hair.

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,230
Two hundred yuan.

50
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,400
It's really puzzling.

51
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,230
I don't want more.

52
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,310
Xiaobao,

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,840
There are weird aunts everywhere.

54
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,920
You must pay attention to

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,960
personal safety in the future.

56
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,790
Do you understand?

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,480
Hey...

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,670
Let's go home.

59
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,190
You are weird uncle.

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
He Weifei,

61
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,270
I haven't received those two cards

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,110
for so many years,

63
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,670
but you gave them to a weird aunt.

64
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,480
Forget it.

65
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll take you to

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,310
a more normal hospital.

67
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,110
Go!

68
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,000
How long are you going to

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,750
confront me?

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,589
Let's talk about it calmly.

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
You can put forward your needs.

72
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,790
Dr. Qin?

73
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,310
What does Dr. Qin mean?

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,190
You want Dr. Qin to come to our home

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,750
and be your doctor?

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,880
Turn off the light and go sleep.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,590
Mr. He.

78
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,230
This is what I collected and sorted out

79
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,880
all information of Dr. Qin Yiyue.

80
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,880
Did you see the two meetings

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,230
between Xiaobao and Dr. Qin

82
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,000
with your own eyes?

83
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,710
It's the first time I saw Xiaobao

84
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,750
can be so close

85
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,590
to a stranger.

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,270
It's strange, to be honest.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,840
I'm so surprised.

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,750
After all these years,

89
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,080
I've been so nice to Xiaobao,

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,150
he didn't even let me

91
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,150
touch his little hand.

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,230
Look.

93
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,190
Look at it.

94
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm so curious.

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Which fairy she is,

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,360
can shake the big and small icebergs

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,630
in your family?

98
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,080
She was born in a county

99
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,190
next to Qincheng.

100
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,920
Her parents

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,270
are all ordinary workers.

102
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
From primary school to high school,

103
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,790
she never left that small county.

104
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,310
She has no

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,790
background of studying abroad.

106
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,790
She has only worked for three years

107
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,080
and with little clinical experience.

108
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,590
All in all,

109
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,520
She can't compete with

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,790
overseas medical experts.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,590
Most importantly,

112
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,190
her temper

113
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
is very unstable

114
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,400
and moody.

115
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,670
In terms of both short-term cooperation

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,270
and long-term development,

117
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,190
cooperation with her

118
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,040
is more harm than good.

119
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
You can do chart analysis for all of this.

120
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,440
I also considered

121
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,080
using value portfolio management model

122
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,000
or 7S model for analysis,

123
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,080
but I found that,

124
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,670
the available data did not support it.

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,750
Lao He,

126
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,710
not all people and things

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,710
can be explained

128
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,590
by business logic.

129
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,920
You're wrong.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
I have an employment relationship with her,

131
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,360
which is an equal exchange

132
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,190
of salary and talents.

133
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,920
So you've seen her twice.

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,040
What do you think of her?

135
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
and it'll never change...

136
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,630
She's quite special.

137
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Tell me.

138
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,080
That's all right.

139
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,560
So much nonsense.

140
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,710
Very wierd

141
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,560
Xiaobao likes her very much.

142
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,880
Although the child doesn't speak,

143
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
he is smart,

144
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,840
just like his father.

145
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,190
He knows how to

146
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
judge a person.

147
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,440
Xiaobao is always my most important Party A.

148
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,270
He has the right to appoint partners.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
I'll trust him for a while.

150
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,880
Good morning, Mr. He.

151
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,630
Good morning.

152
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,270
Mr. He, Miss Qin politely refused.

153
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,190
She said she doesn't receive patients

154
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,350
during the vacation.

155
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,880
In addition,

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,720
About the personal doctor,

157
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,600
She also refused.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,110
Refuse the Prince Charming of Qincheng girls?

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,960
This is something new.

160
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,549
I'm more and more curious

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,039
about Dr. Qin.

162
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,039
It seems that I need to

163
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,429
send her an e-mail in person.

164
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,880
E-mail?

165
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:45,680
Oh my God, only you can do this.

166
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,760
Let me see.

167
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,190
For the contract and related matters,

168
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,080
please refer to the attachment.

169
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,390
Please find the attachment.

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,800
Bro, you are too rigid.

171
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,350
It's strange that she will accept your request.

172
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,470
You just wait and see.

173
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,550
What are you doing?

174
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,190
Girls in nowadays

175
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,720
don't value money,

176
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,150
they value your character.

177
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,600
It's in vain to

178
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,880
give you such a good appearance.

179
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,640
Don't make trouble for me.

180
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,760
Give it to me.

181
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,110
Wait a moment.

182
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,150
With 100 MB optical fiber,

183
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,000
even if you turn it off,

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,080
it can be sent out.

185
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,110
It's disgusting.

186
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,720
He's a psychopath,

187
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,310
and a narcissist.

188
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,270
It's all pictures of himself.

189
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
You can send,

190
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,430
I can delete.

191
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,960
Delete.

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,920
Don't want to look.

193
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,600
I thought as much.

194
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,840
As for the formal negotiation,

195
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,310
I have to come in person.

196
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,190
Hello.

197
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,080
This is He Qiaoyan,

198
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,190
CEO of the Heshi Group.

199
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,230
I'd like to invite you

200
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,000
to our company tomorrow.

201
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,110
You're the CEO?

202
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,470
I'm the chairman.

203
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,960
This kind of phone fraud,

204
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,600
I'll report one by one.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,680
Hello?

206
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Hung up.

207
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,390
Phone fraud?

208
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,080
It's impossible for me to be a private doctor.

209
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm a full-time doctor.

210
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,550
Our hospital has regulations.

211
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,080
I've negotiated

212
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,230
with the Director.

213
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,350
Don't worry.

214
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Besides, the money is just a deposit.

215
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,840
Dr. Qin

216
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,230
is an absolute beneficiary.

217
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,470
Your salary and bonus

218
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,270
will only double.

219
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,510
In your eyes,

220
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,840
everything can be done

221
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,510
with money?

222
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,600
It is true theoretically.

223
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800
Because everything

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,350
has its equivalent value match.

225
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,390
Can children's psychological deficiency

226
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,040
be cured with money?

227
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,960
Not exactly.

228
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,840
But at least in material terms,

229
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,880
whatever he wants,

230
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,960
I can satisfy him.

231
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Including you.

232
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Sorry, Mr. He.

233
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,350
I feel offended

234
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,550
and don't want to see you again.

235
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,430
Please leave.

236
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,190
I'm so tough.

237
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,000
I regard money like dirt.

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
It's not in vain to read novels dominated by heroines.

239
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
About business negotiation,

240
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,760
Often I get used to

241
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,080
saying bluntly first.

242
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,800
Please leave now.

243
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,720
Excuse me.

244
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,040
Really left?

245
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,110
She pushed you out of the door?

246
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,000
She read the contract.

247
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,110
The deposit was also in front of her.

248
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,760
She still won't cooperate with me.

249
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,190
I haven't had such a tough project

250
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,640
in a long time.

251
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,150
I put out a lever,

252
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,920
but I couldn't find the fulcrum to pry her.

253
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,230
It's really not an ordinary woman.

254
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,310
I think,

255
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,190
You have to find a way

256
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,960
to make her really become your person,

257
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,350
thus,

258
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,880
she can be better used by you.

259
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,430
Know her, analyze her,

260
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,720
go into her heart.

261
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,760
In a word, having her in mind.

262
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,430
Dr. Qin

263
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,080
likes reading such novels.

264
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,230
These heroes,

265
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,800
ten poker faces,

266
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
nine psychoses.

267
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,470
Indeed,

268
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,600
It's like you.

269
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,720
No.

270
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,270
The heroes,

271
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,960
either lost their memory in a car accident

272
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,080
or were terminally ill.

273
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,190
or their parents died

274
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,510
and their brothers betrayed them.

275
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,760
Or, you were also standing in the middle of the road,

276
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,040
I'll crash into you like in the novel.

277
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,390
I made a general analysis.

278
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
These are all problems

279
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,190
that can be solved with money,

280
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:18,880
which is the same as business.

281
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,510
It's simple.

282
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,720
Don't think about it.

283
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Trust me.

284
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,310
I will take full charge of the matter.

285
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,310
Chapter one

286
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,150
The president spends money on me.

287
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,760
However,

288
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,350
You must send money to her hospital,

289
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,310
let others envy her,

290
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
satisfy the vanity

291
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,720
of women.

292
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,550
But I want to remind you,

293
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,840
She's not a girl,

294
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,800
She is a weird aunt.

295
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,640
Is there something wrong with this person's brain?

296
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,040
He Qiaoyan is crazy.

297
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,720
He begins to retaliate against me because I'm not satisfied his request.

298
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,350
Secondly, date her in person.

299
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,430
Thoughts will throng her mind.

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,510
As soon as she goes out,

301
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,270
she will see you picking her up from work.

302
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,550
Right now,

303
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,470
You must plunder a burning house.

304
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,110
No,

305
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,510
You must strike while the iron is hot.

306
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,080
My god!

307
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,110
The swindler came after me.

308
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,000
She's gone.

309
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,430
Gone?

310
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,760
What are you doing?

311
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
Go after her!

312
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,230
Stop!

313
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,430
He's still following me.

314
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,040
I'll give you whatever you want.

315
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,110
As long as you want.

316
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,310
As long as I have.

317
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,600
You have to give me whatever I want.

318
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,760
As long as I want,

319
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
you have to give it to me.

320
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,190
he must be crazy.

321
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,230
No, no, not like this.

322
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,920
You're a macho boss,

323
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
not a robbery.

324
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,800
I'm not a robbery.

325
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,470
Robbery?

326
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,430
You screwed up.

327
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,510
I lost her.

328
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,760
Then keep on chasing.

329
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,150
Now I seriously doubt

330
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,190
the practicality and credibility

331
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,190
of your instructions.

332
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,040
Dealing with women...

333
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,880
Hello?

334
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,600
I have my own way.

335
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,760
How do you know my address?

336
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,350
I've read your resume.

337
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,550
Slow down, pretty.

338
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,390
Pretty.

339
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,350
Help!

340
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Help!

341
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,600
Hey!

342
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,350
Help!

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,190
What are you doing?

344
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
Run and call the police!

345
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,000
Who are you?

346
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So timid!

347
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,230
Do you have nothing to do?

348
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,000
Why don't you go to bed at night?

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,840
Come on!

350
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Get away!

351
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,270
Thank you.

352
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,079
Why did you run just now?

353
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,150
It is the social responsibility of every citizen

354
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,230
to be brave for a just cause.

355
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,390
You're the opposite.

356
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,150
Turn around and run.

357
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,150
I have

358
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,349
my own principles.

359
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,190
Just like that,

360
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,599
before it's clear,

361
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,640
I'm not going to do anything rash.

362
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,000
Stop.

363
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,510
Follow me.

364
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,350
Have the police finished with this?

365
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,270
They're done.

366
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Give me your hand.

367
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,270
It's a little painful. Take it easy.

368
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,150
Does it hurt?

369
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,510
Of course not.

370
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,550
Are you a man?

371
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,550
Okay.

372
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,390
It's done?

373
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,720
What about my wound infection?

374
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,760
Come to me if you are infected,

375
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,270
I have a magic hand,

376
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,350
can amputate for free.

377
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,080
Just now, at the end of the lane,

378
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,110
I saved you.

379
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,510
Based on the principle of equivalent exchange,

380
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,150
now, let's talk about

381
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,640
your way of return.

382
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,550
Are you kidding me?

383
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,470
I don't have any more. If you think this is not enough, don't take it.

384
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,470
Naive.

385
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,550
I declare,

386
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,000
from now on,

387
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,270
You're my man.

388
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,640
This is a token

389
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,840
of our agreement.

390
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,680
Here's one for you.

391
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,840
This is mine.

392
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,800
Let's make a pinky promise,

393
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
and it'll never change.

394
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,190
I'm not your man.

395
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,840
I'm your future boss.

396
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,840
The design is not aesthetic enough.

397
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,840
It needs to be separated from

398
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,110
the words "black" and "heavy".

399
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,110
Lack of adequate software and services,

400
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,550
and the user experience is poor,

401
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,470
and other issues.

402
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,350
Mr. He, what can I do for you?

403
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,390
Manager Xu,

404
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,640
I have a question for you.

405
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,960
Yes, please.

406
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,600
Recently,  in recruiting staff,

407
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,150
I encountered

408
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,550
a very difficult problem.

409
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,600
I offered the best conditions

410
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,880
within my ability,

411
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,470
but she was not interested.

412
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,600
You can try

413
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,840
to make the other person feel that

414
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,510
you not only recognize her ability,

415
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,920
but also are more willing to help her,

416
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,680
support her,

417
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
live and grow together.

418
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,960
It's the same as being in love.

419
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,680
Live and grow together?

420
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,510
Sure.

421
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,640
Go on.

422
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,600
Okay.

423
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,960
Look.

424
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,110
Because the public

425
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,230
has completely begun to

426
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,510
rely on smart phones,

427
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,000
and other smart devices

428
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,430
cannot be effectively applied,

429
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,640
it will only make people feel redundant.

430
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,640
There are difficulties in the definition of value.

431
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,230
Many products because...

432
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,960
Mr. He

433
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,880
Do you think our plan is not good?

434
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,600
Nothing.

435
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,310
Good.

436
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,720
Very good.

437
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,510
Young people's own needs,

438
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,720
and young people's awareness of

439
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
their own protection is gradually enhanced.

440
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,390
Value consumer groups

441
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,840
belong to the sensitive group.

442
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,350
As long as the product meets the actual demand,

443
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,000
and can also bring added value,

444
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,550
It will give users a stronger sense of experience

445
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,680
than cosmetics and clothing.

446
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,960
The first attempt of baking experiment.

447
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,840
Fault tolerance is

448
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,430
Zero.

449
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
Ready to start.

450
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,150
All right, it's done.

451
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,190
Mr. He,

452
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,040
It may take another 30 minutes

453
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,640
due  to traffic jam.

454
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,080
Is there another way?

455
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,150
The urban bus rapid transit

456
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,310
is the only one that won't get stuck.

457
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,000
Watch out, here is a kid.

458
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,960
I can't catch it.

459
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,270
It seems that Dr. Qin is not here.

460
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,600
And the last 30 seconds,

461
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,080
Let's see,

462
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,150
today,

463
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,680
who is the fish catcher?

464
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,640
Little friend,

465
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,720
You catch and uncle will help you pick them up,

466
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,430
ok?

467
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,390
If we win later,

468
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,080
just give me a candy.

469
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Dear children,

470
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,390
Dear parents,

471
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,430
Next part is the shooting game.

472
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,680
It's your turn to

473
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,270
do your best for the children.

474
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,350
It's our turn.

475
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,080
I want the pink rabbit

476
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,190
in skirt.

477
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,110
OK, I'll shoot it for you right away.

478
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,550
It looks like Dr. Qin's eyesight is not good.

479
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,000
Some things don't have to be forced.

480
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,000
Wait and see!

481
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,350
The last chance.

482
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,920
Come on, Dr. Qin.

483
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,040
A girl and a boy,

484
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,080
are walking

485
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,720
and then hit the muzzle of the gun.

486
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,000
They hurt their faces.

487
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,310
There's a generation gap

488
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,920
between uncle and the children born after 2010.

489
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,960
That guy,

490
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,800
It doesn't seem to be

491
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,840
a cold, stereotyped nuisance.

492
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,040
It's so hot.

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,760
I cannot bear this.

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,390
Let me apply a mask and go to bed.

495
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,960
Wei, is there a power cut?

496
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,190
Help me to check it.

497
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,430
I forgot to pay the electricity bill.

498
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,840
So the day after tomorrow is Xiaobao's birthday.

499
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:38,640
Mr. Wen

500
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Here you are.

501
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,920
This is the new test product

502
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,190
of R&D department

503
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,960
after debugging and modification.

504
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,920
And the outer packaging design

505
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
has also been modified.

506
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:49,960
True love guardian.

507
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,430
After it is bound with the app of the same name,

508
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,430
From a long distance.

509
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,470
it can master the physical condition

510
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,310
and geographical location of the other one.

511
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,920
And at the time of emergency,

512
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,600
it can send the emergency signal

513
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
to the other one.

514
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,150
It can make people feel

515
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,190
the protection of lovers all the time.

516
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,510
Mr. Wen,

517
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,150
His appearance

518
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,000
is really good.

519
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,430
He's getting better at dressing up.

520
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,880
Secretary Zhong here...

521
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,350
Don't think about our secretary.

522
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,150
Secretary Zhong,

523
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,960
Please pour me a cup of coffee.

524
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,080
I asked you to come to the meeting,

525
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,390
not for coffee

526
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,960
What is it?

527
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,550
Didn't you hear that?

528
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,190
This is our latest

529
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,920
and improved pair bracelet.

530
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,230
The one you're holding

531
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,600
is a pair with the one I'm holding.

532
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,760
Test it for me.

533
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,080
Are you declaring of love?

534
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,390
I didn't say I don't want it.

535
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,800
I heard about this product

536
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,000
can record

537
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,550
the heart of love.

538
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,550
Tonight,

539
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Just a chance to use it.

540
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,840
To test this product,

541
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,640
We need

542
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,230
an adult with normal mind.

543
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,080
Obviously you are not.

544
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,040
You laughed at me again.

545
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,680
No kidding,

546
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,470
The day after tomorrow is the tenth.

547
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,270
Do you have any plan?

548
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,470
Our Xiaobao,

549
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,110
built a small house.

550
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,880
Xiaobao,

551
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,600
Do you have any

552
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Birthday wish?

553
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,920
What's up?

554
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,760
Let Dr. Qin talk about it first.

555
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,040
Me, Dr. Qin,

556
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,600
I like birthday best,

557
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,880
but my birthday is in June,

558
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,040
either in time for the final exam

559
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,190
or the parents' meeting.

560
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,920
The worst is

561
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,550
it caught up with the math test in the college entrance examination.

562
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,760
So I can only envy

563
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,800
other people's children's parties.

564
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,350
I feel really sad, too.

565
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,600
Xiaobao,

566
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Can you tell me

567
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,040
if you have received

568
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,920
any special birthday presents?

569
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,680
Do you want to draw it?

570
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,000
Let me envy.

571
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,080
Xiaobao,

572
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,760
What's up?

573
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,960
All right, Xiaobao,

574
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,920
Dad's here.

575
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,840
Don't be afraid.

576
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,190
Why is Xiaobao like this?

577
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,000
It's all my fault.

578
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,920
Five years ago, on Xiaobao's birthday,

579
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,510
we both

580
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,720
lost our closest family.

581
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,150
Over the years,

582
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,600
Because of traumatic stress disorder,

583
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,150
Xiaobao doesn't want to talk

584
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,470
and meet strangers any more.

585
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,840
I hope to make Xiaobao

586
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,720
have the happiness

587
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,190
of his age again.

588
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
In recent years,

589
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,640
I checked all the information,

590
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,800
and consulted a lot of doctors.

591
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,840
But the results are not satisfactory.

592
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,110
How about this?

593
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:16,230
We have a birthday party for Xiaobao.

594
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,040
Since birthday

595
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,840
is one of his stressors,

596
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,720
so this is

597
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,270
the first breakthrough

598
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,190
to rebuild his trust system.

599
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,920
But I'm not sure,

600
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,430
if Xiaobao would like to.

601
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,960
Trust me this time.

602
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,920
I have to go back to the hospital first.

603
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,430
Well,

604
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,960
When I'm off this weekend,

605
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,190
I'll prepare for Xiaobao's birthday

606
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,430
with you.

607
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,080
Bye.

608
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,840
Together?

609
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,510
It's a deal.

610
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,000
Xiaobao is so cute,

611
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,040
but at a young age,

612
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,720
he's suffering so much,

613
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,350
which make me feel pain.

614
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,230
I've never heard of Mr. He was married.

615
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,840
He's probably married in seclusion.

616
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,920
No wonder he's like this.

617
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,270
This is the plot

618
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,350
of most novels on the Internet.

619
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,150
For the death of his beloved,

620
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,110
the hero blames himself,

621
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,080
then he cut off all his passions and desires,

622
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,430
and went to the mountain to practice in seclusion.

623
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,760
For decades,

624
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,880
he has been practicing peerless martial arts.

625
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,600
Practice?

626
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,760
Are you reading martial arts novels?

627
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,190
Does it mean

628
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,190
He Qiaoyan

629
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,430
want to unify the whole country?

630
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,600
But I didn't expect that,

631
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
this poker face

632
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,000
also has an affectionate side.

633
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,080
I don't know if he is affectionate,

634
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,230
I just cherish Xiaobao.

635
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,800
He lost his mother when he was so young,

636
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,760
and he had such a father.

637
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,510
So?

638
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,550
You're going to help him and his son?

639
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,080
I just want to help Xiaobao.

640
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,470
And,

641
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,680
it's my job as a doctor.

642
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,640
Okay.

643
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,550
Go ahead.

644
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,920
Warm hearted Qin heroine.

645
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,190
Before cooperation,

646
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,680
I'm used to negotiating all the agreements.

647
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,150
Although helping Xiaobao to celebrate his birthday

648
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,110
is also treating him,

649
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,000
it will take up

650
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,680
your private time outside of work.

651
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I will pay you

652
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,190
several times the price of your work as a reward.

653
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,800
In addition,

654
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,310
Before you formally accept

655
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,040
the invitation of the private doctor,

656
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:29,800
we will cooperate

657
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,760
in a short term.

658
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
It's the agreement.

659
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,080
Dr. Qin, please have a look.

660
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,430
Do you have a pen?

661
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,190
Dr. Qin, that's a pencil,

662
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,600
not suitable for signing a contract.

663
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,110
Pleasant cooperation.

664
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,600
Pleasant cooperation.

665
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,350
Never Go Back.

666
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,840
Never.

667
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,150
What do you mean?

668
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,150
There is nothing

669
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,760
that a hot pot can't solve.

670
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,390
If there is,

671
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,800
add another cup of milk tea.

672
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,190
I'm hungry.

673
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,510
Please help yourself, Miss Qin.

674
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,110
Hot Pot.

675
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,350
Here we are.

676
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,469
What are you doing?

677
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:45,760
This is the second generation of health bracelet

678
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,719
launched by our company.

679
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,429
Give you.

680
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,510
You see that

681
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,429
I'm not moved by money,

682
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,230
so you try to

683
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,600
please me

684
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,550
with these small favors.

685
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,469
Here is the sample.

686
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,310
You are one of the experience users.

687
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,080
Sample?

688
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,800
This is a lover's bracelet.

689
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,680
Where is the one

690
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,510
that matches my bracelet?

691
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,840
There's a call button.

692
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,270
I want to make a call.

693
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,150
Well,

694
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,600
If you have anything cannot understand,

695
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,230
take the manual

696
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,390
and go home to study by yourself.

697
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,150
It's getting late.

698
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,390
It's time for you to go home.

699
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,470
Get out of the car.

700
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,470
Is it great to have a car with a loud sound?

701
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:09,190
I made an appointment with Dr. Qin today

702
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,190
for dinner tomorrow.

703
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,270
If some people don't want to go,

704
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,270
I'll call and cancel.

705
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,880
What's up?

706
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,150
Mr. Bao has changed his mind?

707
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Are you all right?

708
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,310
Feel it.

709
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,040
You have a slight fever.

710
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:48,350
Did you take any medicine?

711
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,040
I can't take medicine.

712
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,080
If I take medicine,

713
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,640
I can't serve the patient today.

714
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,550
I'll have some warm water first.

715
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,800
The second generation of health bracelets

716
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,110
has only been pre purchased for a week.

717
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,880
Compared with the first generation,

718
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,550
the pre-sale volume has increased

719
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,800
by 27%.

720
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:10,390
So we decided to take the opportunity to launch

721
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,600
limited edition gold

722
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,000
and leather strap.

723
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,150
Uncomfortable.

724
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,510
Uncomfortable?

725
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,230
Is it because

726
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,150
the leather strap is not waterproof?

727
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,270
Or because of the metal strap,

728
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,040
which is not convenient

729
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,000
when people taking exercise?

730
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,720
It's comfortable when I wear it.

731
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,800
And the results of internal tests

732
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,600
is very satisfactory.

733
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,000
Well,

734
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,270
Let's take a five-minute break.

735
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,510
Dr. Qin, are you not feeling well?

736
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,510
You bribed Ruowei?

737
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,310
It's your bracelet data.

738
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
You have a slight fever now,

739
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,960
and sleep debt.

740
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,510
Aren't you a doctor?

741
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,270
Buddy, doctor is also human.

742
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,110
Doctors get sick, too, OK?

743
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,470
Remember to take the medicine.

744
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,600
Don't infect other patients.

745
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,640
Sis,

746
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,270
that...

747
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,150
That man,

748
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:35,920
He knows you have a cold.

749
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,680
So...

750
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,080
I'll get rid of it right away.

751
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,110
I'll eat.

752
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,270
Orange didn't do anything wrong.

753
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,190
Come on, have some too

754
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,960
Sis,

755
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,680
Are you really not going to get a cold medicine?

756
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,880
No.

757
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,600
I'm allergic to cold medicine.

758
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,840
It makes me drowsy.

759
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,470
But don't worry,

760
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,960
I took two tablets of vitamin C first.

761
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,880
It should be able to get through the current difficulties.

762
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,960
So tired.

763
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,510
Yiyue, I'm leaving.

764
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm on a business trip at ten o'clock.

765
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,640
Can you handle it by yourself

766
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,270
You remember to take the medicine.

767
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,310
Call me if you need anything

768
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:29,920
Dear,

769
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,470
See you.

770
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,880
So tired

771
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,110
I feel sore all over.

772
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
I'd better take a bath.

773
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
Xiaobao, You wait for Dad in the car.

774
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,270
I'll go up and see Dr. Qin

775
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Qin Yiyue

776
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,000
Qin Yiyue

777
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,270
Why am I so sleepy.

778
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,800
I feel sore all over.

779
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:38,920
Not good

780
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,800
I think I have a fever.

781
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,680
I can't sleep in the bathtub

782
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,350
Password lock.

783
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,680
Validation failed.

784
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,760
Which one should it be?

785
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,040
The fingerprints

786
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,350
are concentrated in three places.

787
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,000
Six, seven, zero.

788
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,600
Validation failed.

789
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,000
Six, seven.

790
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,270
Incorrect.

791
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,110
Dr. Qin,

792
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,640
I like birthday best,

793
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,960
but my birthday is in June,

794
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,150
either in time for the final exam

795
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,270
or the parents' meeting.

796
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,040
The worst is

797
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,550
it caught up with the math test in the college entrance examination.

798
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,800
Qin Yiyue

799
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,080
