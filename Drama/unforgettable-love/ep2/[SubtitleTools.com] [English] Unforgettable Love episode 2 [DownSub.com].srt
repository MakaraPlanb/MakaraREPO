Unforgettable Love
EP02

2
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,310
Here's one for you.

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
This is mine.

4
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,190
Let's make a pinky promise,

5
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,270
and it'll never change.

6
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,190
Let go of his hands.

7
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,520
Aunt, please excuse me.

8
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,630
Aunt?

9
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,080
Hey, you...

10
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,960
It's you!

11
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,630
What a small world.

12
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,310
What happened last night

13
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,630
was planned by you, right?

14
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,479
It is a

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,080
very subtle plan.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,400
From live to offline,

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,229
Until Xiaobao disappeared,

18
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,270
you showed up by chance.

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,479
Nothing more nor less,

20
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,229
the video is nearly a minute in length,

21
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,229
and spread on the Internet.

22
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,080
From last night to today,

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,670
you haven't lost anything.

24
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,590
But my company

25
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,190
has taken on

26
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,400
heavy financial losses

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
and immense public pressure.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
What are you drivelling about?

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,150
Come on, how much do you want?

30
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,000
You've suffered a loss?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,310
I've also suffered losses.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
I have been unaccountably implicated.

33
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,230
Just name your price.

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,110
Two hundred.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,590
I'm right.

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,229
Check.

37
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,310
Don't be like in the TV series.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,560
Two hundred yuan.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,670
Two hundred yuan?

40
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,440
Are you taunting me?

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,710
For us girls,

42
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,520
you can kill me,

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,400
but you can't mess up my haircut.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,440
Look,

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,110
what you've done

46
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,360
to this hair!

47
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm going to ask the best hairdresser

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,190
to cut my hair.

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,230
Two hundred yuan.

50
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,400
It's really puzzling.

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,230
I don't want more.

52
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,310
Xiaobao,

53
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,840
There are weird aunts everywhere.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
You must pay attention to

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,960
personal safety in the future.

56
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,790
Do you understand?

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,480
Hey...

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,670
Let's go home.

59
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
You are weird uncle.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
He Weifei,

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,270
I haven't received those two cards

62
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,110
for so many years,

63
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,670
but you gave them to a weird aunt.

64
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:47,480
Forget it.

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll take you to

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,310
a more normal hospital.

67
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,110
Go!

68
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,000
How long are you going to

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,750
confront me?

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,589
Let's talk about it calmly.

71
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
You can put forward your needs.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,790
Dr. Qin?

73
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,310
What does Dr. Qin mean?

74
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,190
You want Dr. Qin to come to our home

75
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,750
and be your doctor?

76
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,880
Turn off the light and go sleep.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,590
Mr. He.

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,230
This is what I collected and sorted out

79
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,880
all information of Dr. Qin Yiyue.

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,880
Did you see the two meetings

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,230
between Xiaobao and Dr. Qin

82
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,000
with your own eyes?

83
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,710
It's the first time I saw Xiaobao

84
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,750
can be so close

85
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,590
to a stranger.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,270
It's strange, to be honest.

87
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm so surprised.

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,750
After all these years,

89
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,080
I've been so nice to Xiaobao,

90
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,150
he didn't even let me

91
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,150
touch his little hand.

92
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,230
Look.

93
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,190
Look at it.

94
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm so curious.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,880
Which fairy she is,

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
can shake the big and small icebergs

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,630
in your family?

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,080
She was born in a county

99
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,190
next to Qincheng.

100
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,920
Her parents

101
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,270
are all ordinary workers.

102
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
From primary school to high school,

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,790
she never left that small county.

104
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,310
She has no

105
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,790
background of studying abroad.

106
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,790
She has only worked for three years

107
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,080
and with little clinical experience.

108
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,590
All in all,

109
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,520
She can't compete with

110
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,790
overseas medical experts.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,590
Most importantly,

112
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,190
her temper

113
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,840
is very unstable

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
and moody.

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,670
In terms of both short-term cooperation

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,270
and long-term development,

117
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,190
cooperation with her

118
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,040
is more harm than good.

119
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,360
You can do chart analysis for all of this.

120
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,440
I also considered

121
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
using value portfolio management model

122
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,000
or 7S model for analysis,

123
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,080
but I found that,

124
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,670
the available data did not support it.

125
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,750
Lao He,

126
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,710
not all people and things

127
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,710
can be explained

128
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,590
by business logic.

129
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,920
You're wrong.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
I have an employment relationship with her,

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,360
which is an equal exchange

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,190
of salary and talents.

133
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,920
So you've seen her twice.

134
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,040
What do you think of her?

135
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
and it'll never change...

136
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,630
She's quite special.

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
Tell me.

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,080
That's all right.

139
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,560
So much nonsense.

140
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,710
Very wierd

141
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,560
Xiaobao likes her very much.

142
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,880
Although the child doesn't speak,

143
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
he is smart,

144
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,840
just like his father.

145
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,190
He knows how to

146
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
judge a person.

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,440
Xiaobao is always my most important Party A.

148
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,270
He has the right to appoint partners.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,560
I'll trust him for a while.

150
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,880
Good morning, Mr. He.

151
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,630
Good morning.

152
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,270
Mr. He, Miss Qin politely refused.

153
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,190
She said she doesn't receive patients

154
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,350
during the vacation.

155
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:28,880
In addition,

156
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,720
About the personal doctor,

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,600
She also refused.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,110
Refuse the Prince Charming of Qincheng girls?

159
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
This is something new.

160
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,549
I'm more and more curious

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,039
about Dr. Qin.

162
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,039
It seems that I need to

163
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,429
send her an e-mail in person.

164
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,880
E-mail?

165
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,680
Oh my God, only you can do this.

166
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,760
Let me see.

167
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,190
For the contract and related matters,

168
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,080
please refer to the attachment.

169
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,390
Please find the attachment.

170
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Bro, you are too rigid.

171
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,350
It's strange that she will accept your request.

172
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,470
You just wait and see.

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,550
What are you doing?

174
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,190
Girls in nowadays

175
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,720
don't value money,

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,150
they value your character.

177
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,600
It's in vain to

178
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,880
give you such a good appearance.

179
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't make trouble for me.

180
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,760
Give it to me.

181
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,110
Wait a moment.

182
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,150
With 100 MB optical fiber,

183
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,000
even if you turn it off,

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
it can be sent out.

185
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,110
It's disgusting.

186
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,720
He's a psychopath,

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,310
and a narcissist.

188
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,270
It's all pictures of himself.

189
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,920
You can send,

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,430
I can delete.

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,960
Delete.

192
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,920
Don't want to look.

193
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,600
I thought as much.

194
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,840
As for the formal negotiation,

195
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,310
I have to come in person.

196
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,190
Hello.

197
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,080
This is He Qiaoyan,

198
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,190
CEO of the Heshi Group.

199
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,230
I'd like to invite you

200
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,000
to our company tomorrow.

201
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,110
You're the CEO?

202
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,470
I'm the chairman.

203
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,960
This kind of phone fraud,

204
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,600
I'll report one by one.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,680
Hello?

206
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,640
Hung up.

207
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,390
Phone fraud?

208
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,080
It's impossible for me to be a private doctor.

209
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm a full-time doctor.

210
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,550
Our hospital has regulations.

211
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,080
I've negotiated

212
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,230
with the Director.

213
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,350
Don't worry.

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Besides, the money is just a deposit.

215
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:12,840
Dr. Qin

216
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,230
is an absolute beneficiary.

217
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,470
Your salary and bonus

218
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,270
will only double.

219
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,510
In your eyes,

220
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,840
everything can be done

221
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,510
with money?

222
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,600
It is true theoretically.

223
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,800
Because everything

224
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,350
has its equivalent value match.

225
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,390
Can children's psychological deficiency

226
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,040
be cured with money?

227
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,960
Not exactly.

228
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,840
But at least in material terms,

229
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
whatever he wants,

230
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,960
I can satisfy him.

231
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,880
Including you.

232
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Sorry, Mr. He.

233
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,350
I feel offended

234
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,550
and don't want to see you again.

235
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,430
Please leave.

236
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,190
I'm so tough.

237
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,000
I regard money like dirt.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
It's not in vain to read novels dominated by heroines.

239
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
About business negotiation,

240
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,760
Often I get used to

241
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
saying bluntly first.

242
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,800
Please leave now.

243
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,720
Excuse me.

244
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,040
Really left?

245
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,110
She pushed you out of the door?

246
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,000
She read the contract.

247
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,110
The deposit was also in front of her.

248
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,760
She still won't cooperate with me.

249
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,190
I haven't had such a tough project

250
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,640
in a long time.

251
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,150
I put out a lever,

252
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,920
but I couldn't find the fulcrum to pry her.

253
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,230
It's really not an ordinary woman.

254
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,310
I think,

255
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,190
You have to find a way

256
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,960
to make her really become your person,

257
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,350
thus,

258
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,880
she can be better used by you.

259
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,430
Know her, analyze her,

260
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,720
go into her heart.

261
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,760
In a word, having her in mind.

262
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,430
Dr. Qin

263
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,080
likes reading such novels.

264
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,230
These heroes,

265
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,800
ten poker faces,

266
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,920
nine psychoses.

267
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,470
Indeed,

268
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,600
It's like you.

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
No.

270
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,270
The heroes,

271
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,960
either lost their memory in a car accident

272
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,080
or were terminally ill.

273
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,190
or their parents died

274
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,510
and their brothers betrayed them.

275
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,760
Or, you were also standing in the middle of the road,

276
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
I'll crash into you like in the novel.

277
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,390
I made a general analysis.

278
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
These are all problems

279
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,190
that can be solved with money,

280
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,880
which is the same as business.

281
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,510
It's simple.

282
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,720
Don't think about it.

283
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Trust me.

284
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,310
I will take full charge of the matter.

285
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,310
Chapter one

286
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,150
The president spends money on me.

287
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,760
However,

288
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,350
You must send money to her hospital,

289
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,310
let others envy her,

290
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
satisfy the vanity

291
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
of women.

292
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,550
But I want to remind you,

293
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,840
She's not a girl,

294
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,800
She is a weird aunt.

295
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,640
Is there something wrong with this person's brain?

296
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,040
He Qiaoyan is crazy.

297
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,720
He begins to retaliate against me because I'm not satisfied his request.

298
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,350
Secondly, date her in person.

299
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,430
Thoughts will throng her mind.

300
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,510
As soon as she goes out,

301
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,270
she will see you picking her up from work.

302
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,550
Right now,

303
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,470
You must plunder a burning house.

304
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,110
No,

305
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,510
You must strike while the iron is hot.

306
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,080
My god!

307
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,110
The swindler came after me.

308
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,000
She's gone.

309
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,430
Gone?

310
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,760
What are you doing?

311
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,920
Go after her!

312
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,230
Stop!

313
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,430
He's still following me.

314
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,040
I'll give you whatever you want.

315
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,110
As long as you want.

316
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,310
As long as I have.

317
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,600
You have to give me whatever I want.

318
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
As long as I want,

319
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,960
you have to give it to me.

320
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,190
he must be crazy.

321
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,230
No, no, not like this.

322
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,920
You're a macho boss,

323
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
not a robbery.

324
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm not a robbery.

325
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,470
Robbery?

326
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,430
You screwed up.

327
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,510
I lost her.

328
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,760
Then keep on chasing.

329
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,150
Now I seriously doubt

330
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,190
the practicality and credibility

331
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,190
of your instructions.

332
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,040
Dealing with women...

333
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,880
Hello?

334
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,600
I have my own way.

335
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,760
How do you know my address?

336
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,350
I've read your resume.

337
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,550
Slow down, pretty.

338
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,390
Pretty.

339
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,350
Help!

340
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,000
Help!

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,600
Hey!

342
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,350
Help!

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,190
What are you doing?

344
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Run and call the police!

345
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,000
Who are you?

346
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
So timid!

347
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,230
Do you have nothing to do?

348
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,000
Why don't you go to bed at night?

349
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,840
Come on!

350
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,680
Get away!

351
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,270
Thank you.

352
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,079
Why did you run just now?

353
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,150
It is the social responsibility of every citizen

354
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,230
to be brave for a just cause.

355
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,390
You're the opposite.

356
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,150
Turn around and run.

357
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,150
I have

358
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,349
my own principles.

359
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:24,190
Just like that,

360
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,599
before it's clear,

361
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm not going to do anything rash.

362
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,000
Stop.

363
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,510
Follow me.

364
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,350
Have the police finished with this?

365
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,270
They're done.

366
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,000
Give me your hand.

367
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,270
It's a little painful. Take it easy.

368
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,150
Does it hurt?

369
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,510
Of course not.

370
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,550
Are you a man?

371
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,550
Okay.

372
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,390
It's done?

373
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,720
What about my wound infection?

374
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,760
Come to me if you are infected,

375
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,270
I have a magic hand,

376
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,350
can amputate for free.

377
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,080
Just now, at the end of the lane,

378
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,110
I saved you.

379
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,510
Based on the principle of equivalent exchange,

380
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,150
now, let's talk about

381
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,640
your way of return.

382
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,550
Are you kidding me?

383
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,470
I don't have any more. If you think this is not enough, don't take it.

384
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,470
Naive.

385
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,550
I declare,

386
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,000
from now on,

387
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,270
You're my man.

388
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,640
This is a token

389
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,840
of our agreement.

390
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,680
Here's one for you.

391
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,840
This is mine.

392
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,800
Let's make a pinky promise,

393
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,000
and it'll never change.

394
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,190
I'm not your man.

395
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,840
I'm your future boss.

396
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,840
The design is not aesthetic enough.

397
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,840
It needs to be separated from

398
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,110
the words "black" and "heavy".

399
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,110
Lack of adequate software and services,

400
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,550
and the user experience is poor,

401
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,470
and other issues.

402
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,350
Mr. He, what can I do for you?

403
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,390
Manager Xu,

404
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,640
I have a question for you.

405
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:28,960
Yes, please.

406
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,600
Recently,  in recruiting staff,

407
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,150
I encountered

408
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,550
a very difficult problem.

409
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,600
I offered the best conditions

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,880
within my ability,

411
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,470
but she was not interested.

412
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,600
You can try

413
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,840
to make the other person feel that

414
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,510
you not only recognize her ability,

415
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,920
but also are more willing to help her,

416
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,680
support her,

417
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,840
live and grow together.

418
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,960
It's the same as being in love.

419
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,680
Live and grow together?

420
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,510
Sure.

421
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,640
Go on.

422
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay.

423
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,960
Look.

424
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,110
Because the public

425
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,230
has completely begun to

426
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,510
rely on smart phones,

427
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,000
and other smart devices

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,430
cannot be effectively applied,

429
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,640
it will only make people feel redundant.

430
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,640
There are difficulties in the definition of value.

431
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,230
Many products because...

432
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,960
Mr. He

433
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,880
Do you think our plan is not good?

434
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,600
Nothing.

435
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,310
Good.

436
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,720
Very good.

437
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,510
Young people's own needs,

438
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,720
and young people's awareness of

439
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,920
their own protection is gradually enhanced.

440
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,390
Value consumer groups

441
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,840
belong to the sensitive group.

442
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,350
As long as the product meets the actual demand,

443
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
and can also bring added value,

444
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,550
It will give users a stronger sense of experience

445
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,680
than cosmetics and clothing.

446
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,960
The first attempt of baking experiment.

447
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,840
Fault tolerance is

448
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,430
Zero.

449
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Ready to start.

450
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,150
All right, it's done.

451
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,190
Mr. He,

452
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,040
It may take another 30 minutes

453
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,640
due  to traffic jam.

454
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
Is there another way?

455
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,150
The urban bus rapid transit

456
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,310
is the only one that won't get stuck.

457
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,000
Watch out, here is a kid.

458
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,960
I can't catch it.

459
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,270
It seems that Dr. Qin is not here.

460
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,600
And the last 30 seconds,

461
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,080
Let's see,

462
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,150
today,

463
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,680
who is the fish catcher?

464
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,640
Little friend,

465
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,720
You catch and uncle will help you pick them up,

466
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,430
ok?

467
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,390
If we win later,

468
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,080
just give me a candy.

469
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,000
Dear children,

470
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,390
Dear parents,

471
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,430
Next part is the shooting game.

472
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,680
It's your turn to

473
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,270
do your best for the children.

474
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,350
It's our turn.

475
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,080
I want the pink rabbit

476
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,190
in skirt.

477
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,110
OK, I'll shoot it for you right away.

478
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,550
It looks like Dr. Qin's eyesight is not good.

479
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,000
Some things don't have to be forced.

480
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,000
Wait and see!

481
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,350
The last chance.

482
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,920
Come on, Dr. Qin.

483
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,040
A girl and a boy,

484
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,080
are walking

485
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,720
and then hit the muzzle of the gun.

486
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,000
They hurt their faces.

487
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,310
There's a generation gap

488
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,920
between uncle and the children born after 2010.

489
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,960
That guy,

490
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,800
It doesn't seem to be

491
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,840
a cold, stereotyped nuisance.

492
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,040
It's so hot.

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,760
I cannot bear this.

494
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,390
Let me apply a mask and go to bed.

495
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,960
Wei, is there a power cut?

496
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,190
Help me to check it.

497
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,430
I forgot to pay the electricity bill.

498
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,840
So the day after tomorrow is Xiaobao's birthday.

499
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,640
Mr. Wen

500
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Here you are.

501
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,920
This is the new test product

502
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,190
of R&D department

503
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,960
after debugging and modification.

504
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,920
And the outer packaging design

505
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,960
has also been modified.

506
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,960
True love guardian.

507
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,430
After it is bound with the app of the same name,

508
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,430
From a long distance.

509
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,470
it can master the physical condition

510
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,310
and geographical location of the other one.

511
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,920
And at the time of emergency,

512
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,600
it can send the emergency signal

513
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,760
to the other one.

514
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,150
It can make people feel

515
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,190
the protection of lovers all the time.

516
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,510
Mr. Wen,

517
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,150
His appearance

518
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,000
is really good.

519
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,430
He's getting better at dressing up.

520
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,880
Secretary Zhong here...

521
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,350
Don't think about our secretary.

522
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,150
Secretary Zhong,

523
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,960
Please pour me a cup of coffee.

524
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,080
I asked you to come to the meeting,

525
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,390
not for coffee

526
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:33,960
What is it?

527
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,550
Didn't you hear that?

528
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,190
This is our latest

529
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,920
and improved pair bracelet.

530
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,230
The one you're holding

531
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,600
is a pair with the one I'm holding.

532
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,760
Test it for me.

533
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,080
Are you declaring of love?

534
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,390
I didn't say I don't want it.

535
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,800
I heard about this product

536
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,000
can record

537
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,550
the heart of love.

538
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,550
Tonight,

539
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,760
Just a chance to use it.

540
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,840
To test this product,

541
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,640
We need

542
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,230
an adult with normal mind.

543
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,080
Obviously you are not.

544
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,040
You laughed at me again.

545
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,680
No kidding,

546
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,470
The day after tomorrow is the tenth.

547
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,270
Do you have any plan?

548
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,470
Our Xiaobao,

549
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,110
built a small house.

550
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,880
Xiaobao,

551
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,600
Do you have any

552
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,800
Birthday wish?

553
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,920
What's up?

554
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,760
Let Dr. Qin talk about it first.

555
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,040
Me, Dr. Qin,

556
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,600
I like birthday best,

557
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,880
but my birthday is in June,

558
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,040
either in time for the final exam

559
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,190
or the parents' meeting.

560
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,920
The worst is

561
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,550
it caught up with the math test in the college entrance examination.

562
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,760
So I can only envy

563
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,800
other people's children's parties.

564
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,350
I feel really sad, too.

565
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
Xiaobao,

566
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Can you tell me

567
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,040
if you have received

568
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,920
any special birthday presents?

569
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,680
Do you want to draw it?

570
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,000
Let me envy.

571
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,080
Xiaobao,

572
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
What's up?

573
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
All right, Xiaobao,

574
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,920
Dad's here.

575
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,840
Don't be afraid.

576
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,190
Why is Xiaobao like this?

577
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,000
It's all my fault.

578
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,920
Five years ago, on Xiaobao's birthday,

579
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,510
we both

580
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,720
lost our closest family.

581
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,150
Over the years,

582
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,600
Because of traumatic stress disorder,

583
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,150
Xiaobao doesn't want to talk

584
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,470
and meet strangers any more.

585
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,840
I hope to make Xiaobao

586
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,720
have the happiness

587
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,190
of his age again.

588
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
In recent years,

589
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,640
I checked all the information,

590
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,800
and consulted a lot of doctors.

591
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,840
But the results are not satisfactory.

592
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,110
How about this?

593
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,230
We have a birthday party for Xiaobao.

594
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,040
Since birthday

595
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,840
is one of his stressors,

596
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,720
so this is

597
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,270
the first breakthrough

598
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,190
to rebuild his trust system.

599
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,920
But I'm not sure,

600
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,430
if Xiaobao would like to.

601
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,960
Trust me this time.

602
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,920
I have to go back to the hospital first.

603
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,430
Well,

604
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,960
When I'm off this weekend,

605
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,190
I'll prepare for Xiaobao's birthday

606
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,430
with you.

607
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,080
Bye.

608
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,840
Together?

609
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,510
It's a deal.

610
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,000
Xiaobao is so cute,

611
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,040
but at a young age,

612
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,720
he's suffering so much,

613
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,350
which make me feel pain.

614
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,230
I've never heard of Mr. He was married.

615
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,840
He's probably married in seclusion.

616
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,920
No wonder he's like this.

617
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,270
This is the plot

618
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,350
of most novels on the Internet.

619
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,150
For the death of his beloved,

620
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,110
the hero blames himself,

621
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,080
then he cut off all his passions and desires,

622
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,430
and went to the mountain to practice in seclusion.

623
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,760
For decades,

624
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,880
he has been practicing peerless martial arts.

625
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,600
Practice?

626
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,760
Are you reading martial arts novels?

627
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,190
Does it mean

628
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,190
He Qiaoyan

629
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,430
want to unify the whole country?

630
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,600
But I didn't expect that,

631
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,800
this poker face

632
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,000
also has an affectionate side.

633
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,080
I don't know if he is affectionate,

634
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,230
I just cherish Xiaobao.

635
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,800
He lost his mother when he was so young,

636
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,760
and he had such a father.

637
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,510
So?

638
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,550
You're going to help him and his son?

639
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,080
I just want to help Xiaobao.

640
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,470
And,

641
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:54,680
it's my job as a doctor.

642
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,640
Okay.

643
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,550
Go ahead.

644
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,920
Warm hearted Qin heroine.

645
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,190
Before cooperation,

646
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,680
I'm used to negotiating all the agreements.

647
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,150
Although helping Xiaobao to celebrate his birthday

648
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,110
is also treating him,

649
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
it will take up

650
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,680
your private time outside of work.

651
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
I will pay you

652
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,190
several times the price of your work as a reward.

653
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,800
In addition,

654
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,310
Before you formally accept

655
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,040
the invitation of the private doctor,

656
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:37,800
we will cooperate

657
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,760
in a short term.

658
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,760
It's the agreement.

659
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,080
Dr. Qin, please have a look.

660
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,430
Do you have a pen?

661
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,190
Dr. Qin, that's a pencil,

662
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,600
not suitable for signing a contract.

663
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,110
Pleasant cooperation.

664
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,600
Pleasant cooperation.

665
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,350
Never Go Back.

666
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,840
Never.

667
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,150
What do you mean?

668
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,150
There is nothing

669
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,760
that a hot pot can't solve.

670
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,390
If there is,

671
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,800
add another cup of milk tea.

672
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,190
I'm hungry.

673
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,510
Please help yourself, Miss Qin.

674
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,110
Hot Pot.

675
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,350
Here we are.

676
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:52,469
What are you doing?

677
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,760
This is the second generation of health bracelet

678
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,719
launched by our company.

679
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,429
Give you.

680
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,510
You see that

681
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,429
I'm not moved by money,

682
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:01,230
so you try to

683
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,600
please me

684
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,550
with these small favors.

685
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,469
Here is the sample.

686
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,310
You are one of the experience users.

687
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,080
Sample?

688
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,800
This is a lover's bracelet.

689
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,680
Where is the one

690
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,510
that matches my bracelet?

691
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,840
There's a call button.

692
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,270
I want to make a call.

693
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,150
Well,

694
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,600
If you have anything cannot understand,

695
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,230
take the manual

696
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,390
and go home to study by yourself.

697
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,150
It's getting late.

698
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,390
It's time for you to go home.

699
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,470
Get out of the car.

700
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,470
Is it great to have a car with a loud sound?

701
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,190
I made an appointment with Dr. Qin today

702
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,190
for dinner tomorrow.

703
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,270
If some people don't want to go,

704
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,270
I'll call and cancel.

705
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,880
What's up?

706
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,150
Mr. Bao has changed his mind?

707
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
Are you all right?

708
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,310
Feel it.

709
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,040
You have a slight fever.

710
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,350
Did you take any medicine?

711
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,040
I can't take medicine.

712
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,080
If I take medicine,

713
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,640
I can't serve the patient today.

714
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,550
I'll have some warm water first.

715
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
The second generation of health bracelets

716
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,110
has only been pre purchased for a week.

717
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:13,880
Compared with the first generation,

718
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,550
the pre-sale volume has increased

719
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,800
by 27%.

720
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,390
So we decided to take the opportunity to launch

721
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,600
limited edition gold

722
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,000
and leather strap.

723
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,150
Uncomfortable.

724
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,510
Uncomfortable?

725
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,230
Is it because

726
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,150
the leather strap is not waterproof?

727
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,270
Or because of the metal strap,

728
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,040
which is not convenient

729
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,000
when people taking exercise?

730
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,720
It's comfortable when I wear it.

731
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,800
And the results of internal tests

732
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,600
is very satisfactory.

733
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,000
Well,

734
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,270
Let's take a five-minute break.

735
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,510
Dr. Qin, are you not feeling well?

736
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,510
You bribed Ruowei?

737
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,310
It's your bracelet data.

738
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,760
You have a slight fever now,

739
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,960
and sleep debt.

740
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,510
Aren't you a doctor?

741
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,270
Buddy, doctor is also human.

742
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,110
Doctors get sick, too, OK?

743
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,470
Remember to take the medicine.

744
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,600
Don't infect other patients.

745
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,640
Sis,

746
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,270
that...

747
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,150
That man,

748
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,920
He knows you have a cold.

749
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,680
So...

750
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,080
I'll get rid of it right away.

751
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,110
I'll eat.

752
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,270
Orange didn't do anything wrong.

753
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,190
Come on, have some too

754
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:01,960
Sis,

755
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,680
Are you really not going to get a cold medicine?

756
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,880
No.

757
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,600
I'm allergic to cold medicine.

758
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,840
It makes me drowsy.

759
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,470
But don't worry,

760
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,960
I took two tablets of vitamin C first.

761
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,880
It should be able to get through the current difficulties.

762
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,960
So tired.

763
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,510
Yiyue, I'm leaving.

764
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,840
I'm on a business trip at ten o'clock.

765
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,640
Can you handle it by yourself

766
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,270
You remember to take the medicine.

767
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,310
Call me if you need anything

768
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:37,920
Dear,

769
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,470
See you.

770
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,880
So tired

771
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,110
I feel sore all over.

772
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,000
I'd better take a bath.

773
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,960
Xiaobao, You wait for Dad in the car.

774
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,270
I'll go up and see Dr. Qin

775
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Qin Yiyue

776
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,000
Qin Yiyue

777
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,270
Why am I so sleepy.

778
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,800
I feel sore all over.

779
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:46,920
Not good

780
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,800
I think I have a fever.

781
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,680
I can't sleep in the bathtub

782
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,350
Password lock.

783
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,680
Validation failed.

784
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,760
Which one should it be?

785
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,040
The fingerprints

786
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,350
are concentrated in three places.

787
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,000
Six, seven, zero.

788
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,600
Validation failed.

789
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,000
Six, seven.

790
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,270
Incorrect.

791
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,110
Dr. Qin,

792
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,640
I like birthday best,

793
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,960
but my birthday is in June,

794
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,150
either in time for the final exam

795
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,270
or the parents' meeting.

796
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,040
The worst is

797
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,550
it caught up with the math test in the college entrance examination.

798
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,800
Qin Yiyue

799
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,080
