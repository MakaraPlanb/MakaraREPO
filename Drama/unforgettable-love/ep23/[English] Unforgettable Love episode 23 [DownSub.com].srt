1
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,110
Unforgettable Love

2
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,920
Yiyue, will you go with me?

3
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,630
Where are you taking me to?

4
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,039
Why are you here?

5
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,270
I'm not finished yet.

6
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,310
Others express their love

7
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,000
to those

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
people they like.

9
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,040
But you express love to motivate your rival.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,110
So well intentioned.

11
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,590
Thanks for setting up the venue.

12
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,270
Have you ever thought about

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
what if He Qiaoyan

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
did not come here?

15
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,400
Then he's not qualified

16
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,480
to make Yiyue happy.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,230
And I will take her to German.

18
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,110
Good afternoon, Sir.

19
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,750
Good afternoon.

20
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:32,880
Xiaobao

21
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,110
What happened to him?

22
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,630
I don't know why Xiaobao

23
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,750
insisted on playing basketball by himself

24
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,790
on the playground

25
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,670
and refused to go back to classroom.

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,310
My apology, Sir.

27
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,790
Can we have a minute

28
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,000
with Xiaobao alone?

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,270
Yes.

30
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,560
Sure.

31
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,480
Thanks.

32
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,110
No problem.

33
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,400
Xiaobao

34
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,230
Why do you want to play basketball?

35
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,230
Xiaobao

36
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,960
Is there anything

37
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,000
you want to talk to me?

38
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,150
To play basketball.

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,670
You want to play basketball

40
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,360
with your daddy, right?

41
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,590
Playing basketball is fun.

42
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,000
If your daddy is here

43
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,080
he will teach you how to play basketball.

44
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
And he will try his best

45
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,080
to win you by tricks.

46
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,630
Daddy

47
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,630
Xiaobao, say that again.

48
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,790
Daddy

49
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,710
Good boy.

50
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,480
Go, my boy.

51
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,190
Coming for you.

52
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,880
Do you think

53
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,840
there is love in the world?

54
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,270
Forget about it.

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,630
You are unrequited.

56
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,630
Even if you say so,

57
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,630
I don't buy it.

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,310
Then what do you think love is?

59
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
No clue.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,590
But I know that

61
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,040
I have nothing to do with that thing.

62
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,840
Your anxiety disorder

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
has been lasting for years?

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,880
Since the second year after studying abroad.

65
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,270
Something wrong?

66
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,920
You know...

67
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,190
I was like a bird escaping from a cage

68
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,590
in the first year

69
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,560
when I went abroad.

70
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,400
My design work in that year

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,920
earned me the Broom Top Award.

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
But I knew it later that

73
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,670
at that time

74
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,590
the award I won at home

75
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
was not by my design.

76
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,110
It was all

77
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,150
my mother's plan.

78
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Your parents

79
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,230
don't support you work in design industry, do they?

80
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,400
No, they don't.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
But my mother

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,080
doesn't allow me to fail.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
She knew it was extremely hard to

84
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,270
win that award.

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,790
And

86
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,960
people around

87
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,360
knew I was in the competition.

88
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,960
So...

89
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,360
From then on

90
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,630
Every time

91
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,080
when I face a design script

92
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,000
I would become anxious.

93
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,590
And the anxiety becomes

94
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:14,560
more and more severe.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,880
Honestly

96
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,400
I haven't been able to

97
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,790
draw a single design

98
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,920
since last year.

99
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,040
Think I'm pitiful?

100
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,710
Just feel sorry for me.

101
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,880
You've seen all my embarrassment

102
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,790
anyway.

103
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,110
This is nothing.

104
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,880
It doesn't matter whether others

105
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,000
think you are pitiful or not.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,310
It matters that

107
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,880
how do you think of yourself.

108
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,750
Are you willing to live with it?

109
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,750
People like us

110
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,190
never take our heart

111
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,270
seriously.

112
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,310
Ignore it

113
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,230
for different reasons.

114
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,040
Till it's sick.

115
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,190
Cheers.

116
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,110
Is Xiaobao asleep?

117
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,840
Yes.

118
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,550
I've made my decision.

119
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,270
I'll do what you said.

120
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,110
You are willing to

121
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,760
get you memories back?

122
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,150
With you and Xiaobao.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,510
I have the guts to do that.

124
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,190
Thank you

125
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,510
for everything you've done

126
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,080
during these days.

127
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Thank you for your company

128
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,000
and love.

129
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,470
We will get through this together

130
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,110
if we love each other devotedly.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,390
I want to give you and Xiaobao a happy life.

132
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,150
Mr. He, I guess you come here

133
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,800
not for your illness.

134
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,230
I'm here to express my gratitude.

135
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,270
All this time

136
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,760
Yiyue treats you as her

137
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,920
most trusted friend.

138
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,230
All that you need to do is

139
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,680
continue to play that role

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,840
and never cross the line.

141
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,270
I can't promise you that.

142
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,960
That depends on you.

143
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,840
But I can promise you that

144
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,150
no matter what happens

145
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
I'll make her happy.

146
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,190
Remember what you said today.

147
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,600
Excuse me.

148
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,150
What will you do next

149
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,150
about that thing.

150
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,390
I'll find a way to

151
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,190
get my memories back first.

152
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
I knew a senior fellow apprentice in school.

153
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,110
He once helped someone

154
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,000
like you

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
regain his memory

156
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,080
through hypnosis.

157
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,600
I can introduce him to you

158
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,640
if you don't mind.

159
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,510
I appreciate.

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
I can't make sure that I

161
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,430
can help your friend

162
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,190
get his memories back.

163
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
But we can have a try.

164
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,840
So

165
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
tell him to come to me

166
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,510
tomorrow afternoon.

167
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,230
Thanks a lot.

168
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,350
Wait a second.

169
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,430
I remembered that

170
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,840
you had a roommate

171
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,430
who became a designer.

172
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,470
Right?

173
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,350
Yes, right.

174
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
His name is Zhou Xingyuan.

175
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,040
Why?

176
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,800
I think five years ago

177
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
he was the judge for the Broom Top Award.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,310
Yes, he was.

179
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,270
Do you have his contact?

180
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,800
I wanna consult him some questions.

181
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,640
Yes, I have.

182
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,390
No problem.

183
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,550
I'll send his contact to your phone later.

184
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,960
Thanks.

185
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,720
Nobody is here except us.

186
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,390
So tell me

187
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,390
how much money you were paid.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,270
I don't know what you mean.

189
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,230
You were driving that day

190
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,640
and why you stopped?

191
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,960
Just felt uncomfortable.

192
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,110
You knew something would happen.

193
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,470
So you found an excuse to quit driving.

194
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,190
What's your evidence?

195
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,310
To be honest.

196
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,600
I've got part of

197
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,880
my memories back.

198
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,350
I just want to save my time.

199
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,550
It's fine if you don't tell me the truth.

200
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,190
But I will recall everything sooner or later.

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,880
I am not afraid of that.

202
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,550
I had nothing to do with that car accident.

203
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,230
You go for them.

204
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,470
Them?

205
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,190
So

206
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,600
there were people who

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
planned the accident.

208
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,230
Right.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,150
And Yiyue's intuition

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,760
was correct.

211
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,230
You told Mr. Zhang

212
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,840
that you've got your memories back.

213
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,350
Will the people behind this

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,310
do something to you

215
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,040
for hiding themselves?

216
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,150
I told him on purpose.

217
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,800
Since I can't get my memory back

218
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,840
so let the people in my memories

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,470
come to me.

220
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,920
Qiaoyan, how's it going?

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,350
It seems that hypnosis doesn't

222
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,350
work for me.

223
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,640
I still can't recall anything

224
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,110
after these days.

225
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
It's fine.

226
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,000
There's no damage to your neurons

227
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,720
neither to your brain.

228
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,390
So you must still have your memories.

229
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,310
But for now

230
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,190
we don't know

231
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,720
how to rouse them.

232
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,230
Give me a hug.

233
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,310
Everything is fine.

234
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,470
You will get your memories back.

235
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
Weiwei

236
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,840
I remembered that you love chicken wings

237
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,310
when you were a kid.

238
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,230
I don't eat these anymore.

239
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,550
Too many calories.

240
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,880
Right.

241
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,000
Didn't I tell you to go back?

242
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,840
Why are you still here?

243
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,640
Listen to mom and go home, will you?

244
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,510
That home has been

245
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,310
a broken picture to me.

246
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,760
But every step I take here

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,110
is practical

248
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,920
and real.

249
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,230
Anyway.

250
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:20,390
I have to apologize to you

251
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,080
for having your family here

252
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,600
without letting you know.

253
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,680
It's too impulsive.

254
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,080
Sorry.

255
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
I was busy in business

256
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,510
and didn't answer your call

257
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,600
when you were in danger.

258
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,270
It was my fault, too.

259
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,430
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,390
I...

261
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,000
Better not touch me

262
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,270
with your hand.

263
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,390
Disgusting.

264
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,040
And I don't need your apology.

265
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,680
Can you even count the girls

266
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,760
who you have coaxed?

267
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,430
But I don't care.

268
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:00,840
Let's go.

269
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,600
I said

270
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,310
you and me

271
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,000
are just supervisor and subordinate.

272
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,430
Leave me alone.

273
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,470
Let go of me!

274
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,000
You...

275
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,760
Welcome to my secret garden.

276
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,080
What a good place

277
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,840
on the top of your bar.

278
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,880
I feel vibration under my feet.

279
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,760
We are

280
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,150
dancing above their heads.

281
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,840
We are the super VVVIp.

282
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,390
Here, enjoy your drinks.

283
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,680
When I graduated from university

284
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,960
I've made up my mind that

285
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,680
I would earn my own place

286
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,640
in this city

287
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
to eat and sleep.

288
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
Even a tiny bed

289
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,760
can protect my dream.

290
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,390
Because I will never

291
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,350
go back to that home.

292
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,390
Every day when I go out

293
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,600
I will dress myself well.

294
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,720
It's like arming myself

295
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,350
from head to toes.

296
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,080
I'm afraid to show a trace of timidity

297
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,550
and make others know that

298
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,840
I have nothing.

299
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,840
You ready?

300
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,430
Ready for what?

301
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,680
Walking alone at night

302
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,270
needs many things

303
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,270
to arm myself.

304
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,680
With no home

305
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,680
I build myself a shell.

306
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,600
With no knight

307
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,510
I forge myself a sword.

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,680
Stand still.

309
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,960
Where you stand is the living room

310
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,430
and it's a big balcony outside.

311
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,920
Here is the bedroom

312
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,600
and inside is a large dressing room.

313
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,230
Here are the kitchen, bathroom and the second bedroom.

314
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,270
And maybe there will be a children's room.

315
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,040
I want to give you a home

316
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,270
where you can save all your dreams

317
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,150
and tiredness.

318
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,720
I love you.

319
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,040
I'll give you a home if you want.

320
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,760
I'll give you my love if you want.

321
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm sorry.

322
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,470
I'm sorry for falling in love with you

323
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,310
from the very beginning.

324
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,390
Will you?

325
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:22,640
Sure.

326
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,230
Bye.

327
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,310
Damn.

328
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,350
I left in a hurry this morning.

329
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,150
I took

330
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,110
Wen Gu's phone by mistake.

331
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
What am I supposed to do right now?

332
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,510
Where is Wen Gu?

333
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,000
Even I am here.

334
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Why is he so late?

335
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,550
I guess he's coming soon.

336
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,110
Call him, Ruowei.

337
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,510
Tell him to be quick.

338
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,040
I get another meeting

339
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,390
later.

340
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,800
Sorry for that.

341
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
He's coming soon.

342
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,760
He may be in a traffic jam.

343
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,600
I'd like to praise him due to

344
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,390
his achievement last month.

345
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,800
He seems never change his bad habits.

346
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,600
Can't reach him?

347
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,190
Fine, I'll call him.

348
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,720
Don't...

349
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,080
I apologize for being late.

350
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,680
Didn't find my phone this morning.

351
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,190
Loot at your

352
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,680
forgetfulness.

353
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,800
Then have you found it now?

354
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,110
Yes, it's here.

355
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,390
It's too early.

356
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,840
Let me buy Xiaobao a cotton candy.

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,600
Excuse me, can I get one of these?

358
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,680
How much?

359
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,310
Five yuan.

360
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,600
Xiaobao

361
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,080
Mom is here.

362
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,230
Slow down, no hurry.

363
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,080
Slow...

364
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,190
Mom

365
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,150
Mom

366
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,230
Bad guy took away my mom.

367
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,080
Don't worry, Xiaobao.

368
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,960
Back to classroom and find your teacher.

369
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,040
I'll send driver to pick up you.

370
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,350
Bad guys took away my mom, save her.

371
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,550
What else did you see

372
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,470
besides that car?

373
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,000
A three-zero-two-seven-three(license plate number)

374
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
A three-zero-two-seven-three

375
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,150
You did a good job, Xiaobao.

376
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:49,920
Don't worry.

377
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,960
I'll go find you mom right now.

378
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,390
She will be fine.

379
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,430
Brake! Brake!

380
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,600

381
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,640

384

Don't go.

385
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,000
Don't go.

386
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,150
Yiyue

387
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,080
Don't go, Yiyue.

388
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,840
Yiyue

389
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Qiaoyan

390
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,880
Qiaoyan

391
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,510
Don't go, Yiyue.

392
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,390
Do not leave me.

393
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,310
Yiyue

394
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,800
I won't leave you.

395
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,150
Everything is fine.

396
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,110
Yiyue

397
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,190
Where is Xiaobao?

398
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,960
Aunt went to pick him up.

399
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,310
They'll be back soon.

400
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,880
Why do you wear this?

401
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
What happened?

402
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,390
Don't worry.

403
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,310
I'm fine.

404
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,230
When I was kidnapped

405
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,680
you had a car accident

406
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
on the way you went to save me.

407
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,880
But thanks to the air bag

408
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,470
we were both fine.

409
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,880
You've just been hit in the head.

410
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,430
Doctor said it was not a big deal.

411
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,600
We can go home

412
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,190
after two days of observation.

413
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,040
Glad to see you're safe.

414
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,110
The people who kidnapped me

415
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,310
is the enemy of Heshi group.

416
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,350
They are from AM Group.

417
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,640
They admitted everything.

418
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
You can rest assured.

419
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,190
The police

420
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,150
has arrested everyone

421
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,000
of them.

422
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,310
I remember now.

423
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,470
It was the brake failure.

424
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,350
There's a big truck coming to me.

425
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,550
I was dazzled by its light.

426
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,000
Then I hit the tree

427
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
on one side of the road.

428
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,920
It's all right now.

429
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,150
Back to then

430
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,600
it was because

431
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,470
your brother

432
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,230
found the huge financial loopholes

433
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,310
of AM Group.

434
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,960
The desperate Liao Zilang

435
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,800
was pushed too much.

436
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,640
So he bribed Mr. Zhang

437
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,190
and asked him to be an informer in your family.

438
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,680
Mr. Zhang knew the brake was broken.

439
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,470
But he sold this information to Liao Zilang

440
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,800
because his brother

441
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,470
owed Liao Zilang money.

442
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,430
And then he was asked to

443
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,640
find a reason

444
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,680
to refuse to drive.

445
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,190
And what about that track?

446
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,000
Your guess was correct.

447
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,720
That truck

448
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,920
was planned to

449
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,000
kill you directly.

450
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,840
But the rain was too heavy.

451
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,150
Your car lost control

452
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,270
and just rolled out from the road.

453
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,040
Qiaoyan

454
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,760
It was not your fault.

455
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,040
The culprit has been under arrest.

456
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,350
Yiyue

457
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,230
Thank you.

458
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,640
It was you that saved Xiaobao and me.

459
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,600
The lullaby you sang that day

460
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,760
was the most beautiful song

461
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,550
I've ever heard in my life.

462
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,470
What a joke

463
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,270
has destiny

464
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,880
made with us.

465
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,680
I saved your life.

466
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,600
But you saved mine, too.

467
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:40,760
We can never

468
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,550
live without each other now.

469
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,110
Are you being serious?

470
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
Of course.

471
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,000
I'm impressed by your work.

472
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,430
So I remembered very clearly that

473
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,110
you are the winner of golden prize

474
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,680
who got votes from all the three of us.

475
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,190
But my mother told me...

476
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,550
About that

477
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,640
I told Zhou to

478
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,800
find the person in charge of that year

479
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,470
and asked.

480
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,550
It was a

481
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,150
minor misunderstanding.

482
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,230
Your mother mistaken

483
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,840
another people's work

484
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,080
as yours.

485
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,510
And the name of that person

486
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,960
is only one word different to

487
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,230
the name of your work.

488
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,110
Are you alright?

489
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,110
I should have thought of that

490
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,110
since my mother has never

491
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,550
cared about my design.

492
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,310
So how did she even know

493
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,390
the name of my work.

494
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,390
Difference in profession makes one feel worlds apart.

495
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,760
Your mother didn't know design industry.

496
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,880
So of course she's not interested in knowing your work.

497
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,920
Why did you

498
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,350
help me on this?

499
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,550
I've heard about Zhou

500
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,600
and his personality.

501
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,430
I don't think he is

502
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,000
the person to do that kind of thing.

503
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,080
More importantly I believe that you are

504
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,110
good enough to win the golden prize.

505
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,680
Thanks a lot.

506
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,640
Now the misunderstanding is gone.

507
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,920
What do you plan to do next?

508
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,000
What the heck.

509
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,550
Why did I lose again?

510
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,000
Stick out your tongue.

511
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,550
Don't you know

512
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,720
tenderness toward women

513
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,880
stop before going too far

514
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,350
and the outstanding usually bear the brunt of attack?

515
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,840
All I know is you have to admit defeat.

516
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,190
I'm out.

517
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,760
Childish.

518
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,350
Open your mouth.

519
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It's Ning Fang.

520
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,920
He said he's coming to visit us tonight.

521
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,550
What?

522
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Tell him not to come.

523
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,760
No visit in this hospital

524
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,880
after 9 o'clock

525
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,600
You are such a weird man.

526
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,190
You don't like him, do you?

527
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,190
Why should I?

528
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,080
You are the only one I know

529
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,720
who dislikes

530
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,920
Ning Fang.

531
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,230
Then I won't be

532
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,550
the only one soon.

533
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,470
Who else would be?

534
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,190
You

535
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,680
Why would I dislike him?

536
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,150
Because the husband to sing and the wife to follow.

537
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,880
So childish.

538
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:05,840
Who are you sending messages to this time?

539
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,150
Ruowei

540
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,110
You said that no visit in this hospital

541
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,080
after 9 o'clock.

542
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,110
So I will tell her not to come.

543
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,230
No need to send messages.

544
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,000
She won't come anyway.

545
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,760
How do you know?

546
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,080
Wen Gu told me

547
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,270
he has a basketball game today.

548
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,000
You're right.

549
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,110
Look.

550
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,190
Honey

551
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,719
My Gugu...

552
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,920
Gugu?

553
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,080
My Gugu

554
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,270
has a basketball game tonight.

555
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,510
I'm going to be his cheer leading.

556
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,040
Can't pay you the visit.

557
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,679
Look at this Yang Ruowei.

558
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,230
Since she fell in love

559
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,760
she has thoroughly interpreted the meaning of

560
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,000
needing no friends when in love.

561
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,469
It's just right that they won't come.

562
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,350
Let's continue.

563
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,800
Come on.

564
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,960
No, I'm hungry.

565
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,679
Hungry?

566
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,639
Aunt brought us

567
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,679
a lot of food today.

568
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,270
Go eat some.

569
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,920
What she brought are all

570
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,510
luxurious tonic soups.

571
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,080
Right.

572
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,150
My stomach has nothing but soup and water.

573
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,760
I...

574
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,310
I would like to eat at roadside food stalls.

575
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,040
Let's go.

576
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,270
Thank you, sir.

577
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,600
Wait, wait.

578
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,000
My shoes.

579
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,110
Drop them again.

580
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,000
I haven't been so crazy in a long time.

581
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,470
Last time was

582
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,880
in my childhood.

583
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,920
You were crazy like this when you were a kid?

584
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,150
No.

585
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,510
I mean

586
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,310
I haven't been so purely happy

587
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,230
for a long time.

588
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,110
It seemed that

589
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,040
I was in the same age

590
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,150
with Xiaobao.

591
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,840
♪ Little kids with seldom worries ♪

592
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,760
♪ Looking around in the sunshine ♪

593
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,840
Didn't you say my father was at home?

594
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,310
He just left for business in company.

595
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,080
You hide when something happens.

596
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,760
Did I teach you that?

597
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,270
Sorry, mother.

598
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,510
I can't handle He Qiaoyan.

599
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,840
All right, all right.

600
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,390
Let the failure

601
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,390
become history.

602
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,190
Do you have a plan

603
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
about what to do next?

604
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,880
Yes.

605
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,960
I want to focus on my career first.

606
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,430
Good.

607
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,880
That's what your father and I want.

608
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,680
Go to the company

609
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,270
and work as your father's assistant for a year.

610
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,550
You still have

611
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,680
a lot of things to learn.

612
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,000
I don't want to work in our company.

613
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,760
I want to continue to design.

614
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,080
No way.

615
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,080
Mom, I've made my decision.

616
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,430
Alright, since you made your decision,

617
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,760
do it.

618
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,350
But then

619
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,000
never tell others you are my daughter.
