Unforgettable Love
EP12

2
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,750
So in the second half of the year

3
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,000
you want to focus

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,039
all on the smart bracelet.

5
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,630
Aunt,

6
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,670
This is the data

7
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,400
in two months since the smart bracelet on the line.

8
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
You could have a look.

9
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,750
I'm very optimistic

10
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,880
about its development prospect.

11
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,590
I'm going to repack it

12
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,880
as a key product,

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,039
for the European and American market.

14
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,360
Can you convince the board?

15
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,039
Of course.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,479
Next week,

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,479
it's the thirtieth anniversary dinner.

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,360
I'll arrange it.

19
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,520
And you,

20
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
just concentrate on

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,270
preparing to deal with the board.

22
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,310
Okay.

23
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,270
In previous years, you always went alone,

24
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,360
What about this year?

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,400
The same.

26
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,590
This year I'll invite my wife with me

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,440
together.

28
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,190
Are you sure she can?

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,670
I'm afraid

30
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,270
she even can't complete

31
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,190
a simple dance.

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,590
Just learn.

33
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,110
You can't look down on her.

34
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:29,710
By the way,

35
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,270
next week

36
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,440
is the 30th anniversary dinner of Heshi Group.

37
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,480
Come together with me.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,360
A dinner?

39
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:38,960
I won't go.

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,590
Won't go?

41
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:41,790
Why is that?

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,670
Isn't a so-called dinner party

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,150
wearing a sky-high heels,

44
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,190
breathless tights,

45
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,440
smirking at people,

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,150
standing up all night cramping,

47
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,000
without even a sip of hot soup?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,840
So boring.

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,270
You should recognize that

50
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,560
you are Mrs. He now.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,710
If you don't show up,

52
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,230
that will give rise to criticism.

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,670
The key is that

54
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,400
my aunt will suspect our relationship.

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,080
You could tell her that

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm sick.

57
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,480
If it doesn't work,

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
I'm going to the hospital and get a cast,

59
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,790
pretending to have a relapse.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
I get it.

61
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,040
You're afraid

62
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,560
you're not a good dancer, are you?

63
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,150
But yes,

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,630
for someone like you

65
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,000
who doesn't have a complete cerebellum

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,960
and can't control

67
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,400
their coordination well.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,480
It's really hard

69
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,310
to make you dance.

70
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
You know that?

71
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,270
In my primary school,

72
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,840
I was the leader

73
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,710
of the radio gymnastics,

74
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:46,440
a center of the dance.

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,440
Waltz

76
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
and radio gymnastics

77
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,079
are two completely different concepts.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,079
Isn't it just a waltz?

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,710
In the park where my mom dance,

80
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,230
All those aunts can do this.

81
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll show you.

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,710
Look.

83
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,080
Chug chug

84
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
One two three

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,840
Chug chug

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
One two three

87
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,040
Just having a dance,

88
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
you can step on your feet.

89
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,480
If I get trampled then,

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,920
I'll deduct your salary.

91
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,230
So much trouble.

92
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,110
You're just stimulating me, aren't you?

93
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,880
I tell you

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,480
I

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
really can't stand the stimulation.

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,750
It's just dancing,

97
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,480
I'll learn and show you.

98
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,000
Having our meal first.

99
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,480
Oh, my God.

100
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,710
Why did I say that？

101
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
This is Judy, your etiquette teacher,

102
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,080
Helen, body teacher,

103
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,040
Nana, Dance teacher.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,880
And this one,

105
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,840
is your dress designer

106
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,080
Doris

107
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,190
and her assistant.

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:14,960
The dinner

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,040
is eight days away.

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,310
Don't be lazy.

111
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,270
Every day when I get home,

112
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,670
I'll check on how you're doing.

113
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,310
Hello, Mrs. He.

114
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,630
Hello.

115
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm so tired.

116
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,190
I finally realize that

117
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,520
what is

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,310
devil training.

119
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,360
So you're tired?

120
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,710
Well done.

121
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,750
This is a dinner

122
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,190
that I specially prepared for you.

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
Xiaobao and I have finished it.

124
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,960
I was tortured for a day,

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,150
and you just give me this.

126
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
What's wrong with that?

127
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
I can't get used to it for a long time

128
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,360
what's your diet like before.

129
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,360
Just take this opportunity

130
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,520
to adjust your diet.

131
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,360
And

132
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,560
this dinner

133
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,920
is both nutritious and healthy,

134
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,960
which suits you very well.

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,750
So eat up.

136
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,110
There is not any meat in it.

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,630
Boss He, I really can't eat it without meat.

138
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm very hungry now,

139
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,920
very sleepy, and very tired.

140
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,520
I need high calorie food

141
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
to comfort my broken heart.

142
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,480
So I want...

143
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
I want...

144
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,920
What would you like to eat?

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Hot Pot.

146
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,310
Are you sure?

147
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,230
Which one is this?

148
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,670
Just take a look.

149
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,590
Relax.

150
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,190
Hold on.

151
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,630
So hurt.

152
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,710
So hurt.

153
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,880
And then push the leg down.

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,270
Yes, that's it.

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,790
Come down a little bit.

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,000
Relax.

157
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,790
Come on.

158
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,080
So hurt.

159
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,790
Hold on.

160
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,400
Good.

161
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes, that's it.

162
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,790
So hurt.

163
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,790
Keep your balance.

164
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,790
Tighten up.

165
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,710
Pose.

166
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,360
Keep your head straight.

167
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,230
Relax, OK.

168
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,400
Come down.

169
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,670
Abdomen in.

170
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,710
Lean against the stick.

171
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:01,790
Tighten up.

172
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,560
Good.

173
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,560
Straighten out.

174
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,880
I'll go to the bathroom.

175
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,750
Speaking.

176
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Mr. He, we have news from Tongcheng City.

177
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,550
Did you find the person?

178
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,230
Yes.

179
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,920
I've ordered

180
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,960
the ticket to Tongcheng City for you,

181
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,110
taking off in two hours.

182
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,350
I'm on my way to meet you.

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,080
OK, I see.

184
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,150
Where is he going in such a hurry?

185
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,430
Ladies, take a break.

186
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,150
Okay.

187
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,270
Why so hurry?

188
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,600
Something off the ground.

189
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,680
Since he is not here,

190
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
why don't I give myself

191
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,960
a holiday?

192
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,150
Let's have a hot pot tonight.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,350
I get off work at six on time.

194
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,640
Didn't you say

195
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,800
you need to keep fit

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
for the dinner?

197
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,310
How dare you to eat hot pot?

198
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,350
Mrs. Liu.

199
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,470
I can't stand it.

200
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,880
Whatever the dinner.

201
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,310
I want the hot pot to keep energetic.

202
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,680
Isn't this the driver, Mr. Zhang?

203
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,720
Mr. Zhang?

204
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,230
Who is the driver?

205
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,800
The guy

206
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,350
who used to drive for He family.

207
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,880
He hasn't been seen since the car accident.

208
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,430
Mr. He has been looking for many years

209
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,510
and never found him.

210
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,680
Zhang Cheng, where are you?

211
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,310
Find the truth.

212
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,720
What's the truth?

213
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,040
I just found a Hot pot

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,430
near my company.

215
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,680
You could wait for me in the company

216
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,800
and I'll be off work in a minute.

217
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,550
Mrs. Liu, I'm going out.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,510
Okay.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
Ladies, thanks for your teaching today.

220
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,040
I have something to go out.

221
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,430
You could take a break.

222
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,600
Let's go on in the evening.

223
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,040
All right, Mrs. He.

224
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,640
Li Wei found Zhang Cheng

225
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,720
in a poker game.

226
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,960
Li Wei promised to help Zhang Cheng pay back the money.

227
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,720
So he agreed

228
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,040
to tell us what happened that year

229
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,110
and recorded it.

230
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,190
Please listen to this.

231
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
That night

232
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,800
did Mr. He's brother

233
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,960
told you to prepare the car?

234
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,390
Yes.

235
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,230
Do you remember the weather that day?

236
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,510
It rained heavily.

237
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
The road is slippery.

238
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,040
I drove as slowly as I could.

239
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,270
But because Mr. and Mrs.

240
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,310
were talking all the time.

241
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,760
I'm a little distracted.

242
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,840
What did they say?

243
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,190
I'm not sure.

244
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
It distracted you,

245
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,350
don't you remember?

246
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,430
Maybe they were arguing.

247
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,040
I forgot that.

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,430
It seems that the husband was in a hurry to go out

249
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,310
and the madam was a little slow.

250
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,640
The two

251
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,310
quarreled something.

252
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,310
I was distracted.

253
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,920
At that time,

254
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,350
There was a cart coming to us.

255
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,230
My sister-in-law is not that kind of person

256
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,390
to argue with my brother

257
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,470
just because he was out late.

258
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,470
If in the world,

259
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,960
there are people who never lose their temper.

260
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,680
My sister-in-law is that person.

261
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,150
My brother told me that

262
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,150
she was never in a hurry.

263
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,600
Let alone,

264
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,000
she got angry and quarreled with others.

265
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,760
So Zhang Cheng was lying.

266
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,350
It's Li Wei.

267
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,080
Speaking.

268
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,150
I'll fly there later.

269
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
Mr. He, there's something wrong.

270
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,040
Zhang Cheng ran away.

271
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,600
You've been looking for him for four years.

272
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,390
Less than four hours,

273
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,550
you let him run away.

274
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,110
It was my negligence.

275
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,550
I'm sorry about that, Mr. He.

276
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
Then keep looking for him.

277
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,960
Go.

278
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,390
Beef, mutton,

279
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,390
pig's feet, chitterlings, brains,

280
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,760
chicken paw, chicken claw,

281
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,080
duck feet, duck gizzards, beef balls,

282
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,600
and sausage, spam

283
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,110
Weige, where are you?

284
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,390
I have taken the elevator up.

285
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,190
As long as it's about hot pot,

286
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,190
you are very punctual.

287
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,270
No kidding.

288
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,040
Life is boring.

289
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Regret nothing in matters of

290
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,840
milky tea and hot pot.

291
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,920
That's ok.

292
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,720
Could you wait for me

293
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
at the elevator.

294
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,960
I'll find you when I drop off a file.

295
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,550
Ok.

296
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,350
Come in, come in, come in.

297
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,270
Mr. Wen.

298
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,040
This is the document from Chairman Wen.

299
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,550
Put it here.

300
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Miss Yang.

301
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,270
Anything else?

302
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,110
You know what?

303
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,230
What?

304
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,470
You are so beautiful.

305
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,510
Say something I don't know.

306
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,920
Your lipstick

307
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,390
looks delicious.

308
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,840
Can I taste it?

309
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,270
My lipstick is expensive

310
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,800
and you don't deserve it.

311
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
Don't you have a ripple

312
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,110
in your heart?

313
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,080
I have.

314
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,270
My heart is connected to my stomach,

315
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,430
and I'm going to throw up.

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,080
Mr. Wen, that's your move?

317
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,550
Of course not.

318
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,640
I'm just trying to liven up the atmosphere.

319
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,600
And I found that

320
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,510
there are serious problems

321
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,510
with the documents you sent.

322
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,390
Take it back and rearrange it.

323
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,510
Excuse me, Mr. Wen

324
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,350
What's wrong with these documents?

325
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,190
The problem is so obvious.

326
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,720
Do you need me to say more?

327
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,040
Fine.

328
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,350
I'll go back and sort it out.

329
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Isn't that right?

330
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,310
I see other girls

331
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,640
all like this.

332
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,310
Did I copy the wrong part?

333
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,190
Oh, my God, It must be a wrong path.

334
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,080
If he saw me,

335
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,880
he bound to grab me back to practice.

336
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,600
Ruowei, where are you?

337
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
Did you get there?

338
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,550
In a minute.

339
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,000
Just give me a minute.

340
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,510
This is not a good place to stay.

341
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,150
Or I could wait for you in the store.

342
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,640
No. The store was in a secluded location.

343
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,080
You can't find it.

344
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,800
You just wait a more moment.

345
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll be there in a minute.

346
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,230
Go,go,go.

347
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,430
That's OK.

348
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,680
I got thirty-six strategies.

349
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,720
There's always one for you.

350
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,960
Could you be polite?

351
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,230
Don't you know to knock first?

352
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,150
It's a familiar taste.

353
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,040
Needless to say.

354
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,720
It must be about Zhang Cheng again.

355
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,150
Am I so obvious?

356
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,079
Every time it's about Zhang Cheng.

357
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,000
You're going to

358
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,920
radiate

359
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,680
the smell of danger.

360
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,510
The people I sent out

361
00:17:33,109 --> 00:17:34,109
found Zhang Cheng.

362
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,470
You finally found him.

363
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,720
It's a good thing.

364
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,470
Where is he?

365
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,840
Run away again.

366
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,470
again?

367
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,720
This driver

368
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,960
doesn't look so simple.

369
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,270
Under your persistent search,

370
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,600
he's been hiding from you for four years.

371
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,880
You're right.

372
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,270
He is just a driver.

373
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,310
How did he do it?

374
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,190
It's not normal.

375
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,390
These years

376
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,310
I'm also increasingly aware that

377
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,760
what happened in those days

378
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,640
maybe not simple at all.

379
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,350
There must be someone behind him.

380
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,470
I have to find the truth.

381
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,350
I can't let my brother and sister-in-law

382
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,000
just died for nothing.

383
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,510
Don't worry.

384
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,760
If you need

385
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,150
You can call me at any time.

386
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,760
Why doesn't Ruowei answer the phone?

387
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,680
In such a big company

388
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,110
why can't I find the toilet?

389
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,880
So suffocating.

390
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,640
Qin Yiyue

391
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,800
I...

392
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,960
I'm here

393
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,470
to the bathroom.

394
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,920
Calm down, please.

395
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,350
Nothing to explain to me?

396
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,960
No.

397
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,310
Yes.

398
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,000
Then explain it.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,960
Why not practice dancing

400
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,040
at home at this time?

401
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah.

402
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,880
This time,

403
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,470
shouldn't I be

404
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,800
practicing dancing at home?

405
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,510
Why didn't I

406
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,760
practice dancing at home?

407
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,270
It's actually like this.

408
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,310
I don't understand what the teacher taught me.

409
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm here for Ruowei.

410
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,230
Ruowei knows how to dance

411
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,510
and I asked Ruowei to teach me.

412
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,310
Ruowei knows.

413
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
Mr. Wen

414
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,110
Your information has been sorted out.

415
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,110
Whether you are satisfied or not,

416
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,350
it's time for me to leave work.

417
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,600
If you want to change it again,

418
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,110
Please be early tomorrow.

419
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,470
Yue'er

420
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,270
Didn't I tell you to

421
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,550
wait for me at the elevator?

422
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,350
Let's go. I'm off work.

423
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,640
Hot pot and milky tea is calling us.

424
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Mr. He

425
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,550
You'd better

426
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,960
make allowances for Yue'er.

427
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,270
You see.

428
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,720
Yue'er is forced by you

429
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,600
to be pale.

430
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,110
I don't think you need to

431
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,000
get off work in a hurry.

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Go and rearrange the information.

433
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
Let's go.

434
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,760
Go, go, go.

435
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,190
Turn around.

436
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,110
Do you know that

437
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,640
all those days of hard work

438
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,640
after a hot pot

439
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,600
all in vain.

440
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,270
Don't be so serious.

441
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,310
Each night,

442
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,840
I could practice two hours more.

443
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,920
Three hours.

444
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,840
Three hours?

445
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,190
Your foundation is poor.

446
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,430
Three hours is not enough.

447
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,390
Giving you two more months.

448
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,000
If you dislike me like this

449
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,800
then I won't go.

450
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,510
I don't want to go anyway.

451
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,600
I've always felt that

452
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,960
your attitude towards work

453
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
at least is serious.

454
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I'm serious about my work.

455
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,390
But you want me to dance

456
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,510
with a beautiful dress

457
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,350
in front of a bunch of strangers.

458
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,640
What kind of work is this?

459
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,800
And in our contract,

460
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,470
there is no such work.

461
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,550
I'm only in charge of Xiaobao.

462
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,840
What's more,

463
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
It's your private business.

464
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,680
I can't control it, isn't it?

465
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,150
Private business?

466
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,350
You're right.

467
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,840
I really shouldn't waste your time

468
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,550
with my private business.

469
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,550
So baffling

470
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,840
you are.

471
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,150
So stingy.

472
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,270
Fierce, isn't it?

473
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,390
So can I.

474
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,800
Qin Yiyue

475
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,150
Why aren't you

476
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,350
practicing at home at this time?

477
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,680
I don't know why.

478
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,080
Are you leaving now?

479
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,270
You scared me.

480
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,110
That's Qiaoyan's temper.

481
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,640
He is used to being strict with himself

482
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,600
and often harsh on others.

483
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,350
And today

484
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,550
because of Zhang Cheng

485
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,800
he was in

486
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
a bit of a bad mood.

487
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,550
Zhang Cheng

488
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,110
You mean the driver?

489
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

490
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,350
How much do you know

491
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,310
the car accident five years ago?

492
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,960
I just knew a tittle.

493
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,270
There was a heavy rainstorm on Xiaobao's birthday.

494
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,960
He Qiaoyan's brother and sister-in-law

495
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,640
drove out.

496
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,110
Suddenly there was an accident.

497
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,310
They died on the spot.

498
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Only Xiaobao survived.

499
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,110
I knew all that.

500
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,760
Then where was the He Qiaoyan?

501
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,430
You don't know that?

502
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,600
I can't believe he didn't tell you.

503
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,310
I'm not very clear about the details.

504
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,550
I remember my aunt said that

505
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,880
at that time

506
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,150
He Qiaoyan received a phone call

507
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,880
and not sure what happened.

508
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,230
He went to the hospital.

509
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,000
He had an accident

510
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,800
on his way to the hospital.

511
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,310
He was in a coma for half a month .

512
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,350
It was his aunt

513
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,840
who contacted the police and dealt with the matter.

514
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,680
He didn't know until he was discharged.

515
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,000
In that accident,

516
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,000
His brother and sister-in-law, who had been closer to him than his parents,

517
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,680
had died.

518
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,110
And at that time

519
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,840
the driver, Zhang Cheng, who was driving for them

520
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,880
was gone.

521
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,840
Heshi Group at that time,

522
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,350
despite the tight capital chain,

523
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,390
continue to maintain the expansion.

524
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,270
The leader of He family died.

525
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,880
The youngest son who just woke up from a car accident

526
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,800
have to inherit the family business.

527
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,960
Everyone is waiting to see

528
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,150
if He Qiaoyan can turn the tide.

529
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,150
But more people think

530
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,550
the Heshi Group will be over.

531
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,960
Heshi Group was painstaking efforts from his father

532
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,350
and his brother.

533
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,840
He had to suppress his grief.

534
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,350
Under internal and external troubles,

535
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,000
he had to carry everything alone.

536
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,880
In the end, Heshi Group

537
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,510
was brought out the bankruptcy crisis.

538
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,680
How did He Qiaoyan

539
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,430
hold out in those days?

540
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,040
Let's see. What is it?

541
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
Two chicken claws.

542
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,960
Alright, alright. You are not stupid.

543
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,920
Sister, why don't you eat?

544
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,000
Didn't we have a deal?

545
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,880
We'll eat with you till you come out holding the wall.

546
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,920
I don't think you're going to

547
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,840
skip the hot pot,

548
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,190
just because He Qiaoyan is angry.

549
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,550
It's your favorite hot pot.

550
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,040
Thinking of him

551
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,230
carrying all this alone

552
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,350
made me

553
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,880
feel a little sick in my chest.

554
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,640
I want to do something for him.

555
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,270
Therefore

556
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,190
I want to protect him.

557
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
Sister

558
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,040
You are in danger.

559
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,190
It's dangerous.

560
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,390
I'm not dangerous.

561
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,760
My high heels are protected.

562
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,550
No problem.

563
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,230
No, no, no, I'm not talking about that.

564
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,600
I mean

565
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
It doesn't matter

566
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,640
for a woman

567
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,800
to have a crush

568
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,920
on a man.

569
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,920
But once you're tempted,

570
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,040
you're screwed.

571
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,150
Then you can't stop it.

572
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,150
What did you say?

573
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm just

574
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,800
being too empathetic.

575
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Isn't that right, Xiao’an?

576
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,270
Here you go again.

577
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,040
Xiao'an, come to have some vegetables.

578
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,080
Sister.

579
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,270
I know

580
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,840
your life is not easy these days.

581
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,840
I decided to support you.

582
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,470
I decided to

583
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,800
go to Ning Fang's psychological studio

584
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
as a volunteer.

585
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,390
You don't work in the hospital anymore?

586
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,470
No, you can't go.

587
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,640
I just use my break time

588
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,760
for public welfare.

589
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,470
Sister, aren't you moved?

590
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
I would like to follow you forever.

591
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,110
I'm moved.

592
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,190
Then

593
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,640
If you with me

594
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,960
share this dish together

595
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,350
I will feel more moved.

596
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,880
Xiao'an

597
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,040
Eat, eat, eat.

598
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,390
You invite

599
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,000
so many teachers for her.

600
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,880
But she ran away by herself.

601
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,270
Forget it.

602
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,550
I didn't expect

603
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,230
she can do it anyway.

604
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,550
I'll arrange a companion for you.

605
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,800
No, aunt.

606
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,150
After all, in the past five years

607
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:33,960
every year

608
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,040
I've been going to dinner alone.

609
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm used to it, too.

610
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,960
I told you that you two weren't compatible.

611
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,230
I chose her.

612
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,510
I think we fit in.

613
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,880
Please believe her,

614
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,000
as well as my choice.

615
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
I'm afraid you'll be held back by her.

616
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,270
In recent years,

617
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,960
You are in charge of the Heshi Group

618
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,470
and has made great progress.

619
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,350
But those shareholders

620
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,000
want more than that.

621
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:05,470
They want you to do better.

622
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,760
Take the company to the next level.

623
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,470
So you have to behave

624
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,680
perfectly.

625
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,040
Give them confidence.

626
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
Have you eaten yet?

627
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,390
Bye, aunt.

628
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,720
Be safe on the way.

629
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,880
I know what you're going to say.

630
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,230
I know I'm wrong.

631
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,960
I will make a review

632
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
with practical actions.

633
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,430
Come with me.

634
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Come on, come on, come on.

635
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,390
I said it.

636
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,310
I will make a review

637
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,040
with practical actions.

638
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,190
You don't have to say anything.

639
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,880
It's too heavy. Give me a favor, please.

640
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,470
Don't worry.

641
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,080
I'll never hold you back.

642
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,230
You could take all these snacks away.

643
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:46,720
You could set your mind

644
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,040
to prepare your board.

645
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
I'll take the dinner.

646
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,230
The board is yours.

647
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,720
The couple who are of the same mind could do anything.

648
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,190
I have already dismissed those teachers.

649
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,390
I have already reviewed.

650
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,000
Why don't you take it easy.

651
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,880
I'm not angry.

652
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,600
You're right.

653
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,960
I shouldn't have forced you.

654
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,150
My own business,

655
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,350
I can do it myself.

656
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,350
And

657
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,800
What the aunt said

658
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,840
you don't worry about it.

659
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,110
It's not that serious.

660
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,720
Have an early rest!

661
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,110
I have work to do.

662
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,000
He is angry clearly.

663
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,510
A penny pincher

664
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
We all know that

665
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,550
this dance must be elegant.

666
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,720
I'm very elegant.

667
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,040
Is that so?

668
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,960
How does it still feel wrong?

669
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,510
One two three

670
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,470
How does it feel wrong?

671
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,640
Did you get it?

672
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,640
What?

673
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I said you don't have to force yourself.

674
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,270
I said that, too.

675
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,840
We are married.

676
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,550
Other than that turn,

677
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,390
What else?

678
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,390
Nothing.

679
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,310
Well, I guess I'm going to start

680
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,190
at the beginning.

681
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:15,600
Waltz

682
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,390
is an adagio in four to three beats

683
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:18,350
at twenty-eight

684
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,470
to thirty bars per minute.

685
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,080
Each stanza has three actions.

686
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,510
Every beat is a step.

687
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,550
The first shot

688
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,470
Dongdada, dongdada

689
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,110
Put your left arm around me.

690
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,720
Back your left leg first.

691
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,550
Back your right leg.

692
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,110
Are you ready?

693
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,190
One two three

694
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,600
Two two three

695
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,430
Three two three

696
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,760
Slow down, your legs are long.

697
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,390
You know your legs are short.

698
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,680
Keep up with me.

699
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,840
What's wrong?

700
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,920
It's hard to be a fairy.

701
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,040
Other fairies wearing high heels

702
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,680
like stepping on colorful clouds.

703
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,550
And I?

704
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,510
Just like stepping on the hot wheels and burn your feet.

705
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,080
Sit down and have a rest.

706
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
Come here.

707
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,190
Give me a moment. I'll get some medicine.

708
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,840
Okay.

709
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,510
Go on.

710
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:51,880
Go.

711
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,080
One two three

712
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,270
One two three

713
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,310
One two three

714
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,880
Two two

715
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,920
Play along with the music.

716
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,190
Do you like this style?

717
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,800
What's up?

718
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:48,719
can't I?

719
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Take it easy.

720
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,150
Come here.

721
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,350
Excuse me.

722
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,310
I forgot to change my shoes.

723
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Are you ready?

724
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,190
Of course.

725
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,190
In order to fit this skirt,

726
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,600
I haven't eaten all day.

727
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,080
Is there a buffet here?

728
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,510
I specially told the kitchen

729
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,310
to add more.

730
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,150
Enough for you.

731
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,800
You mean

732
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,920
you dislike my huge appetite.

733
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm afraid you'll bite when you're hungry.

734
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,680
Let's go.

735
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:21,960
Are you nervous?

736
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,110
No, not at all.

737
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,600
Because you and Xiaobao are here.

738
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,550
Let's go.

739
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,310
Xiaobao, go to see your uncle, Wen Gu.

740
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,600
Go.

741
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,040
Yiyue

742
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,840
I'll take you to say hello to aunt.

743
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,550
Aunt.

744
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,190
Aunt.

745
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,680
Every gentlemen of the board

746
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,000
This is my wife, Qin Yiyue.

747
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,110
This is Mr. Wang.

748
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,000
This is Mrs. Wang.

749
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,080
This is Mr. Liu.

750
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
And Mr. Xu,

751
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,720
Are you ready, Mrs. He.

752
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,270
Yiyue

753
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,390
Thank you.

754
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,270
For what?

755
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,190
For being with me.

756
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,960
Are you sure?

757
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,110
Has Miss Lin's invitation arrived yet?

758
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,470
I took it to the Lin's personally.

759
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,600
So sweet.

760
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,430
Are you ready?

761
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,840
What else is on？

762
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
Go, Xiaobao.

763
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,230
The special melody your love.

764
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,840
You sneaked through my playlist.

765
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,040
I can also adapt to your preferences.

766
