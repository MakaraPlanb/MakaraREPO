Unforgettable Love
EP07

2
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,590
Still no reply.

3
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
We've searched so many places.

4
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,400
Where could he go?

5
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,080
By the way,

6
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,310
when did Xiaobao disappear?

7
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,789
Mrs. Liu thought that

8
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,880
Xiaobao was taking a nap

9
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,110
until she felt

10
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,039
something wrong.

11
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:32,960
She went to Xiaobao's room

12
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
and found out that he was not there.

13
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,520
Was there

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
a similar situation before?

15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,520
Absolutely.

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,229
That's the day when he knew that

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:42,920
I'm not his

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
natural father.

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,670
I think I know where he was.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
Xiaobao...

21
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,039
Xiaobao!

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,230
Why did you come here by yourself?

23
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,560
Do you know you cause

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,590
a big trouble to others?

25
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,710
Answer me, He Weifei!

26
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,190
Xiaobao,

27
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,230
Your dad just worried about you.

28
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,110
He's not angry with you. Don't be afraid.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
Qin Yiyue...

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,670
Stop it.

31
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,040
Let's go home.

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
Here we are!

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,750
Don't worry.

34
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,560
Come on.

35
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,079
We're home,

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,360
sweetie.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,710
Let's go. We should wash our hands.

38
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,400
Alright. We've done.

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,110
Xiaobao is hungry.

40
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,190
I'll cook for Xiaobao.

41
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,630
You two can watch TV before the meal.

42
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,790
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,840
Since this time

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,040
You admit your mistake,

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,230
I'll forgive you this time.

46
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,960
But if you commit the same mistake once again,

47
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,710
you'll never be allowed to go out.

48
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,750
You can't go anywhere.

49
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,440
Get it?

50
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,590
Just help yourself.

51
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,630
I'll be quick.

52
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,590
Just help yourself.

53
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,310
Sorry for

54
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,630
disturbing your TV-viewing.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,230
It doesn't matter.

56
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,840
Take it.

57
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,520
If you can't do it, just give it up.

58
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,040
Pretending to be a master can only shame yourself.

59
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,750
My cooking skills

60
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,750
don't need your judgement,

61
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,190
my otherworldly

62
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,750
master

63
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,520
to disdain me.

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,110
Ridiculous.

65
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,360
Cooking is just to follow

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
a series of complex but regular

67
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
operation procedures.

68
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,880
It's the transformation of ingredients

69
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,710
into food,

70
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,040
an artificial process.

71
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,440
It's a piece of cake.

72
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,310
A piece of cake?

73
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,440
Though I dare not say

74
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,750
I'm a very good cook,

75
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,960
making fish

76
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,360
is my specialty.

77
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,230
Do you want to have a contest?

78
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,630
You're asking for insult.

79
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
It takes a spoonful of salt, a half of sugar

80
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,630
and cooking wine of 15 grams.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,110
This recipe doesn't seem to be rigorous.

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
It doesn't indicate the size of the spoon.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,790
A spoonful of salt weighs 2.7 grams.

84
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,360
A spoonful of sugar weighs 1.4 grams.

85
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,920
Need a scale?

86
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
No penalty for it.

87
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,000
No thanks.

88
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
What you are talking about, milligrams,

89
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,040
centimeters...

90
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,400
I don't need these.

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,840
Just feel it.

92
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,190
Feeling is the soul of Chinese cuisine.

93
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,520
Xiaobao,

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,630
now let's have a taste

95
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,670
for the first course.

96
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,710
Now

97
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,880
the second one.

98
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,350
Which one do you prefer?

99
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,920
Reach out your fingers and point to the better one.

100
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,430
Xiaobao, are you sure?

101
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,840
You prefer this one?

102
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,080
It's slightly sour and sweet.

103
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,679
The ratio of sugar, vinegar and salt

104
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,760
is three to two to one.

105
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,549
It follows your

106
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:50,840
daily eating habits.

107
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,799
exactly.

108
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,640
Face the reality, Mr. He.

109
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,600
I put an unique seasoning.

110
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
What unique seasoning?

111
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,190
What is it?

112
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,230
Love.

113
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,760
Love?

114
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,550
You don't understand, do you?

115
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,800
The most important in cooking is emotion.

116
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,350
You have to know

117
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,270
who is this dish for

118
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,840
and what kind of person he is.

119
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,880
In my heart,

120
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,550
Xiaobao is full of

121
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,350
the fragrance of milk, a sweetie pie.

122
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,550
Therefore,

123
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,080
when I was making this dish

124
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,720
I add a little milk

125
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,600
to improve the flavour.

126
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,880
Though you followed the recipe

127
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
and did one

128
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,430
almost perfect braised...

129
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,350
Braised sweet and sour fish.

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,230
Okay, braised sweet and sour fish.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,390
But you've forgot that

132
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,080
kids don't eat

133
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,680
cooking wine, ginger and garlic.

134
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,760
Although I can only made one dish,

135
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
I'm the winner.

136
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Mr. He,

137
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,510
the dish washing is your turn.

138
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,390
Thank you.

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,760
Let's go, Xiaobao.

140
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
Let's go to the bathroom

141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,230
and wash your hands.

142
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,550
Is it so delicious?

143
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,000
Just so so.

144
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,190
An impromptu dish.

145
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:36,680
Xiaobao is just

146
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,840
bewitched by the fresh flavour.

147
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,270
Mr. He,

148
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,190
would you like a bowl of rice?

149
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,230
Let me take you home.

150
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,000
That's fine.

151
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,430
You can think twice.

152
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,150
Please.

153
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,720
About Ruowei...

154
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,150
Thank you so much.

155
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,510
So you came to me today

156
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,880
just to

157
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,110
refuse my help?

158
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,080
No fraud, no business.

159
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,150
Who knows, behind your kindness,

160
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,310
whether or not there hides a plot.

161
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,470
For me,

162
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,080
help you with Yang Ruowei's business

163
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,150
is nothing.

164
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Really?

165
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,390
Believe it or not.

166
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,880
All in all,

167
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
I owe a debt of gratitude to you.

168
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,800
Other people's great crisis

169
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,510
can be solved by your words.

170
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
It's awesome.

171
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,040
I can't agree you more.

172
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,040
I didn't find out until recently,

173
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,550
some things

174
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,880
can't be solved by money.

175
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,110
For example,

176
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,110
a three million yuan worth of ring

177
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,720
can't exchange

178
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
a contract with you.

179
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,720
As it comes to the ring...

180
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,040
You lost it, right?

181
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,800
How could you know that?

182
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,040
When you asked me

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,270
the price of the ring,

184
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,000
I guessed it.

185
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,960
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

186
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Do you think

187
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't pay you back,

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,960
and want to bilk?

189
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,760
Does it matter?

190
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm right!

191
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,880
I promise,

192
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
though it's expensive,

193
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,230
I will pay you back.

194
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,800
Never make a promise

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,270
you can't keep.

196
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,110
Why can't I?

197
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,720
Today the deal

198
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
will be clinched.

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,470
My reward should be

200
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,840
the lost ring.

201
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,230
Get off.

202
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,080
What are you doing?

203
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
Xiaobao is sleeping!

204
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,040
Mr. He,

205
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,920
can't you accept this price?

206
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,880
No problem.

207
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,310
I can give you a discount.

208
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,310
We can...

209
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,310
Now that you've thought it over...

210
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,960
Here you are.

211
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,880
The contract?

212
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,800
You've drawn it up

213
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,350
and place it in the car.

214
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,350
I call it preparedness.

215
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,080
Um,

216
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,600
I mean

217
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,270
we don't have to be in such a hurry.

218
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,390
Time is money.

219
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,190
Sign it.

220
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,310
At least you should show me the details.

221
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,550
Go ahead.

222
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,640
So much money.

223
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,040
I can't accept it.

224
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,640
I've said

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,310
what I want is to pay you back for the ring.

226
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,110
Sure.

227
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,760
But in front of others,

228
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,310
you should name me your husband.

229
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,310
Make it clear in advance,

230
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,390
I can only keep

231
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,680
my promise about Xiaobao.

232
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,430
As for some affairs between husband and wife...

233
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,640
Set your mind at ease,

234
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not interested in you.

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,470
Eh?

236
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,760
What I need is

237
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,880
your major.

238
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,350
I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,110
Remember it's a deal.

240
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,390
It'll end someday.

241
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,150
If you take our relationship seriously,

242
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,880
you're bound to get hurt.

243
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,510
Don't worry about that case, I'll sign it.

244
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
Only in two cases

245
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,230
can the contract be terminated automatically.

246
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,270
First,

247
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
Xiaobao's condition is eased.

248
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,080
Second, Party A or Party B

249
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,840
is influenced by force majeure.

250
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,550
These are all noted in the contract.

251
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,760
Uh, Party A and Party B

252
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,080
can encounter what?

253
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,470
For example?

254
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,000
Acute disease,

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,270
death of one party or

256
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,550
meet the crush.

257
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,040
Mr. He,

258
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,920
I hope you will find

259
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,270
your Miss. Right soon.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,040
Thank you so much.

261
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,600
But I still need to remind you

262
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,960
that the defaults in the contract

263
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,680
include but are not limited to

264
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,080
a poor performance

265
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,760
making Xiaobao's condition worse...

266
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,510
Wait a minute, defaults?

267
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,510
What do you mean?

268
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,720
Is there any penalty?

269
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,390
20 million, of course.

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,000
20 million? Give me the contract!

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,550
The act of throwing yourself on me

272
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,600
is a good performance.

273
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,230
You can do the same next time.

274
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,080
Mrs. He.

275
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,640
Mrs. He?

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,880
When signing the contract next time,

277
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,390
remember to check the items.

278
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
20 million.

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,880
One, two,

280
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,000
three, four,

281
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,430
seven...eight zeros!

282
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,390
It's really 20 million.

283
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,760
He Qiaoyan, you...

284
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,310
How dare you...

285
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,110
You profiteer!

286
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,470
He's a weirdo.

287
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,430
Does he regard marriage as a business?

288
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,680
And sign a contract with you

289
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,760
Seriously?

290
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,150
I'm moving out in two days

291
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,550
As to my job in hospital,

292
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,230
I'll also apply for

293
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,680
an unpaid leave.

294
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,800
I should call you Mrs. He in the future.

295
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,920
My gracious lady,

296
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,960
I swear my allegiance to you.

297
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,640
I will always be your faithful servant.

298
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,840
Stop it.

299
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,430
So bothering.

300
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,720
You know me, his nominal wife, is an employee indeed.

301
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,310
This time

302
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm assigned an important task.

303
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,880
I'll help Xiaobao to talk.

304
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,000
And I'm going to find him

305
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,270
the most suitable primary school.

306
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,640
Let him integrate into the society.

307
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,800
It's too hard.

308
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,800
Don't you remember?

309
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,150
Ever since we came to this city,

310
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,270
we have been living together.

311
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,110
Of course.

312
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,270
Almost six years.

313
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,040
Do you remember

314
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
the first house we rented,

315
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,270
very small, with one bedroom.

316
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:51,680
At that time,

317
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,920
We just bought a curtain to

318
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,840
divide it into two parts.

319
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
Do you remember?

320
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,270
Of course.

321
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,040
At that time,

322
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,680
I stayed up late and binged TV series.

323
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,270
Once I binge-watched,

324
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,000
I can't help laughing.

325
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,190
My laughter

326
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,550
always raised your recrimination.

327
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,080
You said, "Qin Yiyue,

328
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,720
keep quiet!"

329
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,840
And then your bra

330
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,000
was thrown over the curtain.

331
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,390
I was thinking

332
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,840
how lucky I'm, you didn't throw a kitchen knife.

333
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,270
Thank God.

334
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Thank you for not killing me.

335
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,150
You know what?

336
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,150
When I broke up with Zhou Ziyang,

337
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,510
I was very sad,

338
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,310
but I dared not tell you.

339
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,080
I was afraid of your scold.

340
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
As soon as I entered the house,

341
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
you told me

342
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,430
"Qin Yiyue,

343
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,600
why do you wear so little clothing?

344
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,510
Take good care of yourself

345
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,680
or I'll give you a lesson. Are you hungry?

346
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
I can make noodles for you."

347
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
At that time,

348
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,310
my tears

349
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,080
all of a sudden came down.

350
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,470
And then I swore that

351
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,600
if one day I made a fortune,

352
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,680
I'll buy this house.

353
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,640
I want to buy it

354
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,840
and write down our names on the property ownership certificate.

355
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,150
I just want to be with you.

356
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,840
When we're old,

357
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,430
we can go to the nursing home hand in hand.

358
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
We'll be

359
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,960
the most beautiful women there.

360
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Silly girl.

361
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,470
Listen,

362
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,430
I don't want you to

363
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,680
be with me all the life.

364
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,800
Look at your smelly socks,

365
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,310
snack, underwear...

366
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,150
What a mess.

367
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,000
You'd better get married.

368
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,310
Find someone to take care of you.

369
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,040
Don't you love me anymore?

370
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,470
Why not?

371
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't want anyone to look after me.

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
I want to enjoy myself,

373
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,080
with your company.

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,310
No problem.

375
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,680
Tonight

376
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,760
in our home,

377
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,350
let's enjoy ourselves the last time.

378
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,310
Let me play a song.

379
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,470
I get the video.

380
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,150
Let's go.

381
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,800
Call out my name!

382
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,190
Qin Yiyue!

383
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,430
Why do you all look at me?

384
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,080
Why  not make a phone call?

385
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,470
We've urged him.

386
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,760
He said he was on the road.

387
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,040
An hour.

388
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,680
Does he take the silk road?

389
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,680
Maybe there's a traffic jam.

390
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:20,600
Dad, sorry... Mr. Dad...

391
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,270
Sorry...Chairman Wen.

392
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,350
Sorry I'm late.

393
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,190
Why are you late for every regular meeting?

394
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,880
I'm so sorry.

395
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,840
Sorry!

396
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,600
Something happened last night.

397
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,760
Why do you two make faces?

398
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
There are mosquitoes.

399
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,470
Let me introduce you

400
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,430
my secretary Yang Ruowei.

401
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,960
I've finally found you!

402
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,110
Don't remember me?

403
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,840
Me.

404
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,310
How can you forget me?

405
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,350
Have you two known each other?

406
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,230
More than that...

407
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,550
In many aspects,

408
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,080
Miss Yang's showcased me her ability.

409
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,310
It occurred to me

410
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
that we've met only once.

411
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,080
Nothing special.

412
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,270
I forgot it if you didn't say.

413
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,350
Nothing special?

414
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,190
Pardon me,

415
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,550
you reckon it usual?

416
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,800
You two,

417
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,310
please talk about it after the meeting.

418
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,080
Let's talk about

419
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,600
sales of this month.

420
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,760
All right.

421
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,110
Last night I analyzed

422
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,640
the trend of North China market.

423
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,960
I stayed up late

424
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,390
to study it.

425
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,640
A moment please.

426
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,000
Let's have a look.

427
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,640
Any comments?

428
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,190
Boss!

429
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,110
What's up?

430
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,190
The screen!

431
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,230
Mr. Wen,

432
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,880
you take the wrong file.

433
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,760
This is the right one.

434
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,040
Right.

435
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,760
This is it.

436
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,840
It cost me all the night to

437
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,920
prepare it.

438
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,960
Though it's not my idea,

439
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,080
I've read it.

440
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,600
Trust me, dad!

441
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,960
No, Chairman Wen. Don't go.

442
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,800
I got you.

443
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,510
This is the workplace.

444
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,150
I work every day,

445
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,430
while beauty is not always here.

446
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,000
By the way, from now on

447
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,800
you're always here.

448
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,390
Nice to meet you.

449
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,000
What are you doing?

450
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,960
Go on.

451
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,350
What's this?

452
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm afraid my medical records

453
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,920
are hard to take over.

454
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,310
These kids need special attention.

455
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,960
According to their symptoms and preferences,

456
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,040
I've sorted these out.

457
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,470
So that the doctor who take over my post

458
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,510
will adjust to it easily.

459
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,640
Another good doctor is leaving.

460
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,270
It's spreading the hospital that

461
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,680
you're leaving

462
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,920
to get married.

463
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,470
But I know

464
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,880
you're for the boy,

465
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,390
who's unwilling to speak.

466
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,960
He's your patient.

467
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,350
Take it easy.

468
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,390
No matter what others say,

469
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,960
I am behind you.

470
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,470
Do you have to leave?

471
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,110
Yes.

472
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
I promised He Qiaoyan

473
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,040
to take care of Xiaobao at full time.

474
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,920
I'll be back in a year

475
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,800
and continue my work.

476
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,390
I'll miss you.

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,040
If you're not here,

478
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,550
when being bullied,

479
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,840
who can do me a favour?

480
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,390
Let me see...

481
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,800
If in the future

482
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,150
someone bullies you,

483
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,150
you can say you're Qi Yiyue's friend.

484
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,920
And what will happen?

485
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,760
They will beat you even worse.

486
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,270
Eh?

487
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,190
Yang Ruowei and Qin Yiyue

488
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,110
took a short video at home.

489
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,190
What's wrong?

490
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,150
I'll miss you

491
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,960
and this house.

492
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,720
All right.

493
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,510
Don't blame me for being talkative.

494
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,640
Although you've made a deal,

495
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,350
for your sake,

496
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,800
she's not just saying goodbye to being single,

497
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,110
giving up work,

498
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,840
but moving away from her familiar environment.

499
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,000
For herself,

500
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,040
she has to give up a lot of

501
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,110
her hobbies

502
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,550
to cater to your taste.

503
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,640
I've signed with her

504
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,880
a labor contract,

505
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,920
so she has to provide her time

506
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,350
and expertise.

507
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,270
Okay, you can't get it.

508
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,000
I didn't want to make her unhappy.

509
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,960
This is the first time I've heard that

510
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,430
you think about others' feelings.

511
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,840
I just feel that

512
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,430
if she

513
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,080
work in a negative emotion,

514
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,510
it's bound to affect Xiaobao.

515
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Don't fool me. She's special for you.

516
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,040
Yiyue,

517
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,840
why is the door open?

518
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,550
So many things stacked here.

519
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,350
What're you doing?

520
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,430
Ning Fang,

521
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,510
do me a favour.

522
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,840
Moving on myself

523
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,350
is too difficult.

524
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,310
Fortunately you're coming.

525
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
Are you moving?

526
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,840
I'm on unpaid leave,

527
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,510
and I'm moving to He Qiaoyan's home.

528
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,270
I signed a one-year contract with him,

529
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,760
promising to

530
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,840
act as his wife

531
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,110
and take care of Xiaobao.

532
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,640
Are you serious?

533
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,190
Absolutely.

534
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,390
Just for the three million yuan worth of ring,

535
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,800
you sacrificed a lot.

536
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,310
Just three million yuan?

537
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,310
It's beyond my means.

538
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,430
What a big decision!

539
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,040
Why don't you tell me?

540
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,640
I...

541
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,640
Money or contract,

542
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,470
I have many methods

543
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,430
to help you.

544
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,880
It's no use.

545
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,110
How can you help me with so much money?

546
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,310
Let a dog bite him?

547
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,550
Or ask a cat to scratch him?

548
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,880
Three million is just a number.

549
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,390
We went to college together.

550
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,510
I know it's hard to major in medicine.

551
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,390
I don't want you,

552
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,840
for the sake of others,

553
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,640
to give up your dream.

554
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,600
For me, Xiaobao

555
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,270
is just the same as

556
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,840
every patient of mine.

557
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,350
If one year

558
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,680
can cure him,

559
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,430
he'll have

560
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,840
a different life.

561
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,310
It's worthy,

562
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,470
isn't?

563
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,310
So what do you think of He Qiaoyan?

564
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,840
It's just a deal.

565
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,390
Nothing else.

566
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,430
All right, protect yourself.

567
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,470
Let me know if you have any trouble.

568
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,550
Am I late again?

569
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,000
That night...

570
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,080
The room rate

571
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
is 1288 yuan.

572
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,840
Wanna split it?

573
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,550
Please send it to my bank account.

574
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,390
What do you think of me?

575
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,840
If you want me

576
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,270
to keep the secret,

577
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,040
please show your sincerity.

578
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,550
What would you do?

579
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,960
First unbutton my shirt,

580
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,840
then I'll tell you the next step.

581
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,960
You wanna undress...

582
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,470
Oops! You're on purpose!

583
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,510
Have them washed.

584
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,190
And you pay for the dry-cleaning.

585
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,430
Don't direct me.

586
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,760
It's your assistant's work.

587
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,040
You have several

588
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,960
beautiful assistants, don't you?

589
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,190
They were all fired by my dad.

590
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,190
Sorry,

591
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,040
I was being frivolous.

592
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,000
I seldom saw a beauty like you.

593
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,350
I can't help...

594
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,150
If you can make my dad

595
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,600
no longer limit me,

596
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,680
I promise

597
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,680
that wonderful night

598
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,310
will be a secret.

599
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,080
Agree or not?

600
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,680
It's none of my business.

601
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,000
By the way,

602
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,840
split the bill.

603
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,190
I can afford the larger share.

604
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,800
Don't thank me.

605
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,150
Hello, this is Yueyue's vlog.

606
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,350
Today is our

607
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:23,310
last day living in this house.

608
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,680
We good friends

609
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,550
are ready to apply facial masks together.

610
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,470
You know my skin is sensitive.

611
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,640
I didn't dare to use

612
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
whitening mask before.

613
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,680
But this mask of UNIFON

614
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,150
is great.

615
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,190
Look at the ingredients.

616
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,470
Glycyrrhiza glabra L.

617
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,640
All of these are plants.

618
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,760
Compared with other facial masks,

619
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,080
it's more moderate and tolerable.

620
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,800
Girls,

621
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,270
today is the last day

622
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,880
we live here. Cheers.

623
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,430
Yiyue,

624
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,040
thank Mr. He for me.

625
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,510
My new job is terrific.

626
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,080
To your new job,

627
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,600
cheers!

628
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,680
I ordered takeouts.

629
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:04,960
Hello.

630
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,150
Is Dr. Qin in, please?

631
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,510
Eat this. Yummy.

632
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,190
Hello, Dr. Qin.

633
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,470
Mr. He knows

634
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,760
you're moving tomorrow.

635
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,270
So he asked me to

636
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,310
send you this gift today.

637
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,110
This is the contract

638
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,880
of this house.

639
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,270
Several places

640
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,270
require your signature and seal.

641
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:29,920
The contract of this house?

642
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,550
Yes.

643
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,880
You mean

644
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,920
He Qiaoyan

645
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
bought it?

646
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,640
Right.

647
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,960
I Swear

648
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,430
I didn't

649
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,230
ask him to buy it.

650
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,640
This house...

651
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,270
The landlord

652
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,600
rented it out, did he?

653
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,600
This matter

654
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,390
is solved by Mr. He.

655
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,430
Dr. Qin is going to live in Mr. He's house,

656
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,110
and this one can be used by Miss Yang,

657
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,510
as her staff quarters.

658
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,430
By the way, Dr. Qin,

659
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:56,550
you can come back

660
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,350
at will.

661
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,720
What are you doing? Just sign it.

662
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,150
Are you kidding?

663
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,080
This guy is a crook.

664
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,390
It may be a trap.

665
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,640
I won't sign it.

666
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,600
Hello?

667
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
I'll wait for you downstairs.

668
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,680
If you want to thank me,

669
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,230
you can come downstairs in two minutes.

670
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,720
Why should I obey your order?

671
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,350
It's up to me.

672
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,080
Well...

673
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,310
Looking I'm enclosing the contract,

674
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,600
you thought I am going down now,

675
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
right?

676
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,270
No way!

677
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,510
Unpunctual and inefficient...

678
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,190
This is delicious.

679
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,600
Five...

680
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,640
Dr. Qin,

681
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,680
it's been four minutes.

682
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,880
Take it easy.

683
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,470
I'm teaching him to be patient.

684
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:40,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

685
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,110
You wait for me here.

686
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:49,880
Okay.

687
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,310
I'll give you the last chance.

688
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,880
Are you serious?

689
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,080
You dodged me!

690
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:29,880
Do you know

691
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
how dangerous was that?

692
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,510
Your two-minute time limit

693
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,800
is to be blamed.

694
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,389
Why did you buy me the house?

695
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,600
According to my analysis,

696
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,000
you are absent-minded.

697
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,800
There's a 75 percent chance that

698
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,600
you'll drop

699
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,310
the ring

700
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,040
somewhere

701
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,550
in the house.

702
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,350
Thus I bought the house

703
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,150
in case of that someone else get the ring.

704
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,230
My family is big,

705
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,840
but I could never imagine that

706
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,190
all your messy luggage

707
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,920
will be piled up here.

708
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
And your bedroom

709
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,230
looks like a recycling station...

710
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,350
Oh, no.

711
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:08,880
I...

712
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,960
You're forbidden to occupy

713
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,390
too much my private space.

714
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,350
So I decided to

715
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,230
buy you this house.

716
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,230
You can regard it as

717
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,390
a warehouse.

718
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,470
As for your moving,

719
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,270
just bring some

720
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,550
necessities.

721
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,960
This big house

722
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,680
is too expensive.

723
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,760
I can't accept it.

724
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,040
No refusal.

725
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,150
It's my order.

726
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,680
I'm just your employee.

727
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,390
I don't need

728
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,680
such things,

729
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,960
a house, or any other dowry.

730
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,800
Nothing required.

731
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,080
Our deal

732
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,840
is clear in the contract.

733
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,720
Oh well,

734
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
your generosity

735
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,680
makes me burdened.

736
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,720
Qin Yiyue,

737
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,510
to do business with you

738
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,680
is so hard.

739
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,880
You don't need to buy me the house.

740
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,470
You're the owner.

741
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,110
Ruowei and I

742
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,880
are your tenants.

743
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,800
As you've mentioned,

744
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,680
employee's benefits.

745
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,190
You can rent it to us

746
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,110
at half-price.

747
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,600
Deal?

748
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,310
Nope.

749
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,640
I wanna profits, too.

750
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,310
Got it?

751
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,800
How much should I pay?

752
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
A 80% discount.

753
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,350
Serious?

754
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,720
You call it profits?

755
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,680
I haven't finished my words.

756
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,550
The remaining 20%

757
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,310
is not paid in crash.

758
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,680
The contract period

759
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,920
will be prolonged by 20%.

760
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,310
In other words, you should work for me

761
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
for two more months.

762
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,230
One year and two months.

763
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,040
Is this his house?

764
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,150
Qin Yiyue,

765
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,800
calm down.

766
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:46,040
Ummm...

767
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,390
Just take it as

768
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,920
an door-to-door psychotherapy.

769
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,680
Okay?

770
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,430
Nothing special.

771
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,960
Come on.

772
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,350
Tree drivers, five housekeepers,

773
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,880
seven cooks and ten maids,

774
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,840
it's time to receive

775
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,270
Your Lady.

776
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,550
Foolish.

777
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,190
There are not so many people

778
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,680
to receive you.

779
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,680
Welcome, Dr. Qin.

780
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,800
I thought

781
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,430
you're here to help me with my luggage.

782
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,040
Why should I help you with your luggage?

783
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,800
Have you ever seen a new employee

784
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,510
asking her boss to move a computer?

785
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,110
For your brute force,

786
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,600
these two small boxes

787
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,920
are a piece of cake.

788
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,430
Come in.

789
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,680
You really know me.

790
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,470
There are clear provisions in the employment notice that

791
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:51,430
you should have arrived before 9:00 am.

792
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,390
It's 9:06 am.

793
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,680
So I had to put off

794
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,350
the regular meeting of our company to wait for you.

795
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,600
Do not let it happen again.

796
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,470
A brief introduction.

797
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,350
That's the dining room. That's the study.

798
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,600
This is the living room.

799
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,720
These are public areas

800
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,840
are open to you.

801
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,510
Are you living here?

802
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,840
So tidy.

803
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,190
What do you think should be here?

804
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
In ordinary families,

805
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,510
the tea table in the living room

806
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,350
will be full of snacks and fruits.

807
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,510
And the sofa

808
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,430
will be piled up with hairy

809
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,960
blankets and pillows.

810
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:37,550
Your house is so big and desolate.

811
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,960
It doesn't look like an ordinary family.

812
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,640
That TV is large.

813
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,110
Do you have video games?

814
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,470
I never play games.

815
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,680
That's a waste of time.

816
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,270
In addition,

817
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,190
you should eat in the dining room.

818
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,270
I've never eaten

819
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:50,080
on the sofa.

820
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,310
And in my private space,

821
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,150
everything

822
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,040
should have a clear

823
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,960
use value.

824
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,350
Those what you said

825
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,920
are no use for me.

826
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,760
Let's go.

827
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,390
Let me show you

828
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,310
Xiaobao's room.

829
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,510
This is Xiaobao's room.

830
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,880
Are those his books?

831
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,000
How smart he is!

832
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,230
I'll teach you to

833
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,040
embrace the world.

834
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,840
Your room is upstairs.

835
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,720
Excuse me,

836
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,680
we live in the same room?

837
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,040
Come with me.

838
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,270
We must keep it secret that

839
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,640
we are not a couple.

840
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,080
So you can't live in the guest room.

841
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,430
It's easy to catch other's attention.

842
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,310
I've prepared another bed.

843
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,000
Roommates live on different beds.

844
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,880
Accept it?

845
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:14,720
Behind the closed door,

846
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,230
who knows whether I'm in the master bedroom

847
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,430
or the guest bedroom?

848
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,430
Don't underestimate Xiaobao.

849
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,000
Please.

850
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,110
His room is so big.

851
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,270
My room is so small.

852
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,510
So does my wardrobe.

853
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:53,960
These things

854
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,040
can't be piled up on my bed...

855
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,920
It's my stand-in?

856
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,510
He's not a pervert, is he?

857
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,720
This little guy

858
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,080
is still suspicious.

859
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,390
I have to do something.

860
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,150
My dear,

861
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,390
can you help me?

862
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,040
Xiaobao, mommy is calling you.

863
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,390
I'm calling you.

864
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,230
Mrs. Liu,

865
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,150
Come and help her.

866
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,600
You come here.

867
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,760
What's up?

868
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,470
Help me

869
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,640
move this over there.

870
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,920
These things

871
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,310
are usually done by Mrs. Liu.

872
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,080
Hurry up.

873
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,720
Is this necessary?

874
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,550
Keep still.

875
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,470
Xiaobao saw me in another room.

876
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,390
I'm suspected.

877
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,470
Is that necessary?

878
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,960
Of course.

879
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,550
Conjugal love

880
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,680
is the cornerstone of a child's sense of security.

881
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,880
This is a classic gesture to show love.

882
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,350
Hug in when cooking.

883
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,640
It's not hugging.

884
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,150
but kidnapping.

885
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,310
How could I cook?

886
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
Sorry,

887
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,190
I need more practices.

888
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,760
Move to the left.

889
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,080
Xiaobao,

890
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,390
help yourself.

891
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,800
I've told you that

892
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,350
Xiaobao is very slow to get up

893
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,110
Hurry up.

894
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:25,110
Touch my hair.

895
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:25,960
It's too greasy.

896
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,760
I haven't washed it for days.

897
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,080
Put your hands here.

898
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,550
Xiaobao.

899
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,760
Good morning, my boy.

900
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,430
It's not like that.

901
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,190
It's like this.

902
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,270
Got it?

903
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:00,430
Remember to wash it.

904
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,430
Step on me...

905
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,000
What?

906
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,600
We should be face to face.

907
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,960
Xiaobao,

908
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:18,720
mom and dad

909
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,470
are kissing, hugging and raising up.

910
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,110
It's ok to kiss and hug,

911
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:28,390
but raise you up...

912
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,550
It's a triathlon.

913
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,190
Watch TV.

914
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,150
Put me down.

915
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,960
You pinched me in the ribs.

916
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,960
It's time for you to lose weight.

917
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,920
It's not like that.

918
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,720
It's like this.
