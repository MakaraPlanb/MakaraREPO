Unforgettable Love
EP07

2
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,590
Still no reply.

3
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,080
We've searched so many places.

4
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,400
Where could he go?

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,080
By the way,

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,310
when did Xiaobao disappear?

7
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,789
Mrs. Liu thought that

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,880
Xiaobao was taking a nap

9
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,110
until she felt

10
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,039
something wrong.

11
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:24,960
She went to Xiaobao's room

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,880
and found out that he was not there.

13
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,520
Was there

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,560
a similar situation before?

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,520
Absolutely.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,229
That's the day when he knew that

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:34,920
I'm not his

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,000
natural father.

19
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,670
I think I know where he was.

20
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,520
Xiaobao...

21
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,039
Xiaobao!

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,230
Why did you come here by yourself?

23
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,560
Do you know you cause

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,590
a big trouble to others?

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,710
Answer me, He Weifei!

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,190
Xiaobao,

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,230
Your dad just worried about you.

28
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,110
He's not angry with you. Don't be afraid.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
Qin Yiyue...

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,670
Stop it.

31
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,040
Let's go home.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
Here we are!

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,750
Don't worry.

34
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,560
Come on.

35
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,079
We're home,

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,360
sweetie.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,710
Let's go. We should wash our hands.

38
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,400
Alright. We've done.

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,110
Xiaobao is hungry.

40
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,190
I'll cook for Xiaobao.

41
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,630
You two can watch TV before the meal.

42
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,790
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,840
Since this time

44
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,040
You admit your mistake,

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,230
I'll forgive you this time.

46
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,960
But if you commit the same mistake once again,

47
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,710
you'll never be allowed to go out.

48
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,750
You can't go anywhere.

49
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,440
Get it?

50
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,590
Just help yourself.

51
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,630
I'll be quick.

52
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,590
Just help yourself.

53
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,310
Sorry for

54
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,630
disturbing your TV-viewing.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,230
It doesn't matter.

56
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,840
Take it.

57
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,520
If you can't do it, just give it up.

58
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,040
Pretending to be a master can only shame yourself.

59
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,750
My cooking skills

60
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,750
don't need your judgement,

61
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,190
my otherworldly

62
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,750
master

63
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,520
to disdain me.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,110
Ridiculous.

65
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,360
Cooking is just to follow

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,840
a series of complex but regular

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,840
operation procedures.

68
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,880
It's the transformation of ingredients

69
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,710
into food,

70
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,040
an artificial process.

71
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,440
It's a piece of cake.

72
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,310
A piece of cake?

73
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:40,440
Though I dare not say

74
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,750
I'm a very good cook,

75
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,960
making fish

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
is my specialty.

77
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,230
Do you want to have a contest?

78
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,630
You're asking for insult.

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
It takes a spoonful of salt, a half of sugar

80
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,630
and cooking wine of 15 grams.

81
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,110
This recipe doesn't seem to be rigorous.

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,080
It doesn't indicate the size of the spoon.

83
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,790
A spoonful of salt weighs 2.7 grams.

84
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,360
A spoonful of sugar weighs 1.4 grams.

85
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,920
Need a scale?

86
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
No penalty for it.

87
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,000
No thanks.

88
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
What you are talking about, milligrams,

89
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
centimeters...

90
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,400
I don't need these.

91
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,840
Just feel it.

92
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,190
Feeling is the soul of Chinese cuisine.

93
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,520
Xiaobao,

94
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,630
now let's have a taste

95
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,670
for the first course.

96
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,710
Now

97
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,880
the second one.

98
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,350
Which one do you prefer?

99
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,920
Reach out your fingers and point to the better one.

100
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,430
Xiaobao, are you sure?

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
You prefer this one?

102
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,080
It's slightly sour and sweet.

103
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,679
The ratio of sugar, vinegar and salt

104
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,760
is three to two to one.

105
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,549
It follows your

106
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,840
daily eating habits.

107
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,799
exactly.

108
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,640
Face the reality, Mr. He.

109
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,600
I put an unique seasoning.

110
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
What unique seasoning?

111
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,190
What is it?

112
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,230
Love.

113
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,760
Love?

114
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,550
You don't understand, do you?

115
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,800
The most important in cooking is emotion.

116
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,350
You have to know

117
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,270
who is this dish for

118
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,840
and what kind of person he is.

119
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,880
In my heart,

120
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,550
Xiaobao is full of

121
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,350
the fragrance of milk, a sweetie pie.

122
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,550
Therefore,

123
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,080
when I was making this dish

124
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,720
I add a little milk

125
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,600
to improve the flavour.

126
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,880
Though you followed the recipe

127
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
and did one

128
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,430
almost perfect braised...

129
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,350
Braised sweet and sour fish.

130
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,230
Okay, braised sweet and sour fish.

131
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,390
But you've forgot that

132
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,080
kids don't eat

133
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
cooking wine, ginger and garlic.

134
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,760
Although I can only made one dish,

135
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm the winner.

136
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Mr. He,

137
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,510
the dish washing is your turn.

138
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,390
Thank you.

139
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,760
Let's go, Xiaobao.

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
Let's go to the bathroom

141
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,230
and wash your hands.

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,550
Is it so delicious?

143
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,000
Just so so.

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,190
An impromptu dish.

145
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,680
Xiaobao is just

146
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,840
bewitched by the fresh flavour.

147
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,270
Mr. He,

148
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,190
would you like a bowl of rice?

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,230
Let me take you home.

150
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,000
That's fine.

151
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,430
You can think twice.

152
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,150
Please.

153
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,720
About Ruowei...

154
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,150
Thank you so much.

155
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,510
So you came to me today

156
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,880
just to

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,110
refuse my help?

158
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,080
No fraud, no business.

159
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,150
Who knows, behind your kindness,

160
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,310
whether or not there hides a plot.

161
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,470
For me,

162
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,080
help you with Yang Ruowei's business

163
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,150
is nothing.

164
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,640
Really?

165
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,390
Believe it or not.

166
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,880
All in all,

167
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I owe a debt of gratitude to you.

168
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,800
Other people's great crisis

169
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,510
can be solved by your words.

170
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,040
It's awesome.

171
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,040
I can't agree you more.

172
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,040
I didn't find out until recently,

173
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,550
some things

174
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,880
can't be solved by money.

175
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,110
For example,

176
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,110
a three million yuan worth of ring

177
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,720
can't exchange

178
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,960
a contract with you.

179
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,720
As it comes to the ring...

180
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,040
You lost it, right?

181
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,800
How could you know that?

182
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,040
When you asked me

183
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,270
the price of the ring,

184
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
I guessed it.

185
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,960
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

186
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,800
Do you think

187
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't pay you back,

188
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,960
and want to bilk?

189
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,760
Does it matter?

190
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,080
I'm right!

191
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,880
I promise,

192
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,840
though it's expensive,

193
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,230
I will pay you back.

194
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,800
Never make a promise

195
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,270
you can't keep.

196
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,110
Why can't I?

197
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,720
Today the deal

198
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,880
will be clinched.

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,470
My reward should be

200
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,840
the lost ring.

201
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,230
Get off.

202
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,080
What are you doing?

203
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Xiaobao is sleeping!

204
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,040
Mr. He,

205
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,920
can't you accept this price?

206
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,880
No problem.

207
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,310
I can give you a discount.

208
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,310
We can...

209
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,310
Now that you've thought it over...

210
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,960
Here you are.

211
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,880
The contract?

212
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,800
You've drawn it up

213
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,350
and place it in the car.

214
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,350
I call it preparedness.

215
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,080
Um,

216
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,600
I mean

217
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,270
we don't have to be in such a hurry.

218
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,390
Time is money.

219
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,190
Sign it.

220
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,310
At least you should show me the details.

221
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,550
Go ahead.

222
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,640
So much money.

223
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,040
I can't accept it.

224
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,640
I've said

225
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,310
what I want is to pay you back for the ring.

226
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,110
Sure.

227
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,760
But in front of others,

228
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,310
you should name me your husband.

229
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,310
Make it clear in advance,

230
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,390
I can only keep

231
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,680
my promise about Xiaobao.

232
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,430
As for some affairs between husband and wife...

233
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,640
Set your mind at ease,

234
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm not interested in you.

235
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,470
Eh?

236
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,760
What I need is

237
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,880
your major.

238
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,350
I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,110
Remember it's a deal.

240
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,390
It'll end someday.

241
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,150
If you take our relationship seriously,

242
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,880
you're bound to get hurt.

243
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,510
Don't worry about that case, I'll sign it.

244
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,040
Only in two cases

245
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,230
can the contract be terminated automatically.

246
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,270
First,

247
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,960
Xiaobao's condition is eased.

248
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,080
Second, Party A or Party B

249
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,840
is influenced by force majeure.

250
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,550
These are all noted in the contract.

251
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,760
Uh, Party A and Party B

252
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,080
can encounter what?

253
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,470
For example?

254
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,000
Acute disease,

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,270
death of one party or

256
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,550
meet the crush.

257
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,040
Mr. He,

258
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,920
I hope you will find

259
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,270
your Miss. Right soon.

260
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,040
Thank you so much.

261
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,600
But I still need to remind you

262
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,960
that the defaults in the contract

263
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,680
include but are not limited to

264
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,080
a poor performance

265
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,760
making Xiaobao's condition worse...

266
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,510
Wait a minute, defaults?

267
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,510
What do you mean?

268
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,720
Is there any penalty?

269
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,390
20 million, of course.

270
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,000
20 million? Give me the contract!

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,550
The act of throwing yourself on me

272
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,600
is a good performance.

273
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,230
You can do the same next time.

274
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,080
Mrs. He.

275
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,640
Mrs. He?

276
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,880
When signing the contract next time,

277
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,390
remember to check the items.

278
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
20 million.

279
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,880
One, two,

280
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
three, four,

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,430
seven...eight zeros!

282
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,390
It's really 20 million.

283
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,760
He Qiaoyan, you...

284
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,310
How dare you...

285
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,110
You profiteer!

286
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,470
He's a weirdo.

287
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,430
Does he regard marriage as a business?

288
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,680
And sign a contract with you

289
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,760
Seriously?

290
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,150
I'm moving out in two days

291
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,550
As to my job in hospital,

292
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,230
I'll also apply for

293
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,680
an unpaid leave.

294
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,800
I should call you Mrs. He in the future.

295
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,920
My gracious lady,

296
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,960
I swear my allegiance to you.

297
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,640
I will always be your faithful servant.

298
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,840
Stop it.

299
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,430
So bothering.

300
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,720
You know me, his nominal wife, is an employee indeed.

301
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,310
This time

302
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,720
I'm assigned an important task.

303
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,880
I'll help Xiaobao to talk.

304
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,000
And I'm going to find him

305
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,270
the most suitable primary school.

306
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,640
Let him integrate into the society.

307
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,800
It's too hard.

308
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,800
Don't you remember?

309
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,150
Ever since we came to this city,

310
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,270
we have been living together.

311
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,110
Of course.

312
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,270
Almost six years.

313
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,040
Do you remember

314
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
the first house we rented,

315
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,270
very small, with one bedroom.

316
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,680
At that time,

317
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,920
We just bought a curtain to

318
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
divide it into two parts.

319
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Do you remember?

320
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,270
Of course.

321
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,040
At that time,

322
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,680
I stayed up late and binged TV series.

323
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,270
Once I binge-watched,

324
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't help laughing.

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,190
My laughter

326
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,550
always raised your recrimination.

327
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,080
You said, "Qin Yiyue,

328
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,720
keep quiet!"

329
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,840
And then your bra

330
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,000
was thrown over the curtain.

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,390
I was thinking

332
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,840
how lucky I'm, you didn't throw a kitchen knife.

333
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,270
Thank God.

334
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,640
Thank you for not killing me.

335
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,150
You know what?

336
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,150
When I broke up with Zhou Ziyang,

337
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,510
I was very sad,

338
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,310
but I dared not tell you.

339
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,080
I was afraid of your scold.

340
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
As soon as I entered the house,

341
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,920
you told me

342
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,430
"Qin Yiyue,

343
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,600
why do you wear so little clothing?

344
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,510
Take good care of yourself

345
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,680
or I'll give you a lesson. Are you hungry?

346
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
I can make noodles for you."

347
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,080
At that time,

348
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,310
my tears

349
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,080
all of a sudden came down.

350
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,470
And then I swore that

351
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,600
if one day I made a fortune,

352
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,680
I'll buy this house.

353
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,640
I want to buy it

354
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,840
and write down our names on the property ownership certificate.

355
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,150
I just want to be with you.

356
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,840
When we're old,

357
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,430
we can go to the nursing home hand in hand.

358
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
We'll be

359
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,960
the most beautiful women there.

360
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,720
Silly girl.

361
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,470
Listen,

362
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,430
I don't want you to

363
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,680
be with me all the life.

364
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,800
Look at your smelly socks,

365
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,310
snack, underwear...

366
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,150
What a mess.

367
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,000
You'd better get married.

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,310
Find someone to take care of you.

369
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:41,040
Don't you love me anymore?

370
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,470
Why not?

371
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't want anyone to look after me.

372
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,920
I want to enjoy myself,

373
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,080
with your company.

374
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,310
No problem.

375
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,680
Tonight

376
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,760
in our home,

377
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,350
let's enjoy ourselves the last time.

378
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,310
Let me play a song.

379
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,470
I get the video.

380
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,150
Let's go.

381
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,800
Call out my name!

382
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,190
Qin Yiyue!

383
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,430
Why do you all look at me?

384
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,080
Why  not make a phone call?

385
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,470
We've urged him.

386
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,760
He said he was on the road.

387
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,040
An hour.

388
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,680
Does he take the silk road?

389
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,680
Maybe there's a traffic jam.

390
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,600
Dad, sorry... Mr. Dad...

391
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,270
Sorry...Chairman Wen.

392
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,350
Sorry I'm late.

393
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,190
Why are you late for every regular meeting?

394
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm so sorry.

395
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,840
Sorry!

396
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,600
Something happened last night.

397
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,760
Why do you two make faces?

398
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
There are mosquitoes.

399
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,470
Let me introduce you

400
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,430
my secretary Yang Ruowei.

401
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,960
I've finally found you!

402
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,110
Don't remember me?

403
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,840
Me.

404
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,310
How can you forget me?

405
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,350
Have you two known each other?

406
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,230
More than that...

407
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,550
In many aspects,

408
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,080
Miss Yang's showcased me her ability.

409
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,310
It occurred to me

410
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
that we've met only once.

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,080
Nothing special.

412
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,270
I forgot it if you didn't say.

413
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,350
Nothing special?

414
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,190
Pardon me,

415
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,550
you reckon it usual?

416
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,800
You two,

417
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,310
please talk about it after the meeting.

418
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,080
Let's talk about

419
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,600
sales of this month.

420
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
All right.

421
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,110
Last night I analyzed

422
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,640
the trend of North China market.

423
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:44,960
I stayed up late

424
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,390
to study it.

425
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,640
A moment please.

426
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's have a look.

427
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,640
Any comments?

428
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,190
Boss!

429
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,110
What's up?

430
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,190
The screen!

431
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,230
Mr. Wen,

432
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,880
you take the wrong file.

433
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,760
This is the right one.

434
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,040
Right.

435
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,760
This is it.

436
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,840
It cost me all the night to

437
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,920
prepare it.

438
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,960
Though it's not my idea,

439
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,080
I've read it.

440
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
Trust me, dad!

441
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,960
No, Chairman Wen. Don't go.

442
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,800
I got you.

443
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,510
This is the workplace.

444
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,150
I work every day,

445
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,430
while beauty is not always here.

446
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,000
By the way, from now on

447
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,800
you're always here.

448
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,390
Nice to meet you.

449
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,000
What are you doing?

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,960
Go on.

451
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,350
What's this?

452
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm afraid my medical records

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,920
are hard to take over.

454
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,310
These kids need special attention.

455
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,960
According to their symptoms and preferences,

456
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,040
I've sorted these out.

457
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,470
So that the doctor who take over my post

458
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,510
will adjust to it easily.

459
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,640
Another good doctor is leaving.

460
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,270
It's spreading the hospital that

461
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,680
you're leaving

462
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
to get married.

463
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,470
But I know

464
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,880
you're for the boy,

465
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,390
who's unwilling to speak.

466
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,960
He's your patient.

467
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,350
Take it easy.

468
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,390
No matter what others say,

469
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,960
I am behind you.

470
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,470
Do you have to leave?

471
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,110
Yes.

472
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,640
I promised He Qiaoyan

473
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,040
to take care of Xiaobao at full time.

474
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,920
I'll be back in a year

475
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,800
and continue my work.

476
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,390
I'll miss you.

477
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
If you're not here,

478
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,550
when being bullied,

479
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,840
who can do me a favour?

480
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,390
Let me see...

481
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,800
If in the future

482
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,150
someone bullies you,

483
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,150
you can say you're Qi Yiyue's friend.

484
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,920
And what will happen?

485
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,760
They will beat you even worse.

486
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,270
Eh?

487
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,190
Yang Ruowei and Qin Yiyue

488
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,110
took a short video at home.

489
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,190
What's wrong?

490
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,150
I'll miss you

491
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,960
and this house.

492
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,720
All right.

493
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,510
Don't blame me for being talkative.

494
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,640
Although you've made a deal,

495
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,350
for your sake,

496
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,800
she's not just saying goodbye to being single,

497
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,110
giving up work,

498
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,840
but moving away from her familiar environment.

499
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,000
For herself,

500
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,040
she has to give up a lot of

501
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,110
her hobbies

502
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,550
to cater to your taste.

503
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,640
I've signed with her

504
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,880
a labor contract,

505
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,920
so she has to provide her time

506
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,350
and expertise.

507
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,270
Okay, you can't get it.

508
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,000
I didn't want to make her unhappy.

509
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,960
This is the first time I've heard that

510
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,430
you think about others' feelings.

511
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,840
I just feel that

512
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,430
if she

513
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,080
work in a negative emotion,

514
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,510
it's bound to affect Xiaobao.

515
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't fool me. She's special for you.

516
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,040
Yiyue,

517
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,840
why is the door open?

518
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,550
So many things stacked here.

519
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,350
What're you doing?

520
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,430
Ning Fang,

521
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,510
do me a favour.

522
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,840
Moving on myself

523
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,350
is too difficult.

524
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,310
Fortunately you're coming.

525
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Are you moving?

526
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
I'm on unpaid leave,

527
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,510
and I'm moving to He Qiaoyan's home.

528
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,270
I signed a one-year contract with him,

529
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,760
promising to

530
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,840
act as his wife

531
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,110
and take care of Xiaobao.

532
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,640
Are you serious?

533
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,190
Absolutely.

534
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,390
Just for the three million yuan worth of ring,

535
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,800
you sacrificed a lot.

536
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,310
Just three million yuan?

537
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,310
It's beyond my means.

538
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,430
What a big decision!

539
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,040
Why don't you tell me?

540
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,640
I...

541
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
Money or contract,

542
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,470
I have many methods

543
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,430
to help you.

544
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,880
It's no use.

545
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,110
How can you help me with so much money?

546
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,310
Let a dog bite him?

547
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,550
Or ask a cat to scratch him?

548
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,880
Three million is just a number.

549
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,390
We went to college together.

550
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,510
I know it's hard to major in medicine.

551
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,390
I don't want you,

552
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,840
for the sake of others,

553
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,640
to give up your dream.

554
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,600
For me, Xiaobao

555
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,270
is just the same as

556
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,840
every patient of mine.

557
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,350
If one year

558
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,680
can cure him,

559
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,430
he'll have

560
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,840
a different life.

561
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,310
It's worthy,

562
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,470
isn't?

563
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,310
So what do you think of He Qiaoyan?

564
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,840
It's just a deal.

565
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,390
Nothing else.

566
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,430
All right, protect yourself.

567
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,470
Let me know if you have any trouble.

568
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,550
Am I late again?

569
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,000
That night...

570
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,080
The room rate

571
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,640
is 1288 yuan.

572
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
Wanna split it?

573
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,550
Please send it to my bank account.

574
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,390
What do you think of me?

575
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,840
If you want me

576
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,270
to keep the secret,

577
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,040
please show your sincerity.

578
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,550
What would you do?

579
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,960
First unbutton my shirt,

580
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,840
then I'll tell you the next step.

581
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,960
You wanna undress...

582
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,470
Oops! You're on purpose!

583
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,510
Have them washed.

584
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,190
And you pay for the dry-cleaning.

585
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,430
Don't direct me.

586
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,760
It's your assistant's work.

587
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,040
You have several

588
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,960
beautiful assistants, don't you?

589
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,190
They were all fired by my dad.

590
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,190
Sorry,

591
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,040
I was being frivolous.

592
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,000
I seldom saw a beauty like you.

593
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,350
I can't help...

594
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,150
If you can make my dad

595
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,600
no longer limit me,

596
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,680
I promise

597
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
that wonderful night

598
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:54,310
will be a secret.

599
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,080
Agree or not?

600
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,680
It's none of my business.

601
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,000
By the way,

602
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,840
split the bill.

603
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,190
I can afford the larger share.

604
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,800
Don't thank me.

605
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,150
Hello, this is Yueyue's vlog.

606
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,350
Today is our

607
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,310
last day living in this house.

608
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,680
We good friends

609
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,550
are ready to apply facial masks together.

610
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,470
You know my skin is sensitive.

611
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,640
I didn't dare to use

612
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
whitening mask before.

613
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,680
But this mask of UNIFON

614
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,150
is great.

615
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,190
Look at the ingredients.

616
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,470
Glycyrrhiza glabra L.

617
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,640
All of these are plants.

618
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,760
Compared with other facial masks,

619
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,080
it's more moderate and tolerable.

620
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,800
Girls,

621
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,270
today is the last day

622
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,880
we live here. Cheers.

623
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,430
Yiyue,

624
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,040
thank Mr. He for me.

625
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,510
My new job is terrific.

626
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:42,080
To your new job,

627
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,600
cheers!

628
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,680
I ordered takeouts.

629
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,960
Hello.

630
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,150
Is Dr. Qin in, please?

631
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,510
Eat this. Yummy.

632
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,190
Hello, Dr. Qin.

633
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,470
Mr. He knows

634
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,760
you're moving tomorrow.

635
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,270
So he asked me to

636
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,310
send you this gift today.

637
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,110
This is the contract

638
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,880
of this house.

639
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,270
Several places

640
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,270
require your signature and seal.

641
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
The contract of this house?

642
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,550
Yes.

643
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,880
You mean

644
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,920
He Qiaoyan

645
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,840
bought it?

646
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,640
Right.

647
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:30,960
I Swear

648
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,430
I didn't

649
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,230
ask him to buy it.

650
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,640
This house...

651
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,270
The landlord

652
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,600
rented it out, did he?

653
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,600
This matter

654
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,390
is solved by Mr. He.

655
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,430
Dr. Qin is going to live in Mr. He's house,

656
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,110
and this one can be used by Miss Yang,

657
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,510
as her staff quarters.

658
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,430
By the way, Dr. Qin,

659
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,550
you can come back

660
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,350
at will.

661
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,720
What are you doing? Just sign it.

662
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,150
Are you kidding?

663
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,080
This guy is a crook.

664
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,390
It may be a trap.

665
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,640
I won't sign it.

666
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,600
Hello?

667
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I'll wait for you downstairs.

668
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,680
If you want to thank me,

669
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,230
you can come downstairs in two minutes.

670
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,720
Why should I obey your order?

671
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,350
It's up to me.

672
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
Well...

673
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,310
Looking I'm enclosing the contract,

674
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
you thought I am going down now,

675
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
right?

676
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,270
No way!

677
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,510
Unpunctual and inefficient...

678
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,190
This is delicious.

679
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,600
Five...

680
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,640
Dr. Qin,

681
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,680
it's been four minutes.

682
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,880
Take it easy.

683
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,470
I'm teaching him to be patient.

684
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,680
Five, four, three, two, one.

685
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,110
You wait for me here.

686
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,880
Okay.

687
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,310
I'll give you the last chance.

688
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
Are you serious?

689
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
You dodged me!

690
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:21,880
Do you know

691
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,000
how dangerous was that?

692
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,510
Your two-minute time limit

693
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,800
is to be blamed.

694
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,389
Why did you buy me the house?

695
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,600
According to my analysis,

696
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,000
you are absent-minded.

697
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
There's a 75 percent chance that

698
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,600
you'll drop

699
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,310
the ring

700
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,040
somewhere

701
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,550
in the house.

702
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,350
Thus I bought the house

703
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,150
in case of that someone else get the ring.

704
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,230
My family is big,

705
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,840
but I could never imagine that

706
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,190
all your messy luggage

707
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,920
will be piled up here.

708
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
And your bedroom

709
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,230
looks like a recycling station...

710
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,350
Oh, no.

711
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:00,880
I...

712
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,960
You're forbidden to occupy

713
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,390
too much my private space.

714
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,350
So I decided to

715
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,230
buy you this house.

716
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,230
You can regard it as

717
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,390
a warehouse.

718
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,470
As for your moving,

719
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,270
just bring some

720
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,550
necessities.

721
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,960
This big house

722
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,680
is too expensive.

723
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,760
I can't accept it.

724
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,040
No refusal.

725
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,150
It's my order.

726
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,680
I'm just your employee.

727
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,390
I don't need

728
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,680
such things,

729
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,960
a house, or any other dowry.

730
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,800
Nothing required.

731
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,080
Our deal

732
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,840
is clear in the contract.

733
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,720
Oh well,

734
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,880
your generosity

735
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,680
makes me burdened.

736
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,720
Qin Yiyue,

737
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,510
to do business with you

738
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,680
is so hard.

739
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,880
You don't need to buy me the house.

740
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,470
You're the owner.

741
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,110
Ruowei and I

742
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,880
are your tenants.

743
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,800
As you've mentioned,

744
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,680
employee's benefits.

745
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,190
You can rent it to us

746
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,110
at half-price.

747
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,600
Deal?

748
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,310
Nope.

749
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,640
I wanna profits, too.

750
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,310
Got it?

751
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,800
How much should I pay?

752
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
A 80% discount.

753
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,350
Serious?

754
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,720
You call it profits?

755
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,680
I haven't finished my words.

756
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,550
The remaining 20%

757
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,310
is not paid in crash.

758
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,680
The contract period

759
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
will be prolonged by 20%.

760
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,310
In other words, you should work for me

761
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
for two more months.

762
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,230
One year and two months.

763
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,040
Is this his house?

764
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,150
Qin Yiyue,

765
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,800
calm down.

766
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:38,040
Ummm...

767
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,390
Just take it as

768
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,920
an door-to-door psychotherapy.

769
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,680
Okay?

770
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,430
Nothing special.

771
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,960
Come on.

772
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,350
Tree drivers, five housekeepers,

773
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,880
seven cooks and ten maids,

774
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,840
it's time to receive

775
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,270
Your Lady.

776
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,550
Foolish.

777
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,190
There are not so many people

778
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,680
to receive you.

779
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,680
Welcome, Dr. Qin.

780
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,800
I thought

781
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,430
you're here to help me with my luggage.

782
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,040
Why should I help you with your luggage?

783
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,800
Have you ever seen a new employee

784
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,510
asking her boss to move a computer?

785
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,110
For your brute force,

786
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,600
these two small boxes

787
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,920
are a piece of cake.

788
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,430
Come in.

789
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,680
You really know me.

790
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,470
There are clear provisions in the employment notice that

791
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,430
you should have arrived before 9:00 am.

792
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,390
It's 9:06 am.

793
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,680
So I had to put off

794
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,350
the regular meeting of our company to wait for you.

795
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,600
Do not let it happen again.

796
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,470
A brief introduction.

797
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,350
That's the dining room. That's the study.

798
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,600
This is the living room.

799
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,720
These are public areas

800
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,840
are open to you.

801
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,510
Are you living here?

802
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,840
So tidy.

803
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,190
What do you think should be here?

804
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,960
In ordinary families,

805
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,510
the tea table in the living room

806
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,350
will be full of snacks and fruits.

807
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,510
And the sofa

808
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,430
will be piled up with hairy

809
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,960
blankets and pillows.

810
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,550
Your house is so big and desolate.

811
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,960
It doesn't look like an ordinary family.

812
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,640
That TV is large.

813
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,110
Do you have video games?

814
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,470
I never play games.

815
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,680
That's a waste of time.

816
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,270
In addition,

817
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,190
you should eat in the dining room.

818
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,270
I've never eaten

819
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,080
on the sofa.

820
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,310
And in my private space,

821
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,150
everything

822
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,040
should have a clear

823
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,960
use value.

824
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,350
Those what you said

825
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,920
are no use for me.

826
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:50,760
Let's go.

827
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,390
Let me show you

828
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,310
Xiaobao's room.

829
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,510
This is Xiaobao's room.

830
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,880
Are those his books?

831
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,000
How smart he is!

832
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,230
I'll teach you to

833
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,040
embrace the world.

834
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,840
Your room is upstairs.

835
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,720
Excuse me,

836
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,680
we live in the same room?

837
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,040
Come with me.

838
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,270
We must keep it secret that

839
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,640
we are not a couple.

840
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,080
So you can't live in the guest room.

841
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,430
It's easy to catch other's attention.

842
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,310
I've prepared another bed.

843
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,000
Roommates live on different beds.

844
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,880
Accept it?

845
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,720
Behind the closed door,

846
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,230
who knows whether I'm in the master bedroom

847
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,430
or the guest bedroom?

848
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,430
Don't underestimate Xiaobao.

849
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,000
Please.

850
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,110
His room is so big.

851
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,270
My room is so small.

852
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,510
So does my wardrobe.

853
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,960
These things

854
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,040
can't be piled up on my bed...

855
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,920
It's my stand-in?

856
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,510
He's not a pervert, is he?

857
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,720
This little guy

858
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,080
is still suspicious.

859
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,390
I have to do something.

860
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,150
My dear,

861
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,390
can you help me?

862
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,040
Xiaobao, mommy is calling you.

863
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,390
I'm calling you.

864
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,230
Mrs. Liu,

865
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,150
Come and help her.

866
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,600
You come here.

867
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,760
What's up?

868
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:46,470
Help me

869
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,640
move this over there.

870
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:48,920
These things

871
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,310
are usually done by Mrs. Liu.

872
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:51,080
Hurry up.

873
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,720
Is this necessary?

874
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,550
Keep still.

875
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,470
Xiaobao saw me in another room.

876
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,390
I'm suspected.

877
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:18,470
Is that necessary?

878
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,960
Of course.

879
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,550
Conjugal love

880
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,680
is the cornerstone of a child's sense of security.

881
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,880
This is a classic gesture to show love.

882
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,350
Hug in when cooking.

883
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,640
It's not hugging.

884
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,150
but kidnapping.

885
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,310
How could I cook?

886
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,920
Sorry,

887
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,190
I need more practices.

888
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Move to the left.

889
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,080
Xiaobao,

890
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,390
help yourself.

891
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,800
I've told you that

892
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,350
Xiaobao is very slow to get up

893
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,110
Hurry up.

894
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,110
Touch my hair.

895
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:17,960
It's too greasy.

896
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,760
I haven't washed it for days.

897
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
Put your hands here.

898
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,550
Xiaobao.

899
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,760
Good morning, my boy.

900
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,430
It's not like that.

901
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,190
It's like this.

902
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,270
Got it?

903
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,430
Remember to wash it.

904
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,430
Step on me...

905
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,000
What?

906
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,600
We should be face to face.

907
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:08,960
Xiaobao,

908
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,720
mom and dad

909
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,470
are kissing, hugging and raising up.

910
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,110
It's ok to kiss and hug,

911
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,390
but raise you up...

912
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,550
It's a triathlon.

913
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,190
Watch TV.

914
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,150
Put me down.

915
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,960
You pinched me in the ribs.

916
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
It's time for you to lose weight.

917
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,920
It's not like that.

918
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,720
It's like this.
