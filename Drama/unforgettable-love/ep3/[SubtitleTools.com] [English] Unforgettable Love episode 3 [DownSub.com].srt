Unforgettable Love
EP03

2
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,670
Password lock.

3
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,880
Verification failed.

4
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,039
Verification failed.

5
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,000
What's the correct password?

6
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:27,360
Fingerprints are

7
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,670
concentrated on three number keys.

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,360
Six, seven, zero.

9
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
Verification failed.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,230
Six, seven.

11
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,360
No.

12
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,789
Dr. Qin

13
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,400
likes birthday best.

14
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,150
But my birthday is in June.

15
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:45,479
Either for the final exam

16
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,880
or the parents' meeting.

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,310
The worst is that

18
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,960
math is a part of college entrance examination.

19
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,190
Qin Yiyue.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Qin Yiyue.

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,880
So you are fine.

22
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,000
I see.

23
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,750
The temperature in the bathroom is too high.

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,310
So there is something wrong

25
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,590
with the band.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,919
I will feedback it

27
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,190
to the technical department.

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,480
Mr. He, could you please ...

29
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,630
Video as proof

30
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,040
I didn't do anything.

31
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,880
It happened for a reason that

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,230
I broke into Ms. Qin Yiyue's apartment.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
I didn't have designs on her.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm leaving now.

35
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,150
Well

36
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,040
Keep your distance, Ms. Qin.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,790
Otherwise

38
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,880
it's even harder to explain.

39
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,480
That door

40
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,079
Never mind the outer door.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,150
I'll help you close the bathroom door first.

42
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,000
No.

43
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,190
That door is broken.

44
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,079
Enjoy your bath.

45
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,310
I'll wait for you outside.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,190
Take it easy.

47
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,040
Open the door.

48
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,480
Are you stupid?

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,840
If you don't open the door

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,230
I'm suing you for trespassing.

51
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,630
and imprisoning a pretty girl.

52
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,520
You devil.

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,590
Inform the technical department,

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,920
it needs more tests

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,590
to strengthen the water resistance

56
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,630
and high temperature resistance

57
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,440
of the band.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
Give me the latest experimental parameter report

59
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
next Monday.

60
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,440
Also

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,520
we must think about

62
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,440
the adaptability of the band

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
in various harsh environment.

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,590
And

65
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,000
I

66
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,150
will never give up.

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,079
Well

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
He Qiaoyan.

69
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,270
You just wait and see.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,400
He Qiaoyan

71
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll fight it out with you.

72
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,880
Fortunately, she doesn't have a high fever.

73
00:04:28,589 --> 00:04:30,480
How can this room be so messy?

74
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
How can she live here?

75
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,400
No wonder you are sick.

76
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,110
It's just like

77
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,590
a big bacteriological petri dish.

78
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,630
She is even a doctor.

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,560
The silly must not know how to take the medicine.

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,840
Even Xiaobao is better than her.

81
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,520
How can she become

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
my qualified family doctor later?

83
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,590
Snacks are on the bed.

84
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,110
Delicious pig's feet.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,400
Taste good.

86
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,080
Both this place and this girl

87
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,400
are not normal.

88
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,040
According to what happened in the novel

89
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,750
am I reborn?

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm reborn

91
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,150
and I also have a husband.

92
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,630
Why is the head so small?

93
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,840
You awake

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,630
Why are you here?

95
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,520
Xiaobao and I

96
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,790
have taken care of you all night.

97
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,310
Let him sleep a little longer.

98
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
You get up first.

99
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,230
My god!

100
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,790
Is this my home?

101
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,080
Have a sit.

102
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,190
No

103
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,080
No

104
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,520
What exactly did you do

105
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,670
to my home?

106
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,670
Have some porridge first

107
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,710
and then take the medicine.

108
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,230
What happened

109
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,440
last night?

110
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,040
And

111
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,000
why are you at my apartment?

112
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,150
Nothing happened

113
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:50,190
last night.

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,310
Have breakfast.

115
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
I remember now.

116
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,760
Last night

117
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,230
I took a bath in the bathroom.

118
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,470
I took a bath.

119
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,760
And then I

120
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,550
Qin Yiyue

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,720
Control yourself.

122
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,150
Control what?

123
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,040
Appetite.

124
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,000
By the way

125
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,110
why did you come to my apartment?

126
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,390
I opened the door for you?

127
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,550
I opened it myself.

128
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,640
0607, your birthday.

129
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,270
How could you know that?

130
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,720
You have told Xiaobao that

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,110
your birthday is in June.

132
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,760
either for the parents' meeting

133
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,110
or the final exam.

134
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,390
The most nervous time

135
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,150
is the day of math college entrance examination.

136
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,000
National college entrance examination

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,430
is on June 7th and 8th.

138
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,510
Math examination is on the first day.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
You even remember this.

140
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,720
I remember

141
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,470
every word you have said.

142
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,350
You are my target partner

143
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
So I'll check

144
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,840
what you say and do.

145
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,270
By the way

146
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
then you helped me get dressed?

147
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,880
Did you see anything

148
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
you shouldn't have seen?

149
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,390
What do you think?

150
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,190
You mean

151
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,840
You have seen everything, haven't you?

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000
You mean

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
you want me to think back.

154
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,110
Tell me the truth.

155
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,270
Visual measurement of height

156
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,430
162 to 164 cm.

157
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,920
The upper body is as long as legs.

158
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,680
Fat is concentrated in the abdomen

159
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,550
hip and legs.

160
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,230
According to my calculation

161
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,000
your actual weight

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,110
should be 3.5 kg more

163
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,510
than that in your resume.

164
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,550
Pardon?

165
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,600
3.5 kg.

166
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
We are not talking about that.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,350
What do you want me to say?

168
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,040
Am I pretty?

169
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,470
Sexy.

170
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Xiaobao

171
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,350
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
I didn't celebrate your birthday.

173
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,760
How about this?

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,760
I

175
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
promise you a birthday wish

176
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,430
as compensation.

177
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
What do you want?

178
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,000
You can tell me

179
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,760
I will get what you want, OK?

180
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,390
What gift do you want?

181
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
Everything.

182
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,470
OK, I will give you what you want.

183
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,920
Mom

184
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
I'm good at English

185
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,840
Mom

186
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,230
Follow me, Mom

187
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,310
Don't you want me to

188
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,430
teach you English?

189
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,350
No

190
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,110
I want you

191
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,390
to be

192
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,680
You want me to be your Mom.

193
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,640
I, I

194
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,110
No

195
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,640
Xiaobao

196
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,430
This is not a matter

197
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,390
to joke about.

198
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,230
No problem.

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,080
I promise you.

200
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,110
Are you sure it's ok?

201
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,510
I'm sure.

202
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,390
I said it.

203
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,760
As long as you ask for

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,550
I'll give you everything you want.

205
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
So

206
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,680
sonny.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,840
You have to call me Mom.

208
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,110
Xiaobao, open your mouth.

209
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Open

210
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,760
Open

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,510
Forget it.

212
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,550
I put the medicine in the cabinet.

213
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,080
Eat breakfast soon.

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
I'll take Xiaobao back.

215
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,310
Wait a minute.

216
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,150
Wait for me for ten minutes.

217
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,150
You drive me to work.

218
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,510
You're sick.

219
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,470
Take a day off.

220
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,880
No

221
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,640
How can I get a day off.

222
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Many little patients

223
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,110
will come to me.

224
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,190
Their parents

225
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,230
ask for a day off from the company

226
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,230
and take their children

227
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,640
to come to me.

228
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,190
It's my duty.

229
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,470
Wait for me.

230
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,390
Get ready for sleep.

231
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,270
Xiaobao

232
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,680
Are you going to sleep like this?

233
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,960
I want my Mom.

234
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,270
Then you have to tell her yourself.

235
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,880
Besides

236
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,550
you have mouth

237
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,040
You told her.

238
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,550
He Weifei

239
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,080
That hard disk

240
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,840
saves data of all my experiments

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,150
from high school to college.

242
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,390
Be good

243
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,600
and put it down slowly.

244
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,680
Be good

245
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:40,760
Be

246
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,880
All right, you little boy.

247
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,510
What do you want to do with my computer?

248
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,270
Fortunately

249
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,680
I learned from the past.

250
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,470
The password is changed this time.

251
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,680
And I'm sure

252
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,510
you'll never guess.

253
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,150
I can't believe you cracked it.

254
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,080
No wonder you spent the whole day

255
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
in my study.

256
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,800
I shouldn't have let you

257
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
play with the computer too early.

258
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,960
Dragon born dragon, chicken born chicken.

259
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,680
My son was born with the talent of coding.

260
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,600
Xiaobao

261
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,640
give this to Dad.

262
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,430
What can I say to you?

263
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,840
Good morning, Dr. Qin.

264
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,230
Boy band today.

265
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,190
My style is changeable

266
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,510
but you don't know that.

267
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,800
Xiaobao is handsome.

268
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
You're right.

269
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,550
Come on.

270
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,510
Come on, Dr. Qin.

271
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,640
Take you to work.

272
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,470
I heard

273
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,760
you have only one patient today.

274
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,960
Xiaobao.

275
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,230
What about other patients?

276
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,350
Dr. Huang

277
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,390
will be in charge of your patients.

278
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,550
And

279
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
give you a hint.

280
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,230
You still owe Xiaobao a meal.

281
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,920
No

282
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,960
Xiaobao said

283
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,390
he had made all the arrangements.

284
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,150
Even I don't know it.

285
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,880
Xiaobao, it is so mysterious.

286
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,080
Then I'll expect it.

287
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,230
Do you want Dr. Qin

288
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,600
to be your Mom?

289
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,080
We are of one mind.

290
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,680
I never believe you can take a horse to the water

291
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,960
but you cannot make him drink.

292
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,680
Drink or not

293
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,000
we all have to try.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,840
Right?

295
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,550
Dr. Qin and your Dad still need something

296
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,760
to develop feelings.

297
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,270
First

298
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,720
create an environment

299
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,839
just for them two.

300
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,640
We're going to have a meal, aren't we?

301
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,109
What is this?

302
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,760
Room Escape

303
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,839
Second

304
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,270
create all kinds of crises

305
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,000
for them.

306
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,920
Let them fight side by side

307
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,390
and overcome difficulties together.

308
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,190
Only the environment for them two and crises

309
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,510
can get them closer.

310
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,510
So as to

311
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,599
create the sparks of love.

312
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm so stupid.

313
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,150
I can do nothing.

314
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,680
All right, I'll do it.

315
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,270
Look

316
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,150
Think about it

317
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,000
In the Room

318
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,880
your Dad and Dr. Qin

319
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,270
can only rely on each other.

320
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,080
In the dark

321
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,230
they can only hear

322
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,880
the heartbeat of each other.

323
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,840
Trust and rely on each other.

324
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,190
At that moment, Dr. Qin would say

325
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,800
you are awesome

326
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,270
and I adore you so much.

327
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,000
Suddenly

328
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,040
The door is closed.

329
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
They get closer.

330
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,550
In the last minute

331
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,840
Dr. Qin would say

332
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,390
I'll take this.

333
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,230
Go ahead, I'm right behind you.

334
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,800
I can't.

335
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,270
I'll do it.

336
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,390
OK

337
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,310
Random permutation

338
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
Why are you so stupid?

339
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,550
Try it.

340
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,960
I don't know how you graduated.

341
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,310
Boy

342
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,550
How about watching some cartoons?

343
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,920
It may take two hours

344
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,040
for your parents to finish.

345
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,350
It won't take two hours.

346
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,390
Ten minutes is enough.

347
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,600
Line up for half an hour.

348
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,920
Ten minutes for the game.

349
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,110
You've ruined

350
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,350
my game.

351
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,920
With your IQ

352
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,550
You can't get out until night, can you?

353
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:46,960
I

354
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,150
Xiaobao, anything else?

355
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,470
Are you scared?

356
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,390
If you're scared

357
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,470
let's hurry back.

358
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,390
Don't waste time.

359
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,310
What am I scared of?

360
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,230
I'm scared of nothing.

361
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,150
It's just rubber all over the floor.

362
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
There is nothing to be scared of.

363
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,230
I'll kill you.

364
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,600
You frighten me.

365
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,270
Boss

366
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,800
I can't do this job.

367
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,350
The two in the Thriller Room

368
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,840
especially the girl

369
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,760
chase and hit me.

370
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,040
They hit me on the head.

371
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,510
I quit.

372
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
Stop.

373
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,920
Come on.

374
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,150
You think I am afraid of you?

375
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,680
If the wind is too strong

376
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,760
remember to close the window.

377
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,760
No, it's fine.

378
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,680
What's wrong, Xiaobao?

379
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,920
Come on, Xiaobao.

380
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
Put your hat in order.

381
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,600
Take your things with you.

382
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,270
Xiaobao, do you know what it is?

383
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,110
It's elm.

384
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,760
This is Photinia.

385
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,840
I show you

386
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,150
something interesting.

387
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,600
This is called Acer Palmatum.

388
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,510
It likes sunshine.

389
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,040
Go.

390
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,150
Acer Palmatum

391
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,150
How can you even know that?

392
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,190
If this problem

393
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,230
still can't be solved

394
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,310
don't contact me next time.

395
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,760
It's Parent-Child time.

396
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,840
No work

397
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,640
Confiscate

398
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,510
Xiaobao

399
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,350
don't worry.

400
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,550
You take it and I'll pick that up.

401
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,680
Be careful.

402
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:19,880
What's wrong?

403
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,110
What's the matter? Cold?

404
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,230
Dad will get your coat in the car.

405
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,920
Wait for Mom here.

406
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,720
Don't run around.

407
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,640
Where is Xiaobao?

408
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,110
He Qiaoyan

409
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,470
Xiaobao

410
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,470
Where is Xiaobao?

411
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,110
Didn't I bringing him to you?

412
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,470
I went back to get his coat in the car.

413
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,190
Hurry to find him.

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,760
Xiaobao

415
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,350
Xiaobao

416
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,760
Xiaobao, hurry up.

417
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,600
Xiaobao

418
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,230
What's wrong?

419
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,840
Lost your hat?

420
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,720
Don't worry.

421
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,510
I will buy you a new one.

422
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
Key

423
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,640
But

424
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,600
to reassure them

425
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,640
let's take a picture together

426
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
and report to them.

427
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,110
Come on

428
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Xiaobao

429
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,880
Xiaobao

430
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
Xiaobao

431
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,150
Hey

432
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:01,880
Xiaobao

433
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,600
Dr. Qin

434
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,470
Xiaobao

435
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,680
Xiaobao

436
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,310
Dr. Qin, Dr. Qin

437
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,510
Leave me alone and save Xiaobao.

438
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,880
Hurry up

439
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,230
Xiaobao has been found.

440
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,350
Everything is fine with Xiaobao.

441
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,840
That hat

442
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,760
That's not Xiaobao.

443
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,150
Xiaobao has been found.

444
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,190
He's safe.

445
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,840
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

446
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,510
You always do things so rashly.

447
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,150
Come on, come on.

448
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,000
Be careful

449
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,430
Come on, come on

450
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,000
If I remember correctly, it should be here.

451
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,720
Where is the car?

452
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,080
Don't think about it.

453
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,510
It must be

454
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,230
Wen Gu.

455
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,600
I really didn't expect that

456
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,150
Xiaobao

457
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,920
has stolen

458
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,800
my spare key.

459
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,350
My phone lets in water.

460
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,470
What about yours?

461
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,430
My phone's out of power.

462
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,110
Maybe we

463
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,310
are going to spend a night here.

464
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,430
Spend a night here?

465
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,600
Come on, put your hands on it

466
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,640
to warm yourself.

467
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,150
That's ridiculous.

468
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,550
Try it

469
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,230
It's really warm.

470
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,430
You already have a cold.

471
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,640
Go into the tent and change clothes.

472
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,800
The trousers get wet today.

473
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,430
What if the cold get worse?

474
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,310
What are you doing?

475
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,080
Then don't peek.

476
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,920
You think too much.

477
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,080
Don't peek.

478
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,640
Got it.

479
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,230
Five seconds left.

480
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,430
You have to be so fussy

481
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,880
about making instant noodles.

482
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,920
Just ten seconds.

483
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
Ten, nine, eight, seven

484
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,470
It's time.

485
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,470
Eat it

486
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,390
Don't you eat it?

487
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,470
Fried noodles

488
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,640
and too much artificial seasoning.

489
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,080
I don't need that.

490
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
It's delicious.

491
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,550
Would you like to have a bite?

492
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,150
No

493
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,110
Do you smell it?

494
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,110
Smell delicious?

495
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,350
You're really not gonna eat?

496
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,800
No

497
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,760
Then I'll eat it.

498
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,190
Is it really that delicious?

499
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,150
I'll taste it myself.

500
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,760
Is it delicious?

501
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,230
A little.

502
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:45,310
Can you stop leaving noodles you've not finished?

503
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,430
You are such a fool.

504
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,270
In the afternoon

505
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
you just jumped into the lake

506
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,840
without knowing

507
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,920
how deep it is.

508
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,510
I saw Xiaobao's hat

509
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,840
was floating on the lake.

510
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,080
I didn't think about anything

511
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:08,310
but save him.

512
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,600
If I didn't stop you

513
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,270
you were going to swim into the lake, right?

514
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm a pediatrician.

515
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,960
I am responsible for children.

516
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,150
And

517
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,390
Xiaobao, he trusts me so much

518
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,880
but I lost him.

519
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,310
I feel guilty.

520
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,270
You know what?

521
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,310
In fact, what children say

522
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,350
is the most sincere.

523
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,350
He hopes

524
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,760
call me Mom so much.

525
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,800
Even if he didn't say it

526
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,270
I can't

527
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,550
let him down.

528
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,270
Actually

529
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,880
our routine work

530
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,310
is very hard.

531
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,190
Many people think that

532
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,680
we don't perform an operation

533
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,390
or take care of patients in ICU.

534
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,430
They think we just

535
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,800
chat and play games with children

536
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,960
every day.

537
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,190
They have no idea

538
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,270
how much pressure

539
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,800
we need to bear.

540
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,960
You know what?

541
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,310
Whenever I feel hard

542
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,510
and tired

543
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,840
the children will come to me

544
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,080
take my hand

545
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,600
smile at me

546
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,110
and call me sister.

547
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,110
All my grievances and difficulties

548
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,550
will disappear.

549
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,350
And

550
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,270
Xiaobao almost accepted me

551
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,470
in the first place.

552
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,760
My pleasure.

553
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
In that case

554
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,000
do you want to

555
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,390
be Xiaobao's Mom?

556
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,080
It's just his joke.

557
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,190
And Xiaobao

558
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,720
has his real Mom.

559
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,880
You're tired after one day.

560
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,880
Sleep early.

561
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,040
I'm back

562
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,920
Why are you back so late?

563
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,600
You also turned off your phone.

564
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,880
The thing is

565
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:06,760
I

566
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,000
took Xiaobao to the forest park.

567
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,040
It's too late

568
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,270
so we didn't come back.

569
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,270
We spent the night outside.

570
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,350
But

571
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,270
my neck hurts.

572
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,040
It's just that the cell phone is out of power.

573
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,760
Why are you so nervous?

574
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,880
Be honest.

575
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,190
Is there something

576
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,510
you and Mr. He?

577
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,000
Hate from previous existence.

578
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm not kidding.

579
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,840
I didn't ask you yet

580
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,960
Qin Yiyue.

581
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,040
Yes.

582
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,680
The night before yesterday when I was away on business

583
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,230
I heard that

584
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,000
Mr. He came from our apartment

585
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,510
in the morning.

586
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,840
You don't even know

587
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:50,720
how is the gossip spread

588
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,080
in the hospital.

589
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,470
The thing is

590
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,680
I

591
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,960
often have affairs.

592
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,230
First, top trending searches

593
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,550
After that, gossip

594
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,680
I'm really famous.

595
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,470
Got it.

596
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,680
On the night of the scandal video leaked of

597
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,470
Mr. He and a mysterious woman

598
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,190
you were in the hotel, right?

599
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,110
Did you

600
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,080
tell Mr. He something?

601
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,110
So Zhou Ziyang didn't win the prize.

602
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,080
Zhou Ziyang didn't win the prize?

603
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,639
Don't you know?

604
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
What do you do on your phone every day?

605
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,639
I told you

606
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,350
now the whole hospital

607
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:33,840
is talking about it.

608
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,080
When Mr. He presented the award

609
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,040
he directly withdraw Zhou Ziyang's award

610
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,190
on the spot.

611
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,550
I remember

612
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,429
every word you have said.

613
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,600
So he remembered

614
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,550
every word I have said.

615
00:34:58,719 --> 00:34:59,550
I'm sorry

616
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,389
Sorry

617
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,639
Sorry

618
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,429
Yue

619
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,430
Yue

620
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Are you OK?

621
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,110
We didn't have time

622
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,310
to talk with each other recently.

623
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,760
For me

624
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,800
it doesn't make any difference

625
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,800
between an Ex and a stranger.

626
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,470
I have nothing to say to a stranger.

627
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,510
I'm sorry

628
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,510
If you

629
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,550
feel sorry

630
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,760
please ask your girlfriend

631
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,470
not to threaten me

632
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,310
to leave

633
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,230
in the name of position and work.

634
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,600
Also

635
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,270
by the way, let me remind you.

636
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,390
Emotion and work

637
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,470
should be separated.

638
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,110
Dr. Zhou

639
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,270
Qing

640
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,390
Dr. Qin

641
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,680
Tonight, there will be a party

642
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,880
to celebrate the completion of the building.

643
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,150
Join us.

644
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,840
Give you some good news quietly.

645
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,720
My Dad will announce

646
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,640
that Ziyang will be promoted to

647
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,470
the chief physician at that time.

648
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,720
Congratulations.

649
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,110
I will be there.

650
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,920
It's unworthy

651
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,230
to buy a new dress

652
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,430
for the promotion

653
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,470
of the Ex.

654
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,550
It's a waste of money.

655
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,800
You're wrong.

656
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,760
It's wrong not to buy the dress.

657
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,430
Just to let him know he's blind.

658
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,390
Let him know

659
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,800
you are doing well.

660
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,080
After leaving him

661
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,270
you are a survivor of a disaster.

662
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,270
I think

663
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,680
you're right.

664
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,470
Just thinking about Zhou Ziyang

665
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll get angry.

666
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,960
If you had not been in love

667
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,080
and gave

668
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,230
him the place to study abroad

669
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,550
how could he be where he is today?

670
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,080
Look

671
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,270
Why did you pretend to be strong?

672
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,350
Went to the scene of the car accident to save people.

673
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,880
You hurt your hand

674
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,840
and you can't

675
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
be a surgeon anymore.

676
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
It's good for me to be a psychologist.

677
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,510
I can help so many children.

678
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,040
I have a great sense of accomplishment.

679
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,000
And I'm happy.

680
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,720
You saved a child at that time.

681
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,430
The next two days

682
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,110
you became a child psychologist.

683
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,960
If you saved

684
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,230
a cat or a dog

685
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,550
you would be a veterinarian?

686
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,230
Why are you so funny?

687
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,230
I feel like being a veterinarian

688
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,270
is also good.

689
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,150
For me

690
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,190
as long as I can cure the disease

691
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,600
any kind of doctor is fine.

692
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,510
All right, stop it.

693
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,760
Go and buy some clothes.

694
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,190
This store looks not bad.

695
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,960
Welcome.

696
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,640
How about this one?

697
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,430
My long white legs

698
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,000
you can see them

699
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but you can't touch them.

700
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,350
This one.

701
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,000
It feels like others can see

702
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,760
but never get you.

703
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,110
This one's too see-through.

704
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,230
Try it, Try it.

705
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,350
Go, go.

706
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,040
I see

707
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,880
I see.

708
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,040
Take it.

709
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,720
Unifon masks.

710
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,640
Tomorrow is very important.

711
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,880
Remember to use it tonight.

712
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
Tomorrow

713
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,080
you'll be the little fairy to shine.

714
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,430
Unifon masks.

715
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,800
You spoil me so much.

716
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,150
I am the one who support you the most.

717
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,720
How about this dress?

718
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,430
Change it.

719
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,760
Take it off.

720
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,550
Then I'll choose another one.

721
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,510
Thank you

722
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,470
Thank you.

723
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,230
Ann

724
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,550
Congratulations.

725
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,040
Thank you

726
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,000
I am really jealous of Dr. Zhou

727
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,760
to marry the daughter of the director of the hospital.

728
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,510
Thank you

729
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,270
Is that Dr. Qin?

730
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,350
I didn't even see it

731
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,510
that Dr. Qin is in such a good shape.

732
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,550
Yiyue

733
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,600
You are here.

734
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,270
You look beautiful today.

735
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,800
Thank you

736
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,040
If I were Dr. Qin

737
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,310
I wouldn't be here.

738
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,840
You are so beautiful today.

739
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,080
This dress looks good.

740
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,880
Drink a glass of wine.

741
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,390
I'm not wearing a dress

742
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,920
but the uniform ready to fight.

743
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,230
You are so careless.

744
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,230
The tag

745
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,190
is still on the dress.

746
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,390
It can't be the luxury just bought in the morning

747
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,430
for the event tonight

748
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:39,430
and you have no time to remove the tag.

749
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,230
Or

750
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,110
it's rare for you to

751
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,430
buy such an expensive dress

752
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,510
then you can't bear to pick it.

753
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,190
Or I'll help you.

754
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,720
OK.

755
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,510
Throw it for me.

756
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,470
You like garbage recycling

757
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,800
don't you?

758
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,350
Cheers!

759
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,190
Hey

760
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,510
Qin Yiyue is really high-profile

761
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,230
and afraid that others won't know about her.

762
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:06,510
What?

763
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
Don't you know?

764
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,040
It's all over the Internet

765
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,190
Pictures of her and He Qiaoyan

766
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,040
and video.

767
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,470
She's seasoned

768
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,150
and easy to get Mr. He.

769
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,350
Now the new building is completed.

770
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,960
Let me introduce you

771
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,680
the young blood

772
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,350
of Yade hospital

773
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:30,040
the youngest head of surgeon

774
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,270
Dr. Zhou Ziyang.

775
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
Dear leaders

776
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
ladies and gentlemen,

777
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,080
thank you for

778
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,920
coming to the evening banquet

779
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,230
for the completion of the new inpatient building.

780
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,310
Thank you for

781
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,640
your support

782
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,920
during my work.

783
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,470
Let's wish

784
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,080
Yade hospital every success.

785
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,800
Cheers!

786
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,800
Cheers, thank you.

787
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,080
Cheers!

788
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,800
Thank you

789
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,680
Thank you

790
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,350
Thank you

791
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,310
Mr. He

792
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,080
Welcome

793
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,390
Are you satisfied with the new building?

794
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,800
Absolutely.

795
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,390
Speaking of Dr. Zhou Ziyang

796
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,550
we have to

797
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,310
thank one person.

798
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,880
That's

799
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,310
Dr. Qin Yiyue.

800
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,270
My alumna

801
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,920
Ye Qing

802
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,880
No worries.

803
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,840
Someone might ask

804
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,190
why I said that.

805
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,110
Because if my alumna didn't

806
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,510
cut off the past bravely

807
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,150
there will be no sweet headlines

808
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,720
about my alumna and Mr. He

809
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,310
on the Internet.

810
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,600
Therefore

811
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,040
without her, Dr. Ziyang

812
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,150
can't be where he is today.

813
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,760
Although Mr. He still

814
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,840
claims that he is single.

815
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,880
But true love is brave.

816
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,110
We should bless this bravery.

817
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,640
Because it's like the new building

818
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,270
people should also have their new life.

819
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,270
Mr. He, what do you think?

820
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,920
Are Qin Yiyue and He Qiaoyan

821
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,760
in a relationship?

822
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,510
It's not good

823
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,550
to be so blatant.

824
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,840
She looks beautiful

825
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
but too seasoned.

826
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,230
He Qiaoyan will deny the relationship with you

827
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,920
for his reputation.

828
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,270
Qin Yiyue

829
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,840
You'll lose your face.

830
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,040
It seems that

831
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,080
people are very interested in our story.

832
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,510
I'd like to take this opportunity today

833
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,110
to clarify

834
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,800
that those are rumors on the Internet.

835
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,920
I don't want to

836
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,640
hang out with Dr. Qin now.

837
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,310
Don't hang out?

838
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Why does he

839
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,720
kick me when I'm down?

840
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,270
I just hope Dr. Qin

841
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:10,920
not to

842
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,230
refuse my proposal anymore.

843
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,600
Proposal

844
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,600
What's going on?

845
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,230
He proposed to Qin Yiyue.

846
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:18,800
Impossible.

847
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,470
That is...
