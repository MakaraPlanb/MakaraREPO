Unforgettable Love

2
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,670
Password lock.

3
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,880
Verification failed.

4
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,039
Verification failed.

5
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,000
What's the correct password?

6
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:19,360
Fingerprints are

7
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,670
concentrated on three number keys.

8
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,360
Six, seven, zero.

9
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,840
Verification failed.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,230
Six, seven.

11
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,360
No.

12
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,789
Dr. Qin

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
likes birthday best.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,150
But my birthday is in June.

15
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,479
Either for the final exam

16
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,880
or the parents' meeting.

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,310
The worst is that

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,960
math is a part of college entrance examination.

19
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,190
Qin Yiyue.

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Qin Yiyue.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,880
So you are fine.

22
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,000
I see.

23
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,750
The temperature in the bathroom is too high.

24
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,310
So there is something wrong

25
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,590
with the band.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,919
I will feedback it

27
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,190
to the technical department.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,480
Mr. He, could you please ...

29
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,630
Video as proof

30
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,040
I didn't do anything.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,880
It happened for a reason that

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,230
I broke into Ms. Qin Yiyue's apartment.

33
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,840
I didn't have designs on her.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,560
I'm leaving now.

35
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,150
Well

36
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,040
Keep your distance, Ms. Qin.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,790
Otherwise

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,880
it's even harder to explain.

39
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,480
That door

40
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,079
Never mind the outer door.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,150
I'll help you close the bathroom door first.

42
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,190
That door is broken.

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,079
Enjoy your bath.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,310
I'll wait for you outside.

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,190
Take it easy.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,040
Open the door.

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,480
Are you stupid?

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
If you don't open the door

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,230
I'm suing you for trespassing.

51
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,630
and imprisoning a pretty girl.

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,520
You devil.

53
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,590
Inform the technical department,

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,920
it needs more tests

55
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,590
to strengthen the water resistance

56
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,630
and high temperature resistance

57
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,440
of the band.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
Give me the latest experimental parameter report

59
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
next Monday.

60
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,440
Also

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,520
we must think about

62
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,440
the adaptability of the band

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,040
in various harsh environment.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,590
And

65
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,000
I

66
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,150
will never give up.

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,079
Well

68
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,000
He Qiaoyan.

69
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,270
You just wait and see.

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,400
He Qiaoyan

71
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll fight it out with you.

72
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,880
Fortunately, she doesn't have a high fever.

73
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,480
How can this room be so messy?

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,440
How can she live here?

75
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,400
No wonder you are sick.

76
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,110
It's just like

77
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,590
a big bacteriological petri dish.

78
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,630
She is even a doctor.

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,560
The silly must not know how to take the medicine.

80
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
Even Xiaobao is better than her.

81
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,520
How can she become

82
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
my qualified family doctor later?

83
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,590
Snacks are on the bed.

84
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,110
Delicious pig's feet.

85
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Taste good.

86
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,080
Both this place and this girl

87
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,400
are not normal.

88
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,040
According to what happened in the novel

89
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,750
am I reborn?

90
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,440
I'm reborn

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,150
and I also have a husband.

92
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,630
Why is the head so small?

93
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,840
You awake

94
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,630
Why are you here?

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,520
Xiaobao and I

96
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,790
have taken care of you all night.

97
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,310
Let him sleep a little longer.

98
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
You get up first.

99
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,230
My god!

100
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,790
Is this my home?

101
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,080
Have a sit.

102
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,190
No

103
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
No

104
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,520
What exactly did you do

105
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,670
to my home?

106
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,670
Have some porridge first

107
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,710
and then take the medicine.

108
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,230
What happened

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,440
last night?

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,040
And

111
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,000
why are you at my apartment?

112
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,150
Nothing happened

113
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,190
last night.

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,310
Have breakfast.

115
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
I remember now.

116
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,760
Last night

117
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,230
I took a bath in the bathroom.

118
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,470
I took a bath.

119
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,760
And then I

120
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,550
Qin Yiyue

121
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,720
Control yourself.

122
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,150
Control what?

123
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,040
Appetite.

124
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,000
By the way

125
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,110
why did you come to my apartment?

126
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,390
I opened the door for you?

127
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,550
I opened it myself.

128
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,640
0607, your birthday.

129
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,270
How could you know that?

130
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,720
You have told Xiaobao that

131
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,110
your birthday is in June.

132
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,760
either for the parents' meeting

133
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,110
or the final exam.

134
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,390
The most nervous time

135
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,150
is the day of math college entrance examination.

136
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,000
National college entrance examination

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,430
is on June 7th and 8th.

138
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,510
Math examination is on the first day.

139
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
You even remember this.

140
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,720
I remember

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,470
every word you have said.

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,350
You are my target partner

143
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,080
So I'll check

144
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,840
what you say and do.

145
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,270
By the way

146
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
then you helped me get dressed?

147
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,880
Did you see anything

148
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,040
you shouldn't have seen?

149
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,390
What do you think?

150
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,190
You mean

151
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,840
You have seen everything, haven't you?

152
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,000
You mean

153
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,880
you want me to think back.

154
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,110
Tell me the truth.

155
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,270
Visual measurement of height

156
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,430
162 to 164 cm.

157
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
The upper body is as long as legs.

158
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,680
Fat is concentrated in the abdomen

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,550
hip and legs.

160
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,230
According to my calculation

161
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,000
your actual weight

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,110
should be 3.5 kg more

163
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,510
than that in your resume.

164
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,550
Pardon?

165
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,600
3.5 kg.

166
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
We are not talking about that.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,350
What do you want me to say?

168
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,040
Am I pretty?

169
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,470
Sexy.

170
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Xiaobao

171
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,350
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
I didn't celebrate your birthday.

173
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,760
How about this?

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,760
I

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
promise you a birthday wish

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,430
as compensation.

177
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,040
What do you want?

178
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,000
You can tell me

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,760
I will get what you want, OK?

180
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,390
What gift do you want?

181
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Everything.

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,470
OK, I will give you what you want.

183
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,920
Mom

184
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
I'm good at English

185
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,840
Mom

186
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,230
Follow me, Mom

187
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,310
Don't you want me to

188
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,430
teach you English?

189
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,350
No

190
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,110
I want you

191
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,390
to be

192
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,680
You want me to be your Mom.

193
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,640
I, I

194
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,110
No

195
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:35,640
Xiaobao

196
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,430
This is not a matter

197
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,390
to joke about.

198
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,230
No problem.

199
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
I promise you.

200
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,110
Are you sure it's ok?

201
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,510
I'm sure.

202
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,390
I said it.

203
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,760
As long as you ask for

204
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll give you everything you want.

205
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,800
So

206
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,680
sonny.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,840
You have to call me Mom.

208
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,110
Xiaobao, open your mouth.

209
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
Open

210
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,760
Open

211
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,510
Forget it.

212
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,550
I put the medicine in the cabinet.

213
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,080
Eat breakfast soon.

214
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
I'll take Xiaobao back.

215
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,310
Wait a minute.

216
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,150
Wait for me for ten minutes.

217
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,150
You drive me to work.

218
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,510
You're sick.

219
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,470
Take a day off.

220
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,880
No

221
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,640
How can I get a day off.

222
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,800
Many little patients

223
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,110
will come to me.

224
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,190
Their parents

225
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,230
ask for a day off from the company

226
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,230
and take their children

227
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,640
to come to me.

228
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,190
It's my duty.

229
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,470
Wait for me.

230
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,390
Get ready for sleep.

231
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,270
Xiaobao

232
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,680
Are you going to sleep like this?

233
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,960
I want my Mom.

234
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,270
Then you have to tell her yourself.

235
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,880
Besides

236
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,550
you have mouth

237
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,040
You told her.

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,550
He Weifei

239
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,080
That hard disk

240
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,840
saves data of all my experiments

241
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,150
from high school to college.

242
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,390
Be good

243
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,600
and put it down slowly.

244
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
Be good

245
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,760
Be

246
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,880
All right, you little boy.

247
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,510
What do you want to do with my computer?

248
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,270
Fortunately

249
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,680
I learned from the past.

250
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,470
The password is changed this time.

251
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,680
And I'm sure

252
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,510
you'll never guess.

253
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,150
I can't believe you cracked it.

254
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,080
No wonder you spent the whole day

255
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
in my study.

256
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,800
I shouldn't have let you

257
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,920
play with the computer too early.

258
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,960
Dragon born dragon, chicken born chicken.

259
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,680
My son was born with the talent of coding.

260
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,600
Xiaobao

261
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,640
give this to Dad.

262
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,430
What can I say to you?

263
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,840
Good morning, Dr. Qin.

264
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,230
Boy band today.

265
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,190
My style is changeable

266
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,510
but you don't know that.

267
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,800
Xiaobao is handsome.

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
You're right.

269
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,550
Come on.

270
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,510
Come on, Dr. Qin.

271
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,640
Take you to work.

272
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,470
I heard

273
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,760
you have only one patient today.

274
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:16,960
Xiaobao.

275
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,230
What about other patients?

276
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,350
Dr. Huang

277
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,390
will be in charge of your patients.

278
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,550
And

279
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,080
give you a hint.

280
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,230
You still owe Xiaobao a meal.

281
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,920
No

282
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:31,960
Xiaobao said

283
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,390
he had made all the arrangements.

284
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,150
Even I don't know it.

285
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,880
Xiaobao, it is so mysterious.

286
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,080
Then I'll expect it.

287
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,230
Do you want Dr. Qin

288
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,600
to be your Mom?

289
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,080
We are of one mind.

290
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,680
I never believe you can take a horse to the water

291
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,960
but you cannot make him drink.

292
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,680
Drink or not

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,000
we all have to try.

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,840
Right?

295
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,550
Dr. Qin and your Dad still need something

296
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,760
to develop feelings.

297
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,270
First

298
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,720
create an environment

299
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,839
just for them two.

300
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,640
We're going to have a meal, aren't we?

301
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,109
What is this?

302
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,760
Room Escape

303
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,839
Second

304
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,270
create all kinds of crises

305
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,000
for them.

306
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,920
Let them fight side by side

307
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,390
and overcome difficulties together.

308
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,190
Only the environment for them two and crises

309
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,510
can get them closer.

310
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,510
So as to

311
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,599
create the sparks of love.

312
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm so stupid.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,150
I can do nothing.

314
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,680
All right, I'll do it.

315
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,270
Look

316
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,150
Think about it

317
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,000
In the Room

318
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,880
your Dad and Dr. Qin

319
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,270
can only rely on each other.

320
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,080
In the dark

321
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,230
they can only hear

322
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,880
the heartbeat of each other.

323
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,840
Trust and rely on each other.

324
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,190
At that moment, Dr. Qin would say

325
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,800
you are awesome

326
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,270
and I adore you so much.

327
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,000
Suddenly

328
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,040
The door is closed.

329
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
They get closer.

330
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,550
In the last minute

331
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,840
Dr. Qin would say

332
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,390
I'll take this.

333
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,230
Go ahead, I'm right behind you.

334
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,800
I can't.

335
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,270
I'll do it.

336
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,390
OK

337
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,310
Random permutation

338
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,040
Why are you so stupid?

339
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,550
Try it.

340
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,960
I don't know how you graduated.

341
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,310
Boy

342
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,550
How about watching some cartoons?

343
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,920
It may take two hours

344
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,040
for your parents to finish.

345
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,350
It won't take two hours.

346
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,390
Ten minutes is enough.

347
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,600
Line up for half an hour.

348
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,920
Ten minutes for the game.

349
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,110
You've ruined

350
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,350
my game.

351
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,920
With your IQ

352
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,550
You can't get out until night, can you?

353
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:38,960
I

354
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,150
Xiaobao, anything else?

355
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,470
Are you scared?

356
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,390
If you're scared

357
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,470
let's hurry back.

358
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,390
Don't waste time.

359
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,310
What am I scared of?

360
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,230
I'm scared of nothing.

361
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,150
It's just rubber all over the floor.

362
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
There is nothing to be scared of.

363
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,230
I'll kill you.

364
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,600
You frighten me.

365
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,270
Boss

366
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,800
I can't do this job.

367
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,350
The two in the Thriller Room

368
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,840
especially the girl

369
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,760
chase and hit me.

370
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
They hit me on the head.

371
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,510
I quit.

372
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,760
Stop.

373
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,920
Come on.

374
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,150
You think I am afraid of you?

375
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,680
If the wind is too strong

376
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,760
remember to close the window.

377
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,760
No, it's fine.

378
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
What's wrong, Xiaobao?

379
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,920
Come on, Xiaobao.

380
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,840
Put your hat in order.

381
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,600
Take your things with you.

382
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,270
Xiaobao, do you know what it is?

383
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,110
It's elm.

384
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
This is Photinia.

385
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,840
I show you

386
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,150
something interesting.

387
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,600
This is called Acer Palmatum.

388
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,510
It likes sunshine.

389
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,040
Go.

390
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,150
Acer Palmatum

391
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,150
How can you even know that?

392
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,190
If this problem

393
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,230
still can't be solved

394
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,310
don't contact me next time.

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
It's Parent-Child time.

396
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,840
No work

397
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,640
Confiscate

398
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,510
Xiaobao

399
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,350
don't worry.

400
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,550
You take it and I'll pick that up.

401
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,680
Be careful.

402
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,880
What's wrong?

403
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,110
What's the matter? Cold?

404
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,230
Dad will get your coat in the car.

405
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,920
Wait for Mom here.

406
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,720
Don't run around.

407
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,640
Where is Xiaobao?

408
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,110
He Qiaoyan

409
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,470
Xiaobao

410
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,470
Where is Xiaobao?

411
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,110
Didn't I bringing him to you?

412
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,470
I went back to get his coat in the car.

413
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,190
Hurry to find him.

414
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,760
Xiaobao

415
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,350
Xiaobao

416
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,760
Xiaobao, hurry up.

417
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,600
Xiaobao

418
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,230
What's wrong?

419
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,840
Lost your hat?

420
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,720
Don't worry.

421
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,510
I will buy you a new one.

422
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,760
Key

423
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,640
But

424
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,600
to reassure them

425
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
let's take a picture together

426
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
and report to them.

427
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,110
Come on

428
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Xiaobao

429
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Xiaobao

430
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,680
Xiaobao

431
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,150
Hey

432
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:53,880
Xiaobao

433
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,600
Dr. Qin

434
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,470
Xiaobao

435
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,680
Xiaobao

436
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,310
Dr. Qin, Dr. Qin

437
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,510
Leave me alone and save Xiaobao.

438
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,880
Hurry up

439
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,230
Xiaobao has been found.

440
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,350
Everything is fine with Xiaobao.

441
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
That hat

442
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,760
That's not Xiaobao.

443
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,150
Xiaobao has been found.

444
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,190
He's safe.

445
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,840
Why didn't you tell me that earlier?

446
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,510
You always do things so rashly.

447
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,150
Come on, come on.

448
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,000
Be careful

449
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,430
Come on, come on

450
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,000
If I remember correctly, it should be here.

451
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,720
Where is the car?

452
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,080
Don't think about it.

453
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,510
It must be

454
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,230
Wen Gu.

455
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,600
I really didn't expect that

456
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,150
Xiaobao

457
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:03,920
has stolen

458
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,800
my spare key.

459
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,350
My phone lets in water.

460
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,470
What about yours?

461
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,430
My phone's out of power.

462
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,110
Maybe we

463
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,310
are going to spend a night here.

464
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,430
Spend a night here?

465
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,600
Come on, put your hands on it

466
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,640
to warm yourself.

467
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,150
That's ridiculous.

468
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,550
Try it

469
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,230
It's really warm.

470
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,430
You already have a cold.

471
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,640
Go into the tent and change clothes.

472
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,800
The trousers get wet today.

473
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,430
What if the cold get worse?

474
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,310
What are you doing?

475
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,080
Then don't peek.

476
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
You think too much.

477
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,080
Don't peek.

478
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,640
Got it.

479
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,230
Five seconds left.

480
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,430
You have to be so fussy

481
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,880
about making instant noodles.

482
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,920
Just ten seconds.

483
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,640
Ten, nine, eight, seven

484
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,470
It's time.

485
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,470
Eat it

486
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,390
Don't you eat it?

487
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,470
Fried noodles

488
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,640
and too much artificial seasoning.

489
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,080
I don't need that.

490
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,080
It's delicious.

491
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,550
Would you like to have a bite?

492
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,150
No

493
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,110
Do you smell it?

494
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,110
Smell delicious?

495
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,350
You're really not gonna eat?

496
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,800
No

497
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,760
Then I'll eat it.

498
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,190
Is it really that delicious?

499
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,150
I'll taste it myself.

500
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,760
Is it delicious?

501
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,230
A little.

502
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,310
Can you stop leaving noodles you've not finished?

503
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,430
You are such a fool.

504
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,270
In the afternoon

505
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,080
you just jumped into the lake

506
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,840
without knowing

507
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
how deep it is.

508
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,510
I saw Xiaobao's hat

509
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,840
was floating on the lake.

510
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,080
I didn't think about anything

511
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,310
but save him.

512
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,600
If I didn't stop you

513
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,270
you were going to swim into the lake, right?

514
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm a pediatrician.

515
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,960
I am responsible for children.

516
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,150
And

517
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,390
Xiaobao, he trusts me so much

518
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,880
but I lost him.

519
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,310
I feel guilty.

520
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,270
You know what?

521
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,310
In fact, what children say

522
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,350
is the most sincere.

523
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,350
He hopes

524
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,760
call me Mom so much.

525
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,800
Even if he didn't say it

526
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,270
I can't

527
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,550
let him down.

528
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,270
Actually

529
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,880
our routine work

530
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,310
is very hard.

531
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,190
Many people think that

532
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,680
we don't perform an operation

533
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,390
or take care of patients in ICU.

534
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,430
They think we just

535
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,800
chat and play games with children

536
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,960
every day.

537
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,190
They have no idea

538
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,270
how much pressure

539
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,800
we need to bear.

540
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,960
You know what?

541
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,310
Whenever I feel hard

542
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,510
and tired

543
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,840
the children will come to me

544
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,080
take my hand

545
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,600
smile at me

546
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,110
and call me sister.

547
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,110
All my grievances and difficulties

548
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,550
will disappear.

549
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,350
And

550
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,270
Xiaobao almost accepted me

551
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,470
in the first place.

552
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,760
My pleasure.

553
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,840
In that case

554
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,000
do you want to

555
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,390
be Xiaobao's Mom?

556
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,080
It's just his joke.

557
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,190
And Xiaobao

558
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,720
has his real Mom.

559
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,880
You're tired after one day.

560
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,880
Sleep early.

561
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,040
I'm back

562
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,920
Why are you back so late?

563
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,600
You also turned off your phone.

564
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,880
The thing is

565
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,760
I

566
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,000
took Xiaobao to the forest park.

567
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,040
It's too late

568
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,270
so we didn't come back.

569
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,270
We spent the night outside.

570
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,350
But

571
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,270
my neck hurts.

572
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:12,040
It's just that the cell phone is out of power.

573
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,760
Why are you so nervous?

574
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,880
Be honest.

575
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,190
Is there something

576
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,510
you and Mr. He?

577
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,000
Hate from previous existence.

578
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,080
I'm not kidding.

579
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,840
I didn't ask you yet

580
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:32,960
Qin Yiyue.

581
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,040
Yes.

582
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,680
The night before yesterday when I was away on business

583
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,230
I heard that

584
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,000
Mr. He came from our apartment

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,510
in the morning.

586
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,840
You don't even know

587
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,720
how is the gossip spread

588
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,080
in the hospital.

589
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,470
The thing is

590
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,680
I

591
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,960
often have affairs.

592
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,230
First, top trending searches

593
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,550
After that, gossip

594
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm really famous.

595
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,470
Got it.

596
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,680
On the night of the scandal video leaked of

597
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,470
Mr. He and a mysterious woman

598
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,190
you were in the hotel, right?

599
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,110
Did you

600
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,080
tell Mr. He something?

601
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,110
So Zhou Ziyang didn't win the prize.

602
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,080
Zhou Ziyang didn't win the prize?

603
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,639
Don't you know?

604
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
What do you do on your phone every day?

605
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,639
I told you

606
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,350
now the whole hospital

607
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,840
is talking about it.

608
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,080
When Mr. He presented the award

609
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,040
he directly withdraw Zhou Ziyang's award

610
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,190
on the spot.

611
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,550
I remember

612
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,429
every word you have said.

613
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,600
So he remembered

614
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,550
every word I have said.

615
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,550
I'm sorry

616
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,389
Sorry

617
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,639
Sorry

618
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,429
Yue

619
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,430
Yue

620
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Are you OK?

621
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,110
We didn't have time

622
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,310
to talk with each other recently.

623
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,760
For me

624
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,800
it doesn't make any difference

625
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
between an Ex and a stranger.

626
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,470
I have nothing to say to a stranger.

627
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,510
I'm sorry

628
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,510
If you

629
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,550
feel sorry

630
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,760
please ask your girlfriend

631
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,470
not to threaten me

632
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,310
to leave

633
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,230
in the name of position and work.

634
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,600
Also

635
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,270
by the way, let me remind you.

636
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,390
Emotion and work

637
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,470
should be separated.

638
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,110
Dr. Zhou

639
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,270
Qing

640
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,390
Dr. Qin

641
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,680
Tonight, there will be a party

642
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,880
to celebrate the completion of the building.

643
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,150
Join us.

644
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,840
Give you some good news quietly.

645
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,720
My Dad will announce

646
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,640
that Ziyang will be promoted to

647
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,470
the chief physician at that time.

648
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,720
Congratulations.

649
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,110
I will be there.

650
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,920
It's unworthy

651
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,230
to buy a new dress

652
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,430
for the promotion

653
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,470
of the Ex.

654
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,550
It's a waste of money.

655
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,800
You're wrong.

656
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,760
It's wrong not to buy the dress.

657
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,430
Just to let him know he's blind.

658
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,390
Let him know

659
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,800
you are doing well.

660
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,080
After leaving him

661
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,270
you are a survivor of a disaster.

662
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,270
I think

663
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,680
you're right.

664
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,470
Just thinking about Zhou Ziyang

665
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,840
I'll get angry.

666
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,960
If you had not been in love

667
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,080
and gave

668
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,230
him the place to study abroad

669
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,550
how could he be where he is today?

670
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,080
Look

671
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,270
Why did you pretend to be strong?

672
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,350
Went to the scene of the car accident to save people.

673
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,880
You hurt your hand

674
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,840
and you can't

675
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,840
be a surgeon anymore.

676
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,920
It's good for me to be a psychologist.

677
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,510
I can help so many children.

678
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,040
I have a great sense of accomplishment.

679
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,000
And I'm happy.

680
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,720
You saved a child at that time.

681
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,430
The next two days

682
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,110
you became a child psychologist.

683
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,960
If you saved

684
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,230
a cat or a dog

685
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,550
you would be a veterinarian?

686
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,230
Why are you so funny?

687
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,230
I feel like being a veterinarian

688
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,270
is also good.

689
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,150
For me

690
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,190
as long as I can cure the disease

691
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,600
any kind of doctor is fine.

692
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,510
All right, stop it.

693
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,760
Go and buy some clothes.

694
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,190
This store looks not bad.

695
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,960
Welcome.

696
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,640
How about this one?

697
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,430
My long white legs

698
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,000
you can see them

699
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
but you can't touch them.

700
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:23,350
This one.

701
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,000
It feels like others can see

702
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,760
but never get you.

703
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,110
This one's too see-through.

704
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,230
Try it, Try it.

705
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,350
Go, go.

706
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,040
I see

707
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,880
I see.

708
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,040
Take it.

709
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,720
Unifon masks.

710
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
Tomorrow is very important.

711
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,880
Remember to use it tonight.

712
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,800
Tomorrow

713
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,080
you'll be the little fairy to shine.

714
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,430
Unifon masks.

715
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,800
You spoil me so much.

716
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,150
I am the one who support you the most.

717
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,720
How about this dress?

718
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,430
Change it.

719
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,760
Take it off.

720
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,550
Then I'll choose another one.

721
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,510
Thank you

722
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,470
Thank you.

723
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,230
Ann

724
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,550
Congratulations.

725
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,040
Thank you

726
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,000
I am really jealous of Dr. Zhou

727
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,760
to marry the daughter of the director of the hospital.

728
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,510
Thank you

729
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,270
Is that Dr. Qin?

730
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,350
I didn't even see it

731
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,510
that Dr. Qin is in such a good shape.

732
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,550
Yiyue

733
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,600
You are here.

734
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,270
You look beautiful today.

735
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,800
Thank you

736
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,040
If I were Dr. Qin

737
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,310
I wouldn't be here.

738
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,840
You are so beautiful today.

739
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,080
This dress looks good.

740
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,880
Drink a glass of wine.

741
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,390
I'm not wearing a dress

742
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,920
but the uniform ready to fight.

743
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,230
You are so careless.

744
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,230
The tag

745
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,190
is still on the dress.

746
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,390
It can't be the luxury just bought in the morning

747
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,430
for the event tonight

748
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,430
and you have no time to remove the tag.

749
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,230
Or

750
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,110
it's rare for you to

751
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,430
buy such an expensive dress

752
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,510
then you can't bear to pick it.

753
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,190
Or I'll help you.

754
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,720
OK.

755
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,510
Throw it for me.

756
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,470
You like garbage recycling

757
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,800
don't you?

758
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,350
Cheers!

759
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,190
Hey

760
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,510
Qin Yiyue is really high-profile

761
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,230
and afraid that others won't know about her.

762
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,510
What?

763
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
Don't you know?

764
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,040
It's all over the Internet

765
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,190
Pictures of her and He Qiaoyan

766
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,040
and video.

767
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,470
She's seasoned

768
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,150
and easy to get Mr. He.

769
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,350
Now the new building is completed.

770
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,960
Let me introduce you

771
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,680
the young blood

772
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,350
of Yade hospital

773
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,040
the youngest head of surgeon

774
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,270
Dr. Zhou Ziyang.

775
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,040
Dear leaders

776
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,040
ladies and gentlemen,

777
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,080
thank you for

778
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,920
coming to the evening banquet

779
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,230
for the completion of the new inpatient building.

780
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,310
Thank you for

781
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,640
your support

782
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,920
during my work.

783
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,470
Let's wish

784
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,080
Yade hospital every success.

785
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,800
Cheers!

786
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Cheers, thank you.

787
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,080
Cheers!

788
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,800
Thank you

789
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,680
Thank you

790
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,350
Thank you

791
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,310
Mr. He

792
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,080
Welcome

793
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,390
Are you satisfied with the new building?

794
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,800
Absolutely.

795
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,390
Speaking of Dr. Zhou Ziyang

796
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,550
we have to

797
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,310
thank one person.

798
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,880
That's

799
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,310
Dr. Qin Yiyue.

800
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,270
My alumna

801
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,920
Ye Qing

802
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,880
No worries.

803
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,840
Someone might ask

804
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,190
why I said that.

805
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,110
Because if my alumna didn't

806
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,510
cut off the past bravely

807
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,150
there will be no sweet headlines

808
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,720
about my alumna and Mr. He

809
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,310
on the Internet.

810
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,600
Therefore

811
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,040
without her, Dr. Ziyang

812
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,150
can't be where he is today.

813
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,760
Although Mr. He still

814
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,840
claims that he is single.

815
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,880
But true love is brave.

816
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,110
We should bless this bravery.

817
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,640
Because it's like the new building

818
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,270
people should also have their new life.

819
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,270
Mr. He, what do you think?

820
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,920
Are Qin Yiyue and He Qiaoyan

821
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,760
in a relationship?

822
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,510
It's not good

823
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,550
to be so blatant.

824
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,840
She looks beautiful

825
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,800
but too seasoned.

826
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,230
He Qiaoyan will deny the relationship with you

827
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:18,920
for his reputation.

828
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,270
Qin Yiyue

829
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,840
You'll lose your face.

830
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,040
It seems that

831
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,080
people are very interested in our story.

832
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,510
I'd like to take this opportunity today

833
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,110
to clarify

834
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,800
that those are rumors on the Internet.

835
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,920
I don't want to

836
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,640
hang out with Dr. Qin now.

837
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,310
Don't hang out?

838
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
Why does he

839
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,720
kick me when I'm down?

840
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,270
I just hope Dr. Qin

841
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:02,920
not to

842
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,230
refuse my proposal anymore.

843
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,600
Proposal

844
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,600
What's going on?

845
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,230
He proposed to Qin Yiyue.

846
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,800
Impossible.

847
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,470
That is...
