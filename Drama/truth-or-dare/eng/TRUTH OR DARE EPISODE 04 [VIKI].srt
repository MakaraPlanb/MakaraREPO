[Truth or Dare - Episode 04]

3
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,120
 [Blind Groom] 

4
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,940
Mei Shiqing, take this wall down immediately!

5
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,650
Or else today, I'll beat you unfilial son to death!

6
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,660
I won't take it down.

7
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,310
Father!

8
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,100
Shiqing, let's take the wall down now.

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,220
I. Won't. Do. It!

10
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,770
- Thanks. 
- No need.

11
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,380
You became injured like this to protect me.

12
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,200
Of course I have to thank you.

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,260
Before, my attitude toward you was horrible.

14
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,180
Now, I really regret it and feel guilty inside.

15
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,320
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,040
However, look at yourself!

17
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,210
Couldn't you have admitted your mistake in that situation?

18
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,510
Why do you have to suffer this kind of pain?

19
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,160
I think you're overthinking it.

20
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,320
I saved you because I was afraid that if you got hurt, we wouldn't be able to explain to the Ninth Prince Manor.

21
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,060
I think you're overthinking it, too.

22
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,920
I...I said this out of courtesy. You know?

23
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,860
I think courtesy means you shutting your mouth.

24
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm someone who pays back for kindness.

25
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,390
Anyways, I'm repaying your kindness no matter what.

26
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,920
I said no need.

27
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,880
In the future, if you want to eat, drink, or need something, feel free to tell me.

28
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,950
It will be treat.

29
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,380
Alright, I need you to shut up.

30
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,040
Aren't you blind?

31
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,450
Then, how you did you

32
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,990
perfectly block in front of me?

33
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,380
I mean, I didn't even notice.

34
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,780
Considering your build and the level of noise,

35
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,270
it is impossible not to know.

36
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,530
Makes sense.

37
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,030
Wait a second, what do you mean by my build?

38
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,800
You're saying I'm fat!

39
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,180
I want to eat porridge.

40
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,310
Porridge, right?

41
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,220
I'll tell Qiao Yun to go make it soon.

42
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,200
Wait, just what do you mean? What do you mean I'm fat?

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,820
Just then, someone was begging and crying for an opportunity to repay my kindness.

44
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,860
As I see it, that's just lip service.

45
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,350
Right now, even a bowl of porridge has to be made by someone else.

46
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,570
Am I someone who doesn't do what they say?

47
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,090
It's just a bowl of porridge, wait right here.

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,120
Young Master, thank goodness you react quickly!

49
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,230
Are you alright?

50
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,840
I'm fine.

51
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:44,330
Okay, okay, okay! Let me do it.

52
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,210
I have to make it myself for it to be sincere.

53
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,360
The fire isn't even lit for you to be making anything.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,640
This porridge has to be made with boiling water.

55
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,870
Then, you add in blanched tonics

56
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,340
for the porridge to have a delicate fragrance. This--

57
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,080
I get it.

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,530
I have to show Third Young Master Mei what gratitude and remembering to pay it back are like.

59
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,370
As for you, letting him have a good ol' bowl of porridge

60
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,770
is the best form of gratitude, okay?

61
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,100
I'll help you make it. After it's done, you just have to bring it over.

62
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,830
Is mine not good?

63
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,180
I wasted a bunch of energy for nothing.

64
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,780
The porridge is done, hurry and eat it before it's cold.

65
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,510
I don't want it.

66
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,860
You don't want it anymore?

67
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,450
Let it go, Xiao Wanzi. 

68
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,740
You're repaying kindness right now, hold it in. 

69
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,950
Fine, if you don't want it, I'll eat it.

70
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,030
Wait, Siheng. Your Young Master is still injured.

71
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,400
Alright, have this porridge. I'll help him wash his hair.

72
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Attentive work like this indeed requires me to do it.

73
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,100
Yes.

74
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,960
Young Master, the porridge tastes great! Aren't you going to try some?

75
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,430
If it's good, then finish it for me!

76
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,240
Okay.

77
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,700
Can he seriously not see?

78
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,950
He was able to save me so suddenly.

79
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,360
Is he really blind?

80
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,630
There's a fly.

81
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,200
Here, Shiqing. Have a foot bath before you go to bed.

82
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,880
What's wrong?

83
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,700
It's scalding hot.

84
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,300
Then, I'll add some cold water for you.

85
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,000
One more ladle.

86
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,200
Try it now.

87
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,400
- Is it okay? 
- Yes, yes.

88
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,560
- Go and get me a cup of water. 
- Oh.

89
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,860
There's no more.

90
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Here, husband. Have some tea.

91
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,770
Why are you covered in sweat?

92
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,370
Is it very hot?

93
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,470
Not really.

94
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,790
- Oh right, there's no more cold water. Go and get me some. 
- Oh.

95
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,890
It's so hot.

96
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,310
How did he know there's no more cold water in here?

97
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,070
Xiao Bao, it's been a long time since you and I last had a drink together.

98
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,640
Today is a good time for us to have a drink.

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,570
Here. 
 Okay.

100
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,680
Xiao Bao,

101
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,610
why did I hear Xiao Wanzi ran away again?

102
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,400
No way, we were playing a game.

103
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,620
You're grown up and still playing around.

104
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,050
But, I think Xiao Wanzi is hard to deal with.

105
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,460
Yes, she is really had to deal with.

106
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,780
I've put in so much effort.

107
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:03,750
Godfather, when do you plan to let the two of us get married?

108
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,630
For the sake of you two,

109
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:13,500
I've been seriously thinking it through all night long.

110
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,040
Godfather, you've put in a lot of work for me.

111
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,320
So I decided

112
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,610
to betroth Nan Xiang to you.

113
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,460
Xiao Bao, think about it. You've been with me for so many years.

114
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,190
I hope you can inherit my position as master of the fort

115
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,210
and grow our Green Dragon Fort, what do you say?

116
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,040
Yes, Godfather. I understand that you are doing this for my good.

117
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,990
Well...if I marry Nan Xiang,

118
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,310
what about Xiao Wanzi?

119
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,080
I will marry her.

120
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,010
B-but, Godfather--

121
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,390
But what?

122
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:02,090
When have I, Nan Batian, ever taken my words back?

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,570
Godfather, y-you're doing too much.

124
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,200
Godfather, you've been extremely kind to me.

125
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,260
I really regret it.

126
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,050
If I knew you liked that girl, I wouldn't have done anything to her.

127
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,220
But...

128
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,290
I have already...done what can't be undone with her.

129
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,420
Y-You, y-you, why are you so quick?

130
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,650
Godfather, she wanted to run.

131
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,180
I was thinking we cannot delay the illness-banishing wedding.

132
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,270
Didn't you say you two were playing games?!

133
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,600
How could you--

134
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,660
I will apologize by taking my life.

135
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,430
W-Wait.

136
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,390
No need, have a seat.

137
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,700
In the past there was the legend of Emperor Tangming and Lady Yang.

138
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,390
Us, Green Dragon Fort,

139
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,590
we can also follow in their footsteps, right?

140
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,520
Godfather, if you are in a rush, I will take her there right now.

141
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,870
Come back! Sit.

142
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,860
You are young. Look at you. However,

143
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,390
did Lady Yang come to the Palace from the Royal Residence?

144
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,460
No.

145
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,250
First she became a nun and went to the convent.

146
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,280
After the short crossing, she came at the palace.

147
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,350
We must also make that crossing.

148
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,920
Okay, I understand.

149
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,360
Tonight, I will send Xiao Wanzi to the guest room.

150
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,710
Then, I will give her a makeover,

151
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,770
then, from the guest room,

152
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,930
I will send her to your room.

153
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,420
Xiao Bao.

154
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,860
I thank you for your filial thought.

155
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,170
But...although we are bandits, we cannot be uncultured.

156
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,360
Yes.

157
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,740
Besides, it has been so hard for me to get a new marriage,

158
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,490
I have to make it grand.

159
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,880
I have to make it really popular and beautiful, no?

160
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,730
I understand.

161
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,350
We have to make it grand, popular and beautiful.

162
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,590
I will listen to all of your orders, I will handle it right now!

163
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,220
Go ahead.

164
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,700
Xiao Wanzi.

165
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,060
No, what's with you?

166
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,490
My Godfather won't let me marry you.

167
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,170
It looks like your Godfather is someone who understands things and knows that we are not suitable for one another.

168
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,760
What are you happy for?

169
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,400
My Godfather wants to marry you himself.

170
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,350
What? Is there no-one normal within the bandits?

171
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,460
Yesterday you were marrying me, today he's marrying me!

172
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,960
You guys are so shameless and low! What do you guys think of me as?

173
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,200
Did you think I wanted to?! It's all your fault!

174
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,230
If it weren't for your parents making you so beautiful,

175
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,310
do you think I would like you this much?!

176
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,460
Thank you for praising me, now what do I do?!

177
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,400
If there's no solution, I will die. I can only get out of this by dying!

178
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,290
I'm...dying.

179
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,000
Go ahead! Let's all die! Then there won't be any more troubles!

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,980
I won't die.

181
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,280
Then what should we do? How about,

182
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,220
how about you pretend to be stupid?

183
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,200
Go away, stay away from me!

184
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,250
Then, what do you think we should do?

185
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,860
I suddenly remember, there was this type of herb when I was young.

186
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,110
If I just soaked it in water and scrubbed it on my body,

187
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,250
my whole body would be covered in rashes, it was really scary.

188
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,170
For real? That powerful?

189
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,400
For real.

190
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,130
Then...what is the herb called?

191
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,360
It is called corydalis saxicola.

192
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,850
I don't know, I'm uneducated.

193
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,960
- Is it expensive?
- Yes.

194
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,000
No matter how expensive it is, I have to buy it for you at the medical shop.

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,970
If I really can't buy it, I will go up the mountains and down the seas.

196
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,060
Even if I jump off a cliff, I will find it for you, okay?

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,850
Xiao Wanzi, how is your relationship with Third Young Master Mei these days?

198
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,520
Those all aren't important.

199
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,160
I suspect that Third Young Master Mei can see.

200
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,370
Can see?!

201
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,160
-This--
-I only suspect.

202
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,490
If we can confirm, we have already prepared, no?

203
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,890
Don't worry. I have already come up with a plan.

204
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,330
What plan?

205
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:43,360
I know that Third Young Master Mei has an obsession with cleanliness.

206
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,870
I also know what he is most afraid of.

207
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,990
Shiqing!

208
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,500
The green mountain crosses the North. The white water surrounds the city of the east.

209
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,390
Princess.

210
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,310
-What are you here for?
-I am here to take care of you.

211
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,500
There's no need, Siheng is enough.

212
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,130
Siheng, go out first.

213
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,260
I...I have something to speak with Young Master privately.

214
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,760
Y-Young Master, here's the book.

215
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
I'll put it here.

216
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,060
Shiqing, this is

217
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,360
a home remedy I found to cure eyes.

218
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,530
Is supposed to activate the mediums around the eyes.

219
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,230
It will help those blind to recover their eyesight.

220
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,490
Let me try it on you.

221
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,300
Are you okay?

222
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,290
Yes.

223
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,260
I apologize for wasting your hard work.

224
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,170
It's okay.

225
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,430
Shiqing, it is said that by massaging the arms more,

226
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,130
it is also helpful to recover eyesight.

227
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,650
So, he really is blind. 

228
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,580
What a waste of time. 

229
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,810
I'll go get you another kind of medicine.

230
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,800
I tried yesterday. The Third Young Master really is blind.

231
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,030
Even when the spider was about to crawl up to his neck,

232
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,490
he didn't react at all.

233
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,700
I guess this is good news.

234
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,670
Qiu Hua, how about you?

235
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,380
I haven't heard any news about the princess.

236
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,420
Nor of the old He of the Paradise Casino.

237
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,480
Since I didn't marry into the fort,

238
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,810
did they kill my father?

239
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,020
They wouldn't have, the Gaming House wouldn't do that.

240
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,430
Xiao Wanzi, don't worry too much.

241
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,560
Your father will be fine.

242
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,670
The Second Madam is here.

243
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,680
Princess looks very relaxed.

244
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,870
Second Madam, since you're here yourself, is there anything you need?

245
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,390
Shiqing has been injured, so I brought some tonics.

246
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,420
Princess, please take care of preparing the tonics for him.

247
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,760
Thank you for your kindness, Second Madam.

248
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,060
Is Shiqing good to you?

249
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,460
Look at how Third Young Master Mei currently is.

250
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,530
Before his eyes went bad

251
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,620
he was known for

252
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,600
being a flirtatious and proud boy.

253
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,020
In the whole Qingzhou city, not a single girl

254
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,470
caught his eye.

255
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,400
Except for the...

256
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,910
The singer from Ruyi Restaurant.

257
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,530
Second Madam, the past is the past.

258
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,680
Right now, I think that as long as he stays by my side, it's enough.

259
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,730
Oh my! My tongue slipped.

260
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,440
I won't speak further.

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,310
Look at my memory! Here.

262
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,000
Princess,

263
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,630
here I have a hairpin.

264
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,610
I think it suits you perfectly.

265
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,030
I hope you won't reject

266
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,240
my small token of appreciation.

267
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,190
- Here. 
- I shouldn't receive this reward without deserving it.

268
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,390
However, this is a gift from my elder after all.

269
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,800
If I don't accept it,

270
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,280
not taking our relationship into consideration. Anyways, thank you, Second Madam.

271
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,850
As long as you like it.

272
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,520
There are barely any womenfolk in this family.

273
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,590
I'm absolutely delighted that you could marry into this family.

274
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,790
I hope that when you have time in the future, you'll come and chat with me.

275
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,690
Most definitely! I'm someone who loves chatting.

276
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,260
Since the Third Young Master has been unwell each day,

277
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm afraid you'd be overly worried

278
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,930
so I also prepared a big surprise for you.

279
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:56,300
Just wait and see.

280
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm someone who loves surprises!

281
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,790
Thank you so much, Second Madam.

282
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,120
You'll like it for sure!

283
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,970
Then, I won't disturb you any longer.

284
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,990
Have a good rest.

285
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,640
Good bye, Second Madam.

286
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,630
Come by often.

287
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,390
Okay.

288
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,750
- Bye bye, princess. 
- Bye bye.

289
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,900
What was she here for?

290
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,510
Shiqing, I think that

291
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,060
Second Madam is pretty nice. She even brought you tonics.

292
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,210
Throw it away.

293
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,170
They're so expensive, don't throw them away!

294
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,850
Okay, I will. I'll throw them away.

295
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:40,890
I just think that even though something's up with the Second Madam,

296
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,420
the tonics are fine. It'd be a shameful waste.

297
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,550
There's nothing else?

298
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,400
- Nope. 
- Really?

299
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,580
Why would I lie to you?

300
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,200
Also, I'm the princess!

301
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,880
Can I be easily attributed for this small favor?

302
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
How funny.

303
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,290
I hope it is so.

304
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,920
Siheng, take me for a walk.

305
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,170
Madam, if you don't like Third Young Master Mei,

306
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,640
then why did you have to bring him tonics?

307
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,130
You must not know.

308
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,350
These things have been sitting around for so long.

309
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,760
It just sits there, giving it to them,

310
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,660
it is only to ask for a favor of the Princess.

311
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,060
Madam, you are wise.

312
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,120
There are tons of these things.

313
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,710
Remember that when you're bringing things over later on,

314
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,320
Be smart and intelligent, get some news.

315
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,810
Yes.

316
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,600
Wait.

317
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,080
What I told you to do - how is it coming along?

318
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,650
Don't worry, Madam. What you have told us to do

319
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,120
all the servants are doing their best to accomplish.

320
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,900
The Princess has just entered the manor,

321
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:06,820
so it naturally takes some effort to bring her to our side.

322
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,640
You are more close with Second Madam, do you know what she gave us to look at?

323
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,100
I only know that in order to make you happy,

324
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,100
she spent some effort.

325
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,240
Is it that you're jealous I have better relations with people here?

326
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,560
My Lord, look, they're here.

327
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,280
- Princess.
- Second Madam, what do you want to show us?

328
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,590
Today, I spent a lot of money to invite the best acrobatics group

329
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,000
to relieve everyone's boredom.

330
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,190
Come on, let's go onto the balcony.

331
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,340
- Let them begin.
- Yes.

332
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,240
- My Lord, let's go.
- Let's go.

333
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,310
Have a seat.

334
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,920
My Lord, the acrobatic group that I invited today

335
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,970
has a special skill that's really famous.

336
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,470
She spent a lot of money to invite an acrobatics group?

337
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,280
My father and I are the best.

338
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,120
Speaking of father,

339
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,050
I don't know where he is right now.

340
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,930
I'm Wang Haiquan, the master of the Qiankun troop and I

341
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,020
give my greetings to General and Madam.

342
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,560
I give my greetings to Young Master and Princess.

343
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,650
Our troop has traveled the world for a long time.

344
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,980
We will definitely give a good show for everyone to watch.

345
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,960
The Princess is here today, do your best!

346
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,950
Since the Princess esteems us, we'll do our best.

347
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,990
[Good show and time]

348
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,550
- Great! 
- Amazing!

349
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,390
- Impressive! Great! 
- Amazing!

350
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,950
Next up is our main event,

351
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,150
Boulder-Shattering Chest. From our audience,

352
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,630
who would like to come forth and try?

353
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,400
Me!

354
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,130
- Can you even? 
- Yes.

355
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,150
Second Young Master,

356
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,250
take the hammer.

357
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,080
It's pretty heavy.

358
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,940
My goodness.

359
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,470
Young Master, perhaps you didn't sleep well last night.

360
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,140
Here, let me.

361
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,000
Let me! Let me, let me! Let me.

362
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,350
Let me do it.

363
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,590
I'm here.

364
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,380
Princess, you mustn't!

365
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,110
Don't worry, move aside.

366
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:03,420
Princess, your body is fragile and precious, maybe you shouldn't...

367
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,220
Don't worry, trust me!

368
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,890
The Princess is indeed an honorable woman.

369
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,510
Oh no, I've blown my cover.

370
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,810
If it weren't for all of my hits earlier, there's no way she could have broken it!

371
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,620
Right! Exactly.

372
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,830
I, well, I took advantage of your work.

373
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,650
Thanks, Second Young Master.

374
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,870
Princess, let me have the hammer.

375
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,050
Lu Yingyao, doesn't behave like a Princess.

376
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,440
Almost like someone from Jianghu. 

377
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,150
I didn't scare you just then, did I?

378
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,740
No.

379
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,050
Here.

380
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,720
You cannot see anything.

381
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,640
Why do you come to the study all day long?

382
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,340
Since I cannot see, why don't you explain it to me?

383
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,920
What is it?

384
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,200
I catched a cold, my throat doesn't feel well.

385
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,980
Since that's the case, then I won't bother you.

386
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,540
What lucky day is it today?

387
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,230
It's better if I go back to the room and stay there.

388
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,540
Shiqing, you have a good rest. I will return to my room.

389
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,770
Hold on.

390
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,160
Shiqing, what is it?

391
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,830
After a few days, it is my Teacher's birthday.

392
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:18,250
I want you to help me write a letter.

393
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,030
Write a letter? That's such a secret matter.

394
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,630
It is better not to let me write it for you.

395
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,720
I don't mind. We are husband and wife.

396
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,080
Who's close with you?

397
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,500
Could it be... that you do not know how to write?

398
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,550
What a joke!

399
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,940
How could a princess possibly not know how to write?!

400
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,790
Of course I can write.

401
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:59,940
I will just write it. You will not be able to see it anyway.

402
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,440
Come on.

403
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,290
Tell me. What do you want me to write?

404
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,410
I will speak, you go write.

405
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,520
Dear teacher, please accept my respects.

406
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,730
It has been many days since we parted.

407
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,120
I don't know if your health is well.

408
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,920
The weather in the capital changes a lot.

409
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,020
I hope you take good care of your health.

410
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,270
Please continue. You do not have to wait for me. I write fast.

411
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,320
My body is not well, I cannot go attend the birthday feast.

412
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I am really remorseful.

413
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,820
Good thing my Father taught me a few words before.

414
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,320
Looks like it really is put to use.

415
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,240
Boulder-Shattering Chest

416
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,860
Bad news! Qiao Yun, bad news!

417
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,720
-What's the matter?
-Third Young Master Mei just asked me to write a letter!

418
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,330
Do you know how to write?

419
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:20,440
I don't know. I just know how to write "Boulder-Shattering Chest".

420
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,220
What did Third Young Master Mei say to you?

421
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,160
- He said "Thank you, Teacher".
- "Thank you, Teacher."

422
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,300
- Asked him to take care of himself and that he can't attend the birthday.
- Take care of himself.

423
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,780
- Can't attend the birthday.
- Can't attend the birthday...

424
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,150
Princess!

425
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,410
Xiao Ran, what are you doing here?

426
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,360
I am here to bring something from Second Madam. Madam has advised

427
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,380
this is a special medicine for Third Young Master Mei to strengthen the body.

428
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,480
Just put it here.

429
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,480
You guys are making soup? I am good at making soups! Do you need help?

430
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,350
Are looking down on me? Xiao Ran?

431
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,630
Please do not misunderstand, older sister.

432
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,990
Then I will not bother you.

433
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm leaving.

434
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,690
Quickly help me write the letter to replace the one I wrote.

435
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,730
It will be bad if he sends it.

436
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:09,410
Okay. Then help me look after the soup. I will be back at once.

437
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,310
Okay, okay.

438
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,130
These tonics are top-quality. He's got it good.

439
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,870
I'll help him replenish some.

440
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,980
So fast!

441
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,540
That's pretty much what he wants to say.

442
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,850
If you send it now,

443
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,890
then the meaning should be about the same.

444
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,860
Quickly go. Quickly.

445
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,390
Run faster. Don't expose yourself.

446
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,910
Shiqing, this soup I have made myself. Try it.

447
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,620
Third Young Master Mei...
