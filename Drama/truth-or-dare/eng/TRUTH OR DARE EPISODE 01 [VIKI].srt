00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Qingzhou, a  place seemingly peaceful

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,150
but there was a salt gang rebellion that affected the people

6
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,060
on this occasion the black cloak

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,980

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,310
tell your leader, try to inflate the price of salt again

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,090

took possession of the mountain

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,160
- and made the merchants who passed by flee. 
- Stop.

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,210
And in the meantime, the one who can compete with them in terms of strength

20
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,610
Is the third son of the Mei army.

21
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,640
Mei Shiqing.

22
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,050
Mei Shiqing. I'd say you're just a junior general. Even if your dad is here...

23
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,430
He'll still have to call me uncle.

24
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,070
Siheng. Save the people.

25
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,470
Yes!

26
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,020
Save me, save me!

27
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,960
Young Master, are you alright?

28
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,410
I told you long ago,

29
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,310
you should have used my tactic long ago. What did you wait so long for?

30
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,800
You slimy bottom feeder! Ah!

31
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,260
Young Master.

32
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,390

00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,980
Today, for the benefit of the citizens of Qingzhou.

55
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,150
We have decided anyone who gives 10 taels,

56
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,980
We will break all 5 slabs at once!

57
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,820
- Thank you, thank you. 
- Thank you.

58
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,550
Is there any boss who will pay?

59
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,170
I will give 5 teals!

60
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,260
- Make way!
- Make way!

61
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,030
- Make way
- Master this way.

62
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,110
- Who is he? 
- This way, prince.

63
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,540
Greetings, prince.

64
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,770
How about you give 5 taels more?

65
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,550
We'll break whichever of the five stones you want.

66
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,430
I don't want to break stones.

67
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,240
If you come with me,

68
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,660
I'll let you live it up.

69
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,490
Prince, we're just performers.

70
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,250
With our life, we cannot enjoy this type of happiness.

71
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,970
Don't be shameless!

72
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,890
What do you take our prince for?

73
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,360
Back off!

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,960
- What's going on? 
- Who are they?

75
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,330
Stop watching! Stop watching!

76
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,810
This is? Huh?

77
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,010
What are they up to?

78
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,800
Get her! Get her!

79
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,250
- Get her.
- Argh!

80
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,740
Aah!

81
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,400
Sorry! I'll fix it.

82
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,220
Is that not it? Then, I'll put it back.

83
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,420
Hurry up and go!

84
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,250
You didn't warn me about using a hammer!

85
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,520
Hurry and chase them!

86
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,380
Chase after them!

87
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,100
Hurry and chase them!

88
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,350
Hurry and chase them!

89
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,940
Make way!

90
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Chase them!

91
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,620
Make way!

92
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,320
Stop right there!

93
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,100
Master! You be the judge!

94
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,030
In broad daylight,

95
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:58,400
what type of person are you to bully elderly and a woman?!

96
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,370
It's her! She hurt our prince.

97
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,060
Master! You be the judge!

98
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,870
Nonsense! They're spewing nonsense.

99
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,750
Obviously, they tried to bully an innocent girl in broad daylight.

100
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,060
They are the ones at fault.

101
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,290
Alright. Disperse! We have important matters to attend.

102
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,970
Siheng, it's too noisy. Return to the Mei Manor!

103
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,010
You all better leave!

104
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,240
Otherwise, we'll deal with you using military laws!

105
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,530
Scram!

106
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,630
Stop!

107
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,060
Are you alright?

108
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,780
You're blind?

109
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,770
Who are you? Get out!

110
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,290
What kind of attitude is that?

111
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,720
I just saved you.

112
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,320
Is that the kind of attitude you should have towards your savior?

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,960
Get out!

114
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't you have anything grateful to say?

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,090
Young Master, are you alright?

116
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,080
- Wanzi. 
- Thank you, miss.

117
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,210
You're welcome.

118
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,360
See? This is what a person should say.

119
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,830
Siheng, take her away!

120
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,700
Young Master, are you okay?

121
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,940
Siheng, toss her out! Go back to the manor!

122
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,570
Wanzi, hurry and get down!

123
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,590
Hurry up.

124
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,360
[Green Dragon Fort]

125
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,330
What happened to Xiao Bao?

126
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,940
Godfather! Hurry up!

127
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,660
- He's injured that badly? 
- Be careful.

128
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,690
- He's injured. 
- Oh my.

129
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,430
Xiao Bao greets Godfather...

130
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,500
Xiao Bao, didn't Mei Sanshao hurt your chest? Why is your foot wrapped up?

131
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,990
Godfather, look at him!

132
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:42,450
We are brothers!

133
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,610
He doesn't even care about me and he is still here talking about me.

134
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,650
if you followed my plan we won't have failed

135
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:52,150
Godfather, it's because he messed up, that three-legged cat kung fu.

136
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,440
Me, a three-legged cat?

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,000
If it weren't for him,

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,060
I'd have caught all of them!

139
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,880
Xiao Bao! Xiao Bao.

140
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
How did you get hurt like this?

141
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,220
-it hurts
-it's ok, it's ok

142
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,870
Xiao Bao, which goddamned person did this to you? Tell me, Nan Xiang.

143
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,550
I'll skin them alive for sure!

144
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,120
Him.

145
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,010
Me?

146
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,350
I told you to go and fight enemies, not to fight your own side!

147
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,030
Xiao Bao hurt his right leg, right?

148
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,310
Today, I'll also destroy your right leg!

149
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,180
- No, I--
- Stop right there!

150
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,190
- Nan Xiang, let me explain!
- Let me through!

151
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,520
Stop right there!

152
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,490
It's fine, it's fine.

153
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,990
Xiao Bao...recover well.

154
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,160
Old Six, take care of him.

155
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,220
Yes, Chief. No problem.

156
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,420
[Mei Manor]

157
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,500
Those damn bandits!

158
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll let them have death by a thousand cuts!

159
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,920
Siheng, what did the doctor say?

160
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,290
The doctor said...

161
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,420
Say it!

162
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,720
The doctor said...there is little hope for Young Master's eyes.

163
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,390
This quack!

164
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,990
Who diagnosed him? Bring him to me immediately!

165
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,450
Lord, calm down. You don't want to harm your health from anger.

166
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,120
Shiqing, seriously.

167
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,970
Your marriage is priority, so why would go around fighting bandits?

168
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,180
If the Princess sees your current condition, she definitely won't want to marry you!

169
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,530
Since I have turned out like this, I'm afraid I'm not a good match for the Princess.

170
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,630
I ask of you to clarify the situation to the Ninth Prince Manor and withdraw from the marriage early on.

171
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:53,200
This is a marriage conferred by the Emperor!

172
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,660
How could I allow you to take hundreds of Mei family lives as a joke?

173
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,790
I told you to go take the imperial examination, yet you took the military exam!

174
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,090
I told you to marry the Princess,

175
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,110
yet you-- you're blind.

176
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,090
Fine, are you trying to anger me to death?

177
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,690
Lord, first and foremost, Shiqing is injured.

178
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,370
Second of all, he never wanted to unite with the Ninth Prince Manor through marriage in the first place.

179
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,990
As I see it, how about...

180
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,160
betrothing the Princess to Shiyuan?

181
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,200
Yeah, dad. Betroth her to me.

182
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,760
Shut up!

183
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,730
As someone who roams bawdy houses and gambling houses all day, how shameless are you to marry the Princess?

184
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,890
Dad, at least I can see the Princess.

185
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,090
- Not like-- 
- This is a bestowed marriage, how could you be allowed to mess around?

186
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,120
If Shiming were still here,

187
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,430
this wouldn't be left to you two good-for-nothings!

188
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,320
If big brother were still here,

189
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,270
He'll just one of your chess pieces to be used by you.

190
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,460
Fine, I see you dare to lecture your father now!

191
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,770
Bring out the family discipline!

192
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,060
Lord!

193
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,290
Lord Shiqing didn't mean that.

194
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,770
- Today is madam's anniversary!
- Quiet!

195
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,930
The marriage is soon, what would the Princess say if Master was injured!

196
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,930
I will take the punishment in his place!

197
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,100
Mei Shiqing, this is a marriage bestowed upon by the Emperor.

198
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,890
Regardless of if she's a good match or not, you have to marry her anyways!

199
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:53,160
You're but a blind person. I'll see how long you can be arrogant for.

200
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,290
[Ninth Prince Manor]

201
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,230
Have a seat, father.

202
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,960
Okay.

203
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,090
- Does this feel good? 
- Yes.

204
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,860
Daughter, take a look around your home.

205
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,660
It is nothing fancy.

206
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,150
The house is empty and all that's left is the empty title of "Imperial".

207
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,530
Daddy, I heard you pleaded the Emperor for the marriage.

208
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,310
Then, can you also ask him to cancel it?

209
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:35,500
Don't say that!

210
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,290
This is a marriage appointed by the Emperor.

211
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,770
Refusing the marriage would be refusing his order! You must marry him.

212
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,940
Father.

213
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,760
Qingzhou General Mei's Third Young Master Mei Shiqing.

214
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,430
He's a talented youth known far and wide.

215
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:55,630
If you marry him, it's a match made in heaven.

216
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,760
Daddy, Qingzhou is far and rural and the Mei family are military commanders.

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,130
Are you really just going to marry your daughter off like this?

218
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,970
I--

219
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,040
Daddy, I think their wealth

220
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,370
and military power has caught your eye.

221
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,330
Imperial sons and daughters...

222
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,600
have never been able to decide on who they marry.

223
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,230
You must be married.

224
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,810
Xiao yun. Attend the princess, get ready to be married.

225
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,900
Yes.

226
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,000
Daddy!

227
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,800
Father!

228
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,030
Princess, get up now.

229
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,640
I've already told you you've tried this too many times, it won't work.

230
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,400
Didn't the emperor already say?

231
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,760
The Mei family's Third Young Master is a talented youth known far and wide.

232
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,000
Perhaps, this might even be a good marriage.

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,490
What talented youth?

234
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,380
I've never even seen him.

235
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,460
What if he's really ugly?

236
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,170
What if he's a drooling idiot?

237
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,630
How about this? I'll run away from home.

238
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,180
At all costs, no! This is a bestowed marriage.

239
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,110
If you run away, this whole manor--

240
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,390
Will be implicated for nine generations, miss.

241
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,820
Miss! Miss!

242
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,930
We didn't make a single cent, what do we do about dinner?

243
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,480
Think about it this way, how energizing was it to teach those people a lesson today!

244
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,140
Energizing? Regardless, I'm out of energy now.

245
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,510
Look here, there's a baozi booth up ahead. Let's hurry a few steps

246
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,520
and I'll buy you two big meat buns, okay?

247
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,270
Sound good? Let's hurry.

248
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,830
One step, two steps.

249
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,080
- One step, two steps.
- One step, two steps.

250
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,780
What's that smell?

251
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,610
- What's wrong, Wanzi? 
- What's that smell?

252
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,100
What's that smell? It smells so good.

253
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,280
Wanzi, this is Qingzhou's most famous Ruyi Restaurant.

254
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,920
Their menu includes sweet and sour ribs,

255
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,120
sweet and sour fish, braised ribs...

256
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,150
Stop thinking about it, Wanzi. This isn't the place for poor folks like us to eat at.

257
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,950
Have a safe trip!

258
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,130
Father, so this is the legendary Ruyi Restaurant.

259
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,220
Wait, wait for me.

260
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,990
I'll just smell the fragrance.

261
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,530
I'll just smell the fragrance and be satisfied.

262
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,160
[Ruyi Restaurant]

263
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,830
That's enough.

264
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,000
Wanzi, put it down. Okay,

265
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,690
your father will end your meatless diet once today.

266
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,010
We won't eat much, just one of their dishes.

267
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,230
Sweet and sour ribs, okay?

268
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,950
Okay, let's go!

269
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,640
Dad, these sweet and sour pork ribs really live up to their name.

270
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,950
Daughter, my wine is also delicious.

271
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,210
Let me have a cup as well. Here, Dad.

272
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,900
Don't drink too much. Your face is already bright red.

273
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,080
This is makeup!

274
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,380
Lady A'Rou!

275
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,720
She really deserves her reputation. So beautiful...

276
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:54,440
Say, do you think that I could be like Lady A'Rou one day?

277
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,530
You should drink less, Daughter.

278
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,480
Young Master, here is your meal.

279
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,960
Don't disturb us if there is nothing else.

280
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Understood.

281
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,540
Young Master, don't be too upset.

282
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,220
The General still values you a lot.

283
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,820
For this marriage, he put in a lot of effort.

284
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,700
The hidden dangers of the Green Dragon Fort have not been eliminated yet.

285
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,330
How could I have the time to think about these things?

286
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,070
Besides, my father

287
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:00,120
abandoned my mother and I for merits in the war ten years ago.

288
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,610
Today, even if my leg broke,

289
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,400
he would still force me to marry

290
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,790
to gain more power for him and the Mei Family.

291
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,190
Where is A'Rou? 
 She's performing downstairs. She'll come up soon.

292
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,290
Young Master, what happened to your eyes?

293
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,470
Young Master and I went to catch the bandits of the Green Dragon Fort,

294
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,200
but we fell into their trap, so his eyes...

295
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,050
Third Young Master, you brought me, a performer who was looked down on by others,

296
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,690
into the Ruyi Restaurant. You not only allowed me to sing and dance,

297
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:48,430
but also let me manage the Ruyi Restaurant.

298
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,280
I will never forget your kindness to me.

299
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,590
I am willing to always stay by your side and serve you.

300
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,610
I'm not blind. Get up.

301
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,800
Young Master, why do you have to pretend to be blind?

302
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,710
Could it be to escape from your marriage?

303
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,720
My actions today are a military secret.

304
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,180
I didn't expect the Green Dragon Fort to actually set a trap to frame me.

305
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,690
A mole most likely leaked the information to them.

306
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,870
Thus, I'm playing along

307
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,170
to appear weak so that I can secretly catch the mole.

308
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,940
The Mei Manor has always been strictly managed.

309
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,480
To think that such things would happen.

310
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,800
How is your progress on the matter I asked you to investigate?

311
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,710
I found a location where private salt is hidden.

312
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,410
Ever since Li Tianlong's group collapsed,

313
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,660
there hasn't been salt smuggling

314
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,730
in Qingzhou City for decades.

315
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,250
Looking at the current situation, this salt smuggling

316
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,850
is a sign of resurgence.

317
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:54,330
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

318
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,890
What's going on? 
 I'll go check.

319
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,180
Good! Good! Good!

320
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,270
Amazing!

321
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,280
Thank you! Thank you, everyone!

322
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,540
If you add one more tael of silver right now,

323
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,260
we'll perform one more time!

324
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,950
Good! Good! Good!

325
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,810
It's fine, Young Master. It's just a little girl who drank too much. A bunch of people are watching her perform.

326
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,620
I didn't expect there to be a hidden talent in our Ruyi Restaurant.

327
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,250
We need to be careful.

328
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,720
Young Master is worried. I'll go with Siheng and take a look.

329
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,190
Where is the delicious food?

330
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,350
The smell of sweet and sour pork ribs?

331
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,790
Who is it?

332
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,710
So you're over here.

333
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,550
Who are you? Get out.

334
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,650
Are you blind?

335
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,290
You look really familiar.

336
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,590
Do we know each other?

337
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,960
But how can you eat if you're blind?

338
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,660
Since we know each other, I'll take care of you.

339
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,300
I'll feed you.

340
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,130
Siheng!

341
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,810
Siheng!

342
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,580
Open your mouth.

343
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,870
Don't you want to eat?

344
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:40,050
So strong!

345
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,400
Open your mouth.

346
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,160
Why is she this strong?

347
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,040
Why aren't you eating?

348
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,500
Such a strong wine smell!

349
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,760
Are you that...

350
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,700
that young General Mei?

351
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,340
The young General Mei?

352
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,790
The beggar?

353
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,450
You ungrateful person!

354
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,050
I obviously saved you, but you're still mean to me?

355
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,060
Fine, I don't care if you were mean,

356
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,030
but you also teased me!

357
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,020
I'll let you know

358
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,330
what is

359
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:23,320
Xiao Wanzi's rage!

360
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,880
Impudent! Pull her away!

361
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,210
Hurry and leave!

362
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,250
Roar!

363
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,190
Roar!

364
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,790
Young Master, are you alright?

365
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,000
A'Rou, don't let this crazy women appear in Ruyi Restaurant in the future!

366
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,410
Understood, Young Master.

367
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,690
Lunatic.

368
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,900
Go away!

369
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,880
Are you okay, Wanzi?

370
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,150
How could you push someone?

371
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,800
Look, you two.

372
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,790
If you don't have money, don't come to Ruyi Restaurant to eat.

373
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,890
We aren't some charity organization.

374
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,750
Let's go! 
 So what if we come? What're you going to do?

375
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,540
We'll just come to your restaurant every day to smell the food!

376
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,800
Right? We'll just come to their restaurant every day to smell the food!

377
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,190
You okay, Wanzi?

378
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,280
Let's go!

379
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,530
Bye bye. 
 Let's go home.

380
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,690
Sweet and sour ribs are delicious.

381
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,080
Daughter, you enjoyed yourself.

382
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,250
Tonight, we have to sleep on the street again. 
 Delicious.

383
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,520
Night-Spirited Hero! Night-Spirited Hero!

384
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,770
What? What's up? Wanzi!

385
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,250
Night-Spirited Hero! Night-Spirited Hero!

386
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,790
Wait for me! Me!

387
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:52,350
Don't move!

388
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,470
Night-Spirited Hero!

389
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,810
Night-Spirited Hero!

390
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,450
Night-Spirited Hero!

391
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,990
Teach me how to fly!

392
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,950
Luckily, she's not here.

393
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,800
It actually is you.

394
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,650
I really like you.

395
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,100
I actually... really like you.

396
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,380
Can you bring me with you in the future?

397
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,030
Let's fight evil together.

398
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,570
We're a match made in heaven.

399
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,780
Damn it.

400
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,620
Wanzi! Wanzi!

401
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,840
Dad, the Night-Spirited Hero is here.

402
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,150
Wanzi, where did you go?

403
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,100
Where's the Night-Spirited Hero?

404
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,120
What do you have on your mind all day?

405
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,700
Let's go!

406
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,600
Big! Big! Open!

407
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,140
Dad. I'm really hungry.

408
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,830
I want to eat west lake vinegar fish and sweet and sour ribs.

409
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,880
Wait a second, daughter. This round is all set for me.

410
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,790
Still big. Big! Big! Big!

411
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:32,890
They must have been cheating at big. Your dad is aware of it okay?

412
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,130
He Yizhi, you've lost everything again.

413
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,940
When are you going to pay back all the money you owe?

414
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,750
That's right! I'll go get you the money.

415
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,210
- Trying to run away, huh?
- No, no.

416
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,760
You stinky old man, you can't pay back the money.

417
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,950
But your daughter, looks like you. Eh?

418
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,230
- What are you trying to say?
- She'll sell for some money.

419
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,800
- No, no, no. 
- Father, save me!

420
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,940
I, He Yizhi, will pay back the money I owe by myself.

421
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,910
This has nothing to do with my daughter. All right, Brother Feng?

422
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,300
Are you able to take the responsibility?

423
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,150
Just wait until I'm full and energized,

424
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,240
I'll beat you up!

425
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,040
- Wanzi! 
 - So noisy.

426
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,140
- Shut her mouth and take her away. 
- Hey!

427
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,230
Father, save me!

428
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,430
Didn't capture Mei Shiqing.

429
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,880
It's all your fault! If it weren't for you, would I end up like this?

430
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,300
Would you have been able to beat Mei Shiqing if it wasn't for my powder blinding him?

431
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:38,680
- You're disgusting! You bastard! 
- Move away.

432
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Xiao Bao.

433
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,250
Drink the medicine.

434
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,590
Nan Xiang, I beg you, let me go.

435
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,760
Xiao Bao, this medicine has to be drunk while warm. I can carry you!

436
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,850
Don't run! Let me feed you you. Brother Bao!

437
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,010
Wait for me! Don't run!

438
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,350
You're the Second Master of our fortress.

439
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,150
We cannot let him benefit.

440
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,470
Nan Xiang likes him.

441
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,960
I have good news that I'm not sure if I should say.

442
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,470
What news?

443
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,800
Wedding?

444
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,720
Paradise Casino people told me that.

445
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,770
There's an old man. Owes lots of money.

446
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,910
He has a daughter who has a "Boulder-Shattering Chest".

447
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,310
Her figure is awesome.

448
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:35,340
Can give birth to a whole bunch of kids. I think.

449
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,270
She suits Xiao Bao especially well.

450
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,630
What do you mean a whole bunch of kids? Is she a sow?

451
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,340
Hey Wu. I know you like the type.

452
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,040
- Wishing lots of kids for you.
- I mean you.

453
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,070
Xiao Bao. We are talking about getting you a wife.

454
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,850
Your injury is almost fixed now.

455
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,050
Why am I marrying Godfather?

456
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,010
I'm still young. I'm not in a rush.

457
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,590
I feel Wu makes sense.

458
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:04,230
Then... Then you've got to find me a good girl.

459
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,320
I already mentioned. Said that "Boulder-Shattering Chest" girl...

460
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,150
I don't want a shrew.

461
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,790
You need to find someone to handle your bad temper.

462
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,200
Firstly...

463
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,970
I will help us reverse our fortunes.

464
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,860
Secondly, it will give you a heir.

465
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,580
- Godfather... 
 - Get out!

466
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,780
Are you the chief or am I the chief?

467
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,330
Thanks, brother.

468
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,200
Hey, Xiao Bao!

469
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,890
I know you don't like bitter things

470
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,370
so I prepared sweet fruits.

471
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,640
- Try it. 
- I'm not eating. Stop bothering me.

472
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,950
What's wrong? Just eat one.

473
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,790
Eat one.

474
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,330
Let them feed on these.

475
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,420
Xiao Bao! Where are you going? Wait for me!

476
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,310
Looks like this daughter of mine

477
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,090
really likes Xiao Bao.

478
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,640
You say. This brat.

479
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,540
Keeps ignoring Nan Xiang.

480
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,610
Don't think my daughter is good enough?

481
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,130
Then I'll find him a "Boulder-Shattering Chest" girl.

482
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:26,040
Find an auspicious day. Bring her up the mountain.

483
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,880
I've already worked it out.

484
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,020
It'll be a rare super auspicious day in 3 days time.

485
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,990
You're really capable kid.

486
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,890
Then let's do it in 3 days time.

487
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,070
The Green Dragon Fort will have a celebration.

488
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,970
Master, I'll get people on it right away.

489
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,370
Why don't they feed us.

490
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,560
Might as well kill me.

491
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,110
What are they going to do with me?

492
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,580
Don't think too much.

493
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,860
We will work out the situation...

494
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,540
as it happens.

495
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,730
Hey. They're bringing food.

496
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,240
Brother Feng. Brother Feng.  Brother Feng.

497
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,780
- Brother Feng 
- Food

498
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,510
How are the two of you doing these few days?

499
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,360
No good.

500
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,370
You should at least feed us and let us bathe.

501
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:30,100
That bun you gave us was so small. Left us hungry.

502
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,970
- Give us more food. Okay?
- You are so strong.

503
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,660
Won't you run away if we gave you food?

504
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,570
Brother Feng. We won't run.

505
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:42,060
But don't worry. In a bit, I will take you to go get a good bath.

506
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,600
Bath?

507
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,910
Great...a bath?

508
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,770
- Bath? 
- Wait,

509
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,580
th-this, what does this mean?

510
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,260
Have you heard of Green Dragon Fort?

511
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,110
The chief's godson, Master Xiao Bao, is interested in daughter.

512
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,770
Hey Brother Feng. That's not possible.

513
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:01,170
My daughter is a maiden, how could she enter the bandit's den?

514
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,960
This is not up to you.

515
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,660
- Father! 
- Wanzi!

516
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,680
Father!

517
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,450
I advise you to be smart.

518
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,140
Your daughter marrying Master Xiao Bao

519
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,870
is her dumb luck.

520
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,340
Moreover, no matter how strong you are.

521
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,040
When you get there, you will not be able to escape the mountain.

522
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,740
I dare you to harm my Wanzi!

523
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,800
I'll beat you at any cost!

524
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,110
Father! Stop hitting my father! Stop hitting him!

525
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,640
I'll marry! I'll marry!

00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,150
â™« The most beautiful scenery of this life â™«

532
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,150
â™« is the clouds passing through the moonlight â™«

533
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:43,230
â™« Twisting and turning, I've fallen into your palm â™«

534
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,900
â™« The moon is covered; the moon is spotted â™«

535
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,760
â™« My treasured memories â™«

536

538
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,220
â™« It's me missing you â™«

539
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,190

540
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:30,210
â™« The night awakens us with the silver moonlight â™«

541
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:37,580

542
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,940

543
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:52,140
â™« What a pity to not meet in all this time â™«

544
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,980
â™« The moon is covered; the moon is spotted â™«

545

â™« My treasured memories â™«

546
