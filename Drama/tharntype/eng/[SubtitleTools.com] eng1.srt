00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,560
<i>My life as a university freshman</i>
<i>begins here.</i>

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>And everything is better than expected,</i>

3
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,880
<i>because even though my dearest dad</i>
<i>forced me to live on campus,</i>

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,800
<i>at least I still have</i>
<i>my friends, my peers…</i>

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,640
<i>and even a roommate…</i>

6
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,720
<i>who's perfectly handsome</i>
<i>and so goddamn nice.</i>

7
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,760
<i>I bet he and I can help each other</i>
<i>get laid within the first year.</i>

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
<i>And did I mention…</i>

9
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,720
<i>I…</i>

10
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,280
<i>hated gay people…</i>

11
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,280
<i>until…</i>

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
Type!

13
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,920
What the hell? You're so noisy.

14
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,160
Did you know?

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
Know what?

16
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,160
Your roommate…

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
is gay!

18
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
What did you say?

19
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Type.

20
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,280
When did you get back?

21
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,880
Have you eaten yet? I have some snacks.

22
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,640
Tharn, I have something to ask you.

23
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,320
What is it?
And why do you look so serious?

24
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
Are you gay?

25
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,480
Well?

26
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,440
Yes.

27
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,920
Then, I have to be honest.
I hate gay people.

28
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,720
-So, what do you want me to do?
-One of us has to move out.

29
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you disgusted just because I'm gay?

30
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,440
Yeah, that's right.

31
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,680
And how does me being gay…

32
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,960
have anything to do with you?

33
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,680
It doesn't,
but I won't live with a gay person.

34
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,760
Then, move out.

35
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Because I'm not the one with a problem.
You are.

36
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,880
Tharn, I'll say it one more time.

37
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,600
I hate gay people
with every fiber of my being.

38
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,640
If I had known you were gay,
I wouldn't have come near you.

39
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,040
You filthy perv!

40
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,040
That's none of my business.

41
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,160
Because I'll never move out.

42
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,800
Even if I have to live
with a narrow-minded jerk like you.

43
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
You must leave!

44
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't know what kind of assholes
you've been around before…

45
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
but even if you can get rid of me,
you won't be able to live in this society

46
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,280
if you still judge people
with that ridiculous logic.

47
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,560
Remember that!

48
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,680
What are you doing?

49
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Congratulations.

50
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
You have to live with this gay man…

51
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,280
for a year.

52
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
Fine.

53
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,160
I want to switch rooms.

54
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,680
No can do.
All the rooms are jam-packed this year.

55
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,680
Do you realize how lucky you are
to even get a room?

56
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,400
The upperclassmen moved off campus
so that the freshmen could live here.

57
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,720
I'll do anything.

58
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,440
Isn't there anyone who wants
to switch rooms, Auntie?

59
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,520
Everyone switches rooms by themselves.
They don't come here to complain.

60
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,360
But this is the Dormitory Office, Auntie.

61
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,520
If there really is a problem,
I can arrange the change.

62
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,560
I have a problem with my roommate.

63
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,480
What is it? It has to be really serious
or I can't help.

64
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,680
My roommate is…

65
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,960
Never mind, Auntie.
I really can't live with him.

66
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,080
Call me "Auntie" one more time,
and I won't help.

67
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,280
Sorry, sis.

68
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,280
You can't switch rooms without a reason,

69
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,280
and I don't accept petty reasons,
like not helping with cleaning.

70
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,520
It's your responsibility to handle things
with your roommate.

71
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,720
What should I do?

72
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,320
Find someone to switch rooms with you
and come here.

73
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,960
Sis will do the rest.

74
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay, Auntie.

75
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
You brat!

76
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,160
Hi, Techno, are you free this evening?

77
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Free or not, you have no choice,
you have to help me.

78
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,320
Type, do you really want to move out?

79
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,880
I already told you I do.

80
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,080
Type.

81
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,000
Honestly, who would want
to switch rooms with you?

82
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,320
Everyone must be close
to their roommates by now.

83
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,240
I don't know, but I'm gonna find one.

84
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,760
Why are you so stubborn?

85
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,880
-Hello, my friend wants to--
-I want to switch rooms with you.

86
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I'd rather not.

87
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
He didn't even listen.

88
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,200
Techno.

89
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
Let's check other rooms.

90
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
Okay, let's go.

91
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,680
You wouldn't survive a night
if you switched to this room. Damn!

92
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,600
Let's check other rooms.
There are still more.

93
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,640
Can you switch rooms?

94
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,680
-With who?
-My friend here.

95
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,160
Not a chance.

96
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,840
Everyone's turned you down
because of that look on your face.

97
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,480
Wait a minute.

98
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,840
Calm down.

99
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,560
Over there.

100
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,760
The last room on this floor.

101
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
Besides…

102
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,000
it's right next to your room.

103
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,880
What are you gonna do?

104
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,280
Fine.

105
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,360
What's wrong with you?

106
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
What's up?

107
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
-Khlui, Type wants to--
-Wait a sec.

108
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,880
Seo Duang, quiet down.

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,960
Khlui, can you switch rooms with me?

110
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
What's going on?

111
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,440
Come on, please switch rooms with me.

112
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,560
Nah, my roommate is pretty decent.

113
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Hey.

114
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,800
I guess.

115
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,840
Okay.

116
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,920
Khlui, is your roommate Korean?

117
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm beginning to have my doubts.

118
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,440
Not sure if he's Korean
or just plain crazy.

119
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,880
Okay. I'd better go.

120
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,200
What the hell?

121
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,880
He gave me a murderous look
just because I said no?

122
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Why?

123
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,320
Why did he come?

124
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,000
Stop speaking Korean. I don't understand.

125
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,840
You have to move out.

126
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
I won't stand living with you anymore.

127
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,520
Get up and talk to me.

128
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Move out.

129
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,840
No way.

130
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,240
Type!

131
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,480
I won't live with gay people.

132
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,800
Is that clear, you piece of shit?

133
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,640
You have no right to kick me out.

134
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,360
I've done nothing to you.

135
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,800
Not yet, but maybe in the future.

136
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,960
I don't trust people like you.

137
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,560
I bet you screw anybody
who comes your way.

138
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
Do you hate me that much, Type?

139
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
Then, how about I screw you too!

140
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,320
No!

141
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,120
Still falling out of bed at your age?

142
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
What an idiot.

143
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,920
Who did you call an idiot? You…

144
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,600
See you tonight, roomie.

145
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,680
Who's your roomie?

146
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,840
I told you I'm moving out!

147
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,200
Last time, we talked
about Baroque and Classicism.

148
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,400
Today's topic is Romanticism.

149
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,800
Does anybody know
the characteristics of Romanticism?

150
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Okay. Romanticism is the artistic movement
in which characteristics of each composer

151
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,920
-are vividly demonstrated…
-Which page are we on?

152
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,200
…in terms of imagination,
emotion, and musical expression,

153
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,400
which are free of constraints.

154
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,960
It focuses on emotional expression
in music rather than boundaries.

155
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,160
What's wrong?

156
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,120
Nothing.

157
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,080
But your face says otherwise.

158
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,360
Okay, I have a little problem.

159
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,200
Ran into your ex this morning?

160
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,880
No.

161
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,400
Then some guys must've fought over you.

162
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,960
I said no!

163
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,600
The professor will get angry.
Just take notes.

164
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,320
Someone asked you out,
but he turned out to be a muscle bear,

165
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,200
and he asked, "Can I bang you, Tharn?"

166
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,840
Am I right?

167
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,200
Are you having fun?

168
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,520
Stop teasing me.

169
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
It's rare to see you upset.

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,960
Just tell me what's wrong.

171
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,800
I can help.

172
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,080
It's nothing.

173
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,840
If you say so.

174
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
About our new band.

175
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I'm interested in a guitarist.

176
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
He has awesome skills.

177
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,440
Tharn.

178
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,840
What were you saying?

179
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,920
I said I'm interested in a guitarist.

180
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,720
He has awesome skills.

181
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,320
Hey, I'm here.

182
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,560
Judging from the look on your face,
things didn't go well, huh?

183
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,600
No, he won't move out.

184
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,680
Honestly, Type,

185
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,280
why would he want to move out?

186
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,040
He's done nothing wrong.

187
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,000
Just because he's not into girls,
it doesn't mean he's a rapist-murderer.

188
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,440
And he never hassles you.

189
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,280
So why does he have to go?

190
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,000
Because he's gay.

191
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Yes, he's gay.

192
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,160
But he hasn't made a move on you.

193
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,560
-Or has he?
-Quit bullshitting, Techno.

194
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,040
One more word, and I'll shut
your mouth with my foot.

195
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
Almost hit my face.

196
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,960
Just kidding.

197
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
So, what are you gonna do?

198
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,480
What type of roommate
is the most disgusting for you?

199
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,160
Don't tell me you're going to--

200
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Hell yeah!

201
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,680
Man, you're so childish.

202
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,480
Okay, I'll help.

203
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
As your friend, I have no choice.

204
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,240
First of all, someone who disrespects--

205
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,600
Wait a sec.

206
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,280
-Ready.
-Someone who disrespects people's privacy.

207
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,960
That's a no-no.

208
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,240
For example,
you're dead tired from practice.

209
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,400
You return to your room, ready to sleep.

210
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,440
He comes in, switches on the lights,
brings his friends, and blasts some music.

211
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,600
-No manners.
-Correct.

212
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,160
Next, a slob.

213
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,600
For example, he finishes eating
and puts the dishes in the sink.

214
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,120
You have to do the dishes for him.
Think about it. Are you his slave?

215
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,400
More, give me more.

216
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,280
How about this?
Remember when we were in 10th grade?

217
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,760
I know what to do now.

218
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,120
And what is that?

219
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,000
You haven't answered me.

220
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,280
What's gotten into him?

221
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,200
Damn, I shouldn't have told him
Tharn was gay.

222
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,080
They were getting along just fine.

223
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,600
THREE WEEKS EARLIER

224
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,240
Hi, roommate. My name is Tharn.

225
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,600
Hi, I'm Type.

226
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,200
Is this my bed?

227
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,080
By the way, you can eat the snacks.

228
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
That's really nice of you.

229
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,920
Someone gave them to me.
I can't finish them all.

230
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,440
You must be pretty popular.

231
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,440
Who would be interested in me?

232
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,400
If nobody liked you,
there'd be hope left for me.

233
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
If you need any help, just tell me.

234
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,080
We'll be living together for a year,
after all.

235
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,760
Might take you up on that.

236
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,920
THREE WEEKS LATER

237
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,440
<i>The war has begun.</i>

238
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,080
MOVE OUT, GAY MAN!

239
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,320
What the hell is this?

240
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,400
I was going to leave you alone, Type.

241
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,760
But if you want to play a game…

242
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,200
then game on.

243
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,400
Type, you sure you want to use
this plan to get rid of Tharn?

244
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,800
It was your idea, Techno.

245
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,040
My idea, but you didn't have
to follow through with it.

246
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
Messing up his stuff? Really?

247
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,280
Yeah, and if he cleans up,
I'm going to mess it up again.

248
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
Let's see how long he lasts.

249
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
I bet he'd last a long time.

250
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
Wait!

251
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
Type! Calm down, man!

252
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,320
I give up!

253
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,640
Man, it was a joke.

254
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,800
Not funny.

255
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,960
I was just kidding.
Don't be so serious, man.

256
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,000
I WON'T MOVE OUT! BIGOTED JERK!

257
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,160
What the hell happened?

258
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,360
What the hell is this?

259
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,960
I've been looking for this.
So, that's where it went.

260
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,160
This is lube, you asshole!

261
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,720
Yeah.

262
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,320
No one said it was dishwashing liquid.

263
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,880
Damn you, Tharn!

264
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
It's almost empty.

265
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,480
But that's okay.

266
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,440
A filthy perv like me
still has plenty more.

267
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,680
This one is for you.

268
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,640
Think of it as a welcome gift.

269
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,120
I don't want it!

270
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,360
Gifts should be accepted.

271
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,400
What you do with it is up to you.

272
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
And this…

273
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,040
is a bonus.

274
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,000
I WON'T MOVE OUT! BIGOTED JERK!

275
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,120
-Don't mess with me.
-You started it.

276
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,800
Did your parents never teach you
not to touch others' belongings!

277
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,760
So you messed with my stuff as payback?

278
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,480
If you can do it, so can I.

279
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,600
I will make you move out.

280
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,320
You hate me that much?

281
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,800
Fine!

282
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,360
Wait a minute.

283
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,840
What?

284
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,720
-What are you thinking?
-What do you mean?

285
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,960
Are you sure about inviting
Team and Oam to party here?

286
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
I don't care.

287
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,080
Besides, they're already inside.

288
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,920
You want me to kick them out?

289
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,480
Heartless.

290
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
Why are you attacking me?

291
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,480
I'm warning you for your own good.

292
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,280
If Tharn finds out,
he'll be really pissed.

293
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,280
The angrier the better.

294
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,760
Damn, you're a total asshole.

295
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,160
Let's drink. Cheers!

296
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,720
Look at that smug face.

297
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Type, I think your roommate's back.

298
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,800
You're back?

299
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,080
I have my friends over.
We'll be a little noisy.

300
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,640
Since your roommate's back,
we'd better leave. Let's go.

301
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,760
What's the rush? It's not even 8:00 yet.

302
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
My roommate won't mind.

303
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,000
Right?

304
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,200
I don't mind.

305
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,800
The more…

306
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,640
the merrier.

307
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,080
Let me join you.

308
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,720
-No--
-Sure, man.

309
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,120
Go ahead.

310
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,880
Team, mix some booze for Type's roommate.

311
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Sure.

312
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,760
By the way,

313
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
I'm Oam.

314
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,840
Type's high school friend.

315
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,640
And my name is…

316
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
Team.

317
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm…

318
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Techno.

319
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,280
What about you?

320
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,400
I'm Tharn.

321
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
What about you?

322
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,720
What are you doing on my bed?

323
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,120
Your bed?

324
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,200
Type.

325
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,360
You said it was your bed.

326
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,920
Damn, you tricked me.

327
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,440
Tharn, I'm sorry.

328
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,040
I thought it was his bed.

329
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,040
Don't be mad.

330
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,280
I'm not mad at you.

331
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,240
It's no big deal.

332
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,600
You're really nice, just like Type said.

333
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,280
Type complimented me?

334
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,600
-I didn't.
-Quit it, man. You just said it.

335
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,520
What did he say, Team?

336
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,320
He said you're nice,

337
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,560
and very generous.

338
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,760
No matter how much we mess up the room,
you won't mind.

339
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,400
I didn't know…

340
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,400
that you admired me this much.

341
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,840
I'm gonna buy more snacks.

342
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,840
Type.

343
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,960
I'm so thirsty.

344
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,280
I'll go help him carry it.

345
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,520
Hurry back.

346
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm going crazy.

347
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,400
What the hell is wrong with you?

348
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm stressed, man, very stressed.

349
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,920
Damn, I thought I was in the middle
of World War II.

350
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
It's driving me crazy.

351
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Auntie?

352
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,880
The guys next door are so noisy.

353
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,720
They argue every day.

354
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,520
I don't know anything about that.

355
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
But will you stop calling me "Auntie"?

356
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,840
Come on, Auntie. I'm worried about them.

357
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,040
And I want to know
what they're fighting about.

358
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,840
Such a busybody.

359
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,120
I'm curious.

360
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,440
Hey, what are you doing here?

361
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,160
You want to go up together?

362
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,840
-Hello.
-Hi.

363
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,400
Seo, can you speak Thai?
I don't understand.

364
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,840
I asked what you were doing here.

365
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
Do you want to go back up together?

366
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640
No, you go first.
I'm still talking to Auntie.

367
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,440
Auntie, my ass.

368
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,640
Okay.

369
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,080
-See you later, Auntie.
-You!

370
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,760
I love you!

371
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,240
I'm really curious, Auntie.

372
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
They're at it again.

373
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
What's going on?

374
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,760
You're such a busybody.

375
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,800
Type, we need to talk.

376
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,600
You're so immature.

377
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,920
Do you actually think…

378
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,160
that you can get rid of me
with your childish plan?

379
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,280
If my plan wasn't working,
you wouldn't be here, picking a fight.

380
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:30,000
Do you seriously think I'll give up
just because you have your friends over?

381
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
Looks that way to me.

382
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,280
I should've told them you're gay.

383
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm dying to see their reactions.

384
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,560
Go ahead.

385
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,680
I'm dying to see their reactions…

386
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:52,800
when they find out you've been living
with a gay man all this time.

387
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm not gay! I'm not like you,
and I'll never be like you!

388
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,920
But don't forget.

389
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,400
You're living with a gay man.

390
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,720
And…

391
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Son of a bitch!

392
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,240
If you stay around me,
you'll get infected with gay virus.

393
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,120
If you do that one more time,
I'll beat you to death!

394
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,520
Didn't you say I screwed around?

395
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,200
Then, there's nothing wrong…

396
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,280
with screwing you too.

397
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,040
Damn you, Tharn!

398
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,880
Stop right now! What's going on?

399
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,320
Nothing, Auntie.

400
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,240
We're just saying hello…

401
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,520
as friends.

402
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,680
What are they fighting about?

403
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,360
Korean ghost!

404
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,000
Korean, my ass. I'm Thai.

405
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,000
You really scared me.
When did you get here?

406
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,400
Just now.

407
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,600
Damn you! They're gone!

408
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,720
I'm here to get you.

409
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,760
You didn't return to the room.

410
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,040
Come on, it's getting late.

411
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,840
Let's talk to Auntie tomorrow.

412
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,480
Okay.

413
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,280
This is awesome.

414
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,920
It's definitely your "type," Type.

415
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,200
No wonder you like fair-skinned chicks.

416
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,520
Superb.

417
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,760
Oh, my God!

418
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,920
Type.

419
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,040
Your roommate's back.

420
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,040
Should we ask for his permission?

421
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
What for?

422
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,880
I play clips, you just watch.

423
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,160
My roommate is a nice guy.

424
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,560
No matter what I do, he'll never move out.

425
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,520
Since when have you been a jerk?

426
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,760
Let me tell you something.

427
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,240
Empathy is key
when living with other people.

428
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,520
That's rich coming from the prick
who used someone else's bed.

429
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,200
On second thought,

430
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,920
this stuff is not that good.

431
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,360
Tharn, come watch with us.

432
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,560
-Let me see.
-Don't bother. He's not interested.

433
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,400
Who says I'm not interested?

434
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,600
-Because you're--
-I'm what?

435
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,400
-Play it already. Stop spacing out.
-All right.

436
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,560
Let me switch to full screen first.

437
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,920
Damn.

438
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,160
Type.

439
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,400
I really can't get it up with your stuff.

440
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,680
This is not great at all.

441
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,680
-Do you want to watch mine?
-No way!

442
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
But we're interested.

443
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,120
My skin crawls just thinking about it.

444
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,400
Why?

445
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,440
What do you mean by that?

446
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,000
Tharn.

447
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
Are you into some hardcore stuff?

448
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,160
Damn!

449
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,120
Looks can be deceiving.

450
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,840
Try it and you'll be hooked.

451
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,280
Let me play it for you.

452
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,360
Are you bi?

453
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,800
No, I don't like women.

454
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,520
So you trick people into thinking
you're straight with this video.

455
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,360
To be honest,

456
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,880
I don't care about the video.

457
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,000
All I care about
is the person watching it.

458
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,080
What the hell are you saying?

459
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,360
Don't try my patience again.
It's wearing thin.

460
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,240
-Screw you!
-You two!

461
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,080
Go drink if you have nothing to do.

462
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,880
You're so noisy.
We're getting to the best part.

463
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,440
Look, things are heating up.

464
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,760
Damn! Look at her huge boobs!

465
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,600
-This one is yours.
-Thanks a lot for this, man.

466
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,200
See you. Techno, hurry up and go home!

467
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,320
-Safe trip.
-Yeah.

468
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,240
Type, wake up.

469
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,960
Do you know whose bed you're sleeping on?

470
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,600
Come on, wake up.

471
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm gonna sleep.

472
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,240
Type!

473
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,840
You know exactly where you are.

474
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,960
Damn it.

475
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680
But you still got yourself drunk.

476
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,680
I wouldn't be surprised if you get raped.

477
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
Hey.

478
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,880
Type, come on, get up.

479
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,840
He told you, right?

480
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,160
Wake up. Come on.

481
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,600
You need to wake up right now. Type.

482
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,360
You know, don't you?

483
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,160
Know? Know what?

484
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
I don't know anything.

485
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,080
-About us partying here?
-About me being gay.

486
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,520
So, you know, then.

487
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,600
What else did he tell you?

488
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,880
He told me a little bit.

489
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,760
He's always hated gay people.

490
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,680
But I don't know why.

491
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,920
Ever since I met him…

492
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,000
he's always said he hated gay people.

493
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,280
When we were in high school,

494
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,960
some classmates even teased him
about being molested by gay people.

495
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
And do you know what happened?

496
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,440
He beat them to a pulp.

497
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,080
It was so funny.

498
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,960
But I'm not anti-gay or anything.

499
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,160
I have lots of gay friends.

500
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,520
Most are very feminine.

501
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,240
But… you…

502
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,320
I've never known one like you before.

503
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,520
Tharn.

504
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,320
I want to apologize on Type's behalf.

505
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,000
Okay?

506
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,680
He's not a bad guy.

507
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,320
Please, understand him.

508
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,720
Tharn.

509
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,840
Can you do me a favor?

510
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
What is it?

511
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,240
Can you move out of this room?

512
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,720
Please?

513
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,600
Please, do it for my sake.

514
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,880
All this stress is turning me gray.

515
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,960
Please.

516
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,200
I can't.

517
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
I've done nothing wrong.

518
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
Why do I have to go?

519
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,440
So you won't have to put up with him.

520
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
I don't know…

521
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,880
where your friend's gotten this attitude…

522
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,240
but if I move out…

523
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,440
it will mean I believe
my sexual orientation is wrong.

524
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,440
And I don't think I'm wrong.

525
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,800
So I'm not moving out.

526
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,080
Suit yourself.
If you want to put up with his silliness…

527
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,760
I never would have thought
a smart guy like him

528
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,600
could be silly enough
to play this mind game with you.

529
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,200
Get up.

530
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,280
Man, he's heavy.

531
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:19,400
Help me, so I can get him out of your bed.

532
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,240
Leave him be.

533
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,280
Why?

534
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

535
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,240
Don't tell me…

536
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,120
Don't worry.

537
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,360
I don't do drunk people.

538
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,840
You sure?

539
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,120
Just go home.

540
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,360
It's almost 11:00.

541
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,240
Shit! What am I gonna do?

542
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,240
Damn, the dorm security officer
is strict, too.

543
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Okay, I'm leaving.

544
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,000
But…

545
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,880
you wouldn't really
do anything to him, right?

546
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,320
Just…

547
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,640
go easy on him.

548
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,160
He has class tomorrow.

549
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,280
Hickeys are hard to get rid of.

550
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,320
Why am I so attracted to you, Type?

551
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,200
You must really hate me.

552
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,640
You started this.

553
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,000
Do you realize…

554
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,760
you're just like…

555
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,840
a child.

556
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,640
But when you're awake…

557
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,320
you're nothing but a brat.

558
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,440
I want to see you…

559
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,120
when you wake up…

560
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,320
and find out you've been sleeping
next to me all night.

561
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,600
How crazy are you going to be?

562
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,080
Sweet dreams.

563
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,000
Roomie.

564
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,760
{\an8}In case you're hungry, lick the bed.

565
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,320
{\an8}Don't insult my dad!

566
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,200
{\an8}Who took care of me?

567
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,480
{\an8}You don't want it to be me, right?
