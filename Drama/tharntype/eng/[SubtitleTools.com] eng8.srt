00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,640
THARN'S BIRTHDAY

2
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
Here comes the cake.

3
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,080
I baked it myself.

4
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,640
Thank you, Mom.

5
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Happy birthday, Tharn!

6
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,680
Thank you.

7
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,240
You're 19, but you look older than me.

8
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,400
That's not true, you look much older.

9
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,560
How could Princess say that to me?

10
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,280
Because today is Tharn's birthday.

11
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,960
You never took my side on my birthdays.

12
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,240
Because you're the oldest.
You're really old.

13
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
Look at you.

14
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,880
Tharn, it's your birthday.
Grab the first slice.

15
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,360
Okay.

16
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,760
By the way,
you made chocolate cake again this year?

17
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,960
Yes, I was deciding
between orange and chocolate cake.

18
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,240
But I decided on chocolate cake.

19
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
Because you love rich desserts, right?

20
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Yes, Mom.

21
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,360
I love something dark, like chocolate.

22
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,360
Can you…

23
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,920
save a slice for me, Mom?

24
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,840
I'll give it to my roommate.

25
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,160
Of course, take as many as you want.

26
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,120
Have you finished furnishing your room?

27
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Do you need my help?

28
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
It's okay.

29
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,320
We've just bought a fridge
and a microwave.

30
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,480
But I want to meet your friend.

31
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,800
I'll bring him here if I have a chance.

32
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
Okay.

33
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,080
Eat vegetables too.

34
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,320
Thanks, Mom.

35
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,120
-Good evening, everyone.
-San!

36
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

37
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
-Hi, San.
-Come sit.

38
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
Can you enter my house like normal people?

39
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,600
Hey, Tharn, happy birthday.

40
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,240
Thank you.

41
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,040
You come every year.

42
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,800
I was passing by
and realized it was Tharn's birthday.

43
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,400
So I came to say happy birthday.

44
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,880
You've been using that excuse
for four years, you salad!

45
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,760
My name is Saran, not salad.

46
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,280
Come on, Tharn's like my brother.

47
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,080
This family only has three children.
Who the hell are you?

48
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,560
Do my mom and dad know about this?

49
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,480
Mom, Thorn is driving me away again.

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,240
Thorn, how could you say that?

51
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
San is just being considerate.

52
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
Thank you so much.

53
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,960
You're like a son to me.

54
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
You're welcome at our house anytime.

55
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,040
Thank you.

56
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,920
Here.

57
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,000
Your birthday present.

58
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,240
San,

59
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,640
you don't have to buy presents
for me every year.

60
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
How could you reject my present?

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,240
Thank you.

62
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
I miss the 14-year-old you.

63
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
And…

64
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,280
it would be great
if you stopped talking about the past.

65
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,200
Why?

66
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,760
You were only this tall back then.

67
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,080
But now,

68
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm almost as tall as you.

69
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,960
Of course,
you're not that cute little boy anymore.

70
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Now, there's only the guy
who's almost as handsome as me.

71
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,840
Stop right there, San.

72
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,040
My brother's more handsome than you.

73
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,080
Happy birthday, Tharn.

74
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,440
Thank you, San.

75
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,800
Let's enjoy the meal.
Or should we cut the cake?

76
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
Let's do it.

77
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,080
Cut the cake, birthday boy.

78
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,440
We can finally eat the cake.

79
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,080
That's mine.

80
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
Here I go.

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,240
Type…

82
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,640
I thought you'd bring Tharn with you.

83
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,360
He went home. Today's his birthday.

84
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,520
What? His birthday?

85
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah.

86
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,520
You sure it's a good idea
to be here with us?

87
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,760
He went back home.

88
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
You think I'd follow him home?

89
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,800
Yes.

90
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,640
Use your brain, Techno.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,040
That's not it. How do I put it?

92
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
It's your boyfriend's birthday.

93
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,240
Hold on.

94
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,400
What did you say? Who's got a girlfriend?

95
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,760
-You're hearing things. What girlfriend?
-Yes, you're hearing things.

96
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
-But I heard it too.
-Yeah, me too.

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm too blunt to date someone.

98
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,440
Come to think of it, he's right.

99
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
No one can stand his bluntness.

100
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,640
Yes, no one can stand his bluntness.

101
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,840
Actually, I'm worse than all of you.

102
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Sorry.

103
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,240
Let's eat.

104
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,360
{\an8}HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRO.
MOM AND DAD GAVE YOU A HUGE PRESENT.

105
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,840
{\an8}SO, NOTHING FROM ME.
TAKE CARE OF IT. LOVE YOU.

106
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,400
{\an8}Type, wait a sec.

107
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,800
Is Tharn's family that rich?

108
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
His parents bought him an Audi.

109
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
That car's super expensive.

110
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
He told me his dad owns a small company.

111
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,800
His brother drives a BMW,
so they're probably rich.

112
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,120
I don't think it's a small company.

113
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,320
So, why did he live on campus?

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,600
He said driving wasted his rehearsal time.

115
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,160
Living on campus was more convenient.

116
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,680
Very responsible.

117
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,480
Extremely nice.

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,200
Rich, but not arrogant.
And down to earth too.

119
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,360
That's him.

120
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
You're the luckiest guy ever.

121
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,000
Of course.

122
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,680
How is he lucky?

123
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
Because he has a rich friend.

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,640
You're crazy, Techno.

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,640
Having a rich friend doesn't mean
you can help him spend his money.

126
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,520
I, for one, don't want rich friends.
I hate being compared to them.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,760
I remember Tharn, your roommate.

128
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
Handsome, nice, and he studies music.

129
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,520
Now, he has a nice ride.

130
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,920
But don't you agree
that rich people are arrogant?

131
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,240
Right? I think they're arrogant.

132
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't you feel uncomfortable around him?

133
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,560
No.

134
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,040
And I don't like the way
you talk about him.

135
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
So what if he's rich?

136
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
You act as if it's his fault.

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm friends with him because
of his personality, not his wealth.

138
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,640
Watch your mouth, Team.

139
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,240
Take it easy, Type.
Team's just being his usual chatty self.

140
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
-Don't mind him.
-Yeah.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

142
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,120
Buddy…

143
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,680
Type…

144
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,520
This is because of you.

145
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,080
You and your mouth.

146
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,480
Here, take this burnt meat.

147
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
Stuff it in your face.

148
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
What's up, Techno?

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,560
<i>I was gonna ask you…</i>

150
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,280
<i>What did you get for Tharn's birthday?</i>

151
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,960
Can't you just mind your own business?

152
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,880
<i>No, I wanna know everything about you.</i>

153
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,400
<i>So, what is it?</i>

154
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,960
Don't worry.

155
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,440
I've prepared a present.

156
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,120
Trust me, he's gonna love it.

157
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,840
<i>Type,</i>

158
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,760
<i>I just saw Tharn's brother</i>
<i>tagged him in a photo.</i>

159
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,360
<i>Who's the hot dude standing next to him?</i>

160
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,960
What photo?

161
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,920
<i>The latest one.</i>

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,240
<i>On his Facebook page.</i>

163
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,480
<i>I gotta go.</i>

164
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,520
<i>Gotta go shopping for my mom.</i>

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,400
Doesn't he have only two siblings?

166
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
Who's this guy?

167
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,080
NO BIRTHDAY WISHES?

168
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,040
YOU'RE LUCKY I REMEMBER.

169
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,840
WISH ME A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

170
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,240
What a pain in the ass.

171
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,200
Are you playing mind games with me, Tharn?

172
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,600
<i>Hello?</i>

173
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,920
The hell are you playing at?

174
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
All right!

175
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
Happy birthday.

176
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,160
Happy?

177
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,400
<i>I was only waiting</i>
<i>for your birthday wishes, you know?</i>

178
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,040
You're not here tonight.

179
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,120
The bed's all mine.

180
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,040
Happy birthday, handsome!

181
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,080
Lhong, you're heavy!

182
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,640
And I'm not handsome.

183
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,800
Then why are there people
lining up to give you presents?

184
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,200
People or zombies?

185
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,160
Your birthday present.

186
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,280
Chewing gum?

187
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,000
You're lucky I remembered.

188
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,440
Thanks so much…

189
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
for remembering my birthday every year.

190
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,320
I'd be stupid if I couldn't remember it.

191
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,200
Your brother posted the photos
all over the Facebook.

192
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,720
That senior went
to your birthday party too?

193
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
Yeah.

194
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
He brought me a present.

195
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,440
I guess…

196
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,960
first love is hard to forget, right?

197
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,160
What are you babbling about?

198
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Forget it.

199
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,880
We have full band practice next week.

200
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,480
I've found us a new bassist.

201
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,080
His name's Tae.

202
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
He attended the same
sight-singing class as me, remember?

203
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,640
You probably remember him.

204
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,520
Just tell me the date
and time later, then.

205
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,160
Okay, Mr. Perfect Eyebrows.

206
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,600
I'll tell you one year in advance,
so you can have time to prepare.

207
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,040
Jerk.

208
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Loud and clear.

209
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,040
Just let me be a jerk to you for once.

210
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,360
I heard you moved off campus.

211
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,040
You didn't tell me about it.

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,760
I moved off campus
because there are no curfews.

213
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,760
I can go home whenever I want.

214
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
Good morning, class.

215
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,160
Are you ready for today's lesson?

216
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,280
NO SPRITE. DRINK THIS INSTEAD.
HOPE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR SPIKES.

217
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,280
OPEN THE DRAWER

218
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,560
Birthday present?

219
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,800
Better than I expected.

220
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,840
"No Sprite.

221
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,080
Open the drawer."

222
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,840
Hurry back, Type.

223
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm already dying to use the presents.

224
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Hey.

225
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,040
You're back.

226
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,960
I got back this morning.

227
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,960
So…

228
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,920
Did you buy any food?

229
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,040
I haven't eaten yet.

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,480
I bought a lot.

231
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,440
Chocolate.

232
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Strawberries.

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
Oranges.

234
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,480
Melons.

235
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,080
-Peaches--
-When did you become a herbivore?

236
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,040
Why are there only fruits?

237
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Which flavor do you want?
They're all presents from you.

238
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
Come on.

239
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,600
Just choose one.

240
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,840
Aren't you hungry?

241
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
Hungry for food.

242
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,400
Then how about…

243
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,880
Chocolate?

244
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,280
I won't let you eat me.

245
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,080
Try me.

246
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,880
It's my birthday.

247
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
Your birthday was yesterday.

248
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm kidding.

249
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,440
You're hungry?

250
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,680
Over there.

251
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,560
I brought you a cake from home.

252
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,240
Just grab a bite.

253
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,640
Leftovers from your house?

254
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,480
No.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,720
I really want you to eat it.

256
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,640
Because you wouldn't go
to my birthday party.

257
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,840
Eat it first.

258
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,840
After I finish taking a shower…

259
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,080
I'll find you some food.

260
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,320
You're gonna buy it for me?

261
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,440
What do you want to eat?

262
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,080
I don't know.

263
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,400
How about I take a shower after you
and then we'll go get something to eat?

264
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
Okay.

265
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,000
Tharn, let me borrow your shorts.

266
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,480
Sure, they're in my bag.
Just brought them from home.

267
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,960
HBD - YEARS MAY PASS,
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE IMPORTANT TO ME.

268
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
Who gave him this?

269
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,320
The guy in his brother's photo?

270
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
Nice present.

271
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,680
Did you open it?

272
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,000
It was in the bag.

273
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,560
Since you got such a nice present,

274
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,480
you can throw mine away.

275
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,080
Type…

276
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,120
I love your presents.

277
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,320
Who gave you this?

278
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Jealous?

279
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,160
Asshole! You think I'd be jealous of you?

280
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,360
So you don't want to know
who gave it to me.

281
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,720
Yeah, don't tell me.

282
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,760
When you're out, buy me a chicken noodle.

283
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,800
I don't want to go out anymore.

284
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,360
He's angry.

285
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,320
What's wrong?

286
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,440
What's bothering you again?

287
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,960
-Piss off.
-You asshole.

288
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,240
You look scarier than usual.

289
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,800
How so?

290
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,840
No, it's nothing.

291
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,360
Just forget it.

292
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,360
I wanna ask you something.

293
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,080
Can I tell those two queens…

294
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,040
about your relationship with Tharn?

295
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,640
Calm down!

296
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,080
That's a sharp stick.

297
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,680
-Don't stab me.
-What did you say?

298
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,760
I didn't say anything.
You're just hearing things.

299
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I might have said a little bit.

300
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
I really should stab you.

301
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,400
Okay, just eat.

302
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,640
But you and Tharn are together.

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,040
Are you gonna keep it a secret?

304
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,480
Yeah.

305
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
But…

306
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
don't you feel sorry for Tharn?

307
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,920
Why should I feel sorry for him?

308
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,240
He may not want to tell anyone.

309
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,520
I think he wants to keep it a secret too.

310
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,080
I guess you're right.

311
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
But why are you still upset?

312
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,680
Shouldn't you be crazy in love
with your boyfriend?

313
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,760
In love, my ass!

314
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
I want to put him six feet under.

315
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,480
What is it this time?

316
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Don't tell me it's about his birthday.

317
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,640
I knew it!

318
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,240
I told you to celebrate his birthday,

319
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,480
not hang out with your friends.

320
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,160
I have an idea.

321
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
Let's celebrate his birthday together.

322
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,320
Let me text him.

323
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,680
Tharn. Where's his name?

324
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,800
"Treat me, Tharn."

325
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,160
LET'S THROW A BELATED BIRTHDAY PARTY.
TYPE WILL JOIN US, TOO.

326
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,040
You're forcing him?

327
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,840
Come on, just a little bit.

328
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,480
I haven't seen him for a month.

329
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,040
Besides, you guys can make up.

330
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,280
It's a plus, you know?

331
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,280
SURE, MY CLASS FINISHES AT 4:30.
WHERE DO WE MEET?

332
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,960
It's a deal.

333
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,960
I'll go get my stuff. See you later.

334
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,920
Join us later, okay?

335
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,480
What the hell?

336
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,240
Type, call your boyfriend.

337
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,760
Ask if his class is over.

338
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,920
I told you.

339
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Don't call him my boyfriend.

340
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
Sorry.

341
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,920
Just call Tharn and ask where he is.

342
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,240
Wait, stop calling.

343
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,080
Speak of the devil, there he is.

344
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,480
But who's with him?

345
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,720
A senior from his faculty?

346
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,160
Damn, music faculty
only has good-looking people.

347
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,200
Do they pick students
for their looks or their brains?

348
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,200
What's up? How have you been?

349
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,160
Who's this?

350
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,840
This is San, a senior from my school.

351
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,760
-Hello, San.
-Hello.

352
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
This is Techno.

353
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,040
And this is Type.

354
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,200
My roommate.

355
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,800
Thorn said you lived with a roommate.

356
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,920
Nice to meet you.

357
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,920
By the way, you look familiar.

358
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,760
Tharn took him to his birthday party.

359
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,640
I saw the photo of you on Facebook.

360
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,800
Actually, I am…

361
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,400
Tharn's brother's best friend.

362
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,280
You sure have many titles.

363
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,600
Actually, there are more than that.

364
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,760
You're the senior I respect,
that's what you are.

365
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,760
If you say so.

366
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,400
I'm stopping by
to give Tharn some stuff from Thorn.

367
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,960
I wanted to ask him to dinner,
but I guess I came on the wrong day.

368
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
San, that's okay.

369
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,960
You can come with us.

370
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,840
That's great. I'll treat you.

371
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,960
Lead the way.

372
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,160
You're such a great guy. Come on.
I know a good Southern Thai restaurant.

373
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,920
-Is it far?
-No, this way.

374
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,120
Are you okay?

375
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
I'm fucking fine.

376
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,520
Do you want anything else?

377
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,960
Everything here is delicious.

378
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,600
I often eat here.

379
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
What's their signature dish?

380
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
This one, yellow curry.

381
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,640
Type's favorite dish.

382
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,960
He said his mom makes the best
yellow curry in the whole world.

383
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,120
Even Puifai asked for the recipe.

384
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,080
You came to this place with Puifai?

385
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,760
Puifai?

386
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,160
Is she your girlfriend?

387
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,040
No, she's not.

388
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,960
Did you open the present I gave you?

389
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, but you don't have to buy presents
for me.

390
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,360
I feel bad.

391
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,360
Don't feel bad.

392
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,960
-I've been doing this since we were young.
-But you only bought snacks back then.

393
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,680
I'm an adult now.

394
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,480
I have money to buy you things.

395
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,800
How long have you known each other?

396
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,600
Since he was in seventh grade.
I was friends with his brother.

397
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,280
His brother introduced us.
He was afraid Tharn would be bullied.

398
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,640
He's tall and muscular.
Who would bully him?

399
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,160
Tharn was tiny back then.

400
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,240
Imagine it. He's part American.

401
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,000
He had bright eyes and pale cheeks.

402
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,640
His brother thought he might get bullied,

403
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,480
so he introduced him
to his tenth grade friends,

404
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,200
in case something might happen.

405
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,040
You should stop talking about the past.

406
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,040
I've already forgotten it.

407
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
But I want to know.

408
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,680
Do you have photos?

409
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,400
Yes, I'll send them to you.

410
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,800
Tharn was really cute.

411
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,280
He definitely keeps the photos
to blackmail you.

412
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,800
Type, I ordered you
a shrimp in fish sauce.

413
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,040
It's the most popular dish here.

414
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,520
Looks appetizing,
but it's a pity Tharn can't eat it.

415
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,840
Try it.

416
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,520
It's not that spicy.

417
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,400
Tharn doesn't eat raw or spicy foods.

418
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,160
Unlike his brother, who really
enjoys dancing shrimp salad,

419
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,600
where the shrimps are still alive
in his mouth.

420
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
Is that so?

421
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,920
I didn't know you didn't eat raw food.

422
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,840
It's not that I can't eat it.

423
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,480
But you always spat them out.

424
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,200
San, that's enough.

425
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,360
Did I say something wrong?

426
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,680
Stop toying with us.

427
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,760
I didn't do anything.

428
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,080
I'll be back.

429
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,840
Type…

430
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,840
Damn it!

431
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,560
He should've told me.

432
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
Here you are.

433
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
You okay?

434
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm fine.

435
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,880
What's your relationship with Tharn?

436
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,600
Good.

437
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,840
So you're just his roommate.

438
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,960
Other than being his senior
and his brother's friend,

439
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,920
do you know what else I am?

440
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,720
I was Tharn's first…

441
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,120
and only time.

442
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,240
Type, what's going on with you?

443
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,520
Talk to me.

444
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,880
There's nothing to talk about.

445
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,480
I'm sorry.

446
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,000
I didn't tell you I don't eat sashimi.

447
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,440
Why didn't you tell me?

448
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,840
It's not that I can't eat it at all.

449
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,160
Don't lie to me, Tharn.

450
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
You don't like sashimi, do you?

451
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,360
I don't.

452
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,040
Why didn't you tell me?

453
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,440
I took you to that place
because I thought you liked it too.

454
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,520
Did you have fun pretending
and making a fool out of me?

455
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,280
I wasn't pretending.

456
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,760
You wanted to eat…

457
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,280
and I wanted to make you happy.

458
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,120
I don't want you to make me happy.

459
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,600
So, what do you want me to do?

460
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,440
Be honest.

461
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,240
Tell me what you like and don't like.

462
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,840
Whenever I tell you…

463
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,360
you never listen.

464
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,160
You had the chance to tell me.
Why didn't you?

465
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,840
How could I tell you?

466
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,920
"I hate it. I don't eat it."

467
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,600
Do you know who'd get upset?

468
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
You.

469
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,280
So you're gonna blame it on me.

470
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,920
No.

471
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,080
You're doing it now!

472
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,920
Fine!

473
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,480
I never listen to you.

474
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,160
I never care
about what you like or don't like.

475
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,000
I never care about anything at all.

476
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,840
But I also hate it…

477
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,640
when I have to learn about you
from that guy.

478
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,880
What do you want me to do?

479
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,640
Never meet him again.

480
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,680
Why do I have to do as you say?

481
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,640
Because I hate him.

482
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,120
I don't have to avoid San…

483
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,560
just because you hate him.

484
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,640
San is my brother's friend…

485
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,320
and a senior I respect.

486
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
What did he ever do to you?

487
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,520
You don't need to know what he did to me.

488
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,480
All you need to know is I hate him.

489
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
You don't care…

490
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,560
about my feelings at all.

491
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,840
Tharn!

492
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm warning you. Don't meet him again.

493
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
And what if I don't obey you?

494
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,520
Let's break up, then.

495
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
You hate…

496
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,480
learning about me from San.

497
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,040
But you know what?

498
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,680
San…

499
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,880
understands me more than you do.

500
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,080
Because if he was here…

501
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,720
he'd tell you…

502
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,400
that I…

503
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,840
hate the word "breakup" the most.

504
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,760
God damn it!

505
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
Tharn.

506
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,480
Are you sleeping?

507
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
Turn around and talk to me.

509
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,720
I didn't mean what I said.

510
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I don't want to break up with you.

511
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,440
I spoke without thinking.

512
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,280
You should sleep.

513
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,600
I have class in the morning tomorrow.

514
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm sorry.

515
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,800
Please forgive me.

516
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,280
Lhong.

517
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Come here.

518
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
What's wrong with Tharn?

519
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,440
I don't know.

520
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,960
Sorry, I woke up late.
I came here as fast as I could.

521
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,240
You could've called or texted us.

522
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,240
Tharn, I didn't want to be late.

523
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,360
I stayed up late to transcribe songs.

524
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,400
I came here as fast as I could.

525
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,920
Please don't get mad.

526
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,920
Tharn may not, but I will.

527
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,840
Hurry up.

528
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,880
Okay.

529
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
Can I get mad too?

530
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,360
No.

531
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,480
By the way,

532
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,360
what's up with you?

533
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,760
You seem distracted.

534
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,480
It's nothing.

535
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,200
If you say so.

536
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,200
But if you have a problem,
tell me right away.

537
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,600
Remember,

538
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,360
I'm your friend.

539
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,360
I'll tell you if I have a problem.

540
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,480
I think our band's going to be awesome.

541
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,280
Yeah, awesome.

542
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,960
Can we start practicing now?

543
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,200
Okay.

544
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,680
Have you eaten yet?

545
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
Yes, I have.

546
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
What's this?

547
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,240
My breakfast.

548
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,080
But it'll go bad by morning.

549
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,520
It's for you.

550
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,960
How long are you gonna stay mad at me?

551
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,400
I told you I had a nasty mouth.

552
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,800
It's my fault
for picking a fight with you.

553
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,800
I don't want to break up with you.

554
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,560
Talk to me.

555
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,520
If you don't want to break up,

556
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,600
why did you say it?

557
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,520
I said it without thinking.

558
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,520
What if I say I want
to break up with you too?

559
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,640
Forget it.

560
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,680
You wouldn't suffer
as much as I do, anyway.

561
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,040
If I didn't care,

562
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,040
I wouldn't have apologized.

563
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,800
I wouldn't have bought you dinner.

564
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,760
And I wouldn't have gotten
your shirt fixed.

565
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,160
I'm asking for your forgiveness

566
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,600
because I care…

567
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,360
you crappy boyfriend.

568
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,680
Sorry.

569
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,160
Please forgive me.

570
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,160
Then…

571
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:19,960
from now on…

572
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,040
think about my feelings.

573
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,360
I don't want to hear
the word "breakup" from you.

574
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
I forgive you.

575
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,560
There's also something
you need to apologize to me for.

576
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,120
It's about San.

577
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,920
I told you,

578
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,960
San…

579
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,480
is a senior I respect.

580
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,520
Not only that.

581
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,840
You also slept with him.

582
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,080
How did you know?

583
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,800
So, it's true?

584
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,840
You really had sex with him?

585
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,880
San was my…

586
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,720
first time.

587
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,560
Promiscuous.

588
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,120
That's too harsh.

589
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,960
Tharn…

590
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,560
It's just a hug. Don't get annoyed.

591
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,360
You're such a prude.

592
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,440
I'm not easy like you.

593
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,760
Why are you suddenly interested
in my ex-lovers?

594
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,360
Because your first ex-lover
messed with me.

595
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,400
San?

596
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,320
Stop reminding me that it's him.

597
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,440
So…

598
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,360
do you want to know about me and him?

599
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,440
Look at you.

600
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,360
What did you do this time?

601
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,160
You made me wait all night. Here.

602
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,560
You know I have to wait
until after Princess' bedtime.

603
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,280
Don't change the subject.

604
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,680
Answer my question.

605
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,560
What did you do?

606
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,840
Nothing much.

607
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,520
I bet it's about my brother.

608
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,240
Honestly,

609
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,440
I shouldn't have introduced you to him.

610
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
You've been saying that for five years.

611
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,200
So what?

612
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,200
I'll keep saying it.

613
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,240
What you did was awful.
You slept with my brother.

614
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,640
He was only 14 years old.

615
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,680
Because he was so tiny and really cute.

616
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,760
I was crazy about his innocent look,

617
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,440
so I made a move on him.

618
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,080
San, you didn't make a move.

619
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,240
You sealed the deal.

620
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,440
You knew he wanted to study music.

621
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,040
So you took him to the music room

622
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
and boned him.

623
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:47,240
If you hadn't confessed
and let me punch you,

624
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,760
I wouldn't have stayed friends with you.

625
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,080
That reminds me,

626
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,480
you punched me really hard.

627
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,760
I can still feel it.

628
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,960
Served you right.

629
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,240
That was my intention.

630
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,440
Think about it,

631
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,240
I had to take Thanya to the hospital.

632
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,400
So I asked my good friend
to take care of my brother.

633
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,640
Look what happened.

634
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,080
My friend boned my brother.

635
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,600
Stop being sarcastic.

636
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,640
To be honest,

637
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,480
apart from that,
you've always been nice to him.

638
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,720
You helped him persuade my parents…

639
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,240
to let him study music.

640
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,600
You taught him things
and took care of him.

641
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,120
I thought you'd get over him…

642
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,920
when he said he saw you as a brother.

643
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,760
But I was wrong.

644
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,240
Do me a favor.

645
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,280
Don't bother him anymore.

646
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,120
I can't forget him.

647
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,720
Tharn is important to me.

648
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,960
That's why I can't let it go.
Do you understand?

649
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,920
What are you planning to do this time?

650
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,120
Just wait and see.

651
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,200
Come on, let's drink.

652
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,320
You slept with him when you were 14?

653
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,440
Think about it.

654
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,640
If a woman asked to sleep with you…

655
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,440
wouldn't you say yes?

656
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,640
Sex with women is different
from sex with men.

657
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,240
If you forget about gender…

658
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,000
you'll have a much broader viewpoint.

659
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,800
So…

660
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,880
he was your first time.

661
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,320
He made you realize
you weren't meant to be a bottom.

662
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,560
He's like a good brother to you.

663
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,200
He gave you advice on how to persuade
your parents to let you study music.

664
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,680
He's great.

665
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,360
Fucking great.

666
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,400
So great it makes me hate him.

667
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,360
Why don't you let him know
who I really belong to?

668
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,640
No way.

669
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,400
Enough talk.

670
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,280
I'm tired. I'm gonna sleep.

671
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,000
Don't sleep yet.

672
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,040
Let's talk some more.

673
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,120
Don't you want to demonstrate…

674
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,760
which role I prefer?

675
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,840
The role I had with San?

676
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,240
Or the role…

677
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,120
I have with you?

678
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,240
You weren't as naive as you claimed to be,
were you?

679
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,080
You were born a sly fox.

680
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,720
I'll tell you what I like, then.

681
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,280
I…

682
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,720
like this.

683
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,160
I like you.

684
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,160
Let's sleep.

685
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,920
Don't forget what you said.

686
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,480
How could I forget to buy the sauce
for a hot pot?

687
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,600
Son of a bitch!

688
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,560
{\an8}Tharn, seriously, what do you see in him?

689
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,760
{\an8}Leave the way you came.

690
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,920
{\an8}<i>It's your turn to get jealous.</i>

691
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,600
{\an8}We're even.

692
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,200
{\an8}I'm sorry, Tharn.

693
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,400
{\an8}Tharn, wait!

694
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,440
{\an8}I have to go, Tar.

695
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:36,880
{\an8}Let's go, Song.
