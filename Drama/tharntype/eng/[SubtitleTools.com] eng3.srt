1
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,200
You.

2
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,120
What's up?

3
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,640
No, it's nothing.

4
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,040
I talked to Techno.

5
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm sorry…

6
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
for meddling.

7
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,000
Did you actually just say that?

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,520
You're supposed to taunt me.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,520
Just like I've been taunting you
all this time.

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,520
And what will I gain by doing that?

11
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,920
I won't leave you to rot.

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,760
No matter how much we hate each other,
I can't sit around doing nothing.

13
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
You make me feel like a total asshole.

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
You are.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Son of a bitch, are you mocking me?

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
Judging by your reaction…

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,720
I guess you're fully recovered, right?

18
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
How much?

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,480
How much for the medicine?
I don't want to owe you.

20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
You already paid.

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
I couldn't have paid you in my sleep.

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,240
Just tell me how much.

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
This.

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,600
You paid me with this.

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,760
This is for stealing your snacks…

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,080
Let's just say…

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,880
next time…

28
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,480
don't spread the crumbs
on my bed again, okay?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
I didn't do it.

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,720
Don't worry.

31
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
I won't hold it against you.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,840
I'll just pretend…

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,600
a poor hungry dog ate them.

34
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,480
No matter how good you are to me,
I still hate you.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
Don't drop your guard.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,240
Because this mad dog will bite you
the first chance it gets.

37
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,440
Damn.

38
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
A dream?

39
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,000
First you got sick…

40
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,560
and now you're going crazy?

41
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,760
Crazy or not, it's none of your business.

42
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
Tharn.

43
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,800
Last night, did you do something to me?

44
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
Whatever I do…

45
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,080
is none of your business.

46
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,360
I'm going to class.

47
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
What do you mean?

48
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't mess with me.

49
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,280
Tharn!

50
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,520
Don't use my words against me!

51
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,400
-Don't use my words against me!
-Again?

52
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,920
Tharn!

53
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,520
Tharn. Damn you, Tharn! Come back here.
I'm not finished!

54
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
What the hell are you yelling for, Type?

55
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,520
Khlui. Hello.

56
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,800
Can you guys stop fighting every morning?

57
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
First, I have a K-pop obsessed roommate.

58
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,760
Now, the noisy neighbors
to top it all off.

59
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,600
You hate each other,
but shouldn't you have some sense?

60
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,840
You can't keep shouting like this.

61
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,440
I can't take it.

62
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,640
One more thing. I wanted to let you know,
the wall is thin.

64
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,600
I can hear you fight, even though
I don't know what it's about.

65
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,600
You really don't know
what we're fighting about?

66
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,880
I really don't.

67
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,000
I've been eavesdropping,
but I couldn't hear.

68
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,720
Whatever.

69
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,240
You guys remind me
of a couple in my neighborhood.

70
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,200
They argue every day.

71
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,800
One day, you'll be all over each other
like them.

72
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,560
We don't have any kind of relationship.

73
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Why so defensive?

74
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,400
Or are you and Tharn…

75
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,800
Nothing like that!

76
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,080
Look, I'm sorry for being noisy.

77
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
Okay.

78
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
Couple, my ass.

79
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,440
More like sworn enemies.

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,680
What are you staring at?

81
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
Why are you so obsessed with them?

82
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I have to protect the lowerclassmen.

83
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,440
They live next door.
They're like our neighbors.

84
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,760
If your neighbors are arguing,
wouldn't you stop them?

85
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,520
What kind of effed up logic is that?

86
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,920
Come on, don't you know
my personal hashtag?

87
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,720
"Become the ultimate busybody."

88
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,160
And, you, go back to your dance practice.

89
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,280
Type, let me borrow your lecture notes
from the class before.

90
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,440
I fell asleep.

91
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,520
Champ said
they're going to be on the exam.

92
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,480
Type, did you hear me?

93
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Techno!

94
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,360
I did it
'cause you weren't listening to me.

95
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,040
Why are you so quiet? Don't tell me…

96
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,840
you're planning to kick Tharn out again.

97
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,720
Just so you know, he's a good guy.

98
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,080
Are you his friend or mine?

99
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
I'm both your friends now.

100
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,200
What are you angry about this time?

101
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
Let me remind you,

102
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,040
you should be grateful to him.

103
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
He took care of you when you were sick.

104
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,840
Suit yourself.

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,120
If I were you, I wouldn't ruin the chance
to be friends with him

106
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,000
just because he's gay.

107
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm not saying he's bad.

108
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,960
But weren't you quiet

109
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,840
because you were thinking
about chasing him away?

110
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,600
When did I say anything about that?
You're just assuming things.

111
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,520
So, you've patched things up?

112
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,480
-Not yet.
-What?

113
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,000
I can be grateful.

114
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
It's true I hate him…

115
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,000
but he helped me.

116
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
It's just…

117
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,320
I can't stand him.

118
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,640
So, we avoid each other.

119
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
That's good.
Since the mind games are over,

120
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
I don't need to worry anymore.

121
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,960
THARN
MOBILE

122
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
It's your roommate.

123
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,680
Where did you get his number?

124
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,840
I asked him for it when you were sick.

125
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,640
Hello, Tharn. What's up?

126
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
<i>Are you with Type?</i>

127
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
Yes, he's sitting with me.

128
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Don't tell me you don't have his number.

129
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,000
<i>That's right.</i>

130
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,240
<i>I thought of asking him,</i>
<i>but then we got into a fight.</i>

131
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
<i>Where are you now?</i>

132
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,120
In a classroom. Just finished with class.
We'll probably grab some food after this.

133
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,720
<i>That's great.</i>

134
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,160
<i>Then…</i>

135
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,440
<i>tell Type to buy dinner for me.</i>

136
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,520
How about you tell him yourself?

137
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,320
<i>No, just tell him I want him</i>
<i>to return the favor.</i>

138
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>Tell him to buy anything. I'm not picky.</i>

139
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,800
Okay, I'll tell him. Bye.

140
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
What did he say?

141
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,920
Are you interested?

142
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,280
Stop. That's enough.

143
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,160
He wants you to buy dinner for him.

144
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
-No!
-No is not an option,

145
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
and leave me out of this.

146
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,120
You have to buy him dinner.
He said you need to return the favor.

147
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,640
You…

148
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,680
Don't you bite my head off.

149
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,400
Take it out on him, not me.

150
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,920
Hurry up and get ready. I'm hungry.

151
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,920
Look at you.

152
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
Are you coming?

153
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
If you don't move, I'm leaving.
I'm starving.

154
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,040
Let's catch up later, then.

155
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,480
Your dinner, 40 baht. Pay me now.

156
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,760
But I didn't ask you to buy a drink.

157
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,520
Just take it.

158
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,520
Techno kept bugging me about the drink.

159
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,960
I bought it to shut him up.

160
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,560
Thanks.

161
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Don't act like you're grateful.

162
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,040
You reminded me that
I owed you, after all.

163
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
It's not like I could refuse.

164
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,800
I won't sleep tonight.

165
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm gonna find out
what you've been doing to me.

166
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,920
I must be crazy…

167
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
to think you're cute.

168
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,000
Hope you're not having a nightmare.

169
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
Shit!

170
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,000
Why do I keep thinking of him?

171
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,360
That was the last exam. I'm finally free.

172
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
I can finally practice again.

173
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,560
Yeah, congrats.

174
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,640
So, do you have any plans after this?

175
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,160
It's up to Type.

176
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,200
If he doesn't have a plan,
I'll practice with the sophomores.

177
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,440
What's wrong with you again?

178
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,320
Nothing.

179
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,400
Your nothing always means something.

180
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,040
Shouldn't you be glad
now that the exam is over?

181
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,760
I don't want to go back to my room.

182
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't tell me
you got into another fight with Tharn.

183
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,520
Type, you're fighting with Tharn again?

184
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,360
The semester is almost over,
but you guys are still fighting.

185
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,720
He's…

186
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
He's what, God damn it? Why did you stop?

187
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,360
Spit it out.

188
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,920
I'm not a clairvoyant
that knows everything about you.

189
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,080
I want to move off-campus.

190
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,040
But your dad won't allow it.

191
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,320
That's why I'm stressed out right now.

192
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,880
Honestly, you can switch rooms with me.

193
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,720
Do it,
and then everything will finally be over.

194
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
It's okay. Thanks.

195
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,360
No problem.

196
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,600
Tell me if you change your mind.
I'm gonna get some food.

197
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,560
See you later.

198
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,160
Seriously, Type.

199
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,280
Figure out the problem and fix it.

200
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,600
For example,
you hate Tharn because he's gay.

201
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,120
Just forget the gay part
and the problem's solved.

202
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,840
It's just like when you overlook
someone's annoying behavior.

203
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
See? Easy-peasy.

204
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,680
So, you're blaming me for everything.

205
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Of course.

206
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,920
I'll drown you the next time
we go swimming.

207
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,440
I'm just kidding. Okay?

208
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Don't kill me.

209
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,960
-I'm leaving.
-Wait.

210
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,040
You said you didn't want to.
Now, you're going back?

211
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
It's none of your business.

212
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,760
What the hell? Wait for me.

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
What's wrong?

214
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,280
You're laughing for no reason.

215
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,520
Has too much studying made you crazy?

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,240
No.

217
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,040
I'm just thinking of something.

218
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,360
Oh, yeah?

219
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,560
Want to have dinner with me?

220
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
No.

221
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
I'm not hungry.

222
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,720
I'll go straight back to my room.

223
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,840
What about you?

224
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,840
Will you have dinner after this?

225
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,000
No.

226
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,080
You asked as if
you were going to stay with me.

227
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,120
You're always eager
to return to your room.

228
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,360
I guess you've forgotten about me already.

229
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,520
I see you hanging out
with lots of friends.

230
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,320
You can't be lonely.

231
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,000
How do you know that?

232
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,240
I'm a very lonely boy.

233
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,120
Beggars…

234
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,720
can't be choosers.

235
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,960
Asshole!

236
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,800
What's the matter with you?

237
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,040
My pillow.

238
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,440
What the hell are you smiling at?

239
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,640
I can smile…

240
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
at whatever I want.

241
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
You're such a jerk.

242
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,440
Want some?

243
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
Don't tempt me with food.

244
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,920
You can't trick me.

245
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,800
If you put something weird in it,
I'd get sick.

246
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,440
I won't fall for your tricks.

247
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
I wouldn't use food…

248
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,760
to tempt you.

249
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,160
You're all talk.

250
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Talking…

251
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,120
isn't the only thing I'm good at.

252
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,960
I'm gonna take a shower.

253
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
Where are my boxers?

254
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,960
Those are mine.

255
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,080
Tharn, don't be a dick.

256
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,600
Give them back!

257
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll give them back…

258
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,640
if you let me shower with you.

259
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,280
What the hell are you talking about?

260
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,760
You smell nice.

261
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,640
What are you doing?

262
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,880
What the hell are you doing?

263
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
Tharn, let me go!

264
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,560
I told you…

265
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,640
I'm not only good at talking.

266
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Asshole!

267
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,560
Wash that for me.

268
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,040
Shit, this is bad.

269
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,040
Come on, hate him! Be disgusted with him!

270
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
Type, open the door.

271
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,160
Type, I said open the door.

272
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,120
Sweet dreams, Type.

273
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,280
By the way,

274
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,840
you were…

275
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,600
amazing back there.

276
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,360
Don't mess with me again.

277
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,240
Because, next time,
I won't stop after one punch.

278
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,080
Then, next time…

279
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,400
don't beg me to do it again.

280
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,840
I never begged you!

281
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,360
Just admit you like my skills.

282
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,000
Screw you!

283
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,040
I'LL BE LATE TODAY, TAR.

284
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,560
CLASS JUST ENDED.

285
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
HEAVY TRAFFIC TOO.

286
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Getting movie premiere tickets
was a piece of cake.

287
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,800
Yes. Okay, I'll see you in half an hour.

288
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,960
Yes. See you, beautiful.

289
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,920
Wasn't that the French program guy
you told me about?

290
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,360
Yeah.

291
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,320
Quid pro quo.

292
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,080
The picture of Techno
scratching his balls.

293
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,280
Hurry up.

294
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,240
Done.

295
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,920
Check the message.

296
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,840
Did you get it?

297
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,680
I really don't understand
why you're so crazy about Techno.

298
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
You see…

299
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,840
Techno…

300
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,520
makes me feel
like I can really love someone.

301
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,200
Without him…

302
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,040
the world would be downright boring.

303
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,120
Man, I wanna throw up.

304
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,000
You're too serious.
Are you out of your mind?

305
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,560
Haven't you heard of
"love at first sight"?

306
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,400
I'M HERE.

307
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:37,440
WHERE ARE YOU?

308
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,280
This is all your fault.
She's been waiting for ten minutes.

309
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,640
It won't take long.
I'll just grab some books.

310
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,360
Kla, I'm serious with this girl.

311
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,480
Getting her LINE ID was really hard.

312
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
I can find you another girl.

313
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,640
You're unbelievable!

314
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,320
Are you coming?

315
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,120
Yeah, coming.

316
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
Hurry up.

317
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,160
Let's go.

318
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,520
{\an8}I'M ALREADY HOME, TUM.

319
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,800
{\an8}Tar.

320
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,440
Open the door.

321
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,680
Tar, I said open the door.

322
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,680
Don't make me get the key.

323
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,280
We need to talk.

324
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,680
Why didn't you wait for me at school?

325
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
I was worried sick.

326
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,200
If I'd waited, I'd have gotten home later.

327
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,360
Tar!

328
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,440
You can tell me if you're busy.

329
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,200
I can come home by myself.

330
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,280
Didn't I tell you I could pick you up?

331
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
I told you the traffic was bad.

332
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,520
Why didn't you wait for me?

333
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,840
Okay, I'm sorry.

334
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,720
Let's make a deal.

335
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Next time,

336
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,160
if I can't make it, I'll let you know.

337
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,720
But you need to answer my call,
no matter what.

338
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,640
Whatever you're doing, you have to answer.

339
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,200
I worry about you, you know?

340
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,000
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

341
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
Get some rest.

342
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Go! Go! Go!

343
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,000
Stay focused.

344
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,720
Don't forget
you're my crucial team members.

345
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,720
Why don't you tell Type too?

346
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,200
I haven't seen him
on the field once today.

347
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,200
Come on, just focus on your practice.

348
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,200
Who would dare boss him around?

349
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,920
Instead of shouting,
why don't you practice, Techno?

350
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,080
Come on, you know my football skills
are second to none.

351
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,240
Remember, I'm naturally talented.

352
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,120
Just wait and see, Type.

353
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,640
One day…

354
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,160
I will be team captain!

355
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,400
Are you daydreaming?

356
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,880
This is for you.

357
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,040
You'd better wake up, Techno.

358
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,480
-Team captain. You?
-Yeah.

359
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,120
Don't say that.

360
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,440
-He's really passionate about it.
-Yes.

361
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,840
He still says it a hundred times a day.

362
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,480
Whatever.

363
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,080
But when we're seniors
and there's a captain election,

364
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,360
you all must vote for me. Understood?

365
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,280
You're lobbying right now?

366
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,080
-Aren't you taking this too seriously?
-Read my lips.

367
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm serious, dead serious.

368
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,440
Shall I wake you up?

369
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,600
You keep interrupting me.

370
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,720
What's gotten into you this time?

371
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,480
Nothing. Just forget it.

372
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,320
Are you fighting with your roommate again?

373
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,080
You two are fighting all the time.

374
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,000
Tharn and Type are fighting?
How come I didn't know?

375
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,480
-I didn't know.
-Neither did I.

376
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,880
Me neither.

377
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,040
It's nothing.
Techno is just talking nonsense.

378
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,360
I'm leaving.

379
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm coming with you. Bye, guys.

380
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,960
What the hell?

381
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,640
They come and go as they please.

382
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,440
Did you fight with Tharn?

383
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,080
No, I'm just thinking about stuff.

384
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,280
-Are you sure?
-Hello, my dear Techno.

385
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,760
-Hello.
-How are you?

386
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm fine. And you, how are you?

387
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,200
So fine.

388
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
-I'm right here.
-Your friend?

389
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,840
Yes, he's my friend. His name is Type.

390
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,760
He fits the bill.

391
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,240
His skin, his body, all shiny and sweaty.

392
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,680
-We were right to come here.
-Yes, Mama.

393
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Anyway…

394
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,520
All I've heard are compliments
for my friend.

395
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,120
What about me?

396
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,000
We'd like to oblige.

397
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
But you're so yesterday, Techno.

398
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,800
We want to try something fresh
and new, right?

399
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,600
So fresh.

400
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,640
Looks like some queenies
might get slapped today.

401
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,640
That's harsh.

402
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,960
In that case, give me the full
"slap and kiss" experience.

403
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
I slap…

404
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,280
and you kiss, okay?

405
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,600
Kiss?

406
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Kissing is not enough for her.

407
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,240
She likes it rough in bed too, right?

408
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,760
So rough.

409
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,440
Techno.

410
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,400
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

411
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
Wait, can I have a moment?

412
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,880
We are admins of the TT Handsome Guy page.

413
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,320
We want to take your photos
to post on the page.

414
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,800
We also need your name, faculty,
Instagram account and phone number.

415
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
And we'll post them on our page.

416
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
Trust me.

417
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,000
Your toned body…

418
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,880
-Will make girls go crazy.
-So hot.

419
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,480
-Absolutely.
-Especially,

420
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,480
your muscular arms.

421
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,120
So handsome.

422
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,840
-Take it easy.
-You should find someone else.

423
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,200
Give us a minute. Just one photo, please.

424
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
-Get the camera.
-Wait a minute.

425
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,840
You call this handsome?

426
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,320
-Yeah.
-There are more handsome guys out there.

427
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,720
Please find someone else.

428
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,240
-He's the one we're looking for.
-You really should ask someone else.

429
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,560
-Techno, get out of the way.
-Just one photo.

430
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
-Take it now.
-Just one photo, man. One photo.

431
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,240
Look at the camera.

432
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,680
-More. Take backup shots too.
-Perfect.

433
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,160
-Another angle.
-Chill, man.

434
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,560
Okay, I got them.

435
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,800
-Take a couple of shots for me.
-Okay.

436
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,720
Yeah, that's it. So perfect.

437
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,960
Great shot! Perfect!

438
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,000
One more pose.

439
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,320
Put your hand higher.

440
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,400
I think that's enough.

441
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,400
Get away from me!

442
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,320
Mama.

443
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,120
-Stay away, faggots.
-What's wrong with him?

444
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,200
Damn, I really hate your guts.

445
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,520
So, we're fags.
What's your problem, asshole?

446
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,200
I don't give a shit.

447
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,680
I just can't stand
breathing the same air as you.

448
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,400
Aren't you being a little too harsh?
It's just a photo. Don't overreact.

449
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,080
Sis, I'm sorry about my friend.

450
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,720
He doesn't mean it.
He's just got a foul mouth.

451
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,400
-Please calm down.
-Why are you apologizing?

452
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,720
They can't just grope whoever they want.

453
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,480
-What did you say?
-Calm down, please.

454
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,080
Beat him, Mama!

455
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,760
Type, get the hell away from here,
I'm begging you!

456
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,440
Please, calm down.
Don't do anything to him.

457
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,440
Techno.

458
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,360
I'm sorry. So sorry.

459
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,440
Believe me, he didn't mean it.

460
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,000
He's homophobic.

461
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,880
What's wrong with being gay?
We're people too!

462
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,480
Tell your friend this is far from over.

463
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,920
He's stupid
if he wants to mess with gay people.

464
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,520
We'll show him LGBTQ power.

465
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,440
-Let's go.
-Sis, I'm begging you.

466
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,200
Sis, can't we sort this out?

467
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,520
What the hell just happened?

468
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,120
God damn it, Type!

469
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,720
<i>What's wrong with being gay?</i>

470
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,080
<i>We only went on a scouting mission…</i>

471
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,040
DON'T TRACK HIM DOWN. IT'S OUR FAULT.

472
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,560
<i>…for handsome men as usual.</i>

473
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,040
<i>Because our source said</i>
<i>one of the freshmen is hot.</i>

474
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,360
<i>So hot that women and gay men</i>
<i>will swoon with at first glance.</i>

475
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,400
<i>However, an unexpected</i>
<i>turn of eventsoccurred.</i>

476
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,880
<i>We only approached him</i>
<i>and asked for a photo for our page.</i>

477
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,680
<i>Not only did he heartlessly turn us down,</i>

478
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,960
<i>he also called LGBTQ people "trash"</i>

479
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,880
<i>and threatened to attack us.</i>

480
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,520
<i>But it's okay. We don't blame him.</i>

481
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,760
<i>P.S., his photo is in the comment section.</i>

482
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,080
<i>But please don't track him down,</i>
<i>because maybe it's really our fault.</i>

483
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,200
What are you staring at?

484
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,200
Never seen a human before?

485
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,040
Type.

486
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,560
You're such a scumbag, Type.
How could you disrespect the seniors?

487
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,320
How is he a scumbag? I think he's right.

488
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,200
Those homos are freaks. Served them right.

489
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,160
Don't be rude.
They haven't done anything to you.

490
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:10,200
Nothing, my ass!
They exposed our friend on the Internet.

491
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,040
Everyone, calm down!

492
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,200
Type, aren't you going to say something?

493
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,080
Type.

494
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,400
You're in big trouble!

495
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,320
What is it, Techno?

496
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,000
How can you be so calm?
Everything is effed up.

497
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,160
Look!

498
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,480
It's on the university's forum now.

499
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,440
{\an8}Hold on.

500
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,240
{\an8}Aren't you going to apologize?

501
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,760
{\an8}What about you?

502
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,840
{\an8}Ever think of apologizing to me?

503
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,520
{\an8}What did you say to those two?

504
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,720
{\an8}I like him.

505
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,240
{\an8}Oh, my God, you like that jerk?

506
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,640
{\an8}Yes, I do.

507
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,120
{\an8}Why are you doing this?

508
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,960
{\an8}I want to take care of my crush.
What's wrong with that?

509
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
{\an8}What is it?

510
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,400
{\an8}Why don't you want me to go home?

511
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,280
{\an8}Have sex with me.
