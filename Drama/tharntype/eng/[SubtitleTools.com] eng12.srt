1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,320
Tharn?

2
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
What's wrong? What happened?

3
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,600
Tharn.

4
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,400
Tharn.

5
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,200
Tharn, hold on.

6
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,720
What's the matter?

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,880
What happened?

8
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,400
I'm hurting.

9
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,840
I got dumped again.

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,480
It's okay.

11
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
It's okay.

12
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,680
It's okay.

13
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,440
What did I do wrong?

14
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,800
Why did Type leave me?

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
What did I do wrong?

16
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
It's okay, Tharn.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,680
I love him so much, Thorn.

19
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,880
Why did he have to leave me?

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,200
I know, Tharn. I know.

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,280
It's okay.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,200
I love him.

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
It's okay, Tharn.

24
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,520
I want to be with him.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
Why did he leave me, Thorn?

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
It's okay, Tharn.

27
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,160
Tharn.

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,480
Type.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,960
I miss you, Type.

30
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,640
They're all messages from you
cursing me out.

31
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,680
Come back and curse at me.

32
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,880
I'll let you do anything.

33
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,680
You can insult me all you want.

34
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
But please come back to me.

35
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,320
Tharn, you idiot!

36
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Tharn.

37
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,360
Thorn.

38
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,640
It's okay, Tharn.

39
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,360
It's okay.

40
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,000
If you want to cry,

41
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,760
just cry.

42
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,280
I'll be right here with you.

43
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,120
It's okay, Tharn.

44
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
It's okay, Tharn.

45
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,440
I believe you can get over it.

46
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,280
It's okay.

47
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,440
It's been awhile.

48
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,440
Yes.

49
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,000
The last time I came here,
I was in 11th grade.

50
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,440
By the way,

51
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
where is everyone?

52
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,680
Dad's still at the office.

53
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,920
And mom took Princess to her piano class.

54
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,360
You still call Thanya "Princess"?

55
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

56
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,920
I won't stop calling her that.

57
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,200
It's kind of cute.

58
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,960
That's true.

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
Your family's always lovely.

60
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Thanks.

61
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,280
You're here to see Tharn, right?

62
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,040
Yes.

63
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,480
So…

64
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
how's Tharn doing?

65
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,440
Wait here for a moment.

66
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
I'll go get him.

67
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,240
Okay. Thank you.

68
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
I'm so jealous.

69
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
What's there to be jealous of?

70
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,160
Your family is so loving.

71
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
It's always been like this.

72
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,880
So loving that it makes me…

73
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,840
jealous.

74
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,760
Lhong…

75
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,360
listen to me.

76
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,280
Tharn's friends are like my brothers.

77
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,800
If you like it here,
you can come visit often.

78
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,400
Then… I'll come visit more often.

79
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,800
Sure.

80
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,280
So… Tharn…

81
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,400
He's sleeping.

82
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,480
He's been through a lot,
so he must be tired.

83
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,240
I guess he doesn't want to see even me.

84
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,080
Don't be mad at him.
He's been through a lot.

85
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,560
I know.

86
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
I never get mad at him.

87
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm sorry on his behalf.

88
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,080
And thank you so much
for always being there for him.

89
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,240
Have you eaten yet?

90
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,600
Do you want anything?

91
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,960
It's okay.

92
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,840
I don't want to impose.

93
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,360
When Tharn wakes up…

94
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,400
please tell him to call me.

95
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.

96
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
I'm leaving, then.

97
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,400
Goodbye.

98
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,360
Good luck.

99
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,480
I've always been there for him.

100
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,800
But he doesn't want me.

101
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,160
You're spacing out.

102
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,560
Here.

103
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,280
I bought it for you.

104
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,240
Thanks.

105
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,520
So…

106
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,240
what are you gonna do?

107
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,760
Just what I told you.

108
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
Really, Type,

109
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,360
I don't get you sometimes.

110
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,800
Why are you letting yourself suffer?

111
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm not suffering.

112
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,840
Judging from the dark circles
under your eyes…

113
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,960
you must have had a good night's sleep

114
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,480
after your fairy godmother
sang you a lullaby.

115
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,400
Type!

116
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,840
Here you are. I've been looking for you.

117
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,000
What do you want?

118
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,840
Seriously, did you get into a fight again?

119
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,880
No. Why?

120
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,520
There's someone over there
asking for a first-year named Type.

121
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,640
So I rushed here to tell you.

122
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,880
Who could it be?

123
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,720
I don't know. I didn't ask for his name.

124
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,560
But he's handsome.

125
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,800
The girls kept staring at him.

126
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll be right back.

127
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,480
Be right back.

128
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,400
What's wrong with him?

129
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,040
Honestly, Champ. I don't know.

130
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,560
I'm confused.

131
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,000
-Whose drink is this? Can I have it?
-Sure, go ahead.

132
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,120
So? Wanna find something to eat?

133
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,280
Sure, let's go.

134
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's go.

135
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,120
Where is he?

136
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,680
Type.

137
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,280
Thorn.

138
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,600
Can I talk to you?

139
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,360
Let me cut to the chase.

140
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,480
Why did you break up with Tharn?

141
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
I said…

142
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,960
why did you break up with Tharn?

143
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,760
I'm sorry.

144
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,240
I didn't want to get involved.

145
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,920
I just…

146
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,080
My brother's in bad shape.

147
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,160
How is Tharn?

148
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,080
If you still love him,

149
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
why did you break up with him?

150
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,800
It's over.

151
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,480
For Tharn, it's not.

152
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,760
I feel bad for him.

153
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,840
Do you know how he was when he got home?

154
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,160
He cried.

155
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,880
My brother, who I'd never seen cry,
was crying.

156
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,440
He kept asking what he did wrong.

157
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,360
"Why did Type break up with me?"

158
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
I don't understand.

159
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,160
That time you came to our house,
you were getting along just fine.

160
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,000
What happened?

161
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,600
I'm sorry.

162
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,720
I didn't mean to yell at you.

163
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
I just…

164
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,680
Before…

165
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,040
when Tharn was young…

166
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,000
he was very attached to me.

167
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,400
Inseparable.

168
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,280
We always stayed…

169
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,200
and played together.

170
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
Until…

171
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
Mom was pregnant with Princess.

172
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,560
Tharn probably knew…

173
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
that he was no longer
the youngest sibling.

174
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,480
He acted more mature.

175
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,040
Stopped following me around.

176
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,720
Stopped asking for my attention.

177
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,360
Everyone teased him…

178
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,880
that since he had a little sister…

179
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,640
he'd become a big brother.

180
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,360
He can sacrifice for her.

181
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,720
But he can't lose you.

182
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,240
Tharn never cried…

183
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,720
when he lost Dad, Mom, or me to Princess.

184
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,720
But he was crying his heart out
after he lost you.

185
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,840
Please, answer me.

186
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,800
What's so bad about my brother?

187
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,680
Why did you break up with him?

188
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,960
Tell me and I won't get involved anymore.

189
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,840
Is he in really bad shape?

190
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,760
The worst.

191
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,360
Everything I do…

192
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,480
I do it for him.

193
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,680
For him?

194
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,760
Can you promise…

195
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,800
that you won't tell him…

196
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,760
what I'm about to tell you?

197
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,280
What do you mean?

198
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,880
Promise me.

199
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,960
Okay, I promise.

200
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,240
Lhong, can't get through?

201
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,560
What the hell?

202
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,440
How many days has Tharn been absent?

203
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,800
Damn. So irresponsible.

204
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,320
Don't blame him, Tae!

205
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,520
Why?

206
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,360
Why can't I blame him?

207
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
You see he's been skipping practice.

208
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,480
Let me tell you this.

209
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,240
No matter how talented he is,
no one can stand a lazy ass like him.

210
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Then, leave. Get out.

211
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,360
Come on, Lhong. Calm down. Don't fight.

212
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,560
Don't think I can't find someone
to replace you.

213
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,760
You know who's the best in this band.

214
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,440
Not me.

215
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,240
Not Song.

216
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,600
And certainly…

217
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,600
not you!

218
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
Tharn is the best!

219
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,280
Tharn completes our band.

220
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,600
If you want to quit,

221
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,200
I won't stop you.

222
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,560
Do you know how many people
want to play with him?

223
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,440
-Lhong.
-You dare say that to me?

224
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,160
Come on, that's enough. Please stop.

225
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,000
Tae, please stop.

226
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,960
Lhong, don't say that.

227
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,760
Let's call it a day.

228
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
Let's talk after you guys calm down.

229
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,160
Okay.

230
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
I'll stop for Song's sake.

231
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,280
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

232
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,240
-You want a piece of me? Come back!
-Tae, stop. Calm down.

233
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,800
Tae, that's enough.

234
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
Calm down. Take a deep breath.

235
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,960
Look at him.

236
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,000
You know he's worried about Tharn.

237
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,000
We haven't been able
to reach Tharn at all.

238
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,400
It's normal Lhong would get upset.

239
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,880
You're siding with them

240
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,840
because you idolize them, right?

241
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,040
Stop smiling.

242
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
What are you smiling at?
Your mood's lifted.

243
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,440
Let's practice.

244
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,200
So no one can look down on us again.

245
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,720
Come on.

246
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,400
Shit!

247
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,440
I thought you were a ghost!

248
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,640
What the hell are you doing here?

249
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,360
How many times
are you gonna watch that clip?

250
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,280
What the hell am I doing, Techno?

251
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,880
If it's the answer you gave me,

252
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,280
you're doing this for Tharn.

253
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Of course.

254
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,160
This is for Tharn.

255
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,920
Even if he hates me…

256
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
after this.

257
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,280
He's never hated you.

258
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,520
But he'll hate me after this.

259
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Type.

260
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,600
Three times.

261
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,600
Three times what?

262
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,720
In my lifetime…

263
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,280
I'll break up with him only three times.

264
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Type…

265
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,160
Go to sleep.

266
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
You have to help me tomorrow.

267
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,160
I don't want to help you.

268
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,680
But you and I are friends.

269
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,600
Too late to stop being your friend now.

270
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,720
Thanks so much.

271
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,880
When it's my turn…

272
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,600
don't forget to help me.

273
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,760
This is not the time to be emotional.

274
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,080
It's late.

275
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,840
Let's go to sleep.

276
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm sleepy.

277
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,160
Turn off the light.

278
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,840
I know.

279
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,960
Damn it!

280
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,960
It's okay.

281
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,400
Tharn can't be like this for long.

282
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,560
Give him time, Lhong.

283
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,960
Lhong.

284
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,560
Type.

285
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
What's up?

286
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,640
Haven't seen you in days.

287
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,280
How are you?

288
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
I'm fine.

289
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,960
How about you?

290
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,800
I think…

291
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,520
you should reconsider the breakup.

292
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,600
You really think so?

293
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,600
What do you mean?

294
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,160
If I apologize,

295
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,080
will Tharn really forgive me?

296
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,200
I already told you…

297
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,520
to think carefully about breaking up.

298
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,480
It's too late to change your mind now.

299
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
At first…

300
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,040
Tharn couldn't get over it.

301
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,440
But he's gotten so much better now.

302
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,240
He told me…

303
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,160
he's gotten over you.

304
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,680
And if you wanted to go back now…

305
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
I'd better not say it.

306
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,560
Just tell me.

307
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Because nothing can make me hurt
any more than I already am.

308
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,840
He told me…

309
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,720
even if you apologized,

310
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,240
he wouldn't want to see you.

311
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,280
He said that?

312
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,160
I heard it with my own ears.

313
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,760
What if I don't believe you?

314
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,960
It's okay if you don't believe me.

315
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,880
But my friend's not a fool.

316
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,080
You hurt him like hell.

317
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,920
You think he'll forgive you so easily?

318
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,080
You even fell for Tar's plan.

319
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,200
I don't think
Tharn will want to get hurt again.

320
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,280
I'm sorry, but I have to tell the truth.

321
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm saying this because…

322
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,360
I mean well for both of you.

323
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,560
Bullshit!

324
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,160
What's up with you?

325
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,040
You're worse than I thought.

326
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,200
What the hell, Type?

327
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,720
You're upset with Tharn,
and now you're taking it out on me?

328
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
You're so full of shit.

329
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,560
I was such a dumbass

330
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,640
to believe your shit this whole time.

331
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,520
This is too much!

332
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,040
Too much?

333
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,720
What about hiring people
to gang-rape a tenth grader?

334
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,840
Wasn't that too much?

335
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
What are you talking about?

336
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,480
-I don't know anything about that.
-Stop bullshitting.

337
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,520
Tar told me everything…

338
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,240
about how evil you are.

339
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
No matter what,

340
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,400
I'm going to be the cause of your breakup.

341
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,120
What do you mean?

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Answer me!

343
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,640
What do you mean?

344
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Answer me!

345
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,240
I'm being forced.

346
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,920
What do you mean you're being forced?

347
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,360
Type!

348
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
You believe him?

349
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,880
Be quiet, Techno!

350
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,040
I can't tell you.

351
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,200
If you don't tell me,

352
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,840
then it means you did it
because you hate Tharn.

353
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
I don't hate Tharn.

354
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,120
I love him.

355
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,000
-Shut up if you don't know anything.
-Then tell me what I don't know!

356
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,840
In the end,

357
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,480
I can't escape the fact
that I was gang-raped.

358
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,080
You really believe the boy
who made you break up with Tharn?

359
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
You're stupider than I thought.

360
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,400
I'm not stupid.

361
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,320
Tar showed me the clip.

362
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,960
Enough.

363
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,360
So…

364
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,480
Tar is Tharn's ex-bandmate's brother?

365
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,880
I'll recap one more time.

366
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,120
Tar is Tharn's ex-bandmate's brother.

367
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
When he first met Tharn…

368
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
he fell in love.

369
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,400
He asked Tharn out and Tharn said yes.

370
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,920
But on their goddamn anniversary
or something,

371
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,240
Tharn told him to meet at a hotel.

372
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,720
He drank some booze a waiter gave him,
thinking it was from Tharn.

373
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
Eventually…

374
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,240
he woke up on a bed
with the three men who'd just raped him.

375
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,000
And you believe him?

376
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,360
He ran away to throw up.

377
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,080
I bet he's faking it.

378
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,880
No.

379
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,080
I don't think he's faking it.

380
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,880
I know it.

381
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
You know?

382
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,840
It looks consensual, right?

383
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,920
That's why I couldn't tell Tharn.

384
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,400
He's going to hate me for sure.

385
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,560
When I woke up…

386
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,200
with those men…

387
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,680
<i>Disgusting.</i>

388
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
Revolting.

389
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,880
Stinking.

390
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,240
Filthy!

391
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,440
Say no more.

392
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm begging you.

393
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't break up with Tharn.

394
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,320
Don't let his plan succeed.

395
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,760
Who are you talking about?

396
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,280
That person has Tharn's trust…

397
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
more than me…

398
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,320
more than you.

399
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,800
He's always been by Tharn's side.

400
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,800
But I never noticed.

401
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,560
Don't tell me…

402
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,080
Lhong.

403
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,520
He's the mastermind.

404
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,200
He'll destroy you like he did me.

405
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,600
But he'll never get to hurt me.

406
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,200
And he's gonna regret…

407
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,360
messing with the wrong guy.

408
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,400
All the bastards' faces
are shown in the clip.

409
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,160
And I'm lucky enough…

410
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,480
to have a friend who knows all of them.

411
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,160
I just gave them money,

412
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,000
and they told me who paid them to do it.

413
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,880
What does that have to do with me?

414
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,360
They told you I paid them?

415
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,600
No.

416
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,920
But I'll show Tharn the clip.

417
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,960
-Techno.
-What?

418
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,400
Are Tharn and Type really together?

419
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,440
This is not the time to ask.

420
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,360
I'll tell you everything.

421
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
But right now, hold the phone still.

422
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,200
Type told us to film everything.

423
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,560
Tharn will never believe you!

424
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,600
Even if he doesn't believe me,
he'll learn the truth about Tar.

425
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,160
Do you think a good guy like him

426
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,400
will just sit around
if he knows his ex was framed?

427
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,520
Even if he doesn't forgive me,

428
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,760
he'll return to Tar.

429
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
And you…

430
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,360
will be tossed aside once again.

431
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,640
Try to come up with a good excuse.

432
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,840
You'll never succeed!

433
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,680
You hear me?

434
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,560
You'll never beat me!

435
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,000
Techno!

436
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,000
Shit! What do we do? Should I go help him?

437
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,360
No, we have to keep filming
until Lhong confesses everything.

438
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,800
-Take it. I'll go help him.
-No, Champ! You can't go!

439
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,760
You must keep filming.

440
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,560
Wait a little more. Calm down, please.

441
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,800
You hear me?

442
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,600
You'll never beat me!

443
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,480
Do you hear me? He's mine!

444
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,440
I've been by Tharn's side for four years!

445
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,200
Four years of worthlessness?

446
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Shut up!

447
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,800
Shut your mouth!

448
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,560
Shut your mouth.

449
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,000
Tharn will never love you.

450
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,080
Remember that!

451
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,400
Shut up! You don't know anything!

452
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm not like those sons of bitches.

453
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,840
They believed whatever I said…

454
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,680
and quickly lost faith in Tharn.

455
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
But not me.

456
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,440
I believe in Tharn.

457
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm the only one who loves him.

458
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,000
No one but me is perfect for him.

459
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
But you have no right to hurt Tar.

460
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,040
No right, you say?

461
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,080
Tar said Tharn loved him the most.

462
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,600
But you saw…

463
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,360
that he begged those men
to do it all night.

464
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,640
You're a piece of shit.

465
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,400
Tharn will never love you.

466
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,000
Then, you'd better die.

467
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,320
If it hadn't been for you,

468
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,960
Tharn wouldn't have ended up like this.

469
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,480
He wouldn't have changed.

470
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,320
Because of you!

471
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,000
This is all your fault!

472
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,480
-You're a sore loser!
-I'm not a loser!

473
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,080
I'm the winner.

474
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,880
You…

475
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,760
lost.

476
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,560
-Then, die!
-Lhong, stop!

477
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Tharn!

478
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
Lhong!

479
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,080
Die!

480
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,040
Type…

481
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,120
Are you okay?

482
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,400
I'm fine.

483
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,760
How did you get here?

484
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,240
Later.

485
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,200
I'm glad you're okay.

486
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,440
Tharn…

487
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,440
Tharn…

488
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,200
Tharn…

489
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,440
Techno…

490
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,840
look after Type for me.

491
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,120
Take it easy, okay?

492
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,440
Tharn…

493
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,440
don't look at me like that.

494
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm Lhong, your best friend.

495
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Tharn…

496
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,080
don't look at me like that.

497
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,320
What the hell have you done?

498
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,640
I haven't done anything.

499
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,120
I haven't done anything.

500
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,480
How could you do this to me, Lhong?

501
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
Tharn…

502
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,160
I haven't done anything.

503
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,800
He was provoking me.

504
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,600
I was angry for you.

505
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,440
Believe me.

506
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,280
Please believe me, Tharn.

507
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,600
Believe you?

508
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,560
You want me to believe the person
who hurts everyone around me?

509
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,960
Tharn…

510
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,200
you believe other people more than me?

511
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
I've always been by your side.

512
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,880
Everything…

513
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
I've done everything for you.

514
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,200
For me?

515
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,000
This?

516
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,560
You did this for me?

517
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,880
Because no one's good enough for you!

518
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,680
That's none of your business!

519
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,120
No one truly loves you.

520
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,640
No one is perfect for you.

521
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,760
I want you to find a good man,

522
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,680
so I tested them.

523
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,480
But no one is good enough for you.

524
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,240
They're all evil.

525
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,200
You said…

526
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,120
you did what?

527
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,400
What did you do to them?

528
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,720
I only said you cheated on them…

529
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,680
and they turned on you so quickly.

530
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,560
Unlike me.

531
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
No matter how much you lie to me,

532
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,080
I still believe you.

533
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,640
I'll always be by your side, Tharn.

534
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,160
It should be me.

535
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,680
It has to be me.

536
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
It has to be me, Tharn.

537
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,400
I know…

538
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,200
I know that…

539
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,520
I'm important to you.

540
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,040
You can break up with them.

541
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,120
But you can't break up with me.

542
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,800
You're fine without a boyfriend.

543
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,200
But you can't live
without your friend by your side.

544
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,040
I know…

545
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,800
I know you love me too.

546
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,960
You're important to me, Lhong.

547
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,360
But not in the way you think.

548
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,360
That's not true.

549
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,320
Not true.

550
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,480
I trusted you.

551
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,040
But you hurt Tar.

552
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,240
You hurt everyone.

553
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
Tar?

554
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,400
Tar didn't really love you, Tharn.

555
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,240
I can prove it.

556
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,560
He can have sex with any man.

557
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,880
You have to see…

558
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,360
how much he enjoyed it.

559
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,800
I felt disgusted every time…

560
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
I saw you with him.

561
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,040
Tar didn't love you.

562
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,360
He's fine with any man.

563
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,640
I have a clip.

564
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,320
I have a clip, Tharn.
I can send it to you.

565
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,400
Tar's slutty…

566
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,640
It's my fault.

567
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,520
I hurt that boy.

568
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,480
If I had left him alone…

569
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,360
he wouldn't have gone through this.

570
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,480
Stop blaming yourself.

571
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,320
The one who must take responsibility
is him…

572
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,600
not you.

573
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,600
Don't touch him.

574
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,800
Get away from my friends!

575
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Tharn…

576
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,720
I'm going to drop out.

577
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,360
What the hell are you saying?

578
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,760
You can't drop out.

579
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,680
Didn't you say you love music the most?

580
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,920
You can't quit.

581
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
You can't.

582
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,200
I'm the cause of all this.

583
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,640
Because I'm friends with Lhong.

584
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,960
Because I was Tar's boyfriend.

585
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,800
Everything happened because of me.

586
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,440
I must take responsibility.

587
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,680
Will you stop being heroic?

588
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,760
The one who must take responsibility
is him, not you.

589
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,840
Do you really want to break up with me?

590
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,920
No, Type.

591
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,720
Don't break up with me.

592
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,040
Don't break up with me, Type.

593
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,280
You hear that?

594
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,440
How many times are you gonna hurt him,
so you can be satisfied?

595
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,800
You took away his loved ones.

596
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
Now you're taking away
what he loves the most?

597
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,640
No, Tharn.

598
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,840
You can't drop out.

599
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,560
You can't quit music.

600
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,560
You can't quit drumming!

601
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,440
Didn't you tell me
you love music the most?

602
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,720
Leave him alone!

603
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,280
Tharn…

604
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,560
Look at me.

605
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,800
Look at me!

606
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,800
I'm Lhong, your best friend.

607
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,960
-Don't ignore me.
-I said leave him alone!

608
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,600
Tharn…

609
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,480
I love you, Tharn.

610
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,280
I love you, Tharn. I love you.

611
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,440
But I don't love you.

612
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,720
Type…

613
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,040
Let's get out of here.

614
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,720
Come on.

615
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,600
Come on. Please.

616
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,240
I think that's enough.

617
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,680
Let's go.

618
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,280
Don't drop out!

619
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,760
I'll drop out instead.

620
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,080
Since I can't be by your side…

621
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,960
nothing matters anymore.

622
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:37,840
I'll go.

623
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,680
I can't take music away from you.

624
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,200
I really can't take music away from you.

625
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,680
Tharn!

626
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,480
Tharn!

627
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,160
Tharn, I love you!

628
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,920
Tharn!

629
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,760
Tharn, I love you.

630
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,320
I love you.

631
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,960
Tharn…

632
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,760
Surprise! I came back from Germany.

633
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,920
Lhong?

634
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,680
What happened?

635
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,560
Why are you crying?

636
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,880
Why did I have to be born?

637
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,240
What's wrong with you?

638
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:57,480
If nobody cares about me or loves me,
then why did I have to be born?

639
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,000
What are you talking about?

640
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,200
What's wrong with you?

641
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,600
Dad and Mom never loved me.

642
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,560
Big brother and you never cared about me.

643
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,280
If they don't see me as their son…

644
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,800
and you don't appreciate me
as your little brother…

645
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,440
then why don't you just let me die?

646
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,640
Why would you let me live?

647
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,600
I'm hurting.

648
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,760
I'm suffering.

649
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,560
Has anyone ever noticed?

650
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,080
Even now,
Tharn doesn't appreciate me anymore.

651
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,720
So, what's the point of living?

652
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,160
I don't want to live anymore.

653
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,400
You should let me die.

654
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,160
Because I have nothing left.

655
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,080
You said you had nothing left,

656
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,080
but you still have me.

657
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,200
I know you hate me too.

658
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,280
No, I never hated you.

659
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,880
You're lying.

660
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,840
I don't believe you.

661
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,320
Whether you believe me or not,
I'm still your sister.

662
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,160
My being away doesn't mean
I don't love you.

663
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,920
If I hadn't loved you, I wouldn't have
let you cry on my expensive clothes.

664
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,360
I'm sorry.

665
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,320
Big brother and I didn't know
you suffered so much.

666
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,360
I love you.

667
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,720
Big sis…

668
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm sorry.

669
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,480
-It's okay.
-Big sis…

670
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,240
I'm sorry.

671
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,000
Be gentle.

672
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:41,840
Just a bit more.

673
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,520
Be gentle. It hurts.

674
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,360
Almost done.

675
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,880
I was certain when I went out
for a drink with Lhong.

676
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,720
I pretended to be drunk.

677
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,800
When I told him you were mine…

678
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,960
the look on his face convinced me…

679
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,560
that he was behind all this.

680
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,040
I'm sorry.

681
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
You…

682
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,440
won't say that word to me again, right?

683
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,240
Not ever again.

684
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,120
I've said it enough.

685
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,800
You're not the only one who was sad.

686
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,160
I…

687
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,240
almost went mad with grief…

688
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,200
when I broke up with you.

689
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,240
I'm hurting too.

690
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,920
I'm sorry…

691
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:23,920
for being so self-centered.

692
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,480
I just wanted…

693
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,480
to open your eyes.

694
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,200
Techno said…

695
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,600
I didn't have to do it.

696
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,080
That there was no need
to play Lhong's game.

697
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,080
But I couldn't let him fool you anymore.

698
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,400
And I…

699
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,840
didn't want to wait for the day
he'd tear us apart.

700
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,080
So you…

701
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,400
broke up with me first.

702
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,200
I'm sorry.

703
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,800
You hurt me.

704
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,320
I'm sorry.

705
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,320
You drove me crazy.

706
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:16,960
I'm sorry.

707
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,080
My family was very worried.

708
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,000
What do you want?

709
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,920
I got down on my knees and begged you,

710
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,400
but you still left me.

711
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,440
I stopped going to class for a week.

712
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,880
I stopped playing at Khong's bar too.

713
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,640
Sorry.

714
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,320
If Thorn hadn't told me…

715
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,720
I would've been clueless until now.

716
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,600
Damn, Thorn.

717
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,320
He promised.

718
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,960
You must pay for what you did.

719
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,560
What do you want me to do?

720
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,360
Should I get down on my knees
and apologize?

721
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,040
You must get back together with me.

722
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,200
And stay with me forever.

723
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,280
Let's be together.

724
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,560
Let's be together
for the rest of our lives.

725
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,440
When I said I didn't want to
get in deeper…

726
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,920
it wasn't because I wanted
to break up with you…

727
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,880
but I was afraid my love for you
would stop me from keeping to the plan.

728
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,440
What did you say?

729
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,360
Why do you ask?

730
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,440
Because you said…

731
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,520
you loved me.

732
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,800
I never said I loved you?

733
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,840
You never did.

734
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,280
Then, that was my way of saying it.

735
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,240
Come on, Type. Don't cheat.

736
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:41,440
Say it again.

737
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:42,720
Please.

738
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,640
Please.

739
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,640
Listen carefully.

740
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,240
I won't repeat it.

741
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,920
I love you…

742
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,880
you asshole, Tharn.

743
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,000
Crybaby.

744
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,360
Why are you crying?

745
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,560
Come here.

746
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,720
Be gentle!

747
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,000
Then, stay still.

748
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:19,320
You're hurting me.

749
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,720
You usually like the pain.

750
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,880
Now you're complaining?

751
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,360
How many punches did you take?

752
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,480
No idea.

753
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,080
I lost count after the third punch.

754
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,840
Didn't know a skinny guy like him
could throw some heavy punches.

755
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,880
You can hit me.

756
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:47,280
Playing the hero again?

757
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,120
Why don't you hit Lhong for me instead?

758
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,360
If you do that, I'll call you a hero.

759
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:00,560
You can't.

760
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,520
Because he's still your friend.

761
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,960
It's not that I can't do it.

762
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,160
But I just…

763
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,400
I just don't want to see him again.

764
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,040
I don't want to know what else
he did behind my back…

765
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,680
or who else he hurt.

766
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,240
Forget it.

767
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,280
Lhong…

768
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,800
wasn't like this before.

769
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,440
He was quiet

770
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,480
and didn't like being around people.

771
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,600
I was the one who approached him.

772
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,160
I was jealous of him

773
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:51,960
because his family gave him freedom.

774
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,040
He could do anything

775
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,680
and study whatever he wanted.

776
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,600
But now…

777
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,880
I've realized
there was nothing to be jealous of.

778
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,160
Nobody paid attention to him at all.

779
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,880
Lhong told me…

780
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,040
he wasn't lonely…

781
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,360
because I was his friend.

782
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,920
I should've known…

783
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,080
how he was feeling.

784
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,200
I've already made it up to you.

785
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,240
Now it's your turn.

786
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,080
How?

787
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,080
With this.

788
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,080
More?

789
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,360
Don't ask.

790
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:08,680
It's your ex.

791
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:10,960
Tar?

792
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,960
Techno told Tar everything.

793
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,600
So he wanted to say sorry…

794
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,960
for making us fight.

795
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,520
And…

796
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,320
he's gonna study in France.

797
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,200
Is that so?

798
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,040
Why?

799
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,720
Feeling regretful?

800
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:47,640
No.

801
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,600
Don't start a fight.

802
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,320
I'm not starting a fight.

803
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:57,480
He also said…

804
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,440
he told me everything

805
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,680
because he planned to study abroad.

806
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,320
Good thing it's over.

807
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:18,480
What's wrong?

808
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,280
Tell Tar something for me.

809
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:28,600
Tell him…

810
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,800
I'm sorry for everything.

811
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,960
I'm not that jealous, you know?

812
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,160
I knew a hero like you
would say something like that.

813
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:53,720
So, will you tell him yourself,
or you want me to do it?

814
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,200
Tell him for me.

815
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:08,560
Let's go. I'm hungry.

816
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,200
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH IN THIS LIFE,
SO LET'S COMPETE IN OUR NEXT LIVES.

817
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,400
Dream on.

818
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,880
Whether it's this life or the next,
you'll never beat me.

819
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,000
Why are you talking to yourself?

820
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:27,640
You're so annoying, Tharn.

821
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:29,960
What do you mean? Let me see.

822
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,120
No.

823
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,440
Let me see.

824
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,520
No.

825
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,840
I'll show you in the next life.

826
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,240
What do you mean "next life"?

827
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:40,240
Type!

828
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,560
Come in.

829
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,200
What are you doing?

830
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:05,760
Drawing.

831
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,320
Why are you still up?

832
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,320
You have an early flight tomorrow morning.

833
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,120
I'll go to bed soon.

834
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:19,200
Now that you're here,
I have a present for you.

835
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,320
-What is it?
-It's here.

836
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,120
What's that?

837
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,600
-It's…
-It's…

838
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:34,320
this.

839
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,080
As promised.

840
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:48,280
I made you look handsome.

841
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,400
You made yourself look too handsome.

842
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,640
You should go to bed.

843
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,400
When you're there,

844
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,520
take good care of yourself, okay?

845
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,000
You can't go to bed late anymore.

846
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:15,280
Okay.

847
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:18,280
And…

848
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,400
eat regularly and don't skip meals.

849
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:29,160
Because if you get sick,
who will take care of you?

850
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,160
The weather there
is a lot colder than here.

851
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,680
You have to keep yourself warm, okay?

852
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,800
Cover yourself with a thick blanket
when you go to bed.

853
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:02,840
Okay.

854
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:09,720
Tum.

855
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:18,080
I'm sorry.

856
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,640
You're sorry?

857
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:27,240
Why are you apologizing to me?

858
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,160
Well…

859
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,840
I'm sorry…

860
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,920
I never told you anything.

861
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:45,760
Don't worry.

862
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:53,720
Actually, I just want you to know
that whatever happens,

863
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,680
I'll always be there for you.

864
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:00,920
That's enough for me.

865
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,040
No need to apologize.

866
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,080
Thank you.

867
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,280
Tum.

868
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,840
I am who I am today…

869
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,160
because of you.

870
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,480
You're the most important person
in my life.

871
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,240
And you're the one I love…

872
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:55,760
the most in the world.

873
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,560
Cheers!

874
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,600
Damn.

875
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,240
We came here today to watch
you, you, and you.

876
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,080
But you've disbanded?

877
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,240
That's right. I chose to come here
instead of watching a live comeback show.

878
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,240
Come on, bro.

879
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,280
So…

880
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,400
Did Lhong really drop out?

881
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,240
Do we really have to find a new singer?

882
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,760
Who's going to replace him?

883
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:45,080
I don't know.

884
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:51,840
No serious topics today.

885
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,640
We're here to drink.

886
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,880
You'll find a new singer. Right, Champ?

887
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,480
The hell did you say? I don't understand.

888
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,800
What?

889
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,960
Seriously, Champ.

890
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,480
When will you stop eating?

891
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,680
Damn it, you eat like a pig.

892
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:11,200
Techno, stop complaining. I'm hungry.

893
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,080
Look at your skinny bones and my muscles.
My body needs more food.

894
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,400
Leave my skinny bones alone.

895
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,080
So, aren't you gonna play a song at least?

896
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,640
Don't waste my trip.

897
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,680
-Come on.
-Give me time, Khlui.

898
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,800
What are you going to do? Need my help?

899
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,240
It's okay, Song.

900
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,600
Tonight…

901
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,360
let me handle it.

902
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,720
What's he gonna do?

903
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,240
How would I know?
I'm sitting here with you.

904
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,480
You prick.

905
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:12,280
<i>Woke up this morning</i>
<i>To a world that seemed different</i>

906
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,840
<i>The alarm clock woke me up</i>
<i>Like it usually does</i>

907
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,120
<i>You are peacefully sleeping</i>
<i>Not knowing what was in my mind</i>

908
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,480
<i>I'm letting you dwell on your sweet dreams</i>

909
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,480
<i>Thinking of the time we stared</i>
<i>Into each other's eyes</i>

910
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,800
<i>Without uttering a word</i>

911
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:44,080
<i>The way you looked at me</i>
<i>Was the proof of our love</i>

912
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:50,760
<i>With all the good times we've shared</i>
<i>Do you feel the same way I do?</i>

913
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,080
<i>Should I keep it to myself?</i>

914
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:02,960
<i>Or should I tell you?</i>

915
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,600
<i>I want you to be my last love</i>

916
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:17,360
<i>And the one who will be</i>
<i>With me every step of the way</i>

917
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,680
<i>I will never ever hurt you</i>

918
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:27,200
<i>Do you hear me, my love?</i>

919
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:36,440
<i>Please don't let go of my hand</i>

920
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:51,720
<i>No matter what happens</i>
<i>Please believe in me</i>

921
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:58,040
<i>No matter how tough things get</i>
<i>We will make it through together</i>

922
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,840
<i>Because I know our meeting</i>
<i>Was not a coincidence or a dream</i>

923
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:10,320
<i>And today I have come to a decision</i>

924
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:17,680
<i>From now on, I want you to be</i>

925
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,800
<i>I want you to be my last love</i>

926
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:35,440
<i>And the one who will be</i>
<i>With me every step of the way</i>

927
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,760
<i>I will never ever hurt you…</i>

928
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,360
Tharn…

929
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:44,240
<i>Do you hear me, my love?</i>

930
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:47,960
I'm sorry.

931
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,480
<i>If the world falls apart,please remember…</i>

932
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:53,880
I'm sorry.

933
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:01,240
<i>My love for you will never change</i>
<i>You can rest assured</i>

934
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:06,240
<i>The two of us will walk side by side</i>

935
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:10,920
<i>As long as you love me</i>

936
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,200
<i>As long as you hold my hand</i>

937
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:34,080
<i>Please don't let go of my hand</i>

938
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,280
So romantic.

939
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:46,880
What?

940
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,840
-What?
-So happy.

941
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,960
The flowers make me happy.

942
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:57,160
-Nice smile.
-That's for sure.

943
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,080
-What did you think?
-Cheesy.

944
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,280
But I know you liked it.

945
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:09,800
That's too much.

946
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,080
Let's drink.

947
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
Cheers!

948
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:17,960
You've turned red. Just kidding.

949
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:36,880
Wait for a bit.

950
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,080
Are you sleepy?

951
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,080
No.

952
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:47,960
Then…

953
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,760
are you hungry?

954
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,200
In the end,

955
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,280
I actually did fall in love with you.

956
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,320
And you'll keep loving me.

957
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,880
Corny.

958
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,320
So…

959
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,280
are you hungry?

960
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,040
No.

961
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,800
I ate too much to be hungry.

962
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:33,360
I mean…

963
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:35,240
are you hungry for me?

964
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,240
You're always trying to have sex with me.

965
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,400
I'm trying to show you my love.

966
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,080
Shut up.

967
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,680
-Let's go home.
-Sure, let's go.

968
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,240
One more thing.

969
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,240
Don't let go of my hand again.

970
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,920
Hold on tight.

971
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:37,440
THREE YEARS LATER.

972
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:46,720
WHERE ARE YOU? CLASS OVER YET?

973
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:49,360
ALREADY LEFT. HEADING TO THE FIELD NOW.

974
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,800
You're leaving?

975
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:05,280
So, why are you here
if you're not playing soccer?

976
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:08,400
I forgot my stuff in the locker.

977
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,880
Perfect timing. Let's have dinner.

978
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,480
Good offer at a buffet place,
four people for the price of three.

979
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:17,800
I'll eat for two.

980
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,040
Champ.

981
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,600
What the hell? Are you crazy?

982
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,520
Wanna come?

983
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,560
Sorry, my driver's almost here.

984
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,040
I'll be your driver…

985
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,640
if you ride with me.

986
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:44,640
So you have a date with your hubby.

987
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,240
This is why Can was whining.

988
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,880
What do you mean?

989
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,960
Can said you drove
a four-million-baht Audi…

990
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,040
but couldn't afford to buy him
a 40-baht meal.

991
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,360
You wallet costs 15,000 baht,

992
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:06,920
but you couldn't afford to buy
a five-baht grilled pork.

993
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:13,040
You paid 2,000 baht per person
for an international buffet.

994
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,400
-But…
-But Tharn paid for it.

995
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,760
No shame at all.

996
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,520
And I don't mind paying at all.

997
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,800
We'd better go.

998
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,760
See you.

999
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,800
Good luck.

1000
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,080
You assholes!

1001
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,720
Treat me too, damn it!

1002
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,280
Am I your friend or what?

1003
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,160
Come on, I'll eat you.

1004
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,680
What? Eat me?

1005
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,400
-I mean, I'll eat with you.
-Okay.

1006
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,200
Man, it's so cold.
I've got chills down my spine.

1007
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:11,960
Pete.

1008
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,880
Tin, you're here to pick Can up?

1009
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,840
And you?

1010
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,720
I'm heading home, Tin.

1011
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,680
Tharn, Type, hello.

1012
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:29,480
What's up? Here to pick Can up?

1013
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,080
He went to take a dump. We just met him.
Might have to wait long.

1014
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:34,800
I'll wait at the soccer field.

1015
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,280
Ever since he kissed you that day,

1016
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,720
you've been more straightforward.

1017
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,680
Because he's mine.

1018
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,760
I have to go. See you on Monday.

1019
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,080
Okay, Tin.

1020
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,760
Tharn, Type,

1021
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:55,480
well…

1022
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:59,040
I have something to ask you two.

1023
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,440
So…

1024
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,840
are you two together?

1025
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:14,280
Why are you embarrassed
when you're the one asking?

1026
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:17,600
Remember what I told you?

1027
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,000
You always get what you hate.

1028
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:24,000
Before now…

1029
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:26,280
Type and I…

1030
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,280
used to fight a lot.

1031
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:33,240
I'm sure you already knew that.
We'd better go.

1032
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,480
Okay.

1033
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:38,000
Bye.

1034
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,240
Those kids are funny
every time we see them.

1035
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,400
Hilarious. Especially their boyfriends.

1036
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,160
But Pete's is not as funny as Can's.

1037
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:03,080
Aren't you gonna ask
about what I said to him?

1038
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,560
Ask?

1039
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,080
Ask what?

1040
01:27:08,720 --> 01:27:09,720
Forget it.

1041
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,760
If you don't ask, I won't tell you.

1042
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,040
Then, I'll ask.

1043
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,600
You used to say you hated me.

1044
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:24,240
How about now?

1045
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,640
I hate you more than ever.

1046
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,520
You sure about that?

1047
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:31,520
Yeah.

1048
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,760
Keep saying you hate me.

1049
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,720
Because I know…

1050
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,240
that you…

1051
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,480
love me.

1052
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,040
I hate you.

1053
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:49,120
That means you love me.

1054
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:51,720
I hate you so much.

1055
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:54,680
It means you love me so much.

1056
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,920
I hate you more than anyone in the world.

1057
01:27:58,240 --> 01:27:59,320
That means…

1058
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,560
you love me more than anyone in the world.

1059
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,720
It's as you said.

1060
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:46,520
I love you.

1061
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:52,320
I love you too.
