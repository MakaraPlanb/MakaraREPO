1
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,520
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, FAI?

2
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
HELPING MY MOM COOK.

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,800
A DOMESTIC GODDESS!

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,880
I MADE YELLOW CURRY TODAY.

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,720
I WANNA TRY IT.

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
I'LL COOK ONE FOR YOU NEXT TIME.

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,080
Type!

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,280
What are you doing?

9
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,160
Let's play!

10
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,960
Okay, I'm coming.

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,920
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, TYPE?

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,160
THINKING OF YOU.

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
Have you eaten?

14
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,880
When did you get back?

15
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,560
A little while ago.

16
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,680
So, have you eaten yet?

17
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,080
I brought you spicy stir-fried noodle.
It's in the fridge.

18
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
How do you know what I want to eat?

19
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,000
It's the spiciest dish on the menu.

20
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
And how do you know I like spicy food?

21
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Come on, Type.

22
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,480
Whenever you eat rice,

23
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,280
you always add tons of chili fish sauce.

24
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,960
Whenever you eat noodles,

25
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,720
you keep adding chili powder
until the soup turns red.

26
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
Whenever you're deciding where to eat,

27
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,360
you always pick
Southern Thai food restaurants.

28
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,120
There's no way I wouldn't know
you like spicy food.

29
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
What about you?

30
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,360
What about me?

31
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Can you eat spicy food?

32
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,840
You want to know about me?

33
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,880
I can eat spicy food,

34
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,200
but not as much as you.

35
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,800
I love drinking soft drinks,

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,680
but not every day
so my blood sugar doesn't rise.

37
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,080
I love fried eggs. Sunny-side up only.

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't eat over-hard eggs.

39
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,960
I only want jam on my toast, no butter.

40
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
And western food is my favorite.

41
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,880
I love steak, lasagna, and spaghetti.

42
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,640
They're all my favorites.

43
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
I only asked you one question.

44
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
I already ate.

45
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
But I'll eat your food later tonight.

46
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't want to be ungrateful.

47
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,360
Type?

48
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,520
Type!

49
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,680
What?

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Are you free this Friday?
I'll be playing at Jeed's bar.

51
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,280
She invited you too.

52
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you helping your senior's band again?

53
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,880
I have another gig the day after tomorrow.

54
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,880
But…

55
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
the place is far,
so I don't think you should come.

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,600
Sounds interesting.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,440
I can finally find out
if Jeed's lying or not.

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
What did she say?

59
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,520
That you're a kick-ass drummer.

60
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,120
Definitely lying.

61
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm just an ordinary guy
who likes to play drums.

62
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Okay, I'll go.

63
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,520
So I can see what you mean by "ordinary."

64
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
What about you?

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,680
How much will you make
from helping your senior's band?

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,240
Jeed asked me
when you're gonna form a new band.

67
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
She's waiting.

68
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,960
It's almost ready.

69
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
We've just recruited a talented guitarist.

70
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,920
So, Friday, all right?

71
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay, all right.

72
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,880
I won't miss it.
You don't need to repeat yourself.

73
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,760
Where do I go?

74
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Damn, they never told me which room.

75
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,160
This is the right place, isn't it?

76
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
Techno?

77
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
What are you doing here?

78
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Thank you, God.

79
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,560
You sent this handsome angel to save me.

80
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
What are you talking about?

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
I mean this, Tharn.

82
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,040
A student union member asked me
to deliver this document here.

83
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,560
But I can't find the room.

84
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,960
Help me, Tharn.

85
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Please.

86
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,400
Okay.

87
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,560
But why do you have to deliver it?

88
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,520
Are you an SU member?

89
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,880
No, I'm not.

90
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,440
I was just napping at the union's office.

91
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,800
The SU president showed up
and threw me the envelope.

92
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,600
He said,

93
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,000
"Don't sleep your life away around here!

94
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Make yourself useful!"

95
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,160
That's why I had to leave
the air-conditioned room

96
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,720
and walk across campus
to your faculty building.

97
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,200
It must be my unlucky day.

98
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
By the way,

99
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,880
don't you have class after this?

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
No.

101
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,800
But I have music rehearsal.

102
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,160
Sounds interesting.

103
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,200
After you help me deliver the document,

104
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,280
can I go with you? Please.

105
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,000
-You serious?
-Hell yeah!

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,240
Come on,
I've been waiting for this moment.

107
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,080
Are you happy now?

108
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,880
Super dope!

109
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,480
You totally kick ass!

110
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,560
Tharn, teach me.

111
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,360
I want to play drums.

112
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
Sure.

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,560
Type never said you were a superb drummer.

114
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Otherwise,
I would've come here a long time ago.

115
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,560
Speaking of Type…

116
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,000
Screw him.

117
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,320
Right now…

118
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
he must be busy flirting with that girl.

119
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,080
What's the matter?

120
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,080
Did you…

121
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,400
just say…

122
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,080
Type's flirting with a girl?

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,600
I… didn't say anything.

124
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,920
You must be hearing things.

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,120
FAMOUS CAFE JOHN
FOOD - WINE - COFFEE

126
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,600
Hey.

127
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,560
Sorry, I'm very late.

128
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,480
It's okay, I can always wait for you.

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Does that mean I'm really late?

130
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,000
I didn't mean it that way.

131
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Come on, what do you want to eat?

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Anything's fine. Up to you.

133
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,440
Usually, when women say "anything's fine,"

134
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,240
they've already made a decision, right?

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,680
I haven't seen the menu.
How can I make a decision?

136
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm not talking about the menu.

137
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Then, what are you talking about?

138
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
About…

139
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,560
you choosing me.

140
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,600
Cocky.

141
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,120
Come on, let's order.

142
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,560
TECHNO

143
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
What do you want to eat?

144
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,200
Anything's fine.

145
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
I want to recommend a dish.

146
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,600
-What is it?
-Let me see. This.

147
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,760
Crispy fried chicken.

148
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,200
Tharn.

149
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,280
Why were you sitting in the dark?

150
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,200
I thought you were a ghost.

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,160
Where have you been?

152
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,840
I was eating out with a friend.

153
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,400
What friend?

154
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
Just a friend.

155
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,200
A girl, right?

156
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,360
It's none of your business.

157
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,560
How come it's not my business?

158
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
You went out with a woman!

159
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,040
Why are you raising your voice?

160
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
Where were you? Who were you with?

161
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,080
You're not my parent.

162
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,040
I can go wherever I want.
It has nothing to do with you.

163
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
I'm just asking.

164
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,400
Can't you tell me?

165
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,720
But I don't like your tone and attitude.

166
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,680
I never asked where you were
or who you were with.

167
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,680
So you have no right to ask me that!

168
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,160
You're not telling me…

169
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,840
because you went out with a girl, right?

170
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,280
You're seeing someone else, right?

171
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,840
-None of your business!
-But you're mine!

172
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm not yours!

173
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,520
Don't you look at me like that.

174
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
You and I are just sex friends.

175
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
I can fall in love or flirt with anyone.

176
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,120
It's my life.

177
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,400
You have no right to stop me.

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,280
You don't own me.

179
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,240
You're saying it's not my business,
even if you screw someone else?

180
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,440
Yeah!

181
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,200
It's not your business,
even if I screw someone else.

182
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,240
So it's none of your business…

183
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,280
if I screw someone else too.

184
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Yeah!

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Your love life. I won't interfere with it.

186
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,920
You used to say…

187
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
that I screw around.

188
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,120
-And now you're doing it.
-Son of a bitch!

189
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,120
You tell me…

190
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,400
to screw around…

191
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,520
to sleep with someone else.

192
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
But I won't do it.

193
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,120
Because you're the only one for me.

194
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,080
I have you.

195
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
Why would I want anyone else?

196
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,120
So what's wrong…

197
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,160
with being jealous?

198
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,680
Bear this in mind.

199
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm not gay!

200
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,800
I like women.

201
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
If you're not okay with me
seeing someone else,

202
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,080
then we're through!

203
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
Another fight?

204
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,560
Be quiet! I can't hear them.

205
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,160
Khlui, Seo…

206
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,400
can I sleep here tonight?

207
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,800
Fighting with Tharn?

208
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,360
I'll fly to Korea to cry for you.

209
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,360
I'm living with the crazy ones.

210
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,480
Bestie.

211
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,320
What's wrong? You seem off today.

212
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,040
I thought class was canceled.

213
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,840
What are you doing here?

214
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,320
I'm fine.

215
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,120
You're acting really weird today.

216
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Normally, you're calm and quiet.

217
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,920
But today you're as still as a wax figure.

218
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,360
Someone might whack your head
and drag you to his cave.

219
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,120
Don't say I didn't warn you.

220
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
Not funny.

221
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,280
What's the matter?

222
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,960
Tell me about it.

223
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,880
It's nothing.

224
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
I couldn't sleep last night.

225
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,640
So I watched live concert videos
all night long.

226
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,600
You did it again.

227
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
What about you?

228
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,000
Why are you here?

229
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,560
You knew the professor canceled the class.

230
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,120
I found out after I'd already left home.

231
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,840
What about you?

232
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,920
Your dorm's a few feet away.

233
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,360
If I were you,

234
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I would've gone back
to sleep like the dead.

235
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,120
10 RULES FOR CASUAL RELATIONSHIPS.

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,680
3. DON'T CROSS THE LINE
4. CAN BECOME EXCLUSIVE, BUT NOT NECESSARY

238
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,640

241
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,160
9. BF/GF IS THE PRIORITY
10. IF YOU GET CAUGHT, IT'S GAME OVER

242
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,880
WILL YOU STOP DOING NUMBER SIX?

243
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,160
I'll go buy some drinks.

244
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,720
You'll stay here, right?

245
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,840
I'm leaving, Lhong.

246
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm skipping afternoon classes.

247
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
Tharn…

248
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,520
Tharn…

249
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,960
Here's your ball.

250
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,520
If you have something to say, spit it out.

251
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
So…

252
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,880
I have something to confess.

253
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,440
What is it?

254
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
I told Tharn.

255
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Told him what?

256
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,560
That you and Puifai are seeing each other.

257
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,520
I tried to give you a heads-up.

258
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
But you didn't pick up my call.

259
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,000
All right! I didn't mean to say it.

260
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,360
I went to his faculty building
the other day.

261
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,880
And I sort of let it slip.

262
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,080
I told him you're interested in a girl.

263
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,560
Did you have a big fight with him?

264
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,840
I'm the worst.

265
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,600
I'm a snitch,
a blabbermouth, a chatterbox.

266
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,040
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Why are you apologizing?

268
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,800
You're not angry with me?

269
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,840
He's not my boyfriend.

270
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,880
I can go out with whomever I want.

271
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,240
Whether he likes it or not,
he has no right to stop me.

272
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
One more thing.

273
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,200
Stop acting like I'm a cheater
who's just been caught.

274
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,960
Type.

275
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,480
When Tharn found out,
he was really upset with you.

276
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,920
So what?

277
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,280
It has nothing to do with me.

278
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,040
You're right.

279
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,000
He likes you,
but you don't feel the same way.

280
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,240
Your love life doesn't
concern him at all, right?

281
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
It's better this way.

282
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,720
He can finally get over you.

283
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,760
Where were you aiming?

284
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,040
Go fetch it.

285
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,160
Damn it.

286
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,680
What the hell is wrong with me?

287
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,440
Yeah, what is wrong with you?
Talking to yourself.

288
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
How long are you going to stand there?

289
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,800
I'm waiting for an answer.

290
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
Here's the answer.

291
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,160
Casual lovers.

292
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
You sure you won't act
like an idiot again?

293
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,040
I think it's easier this way.

294
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,200
If I'm horny, I'll just have sex with you
to blow off some steam.

295
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,040
And if you're horny, just tell me.

296
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
It's better if we keep it simple.

297
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,360
Good!

298
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,800
You've finally come to your senses.

299
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,120
{\an8}ARE YOU FREE ON WEDNESDAY?

300
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,720
I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR YOU.

301
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,440
Type, remember the Lod Chong
we talked about?

302
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,360
I've found a great place that sells it.
Let's go there together next time.

303
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
Type?

304
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,920
Type!

305
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,960
What were you saying?

306
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,880
Are you okay?

307
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm fine.

308
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,320
Then, tell me, what was I talking about?

309
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,280
Stray cats at your condo?

310
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,800
Wrong.

311
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,600
A new romantic movie?

312
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,360
Also wrong.

313
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,720
Flickering street lights in your alley?

314
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,080
Still wrong.

315
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,960
I was talking about Lod Chong.

316
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,920
Were you thinking about other girls?

317
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,000
No.

318
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,400
What made you think that?

319
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,760
I was just thinking about my dog.

320
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,280
This morning, my mom called to tell me
that he had died.

321
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,600
Really?

322
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,320
How old was he?

323
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm sorry, Fai.

324
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,200
I don't want to talk about it.

325
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
He was like family to me.

326
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,960
I'm sorry for your loss.

327
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,360
Handsy, aren't you?

328
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,640
No, just wanted to hold your hand.

329
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,640
Are you free this Friday?

330
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,680
Why?

331
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,840
It's my birthday.

332
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Really?

333
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
Really.

334
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,360
But I don't know anyone
who wants to celebrate with me.

335
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,200
Everybody's busy, including my parents.

336
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,360
I'm so lonely.

337
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,440
It would be great if someone
could spend the day with me.

338
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,720
Poor you.

339
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,680
Getting blown off by your friends.

340
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,960
Does this mean that you can't come too?

341
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,480
It's your birthday. Of course, I'm free.

342
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,640
So you'll come, right?

343
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,200
Pinky promise.

344
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,280
Don't break your promise.

345
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,840
What are you doing?

346
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,000
We have a deal, remember?

347
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,960
Get off me.

348
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,240
SO YOU'RE FREE THIS FRIDAY, RIGHT?

349
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,880
You're really good at this.

350
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,720
What?

351
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,360
Even when I'm on top of you…

352
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,240
you can still talk to someone else.

353
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,360
Tharn.

354
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,320
This Friday…

355
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,600
My gig starts at 7:00.

356
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,320
I can't make it.

357
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,080
It's Puifai's birthday.

358
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,920
It's okay.

359
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,280
I'll tell Jeed you're busy.

360
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,560
I'll ask Puifai to be my girlfriend.

361
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,080
Good luck.

362
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:44,000
And let me know how it goes.

363
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,040
So I'll know how to act around you.

364
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Don't forget to buy her a present.

365
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,920
Or you'll get dumped
before she's even your girlfriend.

366
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,960
Honey.

367
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,680
-What?
-It's raining outside.

368
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,200
-What! Stop it!
-It's so romantic. Let's go home.

369
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,440
What's the matter with him?

370
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,960
I don't know.

371
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,320
He's been drinking
ever since he got off the stage.

372
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,560
He doesn't hear what we're saying?

373
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,120
He's distracted.
Try insulting him, he won't even notice.

374
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
Tharn!

375
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,320
Hello.

376
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,440
Are you okay?

377
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm okay.

378
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,880
I was just lost in thought.

379
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,680
Of course you are.

380
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,320
You've been like this
since you were on the stage.

381
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,480
Everyone's gone home,
but you're still sitting here.

382
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,040
I'm sorry, Jeed.

383
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,880
Was…

384
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
my performance that terrible?

385
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,840
It's not about that.

386
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,320
Your performance was amazing as always.

387
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,280
All the women had hungry eyes for you.

388
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,080
Wait, how did you know that?

389
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,520
Relax, I was observing
the audience for him.

390
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,280
You sure it wasn't for yourself?

391
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,840
Come on, Jeed. Why would I do that?

392
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,240
You are my young, beautiful,
and shapely wife.

393
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
I can never get enough of you.

394
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,560
-What!
-Tharn can hear you!

395
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,080
He's our friend. He doesn't mind.

396
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,560
Tharn…

397
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,360
you were distracted
because of that handsome boy, right?

398
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
Who?

399
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,200
New boyfriend?

400
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,840
No, he's not.

401
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,440
They're seeing each other, Khong.

402
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,240
I like him, though.

403
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,880
Tall, dark, handsome…

404
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,160
So perfect!

405
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,280
Jeed.

406
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,840
Your husband's right here.

407
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,440
I observed for Tharn.

408
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,760
Just like you did earlier.

409
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,280
Always arguing.

410
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,080
Let's change the subject.

411
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,480
So…

412
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Who is this guy?

413
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,520
He's the one who…

414
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,400
will never love me…

415
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,680
no matter how hard I try.

416
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,600
Stop making that face.

417
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,640
I won't die from heartbreak.

418
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,480
But too many heartbreaks can kill you.

419
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
This is insane.

420
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
It's getting too dramatic.

421
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,360
Let's change the subject. We're in a bar.

422
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,240
We're here to drink.
No serious conversation.

423
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,920
Come on!

424
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,480
Happy birthday.

425
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Thank you, Type.

426
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,960
Open it.

427
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,080
When did you buy it?

428
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
Not telling you.

429
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,840
So cute! I really like it.

430
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
I'm glad to hear that.

431
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,400
I was afraid that you wouldn't like it.

432
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,040
Of course I like it. I really do.

433
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,840
Then, please think of me when you hug it.

434
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,640
Why do I have to do that?

435
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,880
This little bear's cuter than you.

436
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,680
I'm not cute? Give it back now.

437
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,360
You can't do that. It's mine now.

438
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,960
No, give it back.

439
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,560
You're not cute…

440
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,560
but you're very handsome, you know that?

441
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,080
You're also…

442
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,760
very pretty.

443
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,120
Happy birthday.

444
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,240
Opportunistic.

445
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,120
Yes, I am.

446
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,160
I'm going to the restroom.

447
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,960
Can't stand a womanizer.

448
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
Hold it for me.

449
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,160
Hurry back.

450
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,000
Tharn might like this place.

451
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,560
You need to hurry back?

452
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
No.

453
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,920
The dorm curfew is at 11:00,
there's still plenty of time.

454
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,960
Why don't you move off campus?
It's more convenient.

455
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,720
My dad wants me to live on campus
for the first year,

456
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,320
so I can make lots of friends.

457
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,200
I can't live like that.

458
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,000
On-campus dorms have curfews.

459
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,160
Off-campus dorms are more convenient.

460
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,440
You can invite friends to sleep over
without feeling guilty.

461
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,880
So, if I miss the curfew…

462
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,160
can I sleep over at your place?

463
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,320
You've got to be kidding me.

464
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,160
Just kidding.

465
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,160
What kind of a man do you think I am?

466
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,440
You made a serious face.

467
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,720
You call this serious?

468
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,520
-Yes.
-I was kidding. Let's eat.

469
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,840
Thank you for walking me back.

470
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,160
Don't mention it.

471
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,040
It's dangerous for a girl
to travel alone at night.

472
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,640
Worried about me?

473
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,920
It's a secret.

474
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,040
Is this your condo?

475
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Why?

476
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,400
It's beautiful.

477
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
The condo?

478
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,640
I mean you.

479
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,880
You really…

480
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,600
What?

481
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,040
Just kidding. I meant the condo.

482
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,320
Do you want to come up?

483
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,120
You can consider this place
when you want to move off campus.

484
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,120
Sure.

485
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,320
I may move here next year.

486
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm sorry, Tharn.

487
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm sorry.

488
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm really sorry.

489
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,440
Why are you apologizing?

490
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,240
I slept with Puifai.

491
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,960
She invited me to her room.

492
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,120
Suddenly,

493
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,640
I remembered what I said to you.

494
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
That you can have sex with anybody.

495
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,080
It's none of my business.

496
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,160
It pains me.

497
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,720
Why?

498
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,600
I don't know.

499
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,680
The thought of you being with another man…

500
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,360
drives me crazy.

501
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,920
Why?

502
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,640
While I was hugging her soft body…

503
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,600
I kept thinking about yours.

504
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,160
While I was kissing her…

505
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,560
all I thought about were your kisses.

506
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,760
Whenever I'm with her…

507
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm always thinking of you.

508
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,440
Did you really sleep with her?

509
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,000
I couldn't do it, Tharn.

510
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,960
Do you hear me?

511
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,160
I can't sleep with women anymore.

512
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,960
Maybe you're just tired.

513
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,800
No.

514
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,120
I wasn't tired.

515
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,920
Maybe you're just…

516
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,320
not into her.

517
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
I'm not interested in any woman at all.

518
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,200
Maybe you'll find other men interesting.

519
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,040
You wanna die?

520
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm a man…

521
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,360
who doesn't want to sleep
with any other men.

522
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,240
I can only do it with you.

523
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,240
So…

524
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,000
You're the only one I want to sleep with.

525
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,080
Please forgive me.

526
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
Forgive me one more time.

527
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,080
Good boy.

528
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,640
You already know…

529
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,640
that I…

530
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,560
could never be angry with you.

531
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,160
So…

532
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,400
You're mine now.

533
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,080
It's you who are mine.

534
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,880
Because I won't let you go again.

535
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,200
You already know…

536
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,520
that I…

537
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,760
have always been yours.

538
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,360
Is this how you make it up to me?

539
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,760
It's the only way I know.

540
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,280
Are you okay?

541
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm not.

542
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,680
Type said he couldn't do it.

543
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,080
What?

544
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,680
He couldn't hug me.

545
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,520
Impossible.

546
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,600
He looked like he could eat you whole.

547
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,480
Calm down.

548
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,400
Tell me what happened.

549
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,040
I saw you on Instagram
celebrating your birthday with him.

550
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,720
Type's already dating someone.

551
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
He said he couldn't be with me.

552
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,760
He couldn't hurt his partner.

553
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,120
What about me, Mai?

554
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,200
I get hurt, too.

555
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,920
I was very serious about him.

556
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,360
How could he do this to me?

557
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,120
It's okay.

558
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,920
Don't cry.

559
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,320
I'm here.

560
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,320
Don't cry.

561
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,760
I told her I'd never see her again.

562
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,280
After I came back,
I deleted her number and everything.

563
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,680
Even if I wanted her back,
she wouldn't have me.

564
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,760
Why?

565
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,000
I told her I'm dating someone.

566
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,760
That's what I said.

567
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,240
I told her that
when I was in bed with her.

568
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,760
And she slapped me.

569
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,640
The slap was nothing
compared to what I did to her.

570
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,400
Will you be okay…

571
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,920
dating a gay guy like me?

572
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,600
Honestly, I really don't know.

573
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,120
I've been straight my entire life.

574
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,120
I feel like I have sex with a man
because I'm desperate.

575
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,120
Sorry.

576
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,840
You know I have a dirty mouth.

577
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,680
Don't get mad.

578
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,360
Actually…

579
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,160
when you returned…

580
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,560
I was going to break if off with you.

581
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,120
But seeing you now…

582
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,240
I'll never ever break up with you.

583
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,520
Shocked?

584
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,000
Of course, I'm shocked.

585
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,160
Because you were going
to break it off with me.

586
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,920
But I'd been afraid for the whole week.

587
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,280
Because I thought
you'd break up with me first.

588
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm sorry.

589
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,400
I won't act like a dick again.

590
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,080
You still have some self-awareness.

591
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,080
Next semester,

592
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,680
do you want to move off campus with me?

593
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,480
My dad won't let me.

594
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,360
I'll pay the rent myself.

595
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,440
I want to hear you scream
without holding back.

596
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,160
I bet you'll be sexy.

597
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,280
Want me to kick your ass?

598
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,840
I really mean it.

599
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,280
How can a man like me be sexy?

600
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,480
You don't need to know.

601
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,880
I'll keep it to myself.

602
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,560
You must be the jealous type.

603
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,400
Can you date this jealous type guy?

604
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,000
I let you have your way with me.
What do you think?

605
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,480
Then, let me have my way
with you all night.

606
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,480
Whatever.

607
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,720
Are you okay?

608
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,160
Type, the food's cold.

609
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,920
Want me to reheat it?

610
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,840
It's okay. I don't mind.

611
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,520
You haven't looked me in the eyes today.

612
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,520
Why'd you kick me?

613
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,320
Let go of my leg.

614
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,880
Want me to let go?

615
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,440
Look me in the eyes first.

616
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,800
Come on.

617
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,120
I did. Let me go.

618
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,720
Longer than that.

619
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,600
Are you going to do it? Come on.

620
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,600
Tharn, that tickles.

621
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,960
Look me in the eyes first.

622
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,320
I'm looking.

623
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,960
I give up.

624
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,280
This is embarrassing.

625
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,280
Are you happy now?

626
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,840
I'm happy you remember last night.

627
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,520
How could I forget it?

628
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,680
So you remember…

629
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,720
that you and I…

630
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,000
I remember everything.

631
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,280
I remember that we…

632
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,280
are together.

633
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,680
Having fun?

634
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,000
Yes.

635
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,440
If you're having fun…

636
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,560
then continue.

637
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:46,920
Type…

638
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,400
I'm gonna take a nap.

639
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,280
Sweet dreams.

640
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,640
TELL THE TRUTH
TA - PERSONAL AREA - LET'S CELEBRATE

641
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,720
Hello?

642
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,480
I'll be there right away.

643
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,440
{\an8}My house is not far from the campus.

644
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,440
Okay.

645
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,640
{\an8}DAD

646
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,840
Hello, Dad.

647
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,280
<i>What's up, pup?</i>

648
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,040
<i>How was last night?</i>

649
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,160
<i>Did you get yourself a girlfriend?</i>

650
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,440
No, Dad.

651
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,640
<i>Come on, even your old man</i>
<i>can do better than that.</i>

652
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,640
<i>Honey, pup got dumped.</i>

653
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,280
I wasn't dumped.

654
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,400
It just didn't feel right.

655
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,920
<i>What a lame excuse.</i>

656
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:31,480
Dad.

657
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,440
Can I ask for something?

658
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,640
<i>You really have some gall.</i>

659
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,800
<i>What do you want</i>
<i>when you couldn't even get a girl?</i>

660
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,560
<i>Potion for a broken heart?</i>

661
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,280
Can I move off campus next semester?

662
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,640
<i>You have no patience and endurance at all.</i>

663
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,080
<i>We agreed it would be next year, remember?</i>

664
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,120
<i>On-campus dorms are convenient.</i>
<i>You can make more friends.</i>

665
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,440
You just assume that.

666
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,560
I'm gonna live with my friend.

667
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,480
<i>What friend?</i>

668
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,320
Come on.

669
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,480
Let me move off campus.

670
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,080
I promise to study hard
and be a good li'l man,

671
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,040
return to my dorm before 11:00 p.m.,
stay away from drugs and women.

672
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,760
Please, Dad.

673
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,760
I'll get good grades for you too.

674
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,920
<i>Keeping off drugs is okay.</i>
<i>But women too? Incompetent!</i>

675
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:22,960
<i>Honey!</i>

676
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,000
<i>What nonsense are you teaching him?</i>

677
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,160
<i>I gotta go, buddy.</i>

678
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,240
<i>I'm in big trouble.</i>

679
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,440
Okay, Dad.

680
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,480
Li'l man?

681
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,360
That's cute.

682
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,640
Jerk.

683
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,360
Is this how…

684
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,080
you talk to your parents?

685
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,960
Yes.

686
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,520
Your parents never gave you a pet name?

687
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,640
No.

688
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:14,920
I use my name to refer to myself.

689
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,880
Then, you're lucky.

690
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,240
But if you tease me…

691
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,960
Besides calling yourself li'l man…

692
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,760
you have a thumb-sucking habit too?

693
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,280
You're such a jerk.

694
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,200
I'll stop teasing.

695
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,320
So…

696
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,280
What does your dad think…

697
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,360
about you moving off campus?

698
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,120
I don't know.

699
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:48,880
But I guess there won't be a problem.

700
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,440
Tharn, I'm hot.

701
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,360
But I'm cold.

702
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Dick.

703
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,240
Then…

704
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,280
tomorrow…

705
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:14,760
let's scout for a new dorm.

706
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,320
How can I refuse you?

707
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:22,240
Even if I said no,
you'd make me go anyway.

708
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,920
But I never forced you.

709
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,280
I just…

710
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,240
made sure you couldn't refuse me.

711
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,480
That's all.

712
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,160
Asshole.

713
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,000
{\an8}I'm home!

714
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,840
{\an8}You went nuts from studying too hard?

715
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,440
{\an8}Type, your friend's come to visit.

716
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,080
{\an8}-Who?
-It's me!

717
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,640
{\an8}Khom!

718
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,840
{\an8}<i>You're late.</i>

719
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,560
{\an8}What are you wearing?
