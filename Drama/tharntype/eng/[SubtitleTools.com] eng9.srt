1
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,080
San, what are you doing?

2
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,640
-Type!
-Let me go!

3
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,920
I said let go.

4
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm gonna kill him!

5
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,280
Type, calm down.
This is a misunderstanding.

6
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,960
Misunderstanding?
I saw it with my own eyes.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,040
You think I'm stupid?

8
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,360
What did you see?

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,160
I saw you two kissing.

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,440
-The fuck are you laughing at?
-I'm laughing at you.

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,800
I thought you were Tharn's roommate.

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,360
You said it yourself.

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,480
So, why are you interrupting us?

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,040
San…

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
that's enough.

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,920
Stop messing around.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm not messing around.
I call it like I see it.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,120
I respect you.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,760
But if you're trying to mislead him…

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,920
I won't forgive you.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,640
I haven't done anything.

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
He told me there was nothing
between you and him.

23
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,320
So I have the right.

24
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
You have no right!

25
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Please leave.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,840
Thank you for bringing my car here.

27
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
Let me go, Tharn.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,760
Calm down, you misunderstood.

29
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,800
Let me go.

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
He's mine!

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,160
Tharn is mine.

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,040
You hear me?

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Tharn belongs to me.

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
I belong to you.

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
The fuck are you laughing at?

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,160
Tharn…

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,160
won't you invite me to come up?

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,760
I brought your car here.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,120
Or do you want other people to witness…

40
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
a gay couple's argument?

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,120
I hate your senior!

42
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,880
Type…

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
San kissed me…

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
because…

45
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
he brought my car here for me.

46
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Because he brought your car here?

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
He was kidding.

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,080
I swear to God,

49
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,320
I only have eyes for you…

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,160
and no one else.

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
I'd better not catch you cheating on me.

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,080
Type…

53
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
So you can admit it.

54
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,880
What the hell do you mean?

55
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,040
You can admit you're Tharn's boyfriend.

56
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
I thought you were a coward.

57
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm not a coward.

58
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,400
But you are selfish.

59
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,280
Thorn said you had a problem before.

60
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
Me?

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,560
What problem?

62
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,160
You were moping
when you went home that time.

63
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,640
So I wanted to see
who had made Mr. Thara mope.

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,160
After I saw him,
I knew he was a troublemaker.

65
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
I'm a troublemaker?

66
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
You're the type
who won't admit you're dating Tharn.

67
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,840
You let Tharn handle problems for you.

68
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,280
You think you're always right.
That's a troublemaker.

69
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,560
And why do I have to go around
saying I'm dating a man?

70
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,560
I don't want you to do that.

71
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
But I want you to care about his feelings.

72
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,640
Because he's straightforward.
He always speaks his mind.

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,520
Thorn said Tharn couldn't say
a thing this time.

74
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,720
Because his partner
wanted to keep it a secret.

75
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,960
In the end, Tharn will always
go out of his way for you.

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
San…

77
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,960
Type's not that kind of man.

78
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Are you trying to pick a fight with me?

79
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,920
I'm okay with the way things are now.

80
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,200
Are you sure?

81
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,280
You'll always have to change
yourself for him.

82
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,240
It won't work out.

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,600
It won't last if you're the only giver
in this relationship.

84
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Actually, I didn't want to get involved.

85
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,360
But Thorn said you're serious about him.

86
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,280
So I wanted to teach him a lesson.

87
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,840
I was afraid you'd be
the only one getting hurt.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,120
Tharn's your baby or what?

89
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,680
No.

90
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,520
He's my first love.

91
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,520
He was the one I loved the most.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,480
The one I wanted to take care of the most.

93
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,360
But I never got the chance.

94
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Tharn, seriously, what do you see in him?

95
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,040
Leave the way you came!

96
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,960
Type.

97
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
No need to chase me away.

98
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
I'm an outsider, that's all I can say.

99
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Tharn's suffered enough heartbreak.

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,560
Don't make him experience it again.

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,360
You sure are worried about him.

102
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,000
It's fun to see a big baby get agitated.

103
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,080
-Type.
-Let me go.

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
-That's enough.
-Why are you stopping me?

105
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,040
I guess you're happy now, Tharn.

106
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,320
I hate your senior.

107
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,680
I understand.

108
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,800
I hate it
that he won't just leave you alone.

109
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,360
I know.

110
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,520
I hate seeing you with him.

111
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,520
I hate it that he acts
as if he knows everything about you.

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,800
I hate how it felt
when I saw you two kissing.

113
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,600
I hate that you're his first love.

114
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,400
And most importantly,

115
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,160
I hate this feeling of jealousy.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
Okay.

117
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,600
I admit it.

118
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm jealous.

119
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,560
And I'm…

120
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,920
sorry.

121
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
Sorry about what?

122
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm sorry I've never been
a good boyfriend.

123
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll try coming to terms with the fact…

124
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,240
that I'm dating a man.

125
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,520
Actually,

126
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
you don't have to push yourself…

127
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
because…

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
I can wait for the day you're ready.

129
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,760
Your senior's right.

130
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm self-centered.

131
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,480
But this self-centered man
never wants to break up with you.

132
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
I guess this means…

133
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,280
I…

134
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,080
have to thank San, right?

135
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
Don't mention his name again.

136
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,880
Most importantly,

137
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
even if he has a thing for you,

138
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,200
you should remember…

139
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
that you are mine!

140
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,640
Where are you going?

141
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,800
Downstairs, to get what I dropped.

142
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,000
I almost threw a Suki sauce bottle
at your senior's head.

143
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,240
But I was in too much of a shock.

144
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,920
If my groceries are gone,
you have to pay for them.

145
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
Why did you drag me here?

146
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,440
You don't have anything to do anyway.

147
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,680
I was playing games, you know?

148
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,160
Come on, drinks on me. Let's go.

149
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,480
Come on.

150
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,360
-Khong, hello.
-Tharn, you've arrived.

151
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,160
You brought a friend. Sit down.

152
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,760
Make yourself comfortable.

153
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,040
-Jeed.
-Yes?

154
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,360
-Come here and take care of them.
-Okay.

155
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,560
Here.

156
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,160
-Hello, Jeed.
-Hello.

157
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,600
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.

158
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Just go, Khong.

159
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,040
So…

160
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,560
How come you came here together?

161
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,360
We can't come here together?

162
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
Last time, I got drunk here
because you broke my heart.

163
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,440
But this time,

164
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
you look much better.

165
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
Do you have good news?

166
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,520
We're just friends.

167
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,880
Friends…

168
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,120
who are more than just friends.

169
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm blushing.

170
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,400
Oh, my God!

171
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,840
Why do you look so surprised, Tharn?

172
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
Why are you surprised?

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,840
I just want to let people know
you're mine.

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,960
-I can't take it. I'm blushing.
-What are you talking about?

175
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,480
You scared me to death! There's good news.

176
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,520
You're pregnant?

177
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,280
No! Sit down right now.

178
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,000
-You're absolutely clueless.
-So, what's the good news?

179
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,440
It's about them.

180
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,880
By the way, the restroom is pretty empty.

181
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,480
You can get busy in there.

182
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
Too blunt.

183
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,800
-We can discuss business in my office.
-Okay.

184
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,920
I've come to talk to Khong

185
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,080
about coming back to perform here again.

186
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,640
So, I wanted you to be here with me.

187
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,520
I guess he needs support.

188
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
Yes. I never get any.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,600
-Let's talk, shall we?
-Okay, I'll be right back.

190
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
Don't worry about him.

191
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,440
-Don't do anything to him.
-Okay.

192
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,880
-What would you like to drink?
-Anything's fine.

193
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,320
Tharn, you finished?

194
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,920
This is Ten and Kae.

195
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,640
Hello, Tharn.

196
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,600
How…

197
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
do you know me?

198
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,520
They're your fans.

199
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,240
They saw me with you,
so they came to say hi.

200
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Hello.

201
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,360
Tharn, do you remember me?

202
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,640
If I say I don't, will you get mad at me?

203
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,520
I can't get mad at such a handsome face.

204
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,720
I've often bought you drinks.

205
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,840
Thank you very much.

206
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,240
Can I buy you a drink tonight, Type?

207
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,840
Maybe next time.

208
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,640
I got turned down.

209
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm not turning you down.

210
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,040
Why do you think I'm making an excuse
to see you again?

211
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,720
I'm not easy,
but I'm not hard to get either.

212
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,480
This is my number…

213
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,720
Is talking all you want to do?

214
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,200
Type…

215
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,440
What?

216
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
Don't get on my nerves.

217
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
What did you whisper to her?

218
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,760
Nothing.

219
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,760
Type…

220
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,440
Don't be crazy. I was just playing around.

221
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,160
It didn't look
like you were playing around.

222
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,040
It's your turn to get jealous.

223
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,360
We're even.

224
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,240
I guess I'm pretty charming too.

225
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,240
Charming, huh?

226
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
Come with me.

227
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,600
What the hell?

228
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
Tharn…

229
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
this isn't funny anymore.

230
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,240
But I'm really enjoying it, Type.

231
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,120
If you do it here, I'll kill you.

232
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,120
Go on.

233
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,640
I want to try dying…

234
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,200
while on top of you.

235
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
Tharn!

236
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,960
You want to practice
your flirting skills that much?

237
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,160
Then practice with me!

238
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,200
Don't mess with me.

239
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,320
Did you enjoy provoking me?

240
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,520
Did you enjoy making me jealous?

241
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,080
And did you enjoy making me
want to yank that woman away from you?

242
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,880
I sure did.

243
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
I enjoyed it…

244
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,520
because I knew tonight
was gonna be a blast.

245
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,520
Let me tell you something.

246
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,560
No matter how many fangirls you have…

247
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,760
if you cheat on me…

248
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,680
I'll cheat on you back
worse than you can imagine.

249
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,320
Don't think I'll go soft on you
just because I tell people we're dating.

250
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,600
I, Thiwat, am more evil than you think.

251
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,720
By the way,

252
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,560
looks like someone
won't be having a blast tonight.

253
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,000
I'LL BE BACK LATE TODAY.

254
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,840
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

255
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,720
KHONG'S BAR. WITH BANDMATES.
WILL BE A LONG TALK.

256
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,040
OK.

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,240
DON'T WAIT UP.

258
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,120
WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?

259
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,040
YOU'LL WAIT?

260
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
DICK.

261
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,520
NOT SURE.

262
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,120
WHATEVER.

263
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,840
POSSESSIVE?

264
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,440
WANNA DIE?

265
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,520
LOL.

266
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,480
What are you doing?

267
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,040
Why don't you go practice?

268
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,280
You've been addicted to your phone lately.

269
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,800
Is it the girlfriend
they've been talking about?

270
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,440
What's she like?
Is she prettier than Puifai?

271
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,360
I guess, if they had long hair.

272
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,840
So how are things with your friends?

273
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,280
I haven't talked to them
since they gave me the cold shoulder.

274
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,040
Anyway,

275
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,760
you need something?

276
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
Can you tutor me?

277
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
Please?

278
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,880
I can't believe someone
who rarely shows up to class like you…

279
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,400
can be so smart.

280
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,880
LET'S GO ON A DATE AFTER THE EXAM.

281
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Wait a minute, Type.

282
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,360
I didn't know you could have
that lovestruck look.

283
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,480
What are you talking about?

284
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,960
Are you drunk?

285
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,840
Anyway, will you help me?

286
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,200
Your girlfriend will love you heaps.

287
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,760
Love me heaps?

288
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,840
Are you a love potion or something?

289
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,080
I'll pray for your girlfriend to love you
heaps and bunches.

290
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay, I'll help you,
but you don't have to pray for me.

291
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,080
Because, right now, that person
is already falling head over heels for me.

292
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,760
Damn, Type.

293
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,400
You're so full of yourself.

294
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm glad you came with me.

295
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,880
What's this place?

296
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Answer me now.

297
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,680
What do you think this place is?

298
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,360
Your house!

299
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,160
Why did you bring me here?

300
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,920
You already know.

301
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,040
So, why are you asking?

302
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,640
What a jerk!

303
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,840
Come on.

304
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
I'm stopping by to switch cars.

305
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,400
And my brother wants to meet you.

306
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,640
Don't worry, Thorn's the only one home.

307
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,600
You can relax.

308
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,440
How can I relax?

309
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,920
This is your house.

310
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
I don't want to be here.

311
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,360
Why are you two standing out here?

312
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,360
Hi, Thorn.

313
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,320
Do I look intimidating?

314
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,600
You didn't make it inside,
so I came to get you.

315
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,640
-Hello.
-Hello.

316
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,040
You're Type, right?

317
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,040
I've seen your photos.

318
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,400
You look better in person.

319
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,360
You've seen me in photos?

320
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
He's following you on Instagram.

321
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,200
I love to stalk people.

322
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Especially when it comes
to my brother's life.

323
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,680
Seems like Type had no clue
you were bringing him here.

324
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,040
But I can assure you
our parents aren't home.

325
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,760
Come on.

326
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,400
Tharn!

327
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I missed you so much.

328
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,680
I forgot to tell you Thanya's home.

329
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,520
Don't you have a piano lesson today?

330
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,840
I let it slip to her
that you were bringing a friend home,

331
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,960
so she wanted to see you.

332
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,440
Because I missed you.

333
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,040
I missed you too, Thanya.

334
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,000
Hello.

335
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
Hello.

336
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming home?

337
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,680
I'm just stopping by to switch cars,
so I didn't tell you. Sorry.

338
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,240
Thorn said you were bringing
your special friend,

339
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,080
so I called Mom and Dad,
and they hurried back.

340
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,440
Did I do good?

341
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,760
Guess whose favorite food this is?

342
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,240
Just in time. Let's have dinner.

343
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,440
Let's eat.

344
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,640
Type, come sit next to me.

345
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,480
Tharn, go sit at your place.

346
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,120
Come on, don't be afraid.

347
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,920
Eat up, everyone.

348
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay, can I eat now?

349
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
Of course, go on.

350
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,600
Have you known each other long?

351
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,760
Not long.

352
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,280
We met last semester.

353
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,280
You lived on campus together.

354
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes.

355
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,960
And you moved off campus together.

356
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,160
Actually, I'd wanted to live off campus,

357
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
but my dad wouldn't allow it.

358
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,920
Until…

359
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
Tharn…

360
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,800
offered to split the rent.

361
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,120
So my dad gave me the green light.

362
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,840
Does this mean your house
is far from the university?

363
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
My parents live in Surat Thani.

364
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,280
To be precise, his dad owns a resort
on Ko Phangan.

365
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,720
Don't you have any relatives here at all?

366
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
Actually, my aunt lives here.

367
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,040
I'd lived with her
since I was in junior high school.

368
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,480
But when I entered university,
I asked my dad if I could live in a dorm.

369
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,040
Have you had any problems living together?

370
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,520
Does Tharn ever make you uncomfortable?

371
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,760
Not at all.

372
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,360
Tharn doesn't make me
uncomfortable at all.

373
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,800
Relax, I just want to chat with you.

374
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,560
Okay.

375
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,240
Honey, speaking of Phangan,

376
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,880
we should plan a family trip
to Phangan, don't you think?

377
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,240
Sounds good.

378
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,440
We can stay at his family's resort.

379
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,680
That's right, Dad. Let's go now.

380
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
It's nothing.

381
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,000
But didn't you use up all
your annual holiday leave, Dad?

382
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,520
We should go another year.

383
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,360
But we haven't been to a beach
in Thailand for years.

384
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,040
I think I can manage it.

385
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
Let's hold off for a while longer.

386
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,760
You just went on a trip with your friends.

387
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,440
And you said you've been too busy
and you don't have time to rest.

388
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,960
I think we should let Tharn
explore the place first.

389
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,680
And we can go there together later.

390
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,080
Because I don't want to get hurt again.

391
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,280
Will you stay overnight, Tharn?

392
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,480
That's right,
you two should sleep here tonight,

393
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,560
so you don't have to drive back.

394
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,480
You should stay. I'll head back by myself.

395
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,960
You can spend the night
and leave together tomorrow, okay?

396
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,920
It's okay, I don't want to impose.

397
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,360
You're not imposing at all.

398
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,960
Thorn used to bring San here to play games
and stay overnight all the time.

399
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,760
San?

400
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,440
San, Thorn's friend. Do you know him?

401
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,760
Yes.

402
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,920
I know him.

403
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,280
So you're going to stay overnight, right?

404
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,880
You too, Type. Please.

405
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Then, I hope you don't mind if I stay.

406
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,680
Not at all.

407
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,080
Eat this.

408
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
Eat up.

409
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,920
My mom's cooking is the best.

410
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,680
Give it a try.

411
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,760
Please don't be angry with me.

412
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,760
Do I look like I'm angry?

413
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,840
Then, what are you feeling?

414
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,640
Read my lips.

415
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm fucking angry.

416
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,040
Is that clear?

417
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,960
I'm…

418
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
sorry.

419
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,360
Still angry.

420
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,200
I didn't know…

421
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,760
my parents had found out about us.

422
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,240
But they don't mind.

423
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,120
Let's make up.

424
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,040
Don't stress yourself out.

425
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
Don't worry.

426
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,560
Don't think too much.

427
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,280
So what if I do?

428
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,520
If you overthink…

429
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll overthink even more.

430
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,520
If you're stressed…

431
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,440
I'll be even more stressed.

432
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,800
And if you're worried…

433
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,280
I'll be even more worried.

434
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,480
Trust me, Type.

435
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,760
I…

436
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
won't let you feel bad alone.

437
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,360
I'm your boyfriend.

438
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,640
You think I'll forgive you?

439
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,120
Do you?

440
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,760
Tharn…

441
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,720
Tharn, stop. I'm ticklish.

442
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,080
If you don't stop,

443
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
I'll hold out on sex for a week.

444
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,480
Okay.

445
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,600
So…

446
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,840
we can do it now, right?

447
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,120
Perv.

448
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,960
Don't touch my face.

449
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
I'm happy…

450
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,720
you're sleeping over.

451
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,120
But your parents are scary.

452
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,920
My parents…

453
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,520
seem to like you.

454
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,280
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
let you sleep over.

455
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,480
So that means they like San too.

456
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,920
He used to spend the night
here every week.

457
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,320
He invited himself here.

458
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,160
But…

459
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,560
my parents really like you.

460
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,360
So…

461
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,360
you can relax.

462
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,840
I hate you.

463
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,360
But I love you.

464
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,920
I love you.

465
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,880
Type…

466
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,680
Normally, people give morning kisses.

467
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,120
Dream on.

468
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,440
You said you wanted it.

469
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,400
I'm gonna take a shower.

470
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Tharn gets to play in such a big place?

471
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,440
Why are you so excited?

472
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,840
I thought he played in a small bar,
not a big one like this.

473
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,360
I really respect him
after he showed me his drumming skills.

474
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,240
His hands are swift.

475
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Isn't it cool?

476
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,480
How long has he been playing here?

477
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,160
I didn't tell you?

478
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,240
You never told me about anything at all.

479
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,480
I had to find out by myself…

480
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,760
that you two are together.

481
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,040
He's been playing here
since he was in high school.

482
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,920
His old band broke up
because he fought with a bandmate.

483
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,760
He's just formed a new band
during semester break.

484
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,600
So the bar owner held an audition
to see their skills.

485
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,920
As you know, his band is playing
in the evening time slot.

486
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
It's not peak hours.

487
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,200
But Tharn said it's good enough
for a new band.

488
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,240
You sure know a lot about your boyfriend.

489
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,080
-You asshole.
-I'm serious.

490
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,760
-How many members does his band have?
-Four.

491
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,240
-Lead singer?
-His friend, Lhong.

492
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,280
See? You can be a good boyfriend.

493
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,800
How is this relevant?

494
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
That's good.

495
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,160
Being attentive is better
than being hot-headed.

496
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,040
Usually, when I babble this much,
you give me such an earful

497
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,640
that I can't find my way back home.

498
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
-Want me to do that?
-No.

499
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,400
Type!

500
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,280
You're here to show support
for your boyfriend?

501
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,760
No.

502
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,000
My friend here asked me if I knew
a good bar with great atmosphere.

503
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,560
Your place came to mind.

504
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,240
You're so sweet.

505
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,480
Let me find you the best table.

506
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,800
How about a table in front of the stage?

507
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,880
You can have a clear view of Tharn.

508
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
-Okay.
-Follow me.

509
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,280
Make yourself comfortable.

510
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,480
Wait.

511
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,720
I didn't know you had a thing
for older women.

512
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,680
Not to mention,

513
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,760
she teased both you and Tharn.

514
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,200
Normally, you wouldn't let that slide.

515
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,560
It's because she's older.

516
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,200
And Tharn works here.

517
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,040
What does that have to do with Tharn?

518
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,640
Use your brain, Techno.

519
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,360
If I upset Jeed,
Tharn will get into trouble.

520
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
You've really changed, Type!

521
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
-Go!
-What?

522
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,800
Hey.

523
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,480
Type.

524
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,560
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

525
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,000
It wasn't my idea. It's his.

526
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,600
-Hi, Techno.
-Hi.

527
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
Why are you sitting here?

528
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,680
Let me rest my legs a bit.
I'll take to the stage in a minute.

529
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,000
Please?

530
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,640
Wanna drink?

531
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,920
Not yet. I'll wait until the gig's over.

532
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,560
No need to give him a drink.

533
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,560
He'll get plenty when he gets on stage.

534
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
Are you…

535
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,480
jealous?

536
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,720
Jealous, my ass.

537
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,360
I knew it.

538
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,280
You can't speak nicely.

539
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,360
Are you saying I have a dirty mouth?

540
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,880
I'm not saying anything.

541
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,800
But you know me so well.

542
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,120
You two are so…

543
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,640
lovey-dovey.

544
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,320
The hell you talking about?

545
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,640
I mean…

546
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,200
you're talking to each other…

547
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,440
as if you're the only two people
in the world.

548
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,640
You're wrong, Techno.

549
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,160
My world doesn't revolve
around just me and him.

550
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,360
But the most important person…

551
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,560
is him.

552
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
-I'm gonna be sick.
-Me too.

553
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,640
-What's going on here?
-Hey.

554
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,520
Wait, let me introduce myself first.

555
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,120
My name's Lhong.

556
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,520
I'm his friend and I study music.

557
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,560
-Okay, hello.
-Hello.

558
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,480
-I'm Techno.
-Techno.

559
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,360
-Sports science major.
-Techno.

560
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,080
That's Type.

561
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,960
Sports science major too.

562
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Type?

563
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,880
I know you.

564
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,760
You're famous.

565
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,800
What do you mean?

566
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
Everyone on campus knows you

567
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,640
because your photo was posted online.

568
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm sorry, I said too much.

569
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Sorry.

570
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,160
You said way too much, Lhong.

571
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,720
I'm sorry.

572
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,480
Let's get on stage.
I've finished tuning up.

573
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,160
Tae's already waiting.

574
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,160
Are they your friends?

575
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,720
Hello, I'm Song.

576
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,520
I'm the guitarist.
Tharn and Lhong are my idols.

577
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,560
I really admire them.

578
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,240
Song, I think you should've
just introduced yourself.

579
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,880
I'm Techno.

580
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,080
That's my friend, Type.

581
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,640
Hello, Techno, Type.

582
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,840
Let's go, Tharn, Lhong. I'm super excited.

583
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,360
-Sure.
-Let's go.

584
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,280
-Come on, hurry up.
-All right.

585
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,640
Hurry up!

586
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,560
Type, I have to go now.

587
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Do your best.

588
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,120
What a good supporter.

589
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,560
What?

590
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,680
By the way, are you okay?

591
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,640
Please give us a round of applause.

592
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:26,040
Here's our next song.
Please sing along if you know the lyrics.

593
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,320
<i>I know you are not keen on me.</i>

594
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:53,880
<i>You are far from interested in me</i>

595
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,840
<i>But I am not the type to give up</i>

596
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,480
<i>I am such a saint and you know it</i>

597
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,480
<i>But it seems like I am not</i>
<i>The one you want</i>

598
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,000
<i>I am ready to do whatever it takes</i>

599
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,560
<i>I will do everything I can</i>
<i>To make you mine</i>

600
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,640
<i>I will not let you walk awaywith anyone</i>

601
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,360
<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

602
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,480
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

603
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:32,760
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

604
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,240
<i>I will not let anyone else love you</i>

605
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,800
<i>Because you are the only one</i>
<i>I want to hold</i>

606
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,560
<i>My heart is yearning</i>
<i>My heart is calling out</i>

607
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,480
<i>I need to let you know</i>

608
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,360
<i>I will not let you walk awaywith anyone</i>

609
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,080
<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

610
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,120
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

611
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,480
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

612
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:15,160
<i>I will not let you walk awaywith anyone</i>

613
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,480
<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

614
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,880
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

615
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:27,360
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

616
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,080
<i>I will not let anyone else love you</i>

617
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,480
Thank you.

618
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,440
Here, put the blanket on him.

619
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,000
Our team is going to kill me
if he catches a cold.

620
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,480
-Okay, wifey.
-Watch it.

621
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,360
You'll be next.

622
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,920
Who's wifey?

623
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,360
Tharn is Type's wifey.

624
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,760
Tharn…

625
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,440
I'm curious.

626
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,360
About what?

627
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,120
The face you made
when you were playing drums…

628
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,160
What about it?

629
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,040
It was so damn sexy.

630
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,800
When I was playing drums?

631
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,360
To me…

632
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,080
music is like sex.

633
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,000
It gives me climactic pleasure.

634
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:33,760
And now…

635
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,440
I know…

636
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,960
what my most cherished instrument is.

637
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,880
Drums.

638
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,280
No.

639
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,680
It's you.

640
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,240
My most cherished instrument.

641
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,280
Type!

642
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,480
Type…

643
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,000
-You want to do it now?
-Be still.

644
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,760
Type, be gentle. It hurts!

645
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,360
Shut up and be still.

646
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,480
Techno.

647
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,040
Techno.

648
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,040
Techno.

649
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,600
Get up and eat your congee.

650
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,560
Tharn bought it for you.

651
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,440
I can't.

652
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,280
Feels like my head's gonna explode.

653
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,000
Come on, get up.

654
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,320
Here.

655
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,800
What's up, Lhong?

656
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,640
Hold it properly. Don't spill it.

657
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,120
Type?

658
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,080
-What?
-It's just…

659
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,480
Last night…

660
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:05,520
I…

661
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,400
-heard--
-Techno!

662
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,000
If you keep talking…

663
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,000
I'll kill you!

664
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,480
If you tell anyone about last night…

665
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,680
Dude! I slept like a baby last night.

666
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,520
Very soundly and comfortably.

667
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,840
-Good.
-Great.

668
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,560
Type…

669
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,240
Lhong will stop by this evening.

670
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,800
Can I tell him…

671
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,200
we're together?

672
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,200
That's your personal business.

673
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:00,280
None of my business.
I'll go eat my congee over there.

674
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,280
Hot!

675
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,840
Please help me just this once.

676
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,760
Yes.

677
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:33,160
When the professor takes the roll call,
answer it for me.

678
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,800
All right, I'll treat you
to lunch for a week.

679
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,800
Thank you.

680
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,360
Tar, when did you get here?

681
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,160
I've been standing here forever.

682
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,760
Really?

683
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,960
How come you can pick me up today?

684
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,640
You see…

685
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,440
I'm free.

686
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,120
Don't you have class?

687
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,560
I did.

688
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,160
But it ended early.

689
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,480
So I rushed here to pick you up.

690
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,480
You hungry? Do you want to eat anything?

691
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,560
I just want to go home.

692
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,720
Really?

693
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,720
Let's go home, then.

694
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,840
Let's go.

695
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,120
Let's go.

696
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,160
Type…

697
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,920
if I tell Lhong that we're together…

698
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,760
will you be okay with it?

699
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,360
-'Cause if you're not okay--
-Stop being selfless.

700
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,480
I feel like the bad guy.

701
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:35,920
Haven't you heard?

702
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,480
We always fall for the bad guys.

703
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,240
Whether it's a good guy or bad guy…

704
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,240
I don't want either one.

705
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,840
I'm only okay with you.

706
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,120
I love you, Type.

707
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,880
I might too.

708
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,200
You really…

709
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,080
Hi, Lhong.

710
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,800
Handsome boy is here!

711
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,920
Water.

712
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,440
Thanks.

713
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,200
Lhong…

714
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,200
I have something to tell you.

715
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,840
What's wrong?

716
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,680
You look serious.

717
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,280
You see…

718
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,120
Type and I…

719
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,640
We're together.

720
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,560
Are you okay?

721
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,800
Don't.

722
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,080
I'll clean up later.

723
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,360
What's wrong with you?

724
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,160
Why didn't I know about this before?

725
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,000
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

726
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,560
I forgot I have to meet my family.

727
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,240
I have to go.

728
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,240
But you just got here.

729
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,280
It's really important.

730
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,360
Gotta go now.

731
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,320
Here, you can have them.

732
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,520
What's up with him?

733
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,000
No idea.

734
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,560
Take this.

735
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,400
I'm going to clean up.

736
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,120
Be careful. They're sharp.

737
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,920
Tharn, why can't I get
a girlfriend at all?

738
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:00,360
Nobody's interested in me.
I want a girlfriend. What should I do?

739
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,800
-Don't be silly, Song.
-Come on, Tharn.

740
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,840
-Let's go home.
-Okay.

741
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,640
I'm sorry.

742
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,080
-Tar?
-Tharn?

743
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,920
Tharn, wait!

744
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:19,760
I… I've been missing you.

745
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,640
I have to go, Tar.

746
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:24,840
Let's go, Song.

747
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,280
You're back?

748
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,240
Go back to sleep.

749
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,480
Take a shower, quickly…

750
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,240
and hurry back to be my pillow.

751
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,760
{\an8}Tharn has never dated anyone
more than two months.

752
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,600
{\an8}<i>Until he met…</i>

753
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,840
{\an8}<i>Tar.</i>

754
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,560
{\an8}-Who?
-I never wanted to break up with you!

755
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,320
{\an8}Tar wants me back.

756
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,840
{\an8}<i>Why didn't you tell me…</i>

757
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,200
{\an8}that kid's your ex-boyfriend?

758
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,000
{\an8}Does he taste as good…

759
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,200
{\an8}as when you were together?
