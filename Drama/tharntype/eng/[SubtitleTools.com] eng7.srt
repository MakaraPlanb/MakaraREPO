1
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,240
One, two, three, four, five.

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,800
Have pork prices gone up or something?

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,560
Type! Tharn! Over here! Come here!

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,720
I got us a table. Come sit here.

5
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,280
Lately, the two of you've been
pretty cozy.

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,920
Isn't that good?

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,840
You can finally stop complaining about us.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
It's good.

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,440
But you guys seem very, very close.

10
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Type!

11
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,080
You already have a girlfriend?

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,400
You have a girlfriend?

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,080
Fai said Type gave her false hope.

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,080
It's true. I'm sorry.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,120
Why didn't you tell her before?

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,200
She's really hurt, you know?

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
Anyway…

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,320
It's my fault for introducing them
to each other.

20
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,760
And don't call her to apologize again.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
Or else she'll give you an earful.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
Okay.

23
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,400
By the way, who's your girlfriend?

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,320
Yeah, who is it?

25
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,200
Why do I have to tell you?

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,080
Aren't we friends? Do I know her?

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,760
If you don't stop questioning me,

28
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
you won't finish breakfast
in time for class.

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,920
Stingy.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,840
I'm gonna buy breakfast. Be right back.

31
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,520
Let's talk about your "girlfriend," Type.

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,640
If my hunch is correct…

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,360
that person is…

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,680
Have some water, Techno.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,400
You look thirsty.

36
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm not thirsty!

37
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
The person you're dating, Type…

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,560
Is it--

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,640
I think you should drink some more.

40
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,640
You look really parched.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,520
Hold on! Don't change the subject.

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,840
Don't you dare keep secrets from me.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,480
What secrets?

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,040
Yeah, what secrets?

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,080
Don't team up against me!

46
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,000
The one you're dating, Type,

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,600
that person is--

48
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,320
The line was frickin' long.

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,080
Why are there so many people?

50
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
Then…

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
You guys can keep talking.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,240
I have to go to class.

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,680
Remember, we have to sign
the contract for the dorm this evening.

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,960
Then, I'll call you after class.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,200
See you.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,160
Dorm? What dorm?

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm moving off campus with Tharn.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
You're moving off campus with Tharn?

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
By the way, Techno,

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
your hunch…

62
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,360
is correct.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
Type, what do you want?

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,920
Nothing much.

65
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,000
Is Seo here?

66
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Yes.

67
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,480
Seo Duang, Type's here to see you.

68
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,200
What's the matter?

69
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,200
It's semester break.
Why don't you go home?

70
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
That's the reason we're here.

71
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,680
The thing is,

72
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,880
we came here to say goodbye.

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're dropping out?

74
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,680
Do you really have to drop out?

75
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,600
Please, think this through.

76
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,040
Khlui!

77
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,280
-Khlui.
-Yeah.

78
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
They haven't finished yet.

79
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,800
Where are you going? Finish your sentence.

80
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,800
We're gonna move off campus.

81
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,960
And you're moving in together?

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,440
That's right.

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,520
We're moving in together.

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,800
It's because you guys said
the wall's thin.

85
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,520
We fight a lot,
so we don't want to bother you.

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,040
So you're going to move in
to a room with thick…

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,440
and soundproof walls, aren't you?

88
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,960
You got it wrong!

89
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,160
Good for you. Good.

90
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,600
Come here.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
When you live together,

92
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,320
no matter how much you argue,
always forgive each other.

93
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,120
Fighting is part of a couple's life.

94
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,960
It's a fact.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,480
What are you saying?

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,560
As the person who's been watching you
from the beginning,

97
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm so happy for you.

98
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,840
That's enough.

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,240
They're not getting married.

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,280
You bastard.

101
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
Anyway, I'm happy for you.

102
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,520
Thank you so much.

103
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
We have to go.

104
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Goodbye.

105
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,920
Goodbye.

106
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
Good luck.

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,400
It hurts.

108
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Khlui!

109
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,320
Stop crying and start packing.

110
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,880
Didn't you say you're going home tomorrow?

111
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm happy.

112
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,040
Seo.

113
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
You wouldn't understand.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,480
I feel like a father…

115
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
who's just walked his two sons…

116
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,520
down the aisle.

117
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,280
They got their happy ending.

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,920
So…

119
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,680
when will you stop paying attention
to other people…

120
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,680
and start paying attention
to someone close to you?

121
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Who is it?

122
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,720
I…

123
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
like you.

124
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,440
<i>Zoo-wah-hey?</i>

125
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,960
What does that mean?

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
What's so funny?

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,160
Nothing.

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm glad you let me tell Techno about us.

129
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,000
He's gonna find out anyway.

130
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,120
You don't have to feel
extremely grateful to me.

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,120
And other than him, I don't want
anybody else to know just yet.

132
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
After we're done moving…

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,720
I'm going back to Pha-ngan.

134
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,280
I made a promise to my dad.

135
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,800
Li'l Type is going home to see his daddy?

136
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,200
-Asshole.
-You're asking for it.

137
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
Keep packing.

138
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,080
I'm home!

139
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,280
Four months with Tharn
really bored me to death.

140
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,320
A month away from him is all I need.

141
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
Pup!

142
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
You went nuts from studying too hard?

143
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
Is that why you're yelling here?

144
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,440
I just needed to vent my frustration.

145
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,600
Frustrated with your love life?

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,360
Right, you got dumped by a girl.

147
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Come on, Dad, that's in the past.
Just forget about it.

148
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,520
How can I forget?

149
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,160
I transferred 2,000 baht to you,

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,040
but you came back empty-handed. Useless.

151
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,200
When I was your age, I didn't need money
to make women chase after me.

152
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
Women or dogs?

153
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,000
Brat! How could you say that
to your father?

154
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
Just shut your mouth.

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
So when will you return to Bangkok?

156
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,080
Dad, I've just arrived
and you want me gone already?

157
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,680
No, I'm just asking.

158
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,720
Because I'll give you a ride.

159
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,280
By the way, you finally moved
off campus, huh?

160
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,960
Stubborn pup.

161
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,040
The friend you've moved in with…

162
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,680
What's he like?

163
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,320
He has nothing but good looks.

164
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,280
He's annoyingly attentive.

165
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,440
Normally, he's cool and calm like ice.

166
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,720
But when he gets angry,
all hell breaks loose.

167
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,840
And he's stubborn.

168
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
He does everything for me
when I tell him not to.

169
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,640
He buys me food when I tell him not to.

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
He hangs up my laundry
when I tell him not to.

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,440
He even changes my bed sheets.

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
And…

173
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,960
he has nothing but good looks.

174
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,040
He's a quarter American.
His dad is half American.

175
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
His large nose almost pokes my face.

176
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,560
And he's especially popular with women
when he plays in his band.

177
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,160
From what you've told me,
it sounds like you two are really close.

178
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,280
Who says we're close?

179
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,600
If you're not close,
then why would he do everything for you?

180
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,160
Besides, you even know about his family.

181
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,560
You never gave this many details
about your other friends before.

182
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,000
I still don't know
what Team and Oam look like.

183
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,640
Never mind.

184
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,280
But it looks like you really admire
this friend of yours.

185
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,840
Who says I admire him?

186
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,560
You just complimented him non-stop.

187
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,200
Dad,

188
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
a guest wants to talk to you.

189
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,440
He's white, not Middle Eastern.

190
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,680
You know what I meant.

191
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,240
Okay, I'll go take care of the guest.

192
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,640
And don't just lay around.

193
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Because we're very busy
with all the Westerners coming.

194
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,080
Okay.

195
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,760
<i>Hello?</i>

196
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,840
Hello.

197
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,320
<i>Miss me?</i>

198
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,040
Jerk, don't get on my nerves.

199
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,560
<i>When did I do that?</i>

200
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
<i>I was just asking.</i>

201
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Then, my answer is no.

202
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,520
We just saw each other yesterday.
How can I miss you?

203
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,840
<i>Exactly.</i>

204
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,880
<i>We just saw each other,</i>
<i>but you're calling me already.</i>

205
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,040
Jerk.

206
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,920
<i>Are you home yet? How was your trip?</i>

207
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,120
Worried about me?

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,160
<i>I'm both worried and possessive about you.</i>

209
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,000
No matter how much you sweet-talk me,
I'll never fall for it.

210
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,960
<i>But you've fallen for my mouth.</i>

211
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,080
I told you.

212
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,640
I won't fall for your sweet-talk,
no matter how much you do it.

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,440
<i>I'm not talking about sweet-talk.</i>

214
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,560
<i>I'm talking about my mouth…</i>

215
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,680
<i>when I kiss you.</i>

216
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,480
Go to hell, asshole!

217
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,080
What total bullshit!

218
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,640
I really hate you with all my guts.

219
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,840
Did you finish talking
with your friend, Tharn?

220
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,080
Yes, I did.

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
Let me see.

222
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,960
Which part of the song are you practicing?

223
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,040
I can already play the whole song.

224
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,840
Next week, the teacher
will teach me a new song.

225
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,280
Don't return to your dorm just yet.

226
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,840
Stay and watch me
practice the new song first.

227
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,080
Actually…

228
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
I have band practice next week.

229
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm not sure if I can watch you practice.

230
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,400
You have to leave again?

231
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,840
I miss you so much when you're not around.

232
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,920
I missed you too, Thanya.

233
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,280
I don't believe you.

234
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,280
If you miss me,
why don't you come home more often?

235
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,280
He may miss you,
but he misses something else more.

236
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,360
Hi, Thorn. When did you get back?

237
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,440
When you acted like
you were going to bail on Thanya.

238
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,000
Honestly, you're scolding me…

239
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,520
because you're hurt
Thanya is more attached to me, right?

240
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,560
I'm deeply hurt.

241
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Whenever Tharn comes back,
you always ignore me.

242
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
I already see you every day.

243
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,160
Are you really busy
with band practice next week?

244
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,840
Partly.

245
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,640
What are you actually busy with?

246
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Is it about last month's incident
when you looked gloomy,

247
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,040
as if someone had broken your drum set?

248
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
So, what happened?

249
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,360
Right now…

250
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,760
we're dating.

251
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,280
That's good news.

252
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,000
Of course, it is.

253
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
But I was totally exhausted.

254
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,520
Come to think of it,
you haven't dated for almost six months.

255
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,080
Enough about me.

256
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,560
What about you?

257
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,000
There's nothing to talk about.

258
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,440
I don't have time
for anyone else but Thanya.

259
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,920
You should find a girlfriend, Thorn.

260
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,880
You're already 21.

261
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,240
It's not good for you
to get too attached to me.

262
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,040
What a mean girl.

263
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,320
By the way,
I'm meeting with San this week.

264
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,640
Wanna come with me?

265
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,040
San's back?

266
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
He's been back for nearly a month now.

267
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,280
We're meeting up for lunch.

268
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,360
He's bringing us souvenirs too.

269
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,280
He said he'd love to see you
if you had the time.

270
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,960
He misses you.

271
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
Let me think about it.

272
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay.

273
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,720
Type.

274
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,200
What are you doing up there?

275
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,760
The roof's leaking, Mom.

276
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,040
Dad told me to board it up.

277
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,240
He'll get the roofers to fix it tomorrow.

278
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Why don't you let the roofers
do the whole job?

279
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,800
You might fall and get hurt.

280
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,040
I can't.

281
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
If it rains tonight, the guests
will complain about the leak.

282
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,640
And we're fully booked.
We can't switch their rooms.

283
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,960
You're right.

284
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,480
Do you need something?

285
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,040
-A friend's come to see you.
-Who?

286
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,720
It's me!

287
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,000
Khom!

288
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,960
I'll let you two catch up.

289
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,840
You have to stay for dinner too.

290
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,960
Okay.

291
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,880
-Later.
-Thank you.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,280
You look different.

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,360
How?

294
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
Am I more handsome than before?

295
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,440
Don't make me say it.
I don't want to hurt your pride.

296
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,880
And look at you.

297
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,800
You've become a city boy.

298
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Really?

299
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,840
You're giving off the vibe.

300
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
By the way, the roof's leaking?

301
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,520
Yeah.

302
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,200
I don't know if there's more leaks.

303
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,320
We had a storm last night.

304
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,680
You know what? Let me check it out.

305
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,440
What's with that face?
Don't underestimate a mechanic student.

306
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,640
Come on.

307
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,080
You really…

308
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,320
Wanna show off?

309
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,120
Be careful.

310
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
-Give me a nail.
-Here.

311
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,320
Don't make more holes.

312
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,080
Come on, trust me.

313
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
Damn, what the hell is he staring at?

314
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
Who are you talking about?

315
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,560
That asshole foreigner.

316
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,640
He's been giving me a creepy look
since the other day.

317
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,240
You always attract men.

318
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,680
Damn it, Khom.

319
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,520
Want me to kick your ass?

320
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,280
Don't say such horrible things.

321
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Come on.

322
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,960
Being loved…

323
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,240
is better than being hated.

324
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,120
Besides,

325
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,760
he's a guest.

326
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,160
Just deal with it.

327
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,760
I hope these people go to hell!

328
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,560
Just calm down.

329
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,880
By the way, will you go to
the Full Moon Party tomorrow?

330
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,360
What time will you be there?

331
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,040
You know what? I'll call you.

332
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,760
Don't forget.

333
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,840
The party's awesome.
I haven't been to one in a while.

334
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,160
Yeah, and this bar's pretty cool too.

335
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm out of beer.

336
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm gonna buy some more.

337
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,760
Okay, buy for me too.

338
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,800
Okay.

339
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,080
Two beers, please.

340
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,280
Type.

341
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,160
Type!

342
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,080
Take it easy, man.

343
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,360
Just shove your dick up your ass
and go to hell, asshole!

344
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
Sorry, our friends are waiting for us.

345
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,280
Come on, let's go!

346
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,680
Gay people should be wiped off the planet!

347
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,880
If it hadn't been for the sake of my dad,

348
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,760
I would've beaten
those disgusting freaks to a pulp.

349
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,560
I'd rather sleep in a filthy sty
than be touched by them.

350
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,720
Faggots!

351
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,520
Type.

352
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,880
What?

353
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,480
What is it, Khom?

354
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,960
Do you think I'm prejudiced?

355
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,640
Yes, I am!

356
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,160
So what?

357
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,320
As long as you're not one of them,

358
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,080
I have nothing against you.

359
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,320
I'm one of them.

360
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,560
What did you say?

361
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,760
I'm gay!

362
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,040
I'm not saying this to upset you.

363
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,880
And I planned to keep it a secret forever.

364
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,840
I know you hate gay people.

365
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,600
But I can't stand you talking shit…

366
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,880
about my people.

367
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,800
You know how many times
I've heard homophobic insults?

368
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,680
Including the nasty things
you've said all these years.

369
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,240
I'm so frustrated!

370
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,840
I wanted to say that I'm gay too.

371
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,440
Why can't you be open-minded
about people like me?

372
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,880
Not all gay people are evil
like you think!

373
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,280
Type.

374
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,800
I won't ask you to understand.

375
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
And I know that…

376
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,640
my words…

377
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,880
might destroy our friendship.

378
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,320
But I just want my best friend…

379
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,880
to accept me for who I am!

380
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,800
I guess it's too much to ask.

381
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,840
I'm sorry…

382
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,880
for being gay.

383
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,680
KHOM

384
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,720
What's up?

385
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
<i>Nothing.</i>

386
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,800
<i>Just wanted to ask how you're doing.</i>

387
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,480
<i>It's been two weeks.</i>

388
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,320
I'm fine.

389
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Some days, I help my dad out.

390
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,280
Other days,
I goof around to piss off my mom.

391
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,480
When I feel especially great,
I go swimming in the sea.

392
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,760
You told me your dad owns
a resort in Pa-ngan.

393
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,760
<i>I went to the Full Moon Party yesterday.</i>

394
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,080
How was it?

395
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,400
Did you have fun?

396
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>No.</i>

397
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,280
There was a gay foreigner
who said I was so hot.

398
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
And…

399
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,880
what did you do?

400
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,800
What do you think?

401
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,000
I told him to shove his dick up his ass
and go to hell.

402
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,520
Why?

403
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,480
You think I'll fool around with gay guys
because I don't like women?

404
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

405
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,760
But…

406
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,160
you may not realize…

407
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,280
you're actually very hot.

408
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,040
Tharn, you want me to kick your ass
the second we meet again?

409
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,160
That's enough.

410
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,040
I'm done talking about this.

411
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,040
What about you?

412
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,520
How's your break going?

413
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,400
Nothing much happened.

414
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,480
I go to band practice sometimes.

415
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,800
We've just gotten a new guitarist.

416
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,800
So we need to practice more often.

417
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,120
<i>And a senior asked me</i>
<i>to tutor a high-schooler.</i>

418
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,120
<i>But I don't think I'm good enough,</i>
<i>so I turned him down.</i>

419
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
What about you?

420
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,480
When will you come back?

421
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
Why?

422
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,360
<i>I miss you.</i>

423
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
Asshole!

424
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,240
I miss you too.

425
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,560
Mai.

426
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,840
Do you want a drink? Just order.

427
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm waiting for Techno.

428
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,160
No.

429
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,160
I'm here to settle things.

430
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,280
What things? You mean about Type and Fai?

431
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,520
It's already over, Mai.

432
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,440
Type feels guilty.

433
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,880
And Fai doesn't want anything
to do with him.

434
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
What more do you want?

435
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,880
But he should at least apologize properly.

436
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,680
She's really hurt, you know?

437
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,160
What do you expect me to do?

438
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
Force him to beg for forgiveness?

439
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,320
Or should I force him to date her,
even if he doesn't love her?

440
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,080
I think you should stop.

441
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,920
You guys are heartless.

442
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,480
Love isn't something you can force.

443
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,280
Let's stop meddling
in other people's business.

444
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,960
Is it still other people's business
if I tell you I like you?

445
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,200
Mai.

446
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,920
You like me?

447
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,400
Yes, I do.

448
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,480
You're kidding me.

449
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,840
I'm not kidding.

450
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,600
Since when?

451
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,360
How long you've known me
is how long I've liked you.

452
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,080
Damn.

453
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,320
That's a really long time.

454
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,840
But you were so clueless.

455
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,520
Mai.

456
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,600
I'm sorry.

457
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,160
I don't think of you that way.

458
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,120
I already knew that.

459
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,440
That's why I never told you.

460
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
I'd better go.

461
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,240
I'll give you a ride.

462
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
You should wait for your friends.

463
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,480
What's wrong with her?

464
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,600
Buddy!

465
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Damn, you tiger!

466
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,280
-What's up, man?
-You look handsome today.

467
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,560
We met Mai at the entrance.

468
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,200
Why was she here?

469
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,080
Not telling?

470
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,040
Don't tell me she was waiting
to bitch at Type about Puifai?

471
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,440
No, she came to talk to me.

472
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,160
Is that so?

473
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,120
Hold on.

474
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,640
That girl?

475
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,840
Damn! She's hot!

476
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Dick.

477
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,920
We're here to drink.

478
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,880
-A little eye candy won't hurt.
-Guys, menu.

479
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm tired of standing.

480
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,000
-What?
-I'm stiff.

481
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,720
How can you be stiff?
You've just gotten here.

482
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,840
-Take it easy.
-We took a cab, man.

483
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,920
You know.

484
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,200
And you didn't pay your share of the fare.

485
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,200
I paid it. Give me the money.

486
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,320
Hanging out with you guys is better.

487
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,920
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

488
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I have goosebumps.

489
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,280
Damn, you have a thing for me?

490
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,160
No. Here, drink.

491
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,280
You drink first.

492
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,080
Yeah, you go first.

493
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,760
-While waiting for the chairs.
-Go ahead.

494
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,560
GOTTA ATTEND EVENT AT UNI.
CAN'T PICK YOU UP.

495
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,080
BE CAREFUL ON YOUR WAY HOME.

496
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:31,280
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF.

497
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:38,320
CALL ME WHEN YOU GET HOME.

498
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,800
I'LL BE FINE. DON'T WORRY.

499
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,840
Tum.

500
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Tar.

501
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,760
You're back?

502
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,080
Yes. I thought you were at the university.

503
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,000
How did you get back before me?

504
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,840
Actually…

505
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,600
the event ended earlier than I expected.

506
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,520
So I hurried home first.

507
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,880
I haven't eaten anything.

508
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,320
So hungry.

509
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,120
I'll put my backpack away
and fix you something to eat.

510
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

511
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
It tastes good, as usual.

512
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,080
I was afraid you'd get sick of it.

513
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Because it's the only dish I cook.

514
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,480
How could I get sick of it?

515
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
Actually…

516
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,600
I can eat whatever you cook.

517
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,960
But I want to try other dishes too.

518
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,400
Tum…

519
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,280
I'm kidding.

520
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,440
I told you.

521
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,880
I'll eat whatever you cook.

522
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,280
As long as you're the one who cooks it.

523
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,560
By the way,

524
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,840
have you been given
lots of homework lately?

525
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,760
No. Why?

526
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,200
I haven't seen you draw
for quite some time.

527
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,560
I thought you were busy
with homework and assignments.

528
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,520
I'm just bored.

529
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,480
Then… how about this?

530
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,360
When you feel like drawing again…

531
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,920
can you draw me a picture?

532
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,440
Okay.

533
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,800
I'll draw you a picture.

534
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,720
Call your mom when you get there,
so she won't worry.

535
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,240
Okay, Dad.

536
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll call her the second I get there.

537
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,040
You'd better.

538
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,040
Will someone cry after I leave?

539
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,720
You brat! Fat chance!

540
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,560
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

541
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,040
What are you looking for?
Just go, already.

542
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,040
Pup!

543
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,920
You must hate me now.

544
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,560
Am I playing better?

545
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,120
Yes, you are.

546
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,800
But you played that note too soon, okay?

547
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,720
Okay.

548
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,840
How can you believe him so easily, Thanya?

549
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,960
I think you played really well.

550
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,920
You're the one I shouldn't believe.

551
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,640
She's right.

552
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,760
You spoil her too much.
Even she can see that.

553
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,760
Come on, Dad. When did I ever spoil her?

554
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,560
I'm just telling the truth.

555
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,320
Sure, the truth.

556
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,160
The truth is you're
an overly attached brother.

557
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,960
Don't you see how cute she is?

558
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,960
Thanks to your skills,

559
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,400
Thanya looks like a living doll.

560
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,680
Don't you know who I am?

561
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,640
What are you two talking about?

562
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,240
I'm going to prepare dinner.

563
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,960
Today, we have a guest coming.
Anybody want anything special?

564
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,760
I can eat whatever you cook.

565
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,560
But can I have Thai food?
I'm getting tired of cheese.

566
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,560
Come on, honey, it's Tharn's favorite.

567
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,440
He comes home so rarely
that I have to treat him especially well.

568
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,280
I'M BACK IN BANGKOK.

569
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,600
Dad, Mom,

570
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,880
I won't stay for dinner today.
I'm going back to my dorm.

571
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm heading out.

572
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,480
Tharn, San's coming today.

573
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,280
I thought you'd stay to see him.

574
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,880
Then…

575
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,840
tell him I'm sorry.

576
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,400
I have to go.

577
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,000
Don't know when I'll be back. Bye.

578
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,240
Why is Tharn in such a hurry, Thorn?

579
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,640
Judging from his excitement…

580
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,520
it's easy to guess who he's going to see.

581
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
Come on, let him be happy.

582
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,120
What else can we do?

583
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,440
Okay, I'm going to prepare dinner.

584
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,080
You're late.

585
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,960
Am I really late?

586
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,520
I thought you'd come here…

587
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,960
as soon as I texted you.

588
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,440
I tried to call you many times,

589
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,320
but you didn't pick up.

590
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,920
And I'm not a dog…

591
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,200
who runs to his owner
as soon as he gets home.

592
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
You're not?

593
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,720
Not a dog.

594
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,120
But your boyfriend.

595
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,360
What are you wearing?

596
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,960
Your welcome home gift.

597
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,080
Did you…

598
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,320
forget something?

599
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,800
What?

600
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,480
This.

601
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,360
I didn't forget.

602
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,880
It's because you were super late.

603
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,320
I'm sorry…

604
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,840
for being late.

605
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,280
Dad, why didn't you tell me
you were coming to Bangkok?

606
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,720
And now you want to see me
just before you leave?

607
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,720
I'm outside right now.

608
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,240
<i>What? I told you I was coming to see you.</i>

609
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,320
<i>Besides, I want to meet your friend.</i>

610
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,440
You said you were going back to Pa-ngan,
not stopping by here.

611
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,120
<i>It's the same thing.</i>

612
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,560
<i>We won't see each other for four months.</i>

613
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,360
<i>At least, let me say goodbye.</i>

614
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,280
You can always skip work.

615
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,880
<i>Your mom will chop my head off</i>
<i>if I do that.</i>

616
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
Go talk to Mom about it.

617
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,000
Tell her to drive safely.

618
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,240
Bye.

619
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,600
No "li'l Type" this time?

620
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,360
Bastard.

621
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,480
Is your dad…

622
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,720
coming to see you?

623
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,520
My aunt's in the hospital.

624
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,480
But she's gotten better,
so my parents will leave Bangkok today.

625
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,320
Actually, he wanted to meet you.

626
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,680
Don't make that face.

627
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,680
He just wants to meet my roommate.

628
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,160
Do you seriously think
I'd tell him we're together?

629
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,640
I was hoping…

630
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,360
for the impossible.

631
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,880
I'm sorry.

632
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,480
About what?

633
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,600
About something that needs
to be kept secret forever.

634
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,240
I already knew that.

635
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,080
You'll never tell anyone.

636
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,360
Why are you mad at me?

637
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:19,120
Does it matter if we tell other people
about our relationship or not?

638
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,680
It may not matter to you…

639
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,240
but to me…

640
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,760
it does.

641
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,200
I just want to let people know
you're mine.

642
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,680
That's all.

643
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,280
Here.

644
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,400
I'll let you order.

645
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,200
You want to eat here, don't you?

646
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,920
I'll have the sashimi set,
spicy salmon salad, and…

647
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,480
tuna sushi and rolls, two each.

648
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,520
You want rice?

649
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,240
On second thought,
rice makes you full faster.

650
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,520
I'll just have two miso soups.

651
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,320
What about you?

652
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,200
You only ordered raw dishes.

653
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,280
I'll have grilled mackerel.

654
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,640
-One grilled mackerel.
-That's it.

655
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,840
I'm not finished yet.

656
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,960
You won't be able to eat all of it.

657
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,760
You eat too little.

658
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,040
Let's compete to see who can eat more.

659
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,840
Don't be ridiculous, Type.

660
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,680
Anyway…

661
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,200
your hair is longer.

662
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,200
My skin's tanner too.

663
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,040
I know.

664
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,360
I can see the Speedo tan line.

665
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,800
What the hell are you thinking about?

666
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,640
No.

667
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,080
Nothing.

668
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,320
Can you really eat everything you ordered?

669
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,880
Of course, they're all my favorites.

670
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,280
I have my doubts.

671
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,920
Here you go.
This is what you wanted, right?

672
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,000
Don't use a girly trick
to make it up to me.

673
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,280
I'm not a girl.

674
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,400
I'm not doing this
because I think you're a girl.

675
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,040
But because…

676
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,400
you're my boyfriend.

677
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,400
Whatever.

678
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,800
I'm gonna dig in.

679
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,960
Go on.

680
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,760
Here I go.

681
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
I've been waiting for this.

682
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:50,760
Watch me.

683
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,240
So thick.

684
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,600
Delicious?

685
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,160
Absolutely.

686
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,680
You eat too.

687
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,360
It's okay.

688
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,440
I'm waiting for my grilled mackerel.

689
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,240
What for?
You haven't eaten since last night.

690
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,360
Here.

691
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,920
Eat it or you'll starve to death.

692
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,800
You eat first.

693
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,280
I'm not a girl.

694
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,240
I won't let you
be the only one to apologize.

695
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,960
I'm sorry about before.

696
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,960
Here.

697
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,480
Eat it.

698
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,120
That's it.

699
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,680
How is it?

700
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,400
Yummy?

701
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,440
More, eat more.

702
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,760
It's tasty.

703
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,440
Eat.

704
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,880
That's it.

705
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:53,960
Want more?

706
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,200
No, thanks.

707
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,720
Why aren't you eating? It's not tasty?

708
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
It's tasty.

709
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,760
You sure are comfortable.

710
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,640
I'll wait over there.

711
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,960
Type, wait.

712
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,080
Let me go.

713
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,160
You'll run away if I let go.

714
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,480
This is not only for me.

715
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,320
Okay, I'll stay.

716
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,360
But don't say anything stupid
like last time.

717
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,680
What did I say?

718
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,120
The saleslady was the one
who got it wrong.

719
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,520
But if she mentions it again…

720
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,120
this time, she'll be right.

721
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,600
Whatever.

722
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,840
Which one do you like?

723
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,240
They're all the same.

724
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,160
They're not the same, sir.

725
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,760
The materials are different.

726
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,240
Wait… you were here before, right?
I remember you.

727
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,560
Yes.

728
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,320
Would you like to sit on it?

729
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,280
You should do it.

730
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,560
-We'll sleep together anyway.
-Tharn!

731
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,600
We share a dorm room. Am I wrong?

732
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,320
You're living in the same room?

733
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,680
That's right.

734
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,280
That's why we're looking
for a new mattress for…

735
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,360
our new room.

736
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,520
Then, I suggest a rubber mattress.

737
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,800
The price is higher,
but so is the quality.

738
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,880
Because the weight of two men on the bed…

739
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,600
is heavier than women.

740
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,440
The spring mattress may squeak
when you move.

741
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,560
It also has a sagging problem
and can't support heavy weight.

742
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,200
So I don't recommend it.

743
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,360
-Or would you like to try a foam mattress?
-Foam mattress?

744
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,560
Yes, it's cheaper
than the rubber mattress.

745
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,520
It provides support just as well,
but it's less durable.

746
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,840
I see.

747
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,840
Then, I'll let you choose.
I have to take this call.

748
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,280
You're leaving me alone?

749
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,400
Okay.

750
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,520
Hello, San.

751
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,360
<i>Don't "hello San" me.</i>

752
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,560
<i>You bailed on me yesterday.</i>

753
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,080
I didn't bail on you.

754
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,360
You were planning to meet with Thorn.

755
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,560
<i>You know I want to see you.</i>

756
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,880
So…

757
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,360
what do you want?

758
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,720
<i>Do you want anything in particular?</i>

759
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,880
No, I don't want anything.

760
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,160
I don't want to impose on you.

761
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,720
<i>Come on, Tharn.</i>

762
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,760
<i>You know I hate to buy</i>
<i>random birthday presents.</i>

763
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,360
<i>So? What do you want?</i>

764
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,200
I really don't want anything.

765
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,280
<i>Don't complain</i>
<i>if you don't like my present.</i>

766
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,040
Okay.

767
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,840
What's the matter?

768
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,560
Are you free before the semester starts?

769
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,200
Before the semester starts…

770
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,160
You found out.

771
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,040
Before the semester starts…

772
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,320
I'm free in the afternoon.

773
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,560
I have to go home in the evening.

774
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,440
Go home?

775
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,240
It's my mom's rule.

776
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,400
On birthdays, we can celebrate
with whoever we want.

777
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,280
But dinnertime is family time.

778
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,920
That's why I must have dinner
with my family.

779
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,480
So…

780
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,800
what if you have a boyfriend?

781
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,640
If I have a boyfriend…

782
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,600
my mom allows me to bring my boyfriend.

783
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:46,320
But if my boyfriend asks
why he's not my priority…

784
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,840
my mom would say that…

785
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:54,200
she was the one who endured the pain
of giving birth to me.

786
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,520
That's why she has the right to choose.

787
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,360
My mom also says that…

788
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,480
if my boyfriend's being unreasonable,
I should tell him this,

789
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,480
"If you don't love your family,
how can you love someone else?"

790
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,120
Therefore…

791
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,040
come with me.

792
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,520
Come to my house on my birthday.

793
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,160
Did you forget that…

794
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,000
My family knows.

795
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,200
I…

796
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,680
came out when I was in 12th grade.

797
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,840
So my family knows…

798
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,680
I'm gay.

799
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,240
This is not the time to be horny.

800
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,440
We need to talk this over.

801
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,960
I think we're done talking.

802
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,400
You'll come to my house.

803
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,840
It's a birthday present for me.

804
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I didn't say anything about it.

805
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,240
I won't go to your house.

806
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,160
Even though your family knows
what you are…

807
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,400
I'm not shameless enough to go there
and declare I'm your boyfriend.

808
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,000
Your parents may accept you
for who you are,

809
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,160
but it doesn't mean they'll accept
their son's sex buddy.

810
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,000
Type…

811
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,160
you…

812
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,120
are my boyfriend.

813
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:55,640
Not my sex buddy.

814
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,760
Just tell me what you want.

815
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,280
But I won't go to your house.

816
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,160
I already told you what I wanted.

817
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:10,160
When did you say it?
I've been paying attention the whole time.

818
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,040
I told you, but you didn't listen.

819
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,400
Don't play games with me.

820
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,480
I want…

821
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,120
you.

822
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,680
I'm already yours.

823
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,360
{\an8}Here comes the cake.

824
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,080
{\an8}Happy birthday, Tharn!

825
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,080
{\an8}Thank you.

826
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,680
{\an8}HBD - YEARS MAY PASS,
BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE IMPORTANT TO ME.

827
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,680
{\an8}Who gave him this?

828
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,320
{\an8}Speak of the devil, there he is.

829
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,920
{\an8}But who's with him?

830
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,640
{\an8}<i>I was Tharn's first…</i>

831
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,120
{\an8}and only time.
