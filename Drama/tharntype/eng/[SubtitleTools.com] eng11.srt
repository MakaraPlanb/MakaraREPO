1
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,280
So…

2
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you gonna do next?

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,760
For someone like me,

4
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,880
it has to be an eye for an eye.

5
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,960
What are you doing?

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,200
<i>Hello?</i>

7
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,440
Hello, my name is Type.

8
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,760
I'm Tharn's boyfriend.

9
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,040
I have something to--

10
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,640
Son of a bitch!

11
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,040
That coward hung up on me.

12
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
Don't tell me you called…

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,360
Tharn's ex-boyfriend.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,520
He acted as if I was a bad guy
who tried to kill him.

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Techno.

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,160
What?

17
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,800
You said that kid went to
the same school as Technic, right?

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
Don't tell me you're gonna…

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,280
I'm gonna find him.

20
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,640
Type, isn't there any other way?

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,680
No.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm gonna deal with him.

23
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,080
Relax.

24
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Nic's home!

25
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,560
Man, that was fast.

26
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,520
What have you got?

27
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,680
Don't rush me. You gave me only one night.

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,320
There's quite a few 11th graders
in my school.

29
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,280
So you have nothing?

30
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,880
I do have something.

31
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,120
But what do you have in exchange, Techno?

32
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
I…

33
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,040
Are these photos of all the 11th graders?

34
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,480
Yes.

35
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,760
You made a bargain with me,

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,320
but you gave in to Type so easily.

37
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,560
Flexibility is key.

38
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,360
You need to know who can
or can't be bargained with.

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,800
-For Type…
-What?

40
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,920
I give in.

41
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,640
So you're saying I'm stupid.

42
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,520
You know?

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,520
I found him.

44
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Let me see.

45
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
This is him.

46
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,600
He's the French program student.

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
I've met him many times.

48
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
He's well known because of his good looks.

49
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,480
If you're done, I'm going to school now.

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,920
Hold on.

51
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Do me one more favor.

52
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,960
Is that him?

53
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,840
No, he's taller than that.

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,960
Type.

55
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Isn't this bullying?

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
What? When did I ever bully him?

57
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
Yeah, right.

58
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,840
But there's three of us.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
We are ganging up on him.

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,560
And you could kill people with that look.

61
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,520
Speaking of which,
I have something to say.

62
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
What?

63
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,960
Your brother's good looking.

64
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,080
So?

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
-So, why are you fugly?
-Asshole.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't you want me to relax?

67
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,040
Just keep stressing out.

68
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Type, that's Tar.

69
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,240
Bring him here.

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Hurry up.

71
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,720
Easy, man.

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
Type!

73
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,480
I thought my brother was here.

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,320
You're Tar, right?

75
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,640
-Yes.
-I'm Type.

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
What's the rush?

77
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,320
Don't you wanna talk to Type?

78
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,760
Or do you only wanna talk to Tharn?

79
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,960
Aren't you gonna say anything?

80
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,480
I'll make you break up with Tharn.

81
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
What did you say?

82
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Calm down, Type.

83
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,520
You are good-looking,

84
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
but how could you be so foul-mouthed?

85
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,880
How can you steal someone's boyfriend?

86
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,920
You're going to break up anyway.

87
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,760
-You shitty brat!
-Calm down, Type.

88
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,440
-Please.
-Take it easy.

89
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
This is a café.
There are other people here.

90
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,280
They'll think you're bullying him.

91
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
And you too.

92
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,560
You broke up with Tharn a long time ago.

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
So why are you interfering
with their love?

94
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,160
No matter what you say,
you two are going to break up.

95
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
No matter what,

96
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,080
I'm going to be the cause of your breakup.

97
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,240
Took you long enough to return.

98
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,280
Had a tryst with your ex-boyfriend again?

99
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
I had band practice today.

100
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,520
If you don't believe me,

101
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,600
ask Lhong.

102
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,360
There's no need.

103
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
I believe you.

104
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,880
Because I just met
your ex-boyfriend today.

105
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,200
Are you stunned?

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,080
I only met with your Tar.

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,280
Tar's not mine.

108
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,680
But you're his.

109
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,520
Do you really have no idea?

110
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,720
What do you mean?

111
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,200
There's nothing to interpret.

112
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
He told me…

113
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,320
you belonged to him.

114
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,200
And no matter what,

115
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,560
he's gonna take you away from me.

116
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,280
Type…

117
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,200
-you know that I--
-I'm not finished.

118
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't interrupt me.

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,280
That kid…

120
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,960
He said that you still loved him.

121
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,720
And that he loved you so freaking much.

122
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,040
So much so that he's willing to be outed
as a boyfriend stealer.

123
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,800
Because he doesn't want to lose you.

124
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
He said all this time…

125
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
he's never forgotten you.

126
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,240
He's been dying to return to you.

127
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,080
He was even crying
when he said that to me.

128
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,480
Poor him.

129
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
Type.

130
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,440
-I still love you--
-Shut up!

131
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,880
I never said you could speak.

132
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,080
You know what?

133
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,560
Your old flame…

134
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,400
is so full of shit!

135
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,880
He was crying and sobbing.

136
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,680
Saying he wanted you back.

137
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,880
Does he see himself as a novel heroine

138
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,840
and think I'll give back his ex
just because he begs and cries?

139
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I won't lose anything easily.

140
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,640
A single punch to his face…

141
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
is not satisfying enough.

142
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
You punched Tar?

143
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
Why?

144
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,240
You're worried about him?

145
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,160
Are you that worried about him?

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,600
Are you blind?

147
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,200
He's also a man.

148
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,200
A single punch…

149
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,400
won't kill him.

150
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,960
Please calm down, Type.

151
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,360
I'm worried about you.

152
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
I don't want you to get into trouble.

153
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
You're full of shit too!

154
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
Admit you're worried about him.

155
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,920
And, yeah.

156
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,080
This is how I am…

157
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,280
hot-tempered…

158
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
vulgar…

159
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
impulsive.

160
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,680
Just a scumbag who bullies kids.

161
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,040
But no one puts themselves in my shoes.

162
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,760
No one understands me at all!

163
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
I understand you, Type.

164
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,200
But you need to listen.

165
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
I want to explain about last night.

166
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,800
Let me go.

167
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,600
-I love you.
-Let me go.

168
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,840
I love you, Type.

169
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,840
I said let go!

170
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,720
I don't wanna listen.

171
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,480
It's over.

172
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,080
I told that kid…

173
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,000
you're not his!

174
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,560
You're mine!

175
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,680
And don't meet him again.

176
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
Promise me.

177
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,520
I promise.

178
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
I won't see Tar again.

179
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Look me in the eyes and promise.

180
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
I promise.

181
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,880
I won't be with anyone but you.

182
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
Believe me, Type.

183
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
Please.

184
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
Remember your promise.

185
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,280
Where are you going?

186
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
Somewhere without you.

187
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,840
Damn it.

188
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,200
Type.

189
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
Slow down.

190
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
You'll get drunk early.

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,480
Don't stop me.

192
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,760
I'm acting like this
because of your shitty friend.

193
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,280
Come on.

194
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,800
Trust him when he says
there's nothing going on.

195
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,920
You want me to believe someone
who lied to me?

196
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,280
He probably didn't want to upset you.

197
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,440
You know how caring he is.

198
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,000
Maybe he thought you'd overthink

199
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,880
if you knew about it.

200
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,680
Besides,

201
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,200
he only met with Tar.

202
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,080
He didn't sleep with him.

203
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
First Techno,

204
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,040
and now you.

205
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,360
Am I so bad
that nobody takes my side at all?

206
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,560
I didn't mean it that way.

207
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
What do we do now?

208
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,800
If what you said is true,

209
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,240
then this is all Tar's fault.

210
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,840
You just realized that?

211
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,960
Well…

212
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,560
you have to understand.

213
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,240
Your personality's
the exact opposite of his.

214
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,720
Anybody would think you're the bad guy.

215
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
I mean, look at you.

216
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
You punched an 11th grader.

217
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,120
You're lucky no teachers were around
and no one recorded it,

218
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,080
or you'd be screwed.

219
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Calm down.

220
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,560
The more you play his game,

221
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
the more you lose.

222
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,840
This is how I am.

223
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,360
I'm always the bad guy, anyway.

224
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,400
He said he could accept the way I am.

225
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,920
And now he wants me to change.

226
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,320
As Tharn's best friend…

227
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,280
I know he can accept you the way you are.

228
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,840
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
given you his all.

229
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,960
But you need to keep your cool.

230
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,680
Because Tar is cunning.

231
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,200
I didn't realize…

232
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,160
an innocent-looking boy…

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,080
could be so evil.

234
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,040
He also told me he wanted his Tharn back.

235
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,920
Have I been fooled all this time?

236
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,080
Tum even said his brother was
a goody two shoes.

237
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,160
Both you and Tharn have been fooled.

238
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
No matter how evil Tar is…

239
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,080
or how much he cries and begs…

240
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,560
if Tharn doesn't reciprocate…

241
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,920
it's nothing more than an unrequited love.

242
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,640
If he does,

243
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,840
I'll break up with him.

244
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,080
Don't worry.

245
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,760
He'll never do something like that to you.

246
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,720
He really loves you.

247
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,600
I hope you're right.

248
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,600
Take your man back.

249
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,960
Why is he with you?

250
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,840
You two are fighting.

251
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,680
So I had to deal with him.

252
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,720
Type.

253
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,680
Why is he wasted?

254
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,040
-Type.
-I already told you.

255
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,320
Because you two are fighting.

256
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
Can't you just talk nicely?

257
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
Thanks so much for bringing him back.

258
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,400
-Type.
-You're welcome.

259
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Handsome Lhong is glad to be of service.

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
Be nice to each other, okay?

261
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,880
I'm leaving.

262
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,280
Lhong.

263
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,640
So…

264
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,720
did Type…

265
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,560
tell you anything?

266
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,360
Type, what are you doing?

267
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,360
Boyfriend.

268
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,840
You're mine, Tharn.

269
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
You should take care of him first.

270
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,800
Didn't know this tough guy…

271
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,560
could be so cute when he's drunk.

272
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,040
I'm yours, Type.

273
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,680
Thanks so much…

274
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,760
for bringing him back.

275
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,600
Let's go.

276
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,960
No problem.

277
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
I'm leaving.

278
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,520
I…

279
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
have always been yours, Type.

280
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,040
Don't be stubborn.

281
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm trying to make you comfortable.

282
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,160
You're awful, you know?

283
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,800
You always drive me crazy…

284
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,840
whenever you want.

285
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,520
When I saw Lhong hugging you…

286
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,080
I was very jealous.

287
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,960
I don't mind
that you went out for a drink.

288
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,680
But why did you go with another man?

289
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,320
Even though Lhong's my friend,

290
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm still possessive of you.

291
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
And Tar…

292
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,960
Don't worry.

293
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,880
Because that kid…

294
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,920
doesn't mean anything to me anymore.

295
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,920
You're the only one for me.

296
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,680
What are you rambling about?

297
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
You woke me up.

298
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,560
Sorry.

299
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,680
So…

300
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,080
how do you feel?

301
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm sorry.

302
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,080
What are you apologizing for?

303
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,600
For…

304
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
losing my temper.

305
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,240
You serious?

306
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,560
Talking with Lhong made me realize…

307
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
that I never listened to you.

308
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,840
I always get mad at you.

309
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't know why, but I'm frustrated.

310
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,720
I feel awful.

311
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,640
I don't know how to explain my feelings.

312
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,680
Stop apologizing.

313
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,560
I'm the one who should apologize.

314
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
I won't see Tar again.

315
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,440
Please forgive me.

316
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,240
Tharn…

317
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,120
hug me.

318
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,720
You…

319
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
are drunk.

320
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm not drunk.

321
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,320
I guess what people say is true.

322
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Drunk people never admit they're drunk.

323
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
Jerk.

324
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,280
So…

325
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,400
You forgive me, right?

326
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,120
No.

327
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,800
Not until you hug me.

328
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,680
You're such a tease.

329
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,960
Forgive me.

330
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,960
Your friend already defended you.

331
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,000
You have a good friend.

332
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,800
Lhong…

333
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,080
is the best friend I've ever had.

334
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
If there's a next time,

335
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,720
I'm gonna kill you.

336
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,560
I promise.

337
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,760
You've made a promise.

338
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,640
You've promised.

339
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,560
Tharn!

340
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,000
What's wrong, Lhong?

341
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,360
Why are you yelling?

342
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Read this.

343
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,560
What's this?

344
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,200
I wondered the same thing at first.

345
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,640
Last week, I uploaded the clips
of our band practicing

346
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,520
and playing at Khong's bar on YouTube.

347
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,000
And a scout actually contacted us.

348
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
But doesn't it look fishy to you?

349
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,240
If we don't try, we'll never know.

350
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's give it a try, then.

351
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,280
We'll talk to them.

352
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,160
Then I'll tell Tae and Song, okay?

353
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,960
I don't think you should.

354
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,920
We'd better discuss this ourselves.

355
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,800
I don't want to get their hopes up.

356
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
We should be happy…

357
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
and disappointed together.

358
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,520
So, who's going to do the talk? You or me?

359
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,040
I'll do it.

360
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,160
-Send me the contact details.
-Okay.

361
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,200
If I make an appointment with them,
let's go together.

362
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,520
Sure.

363
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,160
I'LL BE BACK LATE TODAY

364
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,160
I HAVE SOCCER PRACTICE.
WILL BE BACK LATE TOO.

365
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,880
WANNA EAT ANYTHING? I'LL BUY IT FOR YOU.

366
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,120
NO, I'LL EAT TECHNO.

367
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,560
"EATING WITH TECHNO" AND
"EATING TECHNO" ARE DIFFERENT.

368
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
Hello.

369
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,960
Where are you?

370
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,640
<i>I got a flat tire.</i>

371
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,720
<i>Just when I'm in a hurry too.</i>

372
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,280
<i>I don't know how to change a tire,</i>
<i>so I called a mechanic.</i>

373
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,600
<i>But I don't know when they'll arrive.</i>

374
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,840
-Do you want me to be there?
<i>-No, it's okay.</i>

375
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,720
<i>It's almost time</i>
<i>for the meeting with the record label.</i>

376
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,600
<i>Just buy me some time.</i>

377
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,800
<i>I'll be there as soon as I'm done here.</i>

378
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
Okay.

379
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,200
Just hurry.

380
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,640
Let me go!

381
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
Tum is not here!

382
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,800
So let me go!

383
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,000
I said let go!

384
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,960
Let me go!

385
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,760
Tum is not here!

386
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,680
I said let go!

387
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,720
What the hell are you doing!

388
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,840
-Stay out of this.
-Stay back!

389
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,800
I paid for this kid. He's mine.

390
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,680
Tharn, I didn't sell my body.

391
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
What's going on here?
Should I alert the staff?

392
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
Damn! I wasted my money for nothing!

393
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,480
Is he okay?

394
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,160
He's fine.

395
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,880
It's just a misunderstanding. I'm sorry.

396
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,160
Okay.

397
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,240
Tar, are you okay?

398
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,240
I'm not a prostitute.

399
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,880
I'm really not.

400
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,200
Get up.

401
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,440
COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.

402
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,040
Is this how you want to play?

403
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,640
Type.

404
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Why are you here?

405
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,600
At a hotel, no less.

406
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,520
Did Tharn tell you to come?

407
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,280
Tharn told me to come too.

408
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,000
Let's find him.

409
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,960
Are you all right now?

410
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm feeling better.

411
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,440
Then…

412
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,840
I'll call Tum.

413
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
Do you hate me that much?

414
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,640
What are you doing?

415
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,600
You…

416
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,480
didn't get punched?

417
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
Why did you trick me?

418
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,080
I was worried sick, you know?

419
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,880
At least,

420
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,960
you still worry about me.

421
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,360
Tar! Stop!

422
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,320
Tar, let me go.

423
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
No.

424
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,080
I won't.

425
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll never let you go again.

426
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,960
I said let me go.

427
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,120
No.

428
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
I won't let you go.

429
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,920
Tar!

430
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,520
If you don't stop…

431
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,040
you won't even be a brother to me.

432
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,320
No.

433
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
I won't let go.

434
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,600
I won't.

435
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,920
Tar.

436
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
I have an appointment,

437
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,200
so let me go.

438
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,440
They won't come.

439
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
What do you mean?

440
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,600
You…

441
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,280
tricked me?

442
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,120
Tharn, listen to me.

443
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,960
I didn't want to trick you.

444
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,000
But I had no choice.

445
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,040
You had a choice.

446
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,640
And you chose to trick me.

447
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I said let go.

448
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,760
No!

449
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Tharn, listen to me.

450
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,480
It's the only way I could
be with you again.

451
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,760
I didn't want to trick you.

452
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
Just this once.

453
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,040
Give me just this once.

454
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,960
Tar!

455
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,760
You can't do this.

456
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,840
Just this once and I'll leave
you alone for good.

457
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,280
Tar.

458
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
Tar!

459
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,280
Stop stooping so low!

460
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,840
I have no choice.

461
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,880
I haven't had it for a long time.

462
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Now I'm just a loose brat…

463
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,280
who can sleep with anybody.

464
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,480
I'm despicable.

465
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,880
But I love you.

466
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,760
I love you.

467
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,240
I really love you.

468
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,520
Tar.

469
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,000
I have a boyfriend.

470
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,000
Break up.

471
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,680
You'll eventually break up with him.

472
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,680
You have no choice.

473
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
Just like me.

474
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,800
You brat!

475
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,480
Let's take it outside…

476
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,000
It's not what you think.

477
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,800
I can't believe it.

478
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,920
You're mistaken.

479
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,560
There's nothing between me and Tar.

480
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
You win.

481
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,000
Happy?

482
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,720
I was a fool…

483
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,160
to think Tharn would never screw around.

484
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
I was a fool…

485
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,960
to think men like Tharn could change.

486
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,520
And I should've realized that…

487
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,880
in the end…

488
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,840
you'd screw him.

489
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,240
Let's break up, Tharn.

490
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,760
No, Type.

491
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
I won't break up with you.

492
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Please don't say this. I won't break up.

493
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,920
I won't put up with this anymore.

494
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,520
How do you think I feel

495
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,280
when I have to get possessive
and jealous all the time?

496
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,520
And I don't want to play
your ex-boyfriend's game anymore.

497
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,720
I've had enough.

498
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,960
Calm down.

499
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,320
Type.

500
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,600
It's obviously that brat's plan.

501
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,320
Don't take it out on Tharn.

502
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,040
What do you mean?

503
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,880
What plan?

504
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,760
Stop being so easily manipulated.

505
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,600
Type!

506
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,360
He's still furious.

507
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,000
Let's wait until both of you calm down.

508
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,520
Calm down?

509
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,240
You're telling me to calm down?

510
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,200
After Type's just broken up with me?

511
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,480
What do you know?

512
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,560
Tell me everything.

513
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
All I know is…

514
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,240
when I arrived…

515
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Type took the elevator to come see you.

516
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,880
He told me…

517
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,160
Tar texted him…

518
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,200
saying you still loved him.

519
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,160
He told Type to come here
if he didn't believe it.

520
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,680
He'd prove it.

521
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,400
Tar…

522
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,840
I don't ever wanna see your face again.

523
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,080
-Tharn.
-Tharn!

524
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,520
What are you doing?

525
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,840
Moving out, of course.

526
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,680
So I won't stand in your way
when you bring new boyfriends here.

527
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,480
I won't break up with you, Type.

528
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,200
I'll never do it.

529
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,000
But I will.

530
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Type!

531
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
I didn't sleep with Tar.

532
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,320
Please believe me.

533
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,600
Do you think I'm an idiot?

534
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
But you know, don't you?

535
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,160
Tar was the one who texted you.

536
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,160
So, how could you believe him?

537
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,160
I know it's a set-up.

538
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,520
Then, why--

539
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,280
But I won't take it anymore.

540
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,640
This time, it's a set-up.

541
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,520
But which one of your exes
will come crying to you next time?

542
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,560
First, San was messing with my head.

543
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,800
Now your old flame keeps bothering me.

544
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
So who's it gonna be next time?

545
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,680
Do you want me to lose my goddamn mind?

546
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,680
But I haven't done anything.

547
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,400
That's why I'm telling you.

548
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,400
I can't take it anymore.

549
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,640
I don't wanna be a joke anymore.

550
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
Look at me.

551
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,240
I'm a man.

552
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,160
Do you think I wanna be like this?

553
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
To constantly get jealous?

554
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,240
To keep telling everyone you're mine?

555
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,040
I'm fed up.

556
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,640
Each day…

557
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,040
I hate myself more and more.

558
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,080
And if we have to break up some day…

559
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,880
isn't it better to do it now?

560
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,920
Before we get in deeper.

561
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,800
Before I lose myself
more than I already have.

562
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,680
Please, let me go.

563
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,480
Type…

564
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,440
I love you.

565
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,520
Please, give me another chance.

566
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,520
Please, give me one more chance.

567
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,360
I promise.

568
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,680
I won't hurt you anymore.

569
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,600
I won't make you cry.

570
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,400
So, please, don't leave me.

571
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,960
Don't break up with me.

572
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,480
Don't break up with me.

573
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,520
Don't do this, Tharn.

574
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,120
Don't make me give up everything.

575
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,520
Type!

576
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,840
I'll eat spicy food.

577
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,680
I'll eat raw food.

578
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,600
I won't be picky anymore.

579
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,120
I'll get up early to wake you up
every morning.

580
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,520
I'll learn how to cook…

581
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,120
for you.

582
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,600
But please don't leave me.

583
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,080
Don't break up with me, Type.

584
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,760
Everything I do…

585
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,440
I do it for you, Tharn.

586
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,040
Type?

587
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,360
What happened?

588
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,960
Why are you carrying a bag?

589
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,880
I broke up with him.

590
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,720
Do you expect me to stay?

591
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,760
I think you should calm down.

592
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,200
You're angry right now.

593
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,960
If you think this through…

594
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,880
you might be able to forgive him.

595
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,680
I don't think so.

596
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,280
Whether it's now…

597
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,000
or later…

598
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,360
I have to break up with him anyway.

599
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,800
Maybe it's for the best…

600
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,760
to break up with him now.

601
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,000
Before I'm not able to let him go.

602
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,560
How's Tharn doing?

603
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,720
I don't know.

604
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,160
Take care of him for me.

605
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,840
Are you sure?

606
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,320
Yes.

607
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,000
If this is your decision…

608
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,960
then I'll take care of Tharn.

609
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,800
They're all a bunch of idiots.

610
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,080
<i>I did as I was told.</i>

611
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,560
<i>Give those clips back to me.</i>

612
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,400
Sure.

613
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,480
I'll send you the original files.

614
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,120
Thank you for your hard work.

615
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,720
<i>Tharn will never be into you.</i>

616
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,720
What are you talking about?

617
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,040
<i>I know who you are.</i>

618
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,720
<i>I've stayed silent for a year.</i>

619
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,440
<i>But I know it's you…</i>

620
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,760
<i>Lhong.</i>

621
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,040
<i>No matter how hard you try…</i>

622
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,600
<i>Tharn will never look at you.</i>

623
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,040
And you think you have a better chance?

624
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,600
You think Tharn will take back someone

625
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,840
who made him break up
with his dear boyfriend?

626
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,680
Besides,

627
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,000
that someone…

628
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,080
also slept with three men
at the same time.

629
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,840
<i>You sent them to rape me.</i>

630
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,480
<i>Go to hell, you bastard!</i>

631
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,440
I won't go to hell that easily.

632
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,640
Unlike you, who can cry yourself
to death all you want,

633
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,600
and Tharn will never take you back.

634
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,200
Remember that!

635
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,760
Tum.

636
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,680
Tharn.

637
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,160
I'm sorry.

638
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,320
Tar.

639
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,080
Tar, what's happening?

640
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,640
Tar.

641
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,440
Are you okay?

642
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,000
What's happening? Tar?

643
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,400
Tar, open the door.

644
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,600
Tar.

645
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,640
Come out and tell me what's wrong.

646
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:10,040
Why don't you ever tell me anything?

647
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,560
Can't I help you at all?

648
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,400
I'm sorry.

649
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
I'm the only one who never abandons him.

650
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,680
I'm the only one who never betrays him.
