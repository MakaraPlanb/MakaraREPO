1
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,520
Type.

2
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,080
Look what you've done.

3
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,800
What is it?

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
So what?

5
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
"So what?"

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,920
Type…

7
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,680
just apologize to those two, please.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And why should I? I've done nothing wrong.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,000
You know it won't be over soon
if they don't stop.

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,040
Type…

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,880
right now, I'm worried about you.

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,400
Just saying sorry…

13
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,160
won't hurt your pride.

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,800
-I think--
-No means no.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,600
You should leave.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,000
I want to sleep. I have a headache.

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,880
You know what?

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,400
I'm gonna buy food downstairs.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,040
Do you want anything?

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,880
No, I'm not hungry.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,880
Okay…

22
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,560
I don't know how to help you anymore.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,520
No this.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,680
No that.

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,560
No everything.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,480
You keep saying frickin' no to everything.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,920
I won't worry about you anymore.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Why the hell do I even care?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,160
Are you okay?

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Guess you've heard.

31
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,400
Whose side are you on?

32
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,880
The side that hates me?

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,040
Or the side that uses me
to diss homosexuals?

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,440
But you must've hated me…

35
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,400
for insulting your own kind.

36
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Today I was an outcast.

37
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,120
All eyes on me wherever I went.

38
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,160
I guess this is what I get…

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
for insulting you.

40
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,200
You'll get infected
with narrow-minded disease.

41
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,080
Is there anything I can do for you?

42
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
Can you make everyone on earth…

43
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,200
straight?

44
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,320
Can you do that?

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,760
I can't.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Because I'll never stop liking men.

47
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Students, do you understand
today's lesson?

48
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,480
If you have any questions,
come see me after class.

49
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,120
Class dismissed.

50
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,080
Tharn.

51
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,200
You'd better move off campus.

52
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,480
Why do you still live
with a man like that?

53
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,920
Exactly what kind of man…

54
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
are you talking about?

55
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,840
You know what I mean.

56
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
Just move out.

57
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,280
Or you'll get dragged into this mess.

58
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,120
It's obvious that your roommate is…

59
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
a troublemaker.

60
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,000
Why do I have to move out?

61
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,200
He and I…

62
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
aren't fighting.

63
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,200
I was wondering about that too.

64
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,040
How could you live with him for so long?

65
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,120
I knew from the start that he…

66
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,600
hated gay people.

67
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,040
I deal with him only when necessary.

68
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Does he know that you're…

69
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,120
Why are you nosing around
in my personal life?

70
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
The midterm exam…

71
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,120
Have you prepared for it?

72
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,880
That hurts, man.

73
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,920
Don't talk about exams.

74
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,720
Let me fully indulge in this drama first.

75
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,160
To hell with studying!

76
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,600
Where are you going? No rehearsal today?

77
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,200
I'm not you.

78
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,280
I'm returning to my room
to study for exams.

79
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,160
Of course, super responsible
and hard-working Tharn.

80
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,520
We only have one theory test.

81
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,760
The rest are practicals.

82
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,760
You sure are diligent, aren't you?

83
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,560
What a great student.

84
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,560
Yeah.

85
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
A thumbs-up for you.

86
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,280
What thumb?

87
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,600
I saw that!

88
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,760
Take care.

89
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,760
Yeah.

90
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
You skipped class again today?

91
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
Leave me alone.

92
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,640
I talked to Techno.

93
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,240
He said you skipped Gen Ed class.

94
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,960
I know he can answer roll calls for you,

95
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,400
but you've been missing classes
for a week.

96
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,800
Nosy.

97
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,960
You should review the dictionary.

98
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Nosy and worried…

99
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,320
mean different things.

100
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,840
You? Worried about me?

101
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,800
I want to laugh my ass off.

102
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
Then laugh.

103
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,160
Anyway, let's have dinner.

104
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm not hungry.

105
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,840
Type, get up and eat something.

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,560
I told you to leave me alone!

107
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,240
I didn't ask you to buy me dinner.

108
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,280
I didn't ask you to be nice to me.

109
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,040
Piece of shit!

110
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,480
What are you doing, Tharn?

111
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,800
Let me go!

112
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
Tharn, let me go.

113
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
Eat something.

114
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,400
Please.

115
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,360
I don't care if you see me as gay…

116
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,000
or whatever else you hate…

117
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,360
but please eat something.

118
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm begging you.

119
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,320
You're begging a scumbag like me?

120
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
I know it's not your fault.

121
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,760
But the whole university's
decided I'm guilty.

122
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,120
I don't care what people say.

123
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,680
To me…

124
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,760
you're innocent.

125
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
Even though I hate gay people?

126
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,120
Even though I hate you?

127
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes.

128
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,880
Even though you hate me.

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Type…

130
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,920
you can tell me what's on your mind.

131
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,240
I'll always hear you out.

132
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm on your side.

133
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,520
Please, Type.

134
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,080
You can tell me.

135
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
When I was 11…

136
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,360
a scumbag did something to me.

137
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,720
He was a roofer at my dad's resort.

138
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,920
I saw him every day.

139
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
He told me…

140
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,640
there was a football field
where I could play.

141
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,880
So I followed him.

142
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,080
Then he punched me.

143
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
I was so tiny.

144
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,200
There was no way I could fight back.

145
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,320
He tied my hands.

146
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,720
No matter how much I begged,
he wouldn't let me go.

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
The memory's still so vivid.

148
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,760
That place was so filthy.

149
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
You made me cum, right?

150
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,200
But I, of all people…

151
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,960
had to do it for a man when I was 11.

152
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,760
It was horrible.

153
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,240
I was disgusted.

154
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,360
I was suffering.

155
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,560
And suffocating.

156
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,520
Tears streamed down my face.

157
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,680
He also groped me.

158
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
And stripped me!

159
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,120
That's enough, Type.

160
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,920
Say no more.

161
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,640
I'm sorry.

162
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Why are you apologizing?

163
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,640
I hate you.

164
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,720
I hate people like you.

165
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
It's okay to hate me.

166
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,120
When will you stop sticking your nose
into other people's business?

167
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,440
I'm worried.

168
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,720
I thought I heard them arguing just now.

169
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
But then they got quiet all of a sudden.

170
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,720
Seo.

171
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm worried about Type.

172
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,880
That damn gossip's spread all over campus.

173
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,800
It's become the talk of the town.

174
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
So…

175
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,040
What do you think?

176
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,600
Do you agree with Type?

177
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
I don't know.

178
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,720
But I'm not against homosexuality.

179
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,200
And I don't believe
Type's that kind of person.

180
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,960
It's true he's foul-mouthed and blunt,

181
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,040
but he has his reasons.

182
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,600
Should I…

183
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,840
go ask him in person?

184
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,800
Before you worry
about the people next door…

185
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,680
shouldn't you worry about yourself first?

186
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,960
How many F's are you planning to get?

187
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,680
Come on, studying is no big deal.

188
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,320
But snooping on…

189
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,000
I mean, looking after the freshmen
is more important.

190
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,560
That's enough. Time to study.

191
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,160
And stop worrying about them.

192
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,600
Even if you don't care about yourself…

193
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,160
I still care about you.

194
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
What?

195
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,480
How long are you going to be like this?

196
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,080
Be quiet!

197
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,720
Mama!

198
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
Look at this.

199
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Things are getting out of control
because of you.

200
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,360
Why are you blaming it on me?
You took part in it too.

201
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
You egged me on.
Now you're pinning the blame on me.

202
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,600
Honestly, if it's not our fault,
then whose fault is it?

203
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,080
That brat.

204
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,720
If he hadn't insulted us,
I wouldn't have done it.

205
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Let me see.

206
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Professor's calling.

207
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,120
Oh, shit.

208
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,520
Pick up!

209
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,200
Hello, Professor.

210
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Yes.

211
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,640
What?

212
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,680
Okay, we'll be there right away.

213
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Yes. See you.

214
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,160
Bitch, we're screwed.

215
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,600
The principal wants to see us.

216
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,000
Bitch, I knew it!

217
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,920
Who shared our story
on the university's forum?

218
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
Look, it's really serious.

219
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,520
I bet she did it. I remember her name.

220
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,160
So nasty.

221
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,000
That ugly bitch.

222
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,400
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

223
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,640
What do we do, Mama?

224
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,000
We must end the feud by this week,
or we'll be in big trouble.

225
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Hold on.

226
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,440
Aren't you going to apologize?

227
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,160
What about you?

228
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,360
Ever think of apologizing to me?

229
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
Why do we have to apologize?

230
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,920
If you hadn't posted my picture,
you wouldn't have gotten into trouble.

231
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,320
Besides, I could've called the police
to arrest you,

232
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,040
but you're lucky I think before I act.

233
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,920
-Shut up!
-Mama, stop it.

234
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,240
We have enough problems.
I want this to be over.

235
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,360
We're gonna let him leave just like that?

236
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,760
We'll have bigger problems
if things drag on.

237
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Tharn.

238
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,560
What are you doing here?

239
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,000
Excuse me.

240
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,880
I want to talk to you.

241
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,120
Type…

242
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,000
you head back first.

243
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,120
I have something to say to them.

244
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Even you are on their side.

245
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,040
What did you say to them?

246
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,520
What did I say?

247
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
Techno sent me this. I can't believe it.

248
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,600
They condemned me
like I was a murderer the other day,

249
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,480
but now they've suddenly apologized?
Are they plotting something again?

250
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,280
It actually worked.

251
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,120
What?

252
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,840
What did you say to those fags?

253
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,720
Watch your mouth, Type.

254
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,560
Haven't you had enough trouble?

255
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,640
Tharn…

256
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,960
What did you say to those two?

257
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
You told them about my past, didn't you?

258
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,480
Is that why they feel sorry for me?

259
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm warning you,

260
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,160
watch your mouth.

261
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,560
You can insult me.

262
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,960
I don't mind.

263
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,080
But not everyone will put up
with your insults.

264
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,240
None of this would've happened
if you'd kept your cool.

265
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,640
It's enough that they agreed to end it.

266
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,360
They even cleared your name.

267
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,760
And don't worry.

268
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,720
I didn't tell them about your past.

269
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,760
Then, what the hell did you tell them?

270
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,640
I told them…

271
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,400
What?

272
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,000
…I like you.

273
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,040
What do you want to talk about?

274
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,200
I need you…

275
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,320
to listen to what I'm about to say.

276
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm gay.

277
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,280
I kinda noticed that.

278
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,360
But how did you get involved with him…

279
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,440
if he hates fem gays so much?

280
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,320
Or is he fine with masculine gays?

281
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,520
No.

282
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Type…

283
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
He hates every kind of gay person.

284
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
And a gay guy like me…

285
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,040
has to live with a guy
who hates gay people the way he does.

286
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,280
How can you live with him?
Don't you two fight?

287
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,080
We almost ripped each
other's heads off at first.

288
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,120
But if you try to understand him…

289
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,720
you'll see he's a good guy.

290
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,480
Even though he's prejudiced…

291
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,280
and a douchebag sometimes…

292
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,200
if you really get to know him,
you'll see he's a good guy.

293
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,880
But I'm here to talk to you…

294
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,480
not because I want you
to sympathize with him.

295
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,440
The real reason is…

296
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
I like him.

297
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Oh, my God, you like that jerk?

298
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,880
Yes, I do.

299
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
And I admit…

300
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,480
I made a move on him.

301
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
So scandalous!

302
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
Sounds like the plot of a BL novel.

303
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,720
Maybe he hates gay people because of me.

304
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,920
I know he doesn't like me.

305
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,520
And yet I kept approaching him.

306
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,480
Because I…

307
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,800
couldn't hold back my feelings for him.

308
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,760
His reactions weren't this violent,
though,

309
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,080
but it's because of me.

310
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,120
That day…

311
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,560
you touched him, didn't you?

312
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,840
Yeah, a little.
But I didn't think he'd be angry.

313
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
He's Techno's friend,

314
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,800
so I thought he wouldn't mind.

315
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,160
If you hadn't touched him…

316
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,480
the way I did…

317
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,560
he wouldn't have insulted you.

318
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,720
If you want to blame someone…

319
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,360
it should be me, not him.

320
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,640
But…

321
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,200
the one who insulted us was him, not you.

322
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
Why are you defending him?

323
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,440
If his insults were actually meant for me…

324
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,200
then he didn't do anything wrong, right?

325
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,640
Do you agree with me?

326
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,000
When people hate someone or something,

327
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,720
they don't want to be near them.

328
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,160
But you touched him

329
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,600
and bugged him for photos.

330
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,720
So how was he wrong for getting mad?

331
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
And you never asked him

332
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,920
why he hates or is scared of us.

333
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,200
If it was your picture
that got posted online

334
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
and people started to criticize you,

335
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,360
without knowing the truth,

336
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,720
how would you feel?

337
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,240
So, you're saying it's our fault?

338
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,960
I'm not blaming anyone.

339
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,560
You probably didn't think
things would go this far.

340
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
And I'm sorry on Type's behalf.

341
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,480
Because this is all my fault, not his.

342
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,200
I'm begging you.

343
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm pleading with you.

344
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,720
Right now…

345
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,960
Type's suffering enough as it is.

346
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,760
I can't stand seeing…

347
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,720
the man I like suffering.

348
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,920
I'm begging you.

349
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,960
Please.

350
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,320
Let's end this.

351
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay, I'll end it.

352
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,240
You look as if you don't believe me.

353
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,600
After all the crazy shit you've said,
do you expect me to believe you?

354
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,880
You just told them you liked me
and got handsy with me,

355
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,680
and they believed you. Is that right?

356
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,680
As if that would help my situation.

357
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,040
My turn to ask you.

358
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,240
Why didn't you report them to the police?

359
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,440
A guy who doesn't put up
with any crap like you

360
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,000
should want to get back at them.

361
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,120
Because back then…

362
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,040
my dad filed charges.

363
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,240
And the media found out.

364
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,040
Believe it or not, I made the front page.

365
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,640
What was it they called me, again?

366
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
"A boy known as T."

367
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
There was a lot of commotion.

368
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,040
Everyone was suddenly
all over that troubled boy,

369
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,720
because of a tiny article
on the front page.

370
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,720
Because of that article,

371
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,960
the neighbors found out
what happened to me.

372
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,720
I couldn't leave my house for months,

373
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,440
because I didn't want people to ask me…

374
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,040
"How are you?"

375
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,320
"You poor boy."

376
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,800
"Oh, dear, it could've been worse."

377
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,160
Poor boy, my ass.

378
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,080
If their kids had suffered the way I did,

379
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,080
they would've stopped being so nosy.

380
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,880
That horrible experience
of being chased by the media…

381
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,760
I know it all too well.

382
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,800
It's the same this time too.

383
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,760
If I press charges,

384
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,440
I might get some satisfaction,

385
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,320
get to see them suffer
for their foolishness.

386
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,280
And then what?

387
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,840
I'll get dragged into the same mess
all over again.

388
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
I've had enough.

389
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,040
I'm going crazy already.

390
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,200
Why does my life
revolve around these people?

391
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,960
Type…

392
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,240
There's something I have to tell you.

393
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,240
When I told them I like you…

394
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800
What about it?

395
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,880
I meant it.

396
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,320
You heard right.

397
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,960
I think…

398
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,640
I like you.

399
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,600
Hey, Type.

400
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,920
Does Tharn actually like you?

401
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,120
What the hell did you say?

402
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,040
I almost choked to death.

403
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
I need to clean my face.

404
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,120
Don't change the subject.

405
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,880
I heard it from those two.

406
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,880
What did you hear?

407
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,360
They said they swallowed their pride
and quashed the rumors about you

408
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,440
not because they were afraid
you'd go to the cops

409
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,840
or sue them for damages,

410
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,280
but because Tharn begged them
to forgive you.

411
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,880
He said it was his fault

412
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,320
for being crazy in love with you

413
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,440
and making you hate gay people,
and you took it out on them as a result.

414
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,720
How the hell are the two related?

415
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,680
Exactly my thoughts.
How the hell are they related?

416
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,880
They insisted that Tharn really liked you.

417
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,920
But since he made such a big pass

418
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,200
on a straight guy like you,
you felt creeped out…

419
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,520
and then took it out on them.

420
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,640
In the end,
Tharn said everything was his fault.

421
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,400
If they wanted to vent their anger,
they should do it on him.

422
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,640
What if he really likes you?

423
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,600
How can he like you?

424
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
The idiot who's been acting childish
and kicking him out of the room.

425
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,320
Take it easy, pal.

426
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,880
Are you here to give me a hard time?

427
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,720
No, I'm just asking.

428
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,640
So…

429
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,560
Did you guys do it?

430
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,200
You want a piece of me?

431
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,960
Impulsive.

432
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,640
What a cruel twist of fate for Tharn
to fall in love with you.

433
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,800
I'll go buy some lunch. So hungry.

434
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,160
How was your class today?

435
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,400
None of your business.

436
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,880
Why did you come back so early?

437
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,560
Worried about me?

438
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,840
The midterm's coming up.

439
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,840
Time to focus on studying
instead of music.

440
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,520
Type…

441
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,600
I bought you dinner.

442
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,200
I already ate.

443
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,000
Save it for later, then.

444
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,880
Why are you doing this?

445
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I want to take care of my crush.
What's wrong with that?

446
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,480
Seriously.

447
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,200
What do you want from me?

448
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
If I tell you…

449
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,320
will you give it to me?

450
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Cut the shit.

451
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,880
I want to have sex with you.

452
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,880
Is that your death wish?

453
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,280
I'm just kidding.

454
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,040
Your reaction was funnier than I expected.

455
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,800
What the hell are you playing at?

456
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,960
What exactly do you want?

457
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,960
The thing is…

458
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm kidding.

459
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,280
But I'm also serious.

460
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,000
What do you mean?

461
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,040
I want to sleep with you.

462
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
Don't get mad. Let me finish first.

463
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,800
Go on.

464
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,080
I want to sleep with you…

465
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,920
but not now.

466
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,520
I told you I liked you, didn't I?

467
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,560
And because I like you…

468
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,720
I'll do whatever it takes
to get your attention.

469
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,480
You're a guy, so you should know…

470
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,120
what man wants to do
with a person he likes.

471
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,160
Therefore…

472
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,680
watch your back.

473
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
If you let your guard down--

474
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,160
I'll never sleep with you.

475
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,240
No more questions?

476
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,920
Then, I'll get back to studying.

477
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
The way you look at me…

478
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,080
says you're falling for me.

479
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,680
Dick.

480
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,440
Damn! I can't focus at all!

481
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,720
I've made up my mind.

482
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,920
Tharn, get up and come eat breakfast.

483
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,720
What time is it?

484
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,200
Ten o'clock.

485
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,200
First time I've seen you drunk.

486
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,120
A senior invited me
to watch him sing at a pub.

487
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,320
And he bought me a drink.

488
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,640
So…

489
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,760
Why don't you want me to go home?

490
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,240
Have sex with me.

491
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
Have sex with me.

492
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,680
What did you say?

493
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,080
You know.

494
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,680
Sleep with me.

495
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,920
I don't want to owe you.

496
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,760
Owe me what?

497
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,120
You've helped me many times, right?

498
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,360
And I don't want to feel indebted to you.

499
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,160
What would I do if you demanded
I repay you out of the blue?

500
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,440
That's why…

501
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,920
I'm gonna sleep with you once,

502
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
and then we're done.

503
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,920
No more obligations to each other.

504
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,160
And I'll tell you this right now.

505
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,200
No matter how hard you try,

506
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,520
I'll never go out with you.

507
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,480
And if I have to watch my back
every time you're around,

508
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,880
I'd be better off sleeping with you
this once and getting it over with.

509
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,000
So, you're saying…

510
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
you'll sleep with me…

511
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,720
because you want to repay me?

512
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,560
I thought you said…

513
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,440
you'd never sleep with me.

514
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,240
I told you it's only the one time.

515
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,320
Want it or not?

516
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,040
Consider it an act of kindness.

517
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,120
One time?

518
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah.

519
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040
One time only and no more.

520
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,320
Who's going to be on top?

521
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,880
You.

522
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm gonna lie still.

523
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,200
Good.

524
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,600
Because I'll tell you something,

525
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,880
I'm always the top.

526
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm going to take a shower.

527
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,280
Just hurry up.

528
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,000
What a pain in the ass.

529
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,680
Are you ready?

530
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,800
Will you quit stalling?

531
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,360
I've been waiting all day.

532
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,160
Just do it and get it over with, already.

533
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,280
You see,

534
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,040
with this kind of stuff…

535
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,360
we must be patient.

536
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,160
How's it different from normal?

537
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,920
You go straight to it and finish.

538
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,640
Did you usually…

539
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,800
do it with your exes that way?

540
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,760
Yeah.

541
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,560
Let me teach you.

542
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,040
This kind of stuff…

543
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,440
is more than just…

544
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
getting straight to it.

545
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,320
No kissing.

546
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm not having sex
with someone who won't kiss me.

547
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,240
Damn it.

548
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,360
Happy now?

549
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,200
It's not enough for me.

550
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,360
Aren't you going to help?

551
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,120
Get up.

552
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,880
You made me sore
and still expect me to help?

553
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,600
How do you feel?

554
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,320
Terrible.

555
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,120
Nobody's ever said
my performance was terrible.

556
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,080
Only terrific.

557
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,360
Good thing you're okay.

558
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,680
I'm a man. Don't treat me like a woman.

559
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,280
I never treated you like a woman.

560
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,360
I don't sleep with women.

561
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,120
So you can relax.

562
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,520
I only do this to the men I sleep with.

563
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,440
So all of your butt buddies are sissies?

564
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,680
Don't insult my ex boyfriends.

565
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,640
Actually…

566
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,440
the first time I slept with a man…

567
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,520
I wasn't the top.

568
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,080
I was probably 14 at the time.

569
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,600
In eighth grade?

570
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,840
Something like that.

571
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,720
I was in an all-boys school.

572
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,360
It's quite normal

573
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,560
for schools with no female students.

574
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,920
At first, I wasn't sure
if I really liked boys,

575
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,880
or if it was because
of environmental influences.

576
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,120
Until a senior…

577
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,320
called me to the music room.

578
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,880
He asked me straight up…

579
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,600
if I would sleep with him.

580
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,480
I was confused,
but I also wanted to try it.

581
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,640
So I said yes.

582
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,080
But it wasn't a good experience.

583
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,080
When I reached high school…

584
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,720
I tried it again.

585
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,000
But this time I switched roles.

586
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,360
It made me realize…

587
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,160
I was born this way.

588
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,440
Do you think you might be gay
because you've never slept with a woman?

589
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,600
I tried once.

590
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,240
But I didn't feel a thing.

591
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,960
I like it this way.

592
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,600
Like you.

593
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,520
Why are you telling me this?

594
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,600
I want you to get to know me better.

595
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,520
By the way,

596
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
nobody's ever…

597
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,360
stopped after just one time with me.

598
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,520
I told you it's just this once.

599
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,120
I heard you.

600
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,920
But I wasn't listening.

601
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Son of a bitch!

602
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,000
I won't let it happen again.

603
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,680
Stop following me,

604
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,680
or people will think
we came here together.

605
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,080
There's no harm in it.

606
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,240
We did come here together.

607
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,560
What will people think if they see two men
getting tested for STIs together?

608
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,640
Use your brain.

609
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,160
They'll probably think…

610
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,800
we're boyfriends.

611
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,080
Tharn!

612
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,000
I'm getting tested like you told me to.

613
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,440
So, if I do it,

614
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,400
you do it too.

615
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,200
Otherwise, it's not fair.

616
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,200
I'm already here.

617
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,320
Then, stop worrying
about what others think.

618
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:02,320
Don't you want to know
whether or not I'm disease-free

619
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,600
and if you can catch anything?

620
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,720
So?

621
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,320
How was it?

622
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,640
Everything's fine.

623
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,080
Except when that damn doctor
asked me if I'd slept with men.

624
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,840
Damn, what a nosy bastard.

625
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,120
Should've just told me the results.

626
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,680
It's the doctor's job to ask.

627
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,640
You just have to answer.

628
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,680
Yeah, whatever.

629
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
What about you?

630
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,080
What about me?

631
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,920
Your results.

632
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,600
Don't play dumb.

633
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,800
Well?

634
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,880
You can relax…

635
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,440
because I'm disease-free.

636
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,720
What about you?

637
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,440
You think I'd get positive results?

638
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,360
I'm disease-free.

639
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,760
I'm relieved.

640
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,760
What's so funny?

641
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,880
Since you're relieved,

642
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,880
let's have lunch.

643
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,360
I'm hungry.

644
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,240
Don't touch me.

645
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,000
Fine, I won't.

646
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,280
So you and I…

647
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,400
Sex only.

648
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,480
They're so handsome. What a pity.

649
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,840
What do you mean? You should praise them.

650
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,360
Not many young men have the courage
to get tested for STIs.

651
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,400
Every couple should take care
of their sexual health after having sex.

652
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,480
You're positive they're a couple?

653
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,760
Aren't they? They seem inseparable.

654
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,920
You're right, they must be a couple.

655
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,440
Where were you yesterday, Type?

656
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,440
I think you've missed
too many classes already.

657
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,080
That's right.

658
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:04,640
But don't scold him.
He scores almost full marks on every test.

659
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,160
By the way,

660
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,600
Type, can you tutor me for exams?

661
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:11,200
Wait, Champ.

662
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,360
I still don't know where he was yesterday.

663
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,600
I wasn't feeling well.

664
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,080
Don't worry about me.

665
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,640
Happy now? You got your answer. My turn.

666
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,600
Will you be my tutor?

667
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,200
What will I get in return?

668
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,200
I'll buy you a meal.

669
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,240
Whatever you want to eat, it's on me.

670
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,200
Okay.

671
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,880
Come see me when you're ready.

672
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,720
Thank you so much, Type.

673
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,040
I'll message you the day before the exam.

674
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,240
Don't forget.

675
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,360
-Yeah.
-Later.

676
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,880
What the hell?

677
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,200
Speaking of which,

678
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,600
have you thanked Tharn yet?

679
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,360
Thanked him for what?

680
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,680
For looking after you when you were sick.

681
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,480
And also smoothing things over
with the seniors.

682
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,200
How do you want me to do it?

683
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,240
Should I go to him and say
"thank you so much,"

684
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,440
or stick a note on his forehead?

685
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,440
See? You're always like this.

686
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,200
Do you know how to be grateful?

687
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,680
Not a single "thank you"
ever comes out of your mouth.

688
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,960
What do you want me to do? Just say it.

689
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,560
Treat him to a meal.

690
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,200
Treat me, too.

691
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,840
Because I helped you too.

692
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,760
You just want free food.

693
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,560
I don't.

694
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,880
Whatever.

695
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,920
But I'm not gonna invite him.

696
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,640
Fine, I know you won't do it.

697
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,680
But that's okay. I'll just text him.

698
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,280
Sorry, I'm late.
The professor wouldn't let us go.

699
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,280
It's all right, man.

700
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,600
Tharn, what do you want to eat?

701
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,160
I wanna eat everything on the menu,
from the first to the last page.

702
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
I'm going to the restroom.

703
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,960
Okay. Put it here.

704
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,640
Damn it.

705
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,800
What was that?

706
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,520
Nothing.

707
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,440
Hurry up and order.

708
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,720
So…

709
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,840
I can order anything?

710
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,920
Will you quit stalling?

711
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,680
Okay.

712
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,640
Excuse me, we want to order.

713
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,520
I'll have…

714
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,280
one large Hawaiian pizza,

715
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,240
six chicken wings, garlic bread,
and spaghetti carbonara and kee mao.

716
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,680
And BBQ pork ribs too.

717
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,760
Techno.

718
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,080
You want French fries?

719
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,160
French fries, my ass. That's enough.

720
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,360
That's all.

721
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,240
And I'll have water, please.

722
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,160
You?

723
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,440
-Water.
-Two glasses of water, please.

724
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,280
What about Tharn?

725
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:10,640
Sprite.

726
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,960
One Sprite, please. Thank you.

727
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,840
He likes to drink Sprite?

728
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,520
Whatever, I just happen to know.

729
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,160
You sure know my mind.

730
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,360
Why the hell are you sitting here?

731
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,480
Calm down, man.
We're in a public place, not your room.

732
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,960
What's your problem? He's just sitting.

733
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,480
I think it's good he's sitting here.

734
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,760
It's your chance to get used to him
and control your sharp tongue.

735
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:42,480
He's right.

736
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,360
In fact, you should be used to me by now.

737
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,400
Used to you?

738
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,320
What a joke.

739
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,640
Thank you.

740
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Thank you.

741
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,400
-Techno, pass me the ketchup.
-Sure, here.

742
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:58,600
I'll do it.

743
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,560
Anything else?

744
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,480
No, just ketchup.

745
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,680
I'll pour it.

746
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:10,520
Too much.

747
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,440
-Too much, prick.
-Too much?

748
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,440
-Too much.
-Give it to me.

749
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,640
Take this.

750
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,000
Guys.

751
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,320
I'm going to the bathroom.

752
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,040
I think I need to pee.

753
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:36,880
You can eat first.

754
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,680
Oh, boy…

755
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,680
Awkward.

756
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,040
Tharn, I'm not your boyfriend.

757
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,720
I know.

758
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,880
So, stop acting like I'm your boyfriend.

759
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,440
You don't have to sit this close to me.

760
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,640
Don't pour ketchup for me.

761
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,840
And don't give me your pizza.

762
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,400
I know we're not boyfriends.

763
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:06,720
So…

764
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,080
just think of it
like I'm taking care of my sex friend.

765
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,080
And since we're sex friends…

766
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,040
should I perform my duty tonight?

767
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,560
What are you talking about?

768
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,520
Where did you get all that stamina?

769
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,200
My bed is messy again.

770
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,160
Type?

771
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:01,160
What?

772
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,080
I'm sleeping on your bed tonight.

773
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,760
Mine's dirty. I don't wanna sleep on it.

774
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:15,040
Are you free this Saturday evening?

775
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,080
If you mean for sex, then yeah.

776
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,000
Who said anything about sex?

777
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,760
I wanted to ask you
to go bedsheet shopping with me.

778
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,200
{\an8}Are you going to the cafeteria?

779
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,720
{\an8}I want you to join me.

780
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,320
{\an8}<i>Weren't you the one that said…</i>

781
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,200
{\an8}<i>the two of us…</i>

782
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,360
{\an8}<i>if we cut out the sex part,</i>
<i>we're just friends?</i>

783
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,960
{\an8}<i>You're the friend I want to do this with.</i>

784
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,320
{\an8}You should be happy I'm acting like this.

785
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,880
{\an8}They are my high school friends.

786
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,120
{\an8}Mai and Puifai.

787
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,520
{\an8}Added.
