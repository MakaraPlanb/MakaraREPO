1
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,200
I think this one suits you.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,680
You want to get your ass kicked?
Too girly.

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,320
It's cute.

4
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,520
How about this one?

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,480
Hell no.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
Too pale.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,320
What about that one? Dark-colored.
That one.

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,640
This one's okay.

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,440
Can I help you?

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,040
I want this bedsheet.
Do you have darker colors?

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, but these are single bedsheets.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,240
King size sheets are over there.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,920
Hey, you.

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,680
What do you mean, king size?

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
I'm sorry, I thought you two were…

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,880
Just buy any of them.
I don't care anymore.

18
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,880
I'll wait at the restaurant.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,760
It's okay.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
The thing is…

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,320
my boyfriend's shy.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,200
So I was right about you two, wasn't I?

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,920
Not exactly.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Right now, I'm just…

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,160
his boyfriend-to-be.

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,840
Why are you so pissed?

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,840
She apologized.

29
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,480
Are you full yet?

30
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,960
Do you want to order more?

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,560
No, I wanna leave.

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
Come on, Type.

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Waiting for me will kill you or something?

34
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,520
Hurry up and finish the food.
I hate waiting.

35
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
Here.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Take it.

37
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,240
Bedsheets?

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,720
{\an8}PRICE: 4,500 BAHT

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,320
What the hell? It cost 4,500 baht.

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,520
It's expensive,
but the fabric is high quality.

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,040
It's very durable too.

42
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,800
I don't want it.

43
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,240
Too expensive.

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
Just take it.

45
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
I said I'd buy it for you.

46
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,200
No, it's too expensive.

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,360
-Take it.
-No.

48
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Is your family rich?

49
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,240
No.

50
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
I have money from my part-time job.

51
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,680
-What job?
-Just a job.

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,800
What job? You never told me about it.

53
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,240
Usually…

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I play drums in bars.

55
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,800
Oh, yeah?

56
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Really?

57
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,360
When I was in tenth grade…

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,600
a senior asked me
to play with him at this bar.

59
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When he graduated,
the bar owner trusted me,

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,160
and he let me continue to play there.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,040
When I was in 12th grade,

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
I had some issues with the band members,

63
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,920
so the band broke up.

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
So…

65
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
What were the issues?

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
Never mind.

67
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,960
It's none of my business.

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,920
Stop touching me.

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,040
I fought with a bandmate.

70
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Why? You screwed his brother or something?

71
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
It's not what you think.

72
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,600
The thing is,

73
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,360
I used to date my bandmate's brother.

74
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
When we broke up,

75
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,480
my friend accused me
of hurting his brother,

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
when I was actually
the one who got dumped.

77
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,760
Why are you telling me this?

78
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,920
I want you to know me.

79
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,360
The real me…

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,680
who's been hurt.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,320
Are you full?

82
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
I'm leaving.

83
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,080
Type.

84
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,360
What?

85
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,000
Can you…

86
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,000
go shopping with me?

87
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,480
Why should I?

88
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,360
It's groceries for our room.
Help me carry them, please.

89
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,000
Just buy as much
as you can carry on your own.

90
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,640
But the groceries are for the two of us.

91
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,240
You ran out of detergent.

92
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,520
And the snacks I stored for later?
You ate all of them.

93
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,560
Why can't you help me?

94
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,480
What are you afraid of?

95
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
I'm not afraid.

96
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Didn't you say that we're sex friends?

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
If we cut out the sex part…

98
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
can't we at least be friends?

99
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,920
I hate when you call me your wifey.

100
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
Then I won't call you that.

101
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Is that it?

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,680
I'm going to the bathroom.

103
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Type?

104
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
What are you doing here?

105
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,240
-Grocery shopping.
-Who're you with?

106
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,920
My roommate. You?

107
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,800
I'm with my high school friends.

108
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I thought you were alone.
I was gonna invite you to a movie.

109
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,760
Enjoy, then. I'd better go.

110
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
-See you later.
-See you.

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
Is he your friend?

112
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Yeah, a friend from university.

113
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Tall, handsome, and a great body.

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
Sounds like your type.

115
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,720
No, I just think he's cute.

116
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,120
If you like him, ask Champ to help.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,960
Does he have a girlfriend?

118
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
Type?

119
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm not sure. I'll ask him.

120
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,640
Let's wait for the update.

121
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,240
But for now, let's go see the movie.

122
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,680
-Let's go.
-Come on.

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,800
-Come on.
-It's about to start.

124
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,920
Are you going to the cafeteria?

125
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,000
Do you want anything?
I can buy it for you.

126
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,480
No.

127
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,080
I want you to join me.

128
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

129
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,560
Are you coming or not?

130
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,720
Sure.

131
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,360
Type.

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,200
Why are you inviting me?

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
Weren't you the one that said…

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,160
the two of us…

135
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,320
if we cut out the sex part,
we're just friends?

136
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,360
And what do you think?

137
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,080
That's why I'm asking you
to join me for a meal.

138
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,720
Are you coming? Such a pain.

139
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I'm coming.

140
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,160
What are you staring at?

141
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
Just eat your food.

142
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm eating with you.
Who do you want me to look at?

143
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,880
And what are you smiling at?

144
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,880
Well…

145
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm happy.

146
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,360
About what?

147
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,400
About you inviting me.

148
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,840
It's just breakfast.

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,680
But it means a lot to me.

150
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,960
You said we're friends.

151
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,600
Don't creep me out any more
than I am already.

152
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
Type.

153
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,600
Can you have dinner with me today?

154
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,680
You said it yourself.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,160
You're okay
with being just friends, right?

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,480
So can you be kind to a man
who has no one to eat with like me?

157
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,560
Pretty please.

158
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,080
Please.

159
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,520
You think I'll pity you?

160
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,360
Text me after class, then.

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,480
You are…

162
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,000
kinder than I thought.

163
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,920
{\an8}Hurry up, Type.

164
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
Wait.

165
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,520
When I said dinner,
I meant at a food stall outside campus.

166
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,160
Not at this kind of place.

167
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,760
This is the bar I'm playing at. Come on.

168
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,240
What the hell?

169
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,760
Nice atmosphere. I like it here.

170
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,920
I'm glad to hear that.

171
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Your smile is different from usual.

172
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,120
How do I usually smile?

173
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,120
Like a jackass.

174
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,880
It's a job.

175
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
What do you mean?

176
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,280
Have you ever heard of a "business smile"?

177
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,080
I'm a musician.

178
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,480
It's my job to entertain people.

179
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,720
Even though I'm not a lead singer,
I had to learn how to smile.

180
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,640
When I smile, customers are impressed.

181
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,520
When customers are impressed,
they're satisfied.

182
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,440
When they're satisfied,
the bar owner keeps hiring me.

183
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
So it's just a fake smile.

184
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,240
I guess you could say that.

185
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,520
But this smile…

186
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,440
is only for you.

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,600
You're so lame.

188
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,520
Do they pay you well here?

189
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes, the more hooked customers are,
the better the pay.

190
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,160
Tharn, what are you doing here?

191
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,120
I thought you weren't playing today.

192
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,520
Hello, Jeed.

193
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,720
I'm not here to work.

194
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,280
Today, I'm a customer.

195
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,240
This is Type.

196
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,960
He's my friend.

197
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,880
This is Jeed, the owner.

198
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,640
-Hello.
-Hello.

199
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,120
Are you sure he's a friend, not boyfriend?

200
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
-Boyfriend?
-No.

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
He's…

202
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,760
just a friend.

203
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,480
Okay, I get it.

204
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,960
This handsome guy is really your friend.

205
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
Jeed…

206
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,600
can I leave my friend with you
for a second?

207
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,640
I'll go say hi to my friends outside.

208
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,760
Of course, anything for you.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
-Thank you.
-Okay.

210
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,960
Tharn.

211
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,560
Don't worry.

212
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,280
Are you afraid of me?

213
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
No.

214
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,600
Type, right?

215
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,360
I'm sorry for teasing you.

216
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,680
I haven't seen Tharn
bring anyone here for a long time.

217
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,000
So when I saw you,
I thought you were his boyfriend.

218
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,160
By the way, do you know Tharn is…

219
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,880
Yes, I know.

220
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,080
That's why I thought
you were his boyfriend.

221
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,640
No, we're just friends.

222
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
Friends it is.

223
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,880
Since Tharn's gone,
let's gossip about him.

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,880
Let me tell you this.

225
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,560
Whenever he plays here,
all the girls are crazy about him.

226
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,600
They give him their number
and send him drinks.

227
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,120
What a shame.

228
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,360
The sooner he forms a new band,

229
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,560
the sooner female customers
will fill up my bar.

230
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,080
Like I said,

231
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,960
Tharn hasn't brought anyone here
for a year.

232
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,600
You're the first one he's brought
in a long time.

233
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,640
I talk too much.

234
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,600
I'll let you enjoy yourself.
I'd better go.

235
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,880
Okay.

236
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,880
What did you talk to Jeed about?

237
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,280
Nothing in particular.

238
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,920
She talked about you.

239
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
About me?

240
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,760
Yeah.

241
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,000
She said chicks are all over you
when you play here.

242
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,400
That's a bit of an overstatement.

243
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,320
You sure are friendly.

244
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,880
It's my job.

245
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,680
Business smile, remember?

246
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,800
Do you want to know…

247
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,240
what Jeed…

248
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,200
whispered to me?

249
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,200
What?

250
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,120
If you want to know…

251
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,720
come closer.

252
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,840
What a pain in the ass.

253
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,600
She asked me…

254
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
if I really see you as a friend.

255
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,320
You're the friend…

256
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,680
I want to do this with.

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,360
Type.

258
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,560
You're drunk.

259
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,240
I'm not drunk.

260
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,720
You're drunk.

261
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,960
I'm not drunk.

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,840
A few drinks can't get me drunk.

263
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,480
If you're not drunk,
then why the hell did you do that?

264
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,000
Alcohol doesn't cloud my judgment.

265
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,320
It gives me courage.

266
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
You know, Type,

267
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,760
I've been longing to do this with you
for a long time.

268
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,760
I wanna leave. I'll wait outside.

269
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,080
Tharn.

270
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Tharn.

271
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,480
I know you're awake.

272
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
Sleep with me.

273
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,120
Come here.

274
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,200
You said you wanted to sleep.

275
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,080
I didn't mean like this.

276
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,560
Why?

277
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,600
This is sleeping. So let's sleep.

278
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,320
Stop joking around.

279
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm not joking.

280
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,440
You said you wanted to sleep.

281
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,600
Should I sing you a lullaby too? Come on.

282
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,760
Damn it, I give up.

283
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,120
What the hell was he playing at?

284
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,040
What a sulky douche.

285
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,800
What's wrong?
Talking to yourself, are you crazy?

286
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,000
-Piss off.
-Prick.

287
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm asking because I'm worried.

288
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,200
I thought you'd gone nuts
talking to yourself like that.

289
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Here's your drink.

290
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
I have something to ask.

291
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Have you decided about joining our team?

292
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Are you in?

293
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,760
I'd better not.
Don't want to hold the team back.

294
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm fine with just casual matches
with you guys.

295
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,760
But I really want you
to be part of the team.

296
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,760
Because you can help me
become the team captain.

297
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,640
This plan is dope!

298
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,680
Are you daydreaming again?

299
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,040
Don't shatter my dreams, damn it.

300
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,320
Are you really my friend?

301
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,240
By the way, what's wrong with Tharn?

302
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,960
What about him?

303
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,840
I saw him this morning.

304
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
And?

305
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
He ignored me and looked tense.

306
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,600
And…

307
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,080
he seemed unusually quiet.

308
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,960
How?

309
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,480
That's why I'm asking
if you're fighting with him again.

310
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Are you my friend or his?

311
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,600
His. No, I'm just kidding.
Your friend, of course.

312
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,160
That's why I'm asking you now,
otherwise I would've already asked him.

313
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Speaking of Tharn, I feel bad for him.

314
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,640
Why?

315
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,320
How can he fall for a guy like you?

316
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I dodged that. I'm getting better.

317
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
You're such a jerk.

318
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,800
So how are things between you two?

319
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,680
But I'm sure you'll never give in to him.

320
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,560
I've made a bet with my friends.

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,520
I'm gonna win for sure.

322
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,200
You look strangely tense.

323
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,440
Don't tell me that you two already…

324
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,240
Shit!

325
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,200
Keep your shitty thoughts
to your shitty self.

326
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
It'll never happen.

327
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,680
Was that your hand or your foot?
Wait for me.

328
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,320
I did it!

329
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,360
Good job.

330
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,560
Thank you.

331
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
Thorn.

332
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Why hasn't Tharn come back home?

333
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,960
He'll be back soon.

334
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Why? Are you bored with me?

335
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,040
No, I just miss Tharn.

336
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,880
Don't you miss me too, Thanya?

337
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,840
I see you every day,

338
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,200
but I haven't seen Tharn for a month.

339
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,520
Don't sulk.

340
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,760
If this prince sulks,
will the princess make up with him?

341
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,400
Okay.

342
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

343
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
Tharn!

344
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,360
Tharn, I missed you so much.

345
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Tharn's back,
and suddenly you're ignoring me.

346
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,600
I told you, I see you every day.

347
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,600
Of course, that's why
you're tired of me, right?

348
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,600
No, I'm not.

349
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,280
Tharn, look at Thorn.

350
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,600
Stop teasing Thanya.

351
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,080
Look, she's already pouting.

352
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,720
I think it's cute.

353
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,920
So, what brings you home?

354
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,080
Judging from the sigh,
I guess you have a problem?

355
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,440
It's nothing.

356
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,400
It's just that my roommate's
self-centered.

357
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,120
So, what were you doing, Princess?

358
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,080
Playing piano.

359
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,920
Since you're back,
teach me to play piano, Tharn.

360
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,200
As you wish, Princess.

361
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,680
But, Thanya, you must find me
something to eat first. I'm hungry.

362
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,960
I can't teach on an empty stomach.

363
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,080
Okay. Let's go.

364
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on.

365
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,120
I'M GOING HOME

366
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,240
What the hell is wrong with you?

367
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,520
Why are you still mad?

368
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,360
You went home without telling me.

369
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,480
And that silent treatment shit
you gave me…

370
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,880
What did I do to deserve this?

371
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,480
Is it because of that goddamn kiss?

372
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,160
Dream on if you think I'm gonna apologize.

373
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,320
Are you okay, Tharn?
You keep hitting the wrong keys.

374
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,320
I'm okay.

375
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
It's just that I've been studying hard.

376
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,760
So, I've barely practiced.

377
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,680
Now my hands are stiff.

378
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,120
But you never missed a single key before.

379
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,200
Tharn's not as good as me,
right, Princess?

380
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,360
No, Tharn's way better than you.

381
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,320
Sure, everything's about Tharn
now that he's back.

382
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm not your favorite brother anymore.

383
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
I'm thirsty.

384
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Go get some water in the kitchen for me.

385
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,320
Bring some for Tharn too.

386
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,360
There's something
you don't want me to know, right?

387
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,640
Okay.

388
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,840
I'll get some water for you.

389
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,200
Okay.

390
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,080
What's wrong?

391
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,000
Nothing.

392
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,800
I'm just tired.

393
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,720
I'm glad you're fine.

394
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,440
But if you have a problem,

395
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,720
you know you can always
talk to me, little bro.

396
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,200
Thanks, man. But I'm really fine.

397
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,840
I'm going to the restroom.

398
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,640
I bet he has love troubles again.

399
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,440
Drink.

400
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,080
What is it?

401
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,120
Water. You know what it is.

402
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,200
Thanks.

403
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm not thirsty.

404
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm sleeping over at my friend's tonight.

405
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,520
What about the Sprite?

406
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,120
Asshole.

407
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,720
I bought it for him,
and he didn't touch it.

408
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,200
What the hell?

409
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,320
I hope you get diabetes.

410
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
I hope you die from clogged arteries.

411
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,800
I'll make you drink till you drop.

412
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,400
Why am I doing this?

413
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,280
I don't want to make up with you.

414
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,080
You know…

415
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,760
you don't have to do this.

416
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm the one who should ask.

417
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,760
Just tell me what's wrong.

418
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,240
I have nothing to say.

419
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,240
Tharn.

420
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,800
You should be happy I'm acting like this.

421
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Tonight…

422
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,360
I'm sleeping at my friend's place.

423
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,560
It hurts.

424
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,040
You wanted the goddamn kiss so much.

425
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,720
Now you've had it.

426
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,320
But I'm not making up with you.

427
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,720
So don't smile.

428
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,760
Now, scram.

429
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,640
It's not that I don't want to leave…

430
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,920
but I can't live without you.

431
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Tharn, you're heavy.

432
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,760
I've been waiting for you.

433
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
I told you, I'm not making up with you.

434
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,200
Wait.

435
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,440
You say that like you knew I'd do it.

436
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,360
Tharn, you son of a bitch.

437
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,080
But in the end, you made me realize…

438
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,480
that you care about me.

439
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,200
-I don't care--
-You got mad

440
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,320
because I went home without telling you.

441
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,720
-I didn't--
-You bought Sprite

442
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,800
because you knew I liked it.

443
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,680
And you kissed me…

444
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,120
because you knew I wanted it.

445
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,880
Am I right?

446
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,680
Yeah, you're right.

447
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,280
But you're forgetting something.

448
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
You forgot to say you tricked me.

449
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,680
But on that night…

450
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,880
I was truly hurt.

451
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,120
And I really mean it.

452
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,160
You're more than just a friend to me.

453
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,280
Okay.

454
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
Just forget it.

455
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,600
Think of that kick
as a punishment for tricking me.

456
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,960
What the hell, Tharn?

457
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,000
Type.

458
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,000
What am I to you?

459
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,440
Type.

460
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
What am I to you?

461
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,000
You want me to say "your boyfriend",
don't you?

462
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,320
I'm hoping.

463
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,640
Casual lover.

464
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,080
Yeah, casual lover.

465
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,920
Friends don't kiss.

466
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,880
Casual lover?

467
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,080
Better than nothing.

468
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,400
You're easily satisfied.

469
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,720
Or can I be more than that?

470
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,200
Don't push your luck.

471
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,480
And one more thing.

472
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,720
If you pull my ankle like that again,

473
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
you won't even have a place to stay.

474
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,320
Let me go, already.

475
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
Tharn.

476
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,640
What are you doing?

477
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,840
At least, this casual lover…

478
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
is yours.

479
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,920
You guys seem close lately.

480
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,080
It's just your imagination.

481
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,600
I'm not imagining things.

482
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,720
Take Tharn, for example.

483
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,160
His faculty is very far,
but he chose to eat here.

484
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,240
Is that strange?

485
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,000
Can't I eat here?

486
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,400
No, it's not strange.
You guys seem close, that's all.

487
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,600
By the way, Type.

488
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Do you not hate gay people anymore?

489
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,800
Let's pretend I didn't say that.

490
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,000
That's between you two, anyway.

491
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,560
I still do.

492
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,760
But I don't hate Tharn.

493
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,840
What do you mean?

494
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,160
Lately, you've been…

495
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,080
strangely nosy, Techno.

496
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm just curious.

497
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,520
By the way, you two…

498
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,640
are you hiding something from me?

499
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,760
I'd better go. Don't want to be late.

500
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,560
Type, are you finished?
Let me put your dish away.

501
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,920
Just hurry up.
Yesterday, you were late too.

502
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,920
That was your fault. I'm off.

503
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,280
What?

504
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,040
Why was he late because of you?

505
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,680
He set an alarm clock,
and the sound was really annoying.

506
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,640
So I turned it off and he woke up late.

507
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,560
That's all.

508
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,120
Hey, guys.

509
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,200
What are you eating?
Why didn't you invite me?

510
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,920
All you care about is food, Champ.

511
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,360
Come on, there aren't many
important things in my life.

512
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,360
Are you skipping class?

513
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm too lazy for morning class.
I still have my absence quotas.

514
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,200
Awesome, in that case, I'm skipping too.

515
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,400
Count me out.

516
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm out of quotas.

517
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,720
I'd better go and get yelled at.

518
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,600
-I'm off.
-Wait.

519
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,480
Do you have plans for this evening?
Let's have dinner.

520
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,000
There's a new restaurant behind campus.
I've heard the food is great.

521
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
All you really care about is food, Champ.

522
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,840
How about this?

523
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
If you treat us,

524
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,560
-we'll go.
-Yeah.

525
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,000
-You know me.
-Big spender, of course.

526
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,120
-Always split the bill.
-Darn it!

527
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,080
So, are you in?

528
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Sure. I'll call you after class.

529
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,080
-I'm off.
-See you.

530
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,120
What?

531
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,800
My plan's working, Techno.

532
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,200
What plan?

533
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,760
My friend wants to meet Type.

534
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,520
Is your friend…

535
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,720
a girl or a guy?

536
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,840
A girl, of course!

537
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,360
Why would a guy want to meet him?

538
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,160
You're so weird.

539
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,320
Good for him, though.
He's been through a lot lately.

540
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Introducing him to a girl sounds good.

541
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,680
I'll go buy some food. Be right back.

542
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,400
Tharn.

543
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,680
Tharn in the flesh!

544
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,560
You're my idol. I really worship you.

545
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,000
Thanks so much.

546
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,880
You're quite good.

547
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,880
So? What else do you have for us?

548
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,840
Show your idol some awesome skills.

549
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,880
Sure, I'll show you.

550
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,640
Come on.

551
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,280
Hey, Techno! Type!

552
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,480
Over here.

553
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,760
Okay.

554
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,640
They're my high school friends.

555
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,120
Mai and Puifai.

556
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,400
I just ran into them here,
so I asked if I could join them.

557
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,240
You guys don't mind, right?

558
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,880
Too late to ask that.

559
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,680
So…

560
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,680
the table is set up.

561
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,600
You already ordered the food too.

562
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,880
I ordered for you.

563
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,520
My name's Techno.

564
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,480
You can just call me No.

565
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,920
And this is Type.

566
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,240
Are you guys from the same faculty?

567
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,760
Same faculty but different majors.

568
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,480
That means you are all
taking science classes.

569
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
-So smart.
-That's not true.

570
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,960
Look at me, I'm stupid.

571
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,160
Yeah, he's right.

572
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,840
You're an exception.

573
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,280
I might not study science,
but I'm pretty observant.

574
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,560
You like yellow curry, Type?

575
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,800
It's actually called "sour curry"
in my hometown.

576
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,000
Southern people call this dish sour curry?

577
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,520
Yes, but I prefer fish kidney curry.

578
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,200
-Come on, time to eat.
-Let's eat.

579
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,200
Okay.

580
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,600
Isn't it spicy, Type?

581
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,320
He's from the south.

582
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,440
He used to tell me…

583
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,640
his mom would cook curry
using a handful of chilis.

584
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,280
More like a basketful.

585
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,040
I want to try it. Do you have the recipe?

586
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,600
Fai, you like to cook, don't you?

587
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,320
Why don't you exchange LINE IDs?
Type might have tasty recipes.

588
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,520
Do it now.

589
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,000
Go on.

590
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,280
Come on.

591
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,440
Can I have your LINE ID, then?

592
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,920
My family loves Southern food.

593
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,160
Added.

594
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,840
Thank you.

595
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,200
-Do we still have class today?
-Yes.

596
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,400
Whose class is it?

597
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,080
I haven't checked.

598
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,000
Have you finished the assignment?

599
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,200
Who do you think I am?

600
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,120
We're leaving.

601
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,040
Okay, take care. See you later.

602
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,160
Okay.

603
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,120
Bye bye.

604
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,640
Bye bye.

605
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,880
Bye bye.

606
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,200
Puifai likes you.

607
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,040
I know.

608
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,680
Man, you're so confident.

609
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
Of course, I am.

610
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,800
He should be, though.

611
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,040
She asked for his LINE ID.

612
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,720
So, does my friend have a chance?

613
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,960
I should be the one
to ask you that question.

614
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,480
Does she have a boyfriend?

615
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,560
She's so cute.

616
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,440
No, she's totally single.

617
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,800
Just broke up with her boyfriend.

618
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,520
MAI

619
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,120
What's up?

620
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,160
<i>Hello, Champ. What are you doing?</i>

621
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,480
Boxing.

622
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,760
<i>Again?</i>

623
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,000
Yeah, you need something?

624
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,800
<i>Nothing, I just wanted to talk to someone.</i>

625
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,040
Too much free time?

626
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,720
<i>Right, let's hang out again</i>
<i>when you have time.</i>

627
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,080
-Sure, just tell me when.
<i>-Really?</i>

628
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,640
What reason do I have to lie?

629
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,800
-Who else is going?
<i>-Why do you bring up other people?</i>

630
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,800
You want to hang out, don't you?

631
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,600
Who else did you invite?

632
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>When will you get the hint?</i>

633
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,880
Why are you mad?

634
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,200
What's wrong with her?

635
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,760
Type.

636
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,360
Where have you been? You came back late.

637
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,880
I ate out with Champ and Techno.

638
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,040
And you? What are you doing?

639
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,200
Hanging your clothes.

640
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,280
Hanging my clothes?

641
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,600
I did my laundry.

642
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,400
So I took your clothes to wash too.

643
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,040
If you're upset…

644
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,080
you can rewash them.

645
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,360
If I was upset, I wouldn't have
come back to sleep here.

646
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,320
-Want to do more than just sleep?
-Prick.

647
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,480
One minute you're speaking nicely,
and the next you talk dirty.

648
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,840
Instead of scolding me,

649
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,200
you should be thanking me.

650
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,960
Thanks.

651
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,480
What?

652
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,640
I'm gonna take a shower.

653
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,680
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, TYPE?

654
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:30,400
I WAS TRYING TO SLEEP, BUT I COULDN'T.

655
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,480
WHY? ARE YOU NOT FEELING WELL?

656
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,960
NO, I'VE BEEN THINKING OF YOU.

657
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,360
{\an8}Did you just say…

658
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,400
{\an8}Type's flirting with a girl?

659
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,640
{\an8}Is this your condo? It's beautiful.

660
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:55,840
{\an8}Do you want to come up?

661
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,720
{\an8}-You're seeing someone else, right?
-You and I are just sex friends.

662
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,400
{\an8}It's not your business,
even if I screw someone else.

663
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,160
{\an8}I think it's easier this way.

664
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,480
{\an8}If I'm horny, I'll just have sex with you
to blow off some steam.
