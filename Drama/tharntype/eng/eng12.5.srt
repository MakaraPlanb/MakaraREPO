1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,040
<i>Your roommate…</i>

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,240
<i>is gay!</i>

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,840
What did you say?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm gay.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,280
Then, I must be frank.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,280
I hate gay people.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
Why am I so attracted to you?

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,600
I ATE THEM. SO WHAT?

9
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,360
Why do I even care?

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,480
That's enough, Type.

11
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
Say no more.

12
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,560
Have sex with me.

15
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,360
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, TYPE?

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,880
I can't make it.

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,360
It's Puifai's birthday.

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,240
Now…

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520
you're mine.

20
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm Tharn's first…

21
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,600
and only time.

22
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,320
Let's break up.

23
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,920
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Type!

25
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,120
Answer me!

26
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,600
Do you have feelings for that kid?

27
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,000
Deny it and I'll believe you.

28
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,000
You must pay for what you did.

29
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,920
What do you want me to do?

30
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,440
Should I get down on my knees
and apologize?

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,880
You must get back together with me.

32
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,360
And stay with me forever.

33
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,600
Let's be together.

34
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,040
Let's be together
for the rest of our lives.

35
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>I love you…</i>

36
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>you asshole, Tharn.</i>

37
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,200
<i>Type! Go over there.</i>

38
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,200
Champ, go over there.

39
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,800
Go! Go! Go! Pass the ball!

40
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,920
Champ, pass it! Pass it!

41
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,480
Go! Go! Go!

42
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Shoot!

43
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,960
Good job, guys!

44
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
Thank you, everyone, for today.

45
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
Take care of the freshmen.

46
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,240
Coach them.

47
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,440
And don't let them skip
the cheer activity.

48
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Because the students' unions
will blame our team, got it?

49
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,640
Yes.

50
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,240
One more thing.

51
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Every one of you mustn't invite
the freshmen for a drink, got it?

52
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,520
Yes.

53
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,400
That's it. Thanks so much for today.

54
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,040
Move along.

55
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,320
-Goodbye.
-See you.

56
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,920
So tired.

57
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,560
Well, well.

58
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,280
Our Techno's become a big shot, Oam.

59
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,800
I can't believe you're actually
the team captain.

60
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,440
Then, don't.

61
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,720
You traitors! I told you to vote for me.

62
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,200
But you quit the team
during the second year.

63
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,320
We were busy studying
and couldn't find time to practice.

64
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,360
I saw you at the barbecue restaurant.

65
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,480
Come on, your dream came true.

66
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,000
The seniors used to kick your ass
around the field.

67
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,560
Now you're bossing the juniors around.
So powerful, man.

68
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,240
I'm going to sock you in the face.

69
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
Wait, who says he's powerful?

70
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,440
The true man of power is right there.

71
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,280
If Type hadn't refused it,
Techno wouldn't have become the captain.

72
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,040
Look, the newbies are still
loitering around.

73
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
They don't obey him.

74
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,040
Damn, you make me look disrespected.

75
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,960
Don't be a sore loser.

76
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,520
A man like me has more
than enough potential.

77
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
When did I ever compete with you?

78
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,880
That'd be a waste of time. Right, Type?

79
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,440
I won't compete with him.

80
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
See? My best friend.

81
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,400
-Because you'll be destroyed.
-Jerk!

82
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,360
So, any good players among the newbies?

83
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,280
There's one guy. Very promising.

84
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,920
He's my protégé.

85
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,120
Hold on, your protégé or mine?

86
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm the one who plans
the practice schedule.

87
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,960
You plan and I execute.
Two heads are better than one.

88
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,080
You're humiliating me.

89
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,120
Wait, you came here
to just ask about the freshmen?

90
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,120
Why don't we find something to eat?

91
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,680
I won the bet, Team.
Champ invited us to a meal.

92
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
Are you serious?

93
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,280
You bet on me, Team?

94
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Eating is all you think about.
Just shut up.

95
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,480
I lost my money because of you.

96
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,960
I was about to invite you guys to a meal.

97
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
-Wanna come?
-Hell yeah!

98
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,320
-Techno, you coming?
-Yeah, I'm coming.

99
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,880
But it looks like Type won't come.

100
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,720
-Why?
-Over there.

101
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,400
Says who?

102
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
We can ask him to come.

103
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,920
And…

104
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,120
get him to pay for us.

105
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,880
-You're such an asshole.
-You're a total douchebag.

106
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,480
You want to eat or not?

107
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,160
-Eat!
-You pricks.

108
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,240
Then, don't complain.
His money is like my money.

109
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,440
All right, all right.

110
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,560
I feel so bad for Tharn.

111
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,200
Damn, you really are the alpha wife.
I'm out.

112
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,400
Let's go.

113
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,680
{\an8}<i>I know you don't like me</i>

114
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,160
{\an8}<i>You are far from interested in me</i>

115
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,640
{\an8}<i>But I am not the type to give up</i>

116
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,560
{\an8}<i>I am such a saint and you know it</i>

117
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,760
<i>But it seems like</i>
<i>I am not the one you want</i>

118
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
Go Tharn!

119
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,960
{\an8}<i>I am ready to do whatever it takes</i>

120
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,280
{\an8}<i>I will do everything I can</i>
<i>To make you mine</i>

121
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,080
{\an8}<i>I will not let youwalk away with anyone</i>

122
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,320
{\an8}<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

123
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

124
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,000
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

125
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,760
{\an8}<i>I will not let anyone else love you</i>

126
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,040
{\an8}-The bassist is good.
-Tharn's a great drummer.

127
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,480
{\an8}Of course.

128
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,800
{\an8}<i>I don't know when you will notice me</i>

129
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,040
<i>I don't know why you can't see</i>
<i>The man who will do everything</i>

130
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,200
<i>The man who will do</i>
<i>Whatever it takes to make you his</i>

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,200
{\an8}<i>I will not let youwalk away with anyone</i>

132
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,640
{\an8}<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

133
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

134
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,280
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

135
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,960
<i>I will not let anyone else love you</i>

136
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,160
<i>Because you are the only one</i>
<i>I want to hold</i>

137
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,880
{\an8}<i>My heart is yearning</i>
<i>My heart is calling out</i>

138
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,440
{\an8}<i>I need to let you know</i>

139
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,480
{\an8}<i>I will not let you walk awaywith anyone</i>

140
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,160
{\an8}<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

141
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,360
{\an8}<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

142
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,000
{\an8}<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

143
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,120
{\an8}<i>I will not let you walk awaywith anyone</i>

144
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,160
<i>I will not let anyone stay by your side</i>

145
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,040
<i>No matter how long it takes</i>

146
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,360
<i>I will give my all to make you mine</i>

147
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,080
<i>I will not let anyone else love you</i>

148
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,280
Go Tharn!

149
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,040
Contain yourself.

150
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
You guys are cool.

151
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Awesome.

152
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,080
{\an8}Piece of cake.

153
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,520
{\an8}We're exhausted from dancing.

154
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,840
{\an8}I have to admit, you guys are very good.

155
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,240
But I'm not as good as Seo.

156
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,600
He's the real deal.

157
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,320
Of course, this guy's my pal.

158
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,560
By the way, Seo.
You're really gonna debut in Korea?

159
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,560
There are many steps to take.

160
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,880
I don't know if I can debut or not,
but I'll do my best.

161
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
But you're so cool.

162
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,760
From a K-pop fan to a trainee,
and now you're gonna debut.

163
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,480
You're really cool.
Seo, let me ask you something.

164
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,600
Do you think I can… debut?

165
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,600
No, you definitely can't.
Thailand's your place.

166
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,840
Wait a second, you mad at me or something?

167
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,280
-No, I just feel bad for Korea.
-My poor ego.

168
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,800
Tharn, I should go home.

169
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,040
I have to pick Tar up early tomorrow.

170
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,440
-What time will the plane land?
-Around nine o'clock.

171
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,280
You should go. Tell him to contact me
when he recovers from jet lag.

172
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,880
I miss him.

173
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,360
Type, I think my brother texts you
more than he texts me.

174
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,920
Tum, let me tag along.

175
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,960
-Sure.
-I must return to my dorm.

176
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,560
It's okay. I'll give Song a ride. Just go.

177
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,280
Tae, my place is in the same
direction as Tum's.

178
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,160
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
Okay, let's go.

179
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,720
We're leaving. See you later.

180
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,320
-See you.
-Bye.

181
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,840
I should go with them.

182
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,800
-Good luck.
-See you.

183
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Come on, let's have a toast for Seo.

184
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
-Everyone.
-Okay.

185
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Let's drink.

186
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,440
Wait!

187
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,680
Champ.

188
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,120
You toast with drinks,
not fried chicken. Okay?

189
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,800
But I want to eat fried chicken.
Let me make a toast with it.

190
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,520
-Suit yourself!
-Cheers!

191
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,560
Cheers.

192
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,960
Man, so yummy.

193
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,360
Okay. You want rice too?

194
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,680
The man of the hour should give a speech.

195
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,280
Yeah, hear me out.

196
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,720
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to my farewell party.

197
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,240
And…

198
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
I have something to say.

199
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,920
Khlui.

200
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
Me?

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,040
Yeah.

202
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,960
I don't know how long
I have to stay there this time.

203
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,720
I don't know if I really can debut.

204
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
I'll do my best.

205
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,960
And…

206
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,960
wait for me.

207
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,360
Applause!

208
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960
You're really cool, Seo.

209
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,000
He is, but think about the one waiting.

210
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,520
Yeah, I'll definitely wait for you.

211
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,560
But… why do I have to wait for him?

212
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,040
Come on, let's drink.

213
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,600
-Try the chicken. It's delicious.
-I prefer peanuts.

214
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,880
Cheers.

215
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Damn, I'm wasted.

216
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
-You drink too fast.
-Come on.

217
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,040
What the hell, Team?

218
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Get me some souvenirs too.

219
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,600
Mom.

220
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,560
I'm going to pick up Tar.

221
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,120
Mom?

222
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,720
What are you cooking?

223
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,520
Tar.

224
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
I thought your flight would land at 9:00.

225
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,920
My flight landed at 5:00
and Mom picked me up.

226
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,880
I wanted to surprise you.

227
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,440
Are you hungry? I've made you breakfast.

228
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,480
Tar.

229
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm happy you're back.

230
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,000
No, I'm on cloud nine!

231
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,480
So, what did you cook?

232
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,680
You lived in France for so long.

233
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,000
What does your lasagna taste like now?

234
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,200
Who said I made lasagna?

235
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,600
I made…

236
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,800
matcha pancakes.

237
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,360
Your favorite.

238
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm home, Tum.

239
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,240
Welcome home…

240
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
my dearest brother.

241
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
Thank you.

242
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
WHERE ARE YOU, CANTALOUPE?

243
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,840
I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME CANTALOUPE.

244
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,800
AND I'M PREPARING TO GO TO YOUR HOUSE.

245
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
LAST TIME, I PUNCHED YOUR BROTHER.

246
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
THIS TIME,
I'LL GET ON YOUR DAD'S GOOD SIDE.

247
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
YOU'RE CUTE, CANTALOUPE.

248
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,880
DAMN IT, TIN!

249
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,840
Tin.

250
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,640
Let me guess, you're texting Can?

251
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,200
You're especially addicted
to your phone lately.

252
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,360
I told him…

253
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,000
he'll get punished if he replies late.

254
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,080
So, that's why you reply quickly,
especially after he kissed you that time.

255
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,800
He's been possessive lately.

256
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,040
So that's why you've been happy lately.

257
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,920
You already knew.

258
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,200
-Your worksheets.
-Thank you, Tin.

259
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,160
Hey, we keep running into each other.

260
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,360
I heard you're taking Monkey
to your house.

261
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,480
He said he had to miss practice.

262
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,280
He talked so much Techno fell asleep.

263
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,360
Kept asking what to do
when meeting a boyfriend's family.

264
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,840
It's not his first time.

265
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,240
Tin…

266
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,800
I think Can is very serious about it.

267
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
I didn't say he wasn't.

268
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,040
What is it, Type?

269
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,640
No, it's nothing.

270
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,440
I just remembered something.

271
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,200
-Anyway, I have to go.
-Okay.

272
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,840
Wish Can luck for me.

273
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm hungry. What should we eat?

274
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,360
Not spicy food.

275
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,200
I know that.

276
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,240
No spicy food, no raw food,
and no fruit with rice.

277
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
You're so picky.

278
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,120
But I think…

279
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,040
I picked the right one.

280
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
Wait till after dinner.

281
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,120
I told you I was hungry.

282
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,120
Does this mean…

283
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,040
we can do it today?

284
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,800
We'll see.

285
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,080
What's so funny?

286
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,160
Remember the first time you met my family?

287
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,600
Of course!

288
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,480
How can I forget?

289
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,240
Why do you ask?

290
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,880
I met Can's boyfriend today.

291
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,360
He said he was taking Can to his house.

292
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,200
But Techno said Can
had been there many times.

293
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,440
I don't get why he's nervous.

294
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,600
Seems like you forgot how you were
when you first went to my house.

295
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
I remember.

296
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Someone lied to me
and said his parents weren't home.

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,960
But when I got there,

298
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,760
I met your dad, mom, brother, and sister.

299
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,520
Honestly, I didn't lie to you.

300
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,440
I had no idea Thanya would call
Mom and Dad to come home.

301
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,800
So…

302
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,080
what do you want to eat?

303
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,520
I'll let you choose.

304
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,480
Carry my bag for me.

305
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,240
Okay, wifey.

306
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Type…

307
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,640
so…

308
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
your junior is visiting
his boyfriend's house?

309
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Yeah, I don't understand why
Can is so nervous.

310
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,880
What's so funny?

311
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,720
I'm thinking of the time
my dad chased you with a machete.

312
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
It must still haunt you.

313
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,600
Yeah.

314
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,720
It's been years.

315
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,760
Why hasn't he accepted me yet?

316
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Just tell him you're actually
the daughter-in-law, not the son-in-law.

317
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,600
I thought…

318
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
you said…

319
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,400
after dinner, we would…

320
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,960
Let me watch the game first.

321
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Stop, I'm watching the game.

322
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,760
You can watch later.

323
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,880
After we finish…

324
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
I'll watch with you.

325
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,680
You're spoiled rotten.

326
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,440
They can wait.

327
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
That's my dad's ringtone.

328
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,920
Just kidding.

329
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,560
Whoa!

330
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
It really is my dad.

331
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,480
Hello, Dad.

332
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,080
<i>Hey, will you come home this month?</i>

333
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,000
Maybe.

334
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
Or maybe not.

335
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
<i>That paleface is with you, right?</i>

336
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,800
<i>He told you not to come home, right?</i>

337
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,320
He's got nothing to do with this.

338
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,280
<i>Like hell he doesn't.</i>

339
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,280
<i>I know he's the one</i>
<i>who encourages you not to come home.</i>

340
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,680
Don't be prejudiced.

341
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,240
<i>So he's actually with you right now.</i>

342
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,640
<i>Next time you come home,</i>
<i>don't bring him with you.</i>

343
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,760
Dad, Tharn's not a coconut.
He's too big to be carried.

344
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,400
<i>Whatever, don't bring him here.</i>
<i>I can't stand him.</i>

345
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,640
<i>He's there, right?</i>

346
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
-Hello, Dad.
<i>-Who's your dad?</i>

347
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,640
<i>I don't accept your greeting.</i>

348
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,920
<i>Don't come here. I'm hanging up.</i>
<i>I don't want to talk to you.</i>

349
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,120
Don't worry, my dad may be a bit crude,
but he's kind.

350
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
He's kind only to you.

351
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,240
What will happen to me
when I visit your family next time?

352
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,920
You still want to visit my family?

353
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,480
If you have to go home…

354
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,360
I'll go with you.

355
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,280
It reminds me of the first time
my dad met you.

356
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,760
He kept complimenting you
on your good looks.

357
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,760
But he changed his mind
after he knew about our relationship.

358
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,680
He was planning to kill me…

359
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,600
all…

360
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,280
day…

361
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,600
long.

362
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
Come here.

363
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,080
The game can wait.

364
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,640
Let me console you.

365
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,840
But…

366
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm not in the mood anymore.

367
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,520
You sure?

368
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,000
Come here.

369
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,760
THREE YEARS EARLIER

370
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,560
Are you…

371
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,760
leaving me alone in Bangkok?

372
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,360
You've been complaining for three weeks.

373
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,440
You know I have to go home.

374
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,640
But you'll be gone for three weeks.

375
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,600
Why don't you come with me?

376
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
Okay.

377
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,440
Are you sure?

378
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,880
Book a flight for me.

379
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,560
Okay.

380
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,800
You can come with me if you want to.

381
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,200
I'll book you a flight.

382
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,880
So excited.

383
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,160
I've been wanting to meet your parents.

384
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,800
Let me see.

385
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,480
Seat added. Two seats.

386
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,840
Book now.

387
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,120
Stop looking so stressed.

388
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,920
I thought you wanted to meet my parents.

389
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,640
I have a good reason.

390
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,760
I only told them
I'd bring my partner with me.

391
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Now you understand
my feelings when I went to your house.

392
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,480
Serves you right.

393
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
Do your…

394
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,000
parents…

395
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,040
hate…

396
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,360
or not?

397
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,800
I don't know.

398
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,960
I don't know…

399
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,640
what they think of gay people
after what happened.

400
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,040
Why?

401
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,000
Will you break up with me
if my parents don't approve?

402
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,960
No!

403
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,000
But it's just…

404
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,320
What if your parents…

405
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,120
are the way you used to be?

406
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,000
It would be tough for me.

407
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,640
Stop complaining.

408
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:45,200
I should've bought you a bus ticket
instead of a plane ticket.

409
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,880
Tharn, we're outside.

410
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,760
Give me your support.

411
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,040
You almost broke my hip last night.

412
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,800
Not that kind of support.

413
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,080
If you don't hurry, we'll miss the flight.

414
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,080
My parents are kind, kinder than your dad.

415
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,280
I won't let them do anything to you.

416
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,680
-Come on, get in the car.
-Okay.

417
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,600
Come on.

418
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,200
Hurry up.

419
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,640
-Type!
-Dad!

420
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I woke up at 4:00 to wait for you.
Should've told me you'd be late.

421
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,040
Did you have to wait that long?

422
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,080
I'm free today,
so I wanted to surprise you.

423
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,080
Where's your girlfriend?

424
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,280
Hello.

425
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Should've told me you'd bring a friend,
so I could prepare a room for him.

426
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,600
It's okay. He can sleep with me.
No need to prepare a room.

427
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,240
What? But I want to give your friend
the warmest welcome.

428
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,800
By the way, he's good-looking.
But not as much as you.

429
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,760
You're the most handsome man ever.

430
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,800
That's right.

431
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,920
Type is the most handsome man.

432
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,560
That's right! He's the most handsome.

433
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,880
And he got it from me.

434
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,560
You have a good friend. What's your name?

435
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,800
Tharn.

436
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,160
Tharn?

437
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,640
Are you half white?

438
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,000
You have a prominent nose.

439
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,360
Actually, I'm a quarter white.

440
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,880
I have more of my dad's genes
than my siblings.

441
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,880
So you have siblings.

442
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,200
An older brother and a little sister.
I'm the middle child.

443
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
Sounds lively.

444
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,480
Type is my only son.

445
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,960
When he left for Bangkok,
the house felt empty.

446
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,960
I should've had a daughter.

447
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,160
But if I had one, I would become
a possessive and worried father.

448
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,320
I'm talking too much.
Where's your girlfriend?

449
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm excited to meet her.

450
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,360
I brought my partner with me.

451
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,520
Where is she?

452
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,800
Or is she coming later?

453
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,200
You can't let a woman travel alone.
It's dangerous.

454
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,200
No, Dad.

455
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,800
We came here together.

456
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,240
What? All I see is your friend here.

457
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,000
He…

458
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,640
is my boyfriend.

459
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,400
-Are you?
-Don't ask if I'm kidding.

460
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
Because I'm serious.

461
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,920
We've been together for a while now,
so I wanted to introduce him to you.

462
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,160
Hello, Dad.

463
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,440
-Shit!
-Type!

464
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,000
He fainted?

465
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,440
Tharn, carry him.

466
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,880
Take him inside.

467
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,360
He's heavy.

468
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,560
Put him down.

469
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,440
My goodness.

470
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,720
Sit there.

471
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Let me check on him.

472
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,320
Type…

473
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,520
You won't faint like Dad, right?

474
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,600
-I'm going to faint.
-Mom!

475
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,080
I'm going to faint because my son's
boyfriend is so handsome.

476
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Tell me the truth. You tricked him, right?

477
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
No.

478
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,840
Tharn, let me tell you something.

479
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,240
Type is a hot-headed
and easily annoyed delinquent.

480
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,680
It's not too late to change your mind.

481
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,040
How could you say that?
Shouldn't you side with me?

482
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm not your dad,
taking your side all the time.

483
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,920
He woke up at 4:00
to wait for you at the pier.

484
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
I don't get what's so exciting
about our son coming home.

485
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,760
He's driving me crazy.

486
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,000
Tharn…

487
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,720
this place is not as fancy
as the hotels near the beach.

488
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,680
But you can tell me if you need anything.

489
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,560
-Thank you.
-Oh, my, look at him.

490
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,080
Not only does he have good looks,
but he also has good manners.

491
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,960
Why can't you be like him?

492
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
Why are you so accepting?

493
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,280
I brought a boyfriend home.

494
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,560
Why shouldn't I be?
There's nothing weird about it.

495
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,160
The neighbor's son had a man
propose to him.

496
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
Yes, it's the truth.

497
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,960
He's a handsome white guy.

498
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,320
He offered a ten-million-baht dowry.

499
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,400
I was saying to your dad that
if a man offered a ten-million-baht dowry,

500
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,840
I'd certainly give my son to him!

501
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,480
You should be more serious.

502
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,640
That's your father's job
because I'm your supporter.

503
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,360
So…

504
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
let's get real.

505
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm your mother.

506
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,680
Whomever you love…

507
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,680
I'll love too.

508
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,200
Do I completely accept this?

509
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,600
No, I disapprove a bit.

510
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,720
But do I…

511
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,640
want to see you cry?

512
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,720
I don't want to see my son cry.

513
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,880
I raised you, but I have no right
to decide who you should love or hate.

514
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,520
All I have to do is accept it.

515
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,760
Am I right?

516
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,320
Remember what happened that time?

517
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,720
I was so scared.

518
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,320
I was scared my son…

519
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,200
would cry and suffer.

520
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,680
But today,

521
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,240
you brought Tharn to our home.

522
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,200
So I know you've made your decision.

523
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,800
It's true you're hot-tempered.

524
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,440
But you're not stupid.

525
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,960
So there's no reason
to disagree with you, right?

526
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,080
Thank you, Mom.

527
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,520
It's because you're my son.

528
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
Thank you so much, Auntie.

529
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,080
My goodness, call me "Mom."

530
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,480
If it's a handsome guy like you, I'm okay.

531
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,520
-Are you serious?
-Of course!

532
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,680
Tharn, don't forget the
ten-million-baht dowry.

533
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,160
My son is stubborn and quite a handful,
so that amount is enough.

534
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,760
Then, I'm going to study hard, work hard…

535
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,240
and save the money, Mom.

536
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,080
-Okay.
-Stop it.

537
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,240
I'll be the one who proposes to you.

538
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,040
Nobody is going to propose!

539
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,120
-Go!
-Bad dream?

540
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,360
Get out!

541
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,880
Who says you can propose to my son?

542
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,480
But I really love Type.

543
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,200
Who'd believe you?

544
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,640
You're too young to know true love.

545
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,280
Wait a minute, honey!
Did you forget something?

546
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,600
I was 19 when you proposed to me.

547
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,520
-Don't side with him.
-What did you say?

548
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,360
-Don't side with him!
-I'm just telling the truth!

549
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,720
What can I do to make you believe me, Dad?

550
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,960
Don't you dare call me "Dad."

551
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,000
Come on, Dad!

552
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,480
Tone down the possessiveness.

553
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,640
Just sit down, for heaven's sake.

554
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,560
Fine!

555
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,440
I don't want to seem heartless.

556
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,240
I'll give you three days.

557
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
If you fail…

558
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,520
don't ever come back here again.

559
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,840
So you'll accept him
once he's survived the three days, right?

560
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,840
No!

561
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,040
If he survives…

562
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,960
he'll face the three-week, three-month,
and three-year challenges.

563
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,440
Just survive the three days first.

564
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,600
You'll see hell!

565
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,640
Son, don't mind him.
Give him time to think.

566
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,920
He's actually a good man.

567
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,280
But he's stubborn, like Type.

568
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,600
Please bear with him.

569
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,760
Okay.

570
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,600
You're dead meat!

571
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,520
Showing support? So supportive.

572
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,360
He shouldn't have done that.

573
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,880
Honey.

574
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
Where are you taking the chilis?

575
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,440
That paleface won't last three days.

576
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,280
Cruel.

577
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,520
So cruel.

578
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,160
Today's dinner.

579
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,480
Tai Pla curry.

580
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,880
Kua Kling.

581
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Pad Sataw.

582
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,760
We're out of fresh vegetables.

583
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,400
This is all the food we have.

584
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,040
Just eat.

585
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,280
I don't want to be a bad host.

586
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,400
He can't do it.

587
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,280
I'll make you a fried egg.

588
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,360
We're out of eggs.

589
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,320
I saw them.

590
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,000
Over there! I threw them in the sea!

591
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,960
Eat!

592
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,240
Eat up.

593
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,520
There's plenty more.

594
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,680
So irritating.

595
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,360
Let me. You're too slow.

596
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,320
Kaeng tai pla.

597
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,280
Lots of soup. Let it soak.

598
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,800
Tasty.

599
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,880
Can you eat it?

600
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,400
Yes.

601
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,920
It's not spicy.

602
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,240
None of them are spicy at all.

603
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
They're tasty.

604
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,200
I can't take it anymore!

605
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,000
I'll make you fried eggs.
I know where you hid the eggs.

606
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,560
You're evil.

607
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,680
-Honey!
-Don't call me!

608
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,480
You okay?

609
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,760
Have you tried Kua Kling?

610
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,520
Try it. It's delicious.

611
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,920
Eat. Have you tried it?

612
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,280
Now I know who you got
your childish behavior from.

613
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,880
Drink it all and talk after.

614
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,640
And what do you mean, childish?

615
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,760
When you tried to kick me out of the dorm.

616
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,120
All right.

617
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,000
I'm childish.

618
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,880
Just like your dad.

619
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,640
My dad is way more childish.

620
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,760
Sit straight.

621
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,720
Will I survive until the last day?

622
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,160
Will you fight for it?

623
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,440
Yes.

624
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,120
I've come this far.

625
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,000
Then, you'll survive.

626
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,440
Because I won't let my dad
kick you to death.

627
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,680
You must die on top of me.

628
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,840
On top of you?

629
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,760
I'm dying on top of you.

630
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,720
I'm suffering…

631
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,680
but I'm happy too.

632
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,720
Don't suck up to me.

633
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,880
I mean it.

634
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,000
I…

635
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,720
will do everything for you.

636
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,200
Including letting my dad
pump your stomach?

637
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,880
Come on, just hang on.

638
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,280
I'll treat you
to a tasty seafood meal tomorrow.

639
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,760
Will it be spicy?

640
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,440
You can eat it.

641
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,280
Then, I'll follow you everywhere.

642
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,680
But I think you should sleep now.

643
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,040
Judging from your condition…

644
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,360
I bet you can't get it up.

645
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,840
Can't get it up?

646
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,560
Do you want to test…

647
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,880
whether or not I can get it up?

648
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,600
Can you really do it?

649
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,200
We have to try.

650
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,480
What's wrong?

651
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,600
It's coming, Type.

652
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,200
Serves you right.

653
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,640
You asked for it.

654
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,560
Hurry up! My dad will see us!

655
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,040
-Won't he get mad?
-Just hurry.

656
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:47,320
Think you can handle him?

657
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,760
You're afraid of my dad,
but you're getting handsy with me?

658
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,080
I'm sick. Give me some love.

659
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,200
I'll kick your ass.

660
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:02,480
Hold on tight.

661
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,440
Wait!

662
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,640
-Where are you going?
-Bye, Dad!

663
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,680
Type, wait!

664
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,120
Type! You son of a gun!

665
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,720
Eat it.

666
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,760
There's a lot in store for you.

667
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,640
Seriously, your dad is trying to kill me.

668
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:49,600
Come on, you haven't truly reached
the South if you don't try Southern food.

669
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,680
If I have to eat
your dad's curry from hell,

670
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,880
I'd rather not come to the South at all.

671
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,800
I'm sorry on his behalf.

672
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,600
But it's funny.

673
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,080
Will people at the music faculty find out

674
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,800
that Tharn,
with his godlike drumming techniques,

675
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,200
crawled out of the toilet like that?

676
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,280
So pathetic.

677
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,160
Here.

678
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,760
There's a lot in store for you
this evening.

679
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,280
You're good at peeling.

680
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,040
I've been practicing since I was young.

681
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,360
My dad said I could do it
for the girl I like.

682
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,680
I'm sorry the girl turned out to be me.

683
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,520
Stop thinking too much.

684
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,320
And don't sulk.

685
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,880
If I had regrets, I wouldn't have
introduced you to my parents.

686
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,440
If you think I have second thoughts…

687
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,560
I'll stab you with this crab claw.

688
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,440
Does this mean…

689
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,280
the person you like…

690
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,560
is me?

691
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,680
Don't trick me into saying it.

692
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,560
It's all right.

693
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:20,880
Because you said you'd peel crabs
for the person you like.

694
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,280
So it must be me.

695
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,520
Is this how you want to play it?

696
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,080
Yes, Tharn. I really like you!

697
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,920
Happy?

698
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,960
Very.

699
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,240
Speaking of regrets…

700
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,840
I do have one.

701
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,000
My friend…

702
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,600
Khom.

703
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,240
I just want my best friend…

704
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,960
to accept me for who I am!

705
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,400
Guess I'm asking too much.

706
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,440
I'm sorry…

707
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
for being gay.

708
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,840
I want to apologize to him.

709
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,760
It's been bothering me for months.

710
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,040
So you're saying…

711
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,000
you brought me here with you…

712
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,360
because of this.

713
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,280
Telling my parents is less scary
than facing Khom.

714
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,760
He's the one who had to listen
to my homophobic rants the most.

715
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,080
I had no idea I'd been insulting him.

716
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,440
I want to apologize to him.

717
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,800
But I don't know how I should act
when I meet him.

718
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,040
Isn't my boyfriend…

719
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,560
fearless…

720
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,560
and determined?

721
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,880
Thanks so much.

722
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:37,200
You're welcome.

723
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,560
Here, take it.

724
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:44,720
Eat up.

725
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,440
Damn you, Mhut!
You left all the work to me again.

726
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,200
Type…

727
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,280
How…

728
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,120
did you come back?

729
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,600
Do you have a minute?

730
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,160
I need to talk to you.

731
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,240
Was that your friend?

732
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,040
Interested?

733
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,320
What? No.

734
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,600
That's not what I meant.

735
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,360
He's my boyfriend.

736
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,000
He's a man.

737
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,200
But he's the man I love.

738
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,560
I'm sorry, Khom.

739
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,040
Sorry for everything.

740
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,960
For every insult.

741
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,160
For every biased comment.

742
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,360
For every action.

743
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,160
I had no intention of hurting you.

744
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,120
But you hate gay people.

745
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,960
I haven't completely overcome my bias.

746
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,880
But Tharn taught me…

747
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,600
if I forget about gender,
I'll have a much broader viewpoint.

748
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,440
And it's true.

749
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,720
Not every one is bad.

750
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:42,680
At least…

751
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,720
there's Tharn…

752
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,840
and you.

753
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,240
I know you're different
from the people I condemned.

754
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,160
Therefore…

755
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,560
can you forgive me?

756
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,480
You can yell at me.

757
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:08,840
Or punch me.

758
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,000
Because I really was an asshole.

759
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,200
Your boyfriend…

760
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,240
What about him?

761
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,040
He's good.

762
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,240
So damn good.

763
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,800
He's changed you so much.

764
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,920
You don't have to apologize.

765
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:39,280
You didn't mean to insult me.

766
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,920
Thanks for coming back.

767
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,600
I thought I'd lost a good friend like you.

768
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,360
I'm the one who should thank you
for forgiving me.

769
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:54,960
No.

770
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,480
Not at all, Type.

771
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,640
You…

772
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,240
will always be my best friend.

773
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,320
Introduce me to your boyfriend.

774
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,880
Tell me first.

775
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,760
Are you interested in him or not?

776
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,880
So I'll know what to do.

777
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,000
Well, I have my own man.

778
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,040
Come on, I'll introduce you to him.

779
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,880
I'm the one who should thank you…

780
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,760
my first love.

781
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,200
Type…

782
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,520
your friend is nice.

783
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,600
Why?

784
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,720
Are you saying you like him?

785
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,200
I'm not saying that.

786
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,640
Hold on.

787
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,200
You said you liked my body type
and skin tone.

788
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,040
Then, Khom is your type.

789
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,360
That was before.

790
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,240
Now my type of guy…

791
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,200
is only you.

792
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,720
Ever think I might not want you?

793
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,840
How could you say that?
Come back and talk to me!

794
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,360
How dare you raise your voice at my son?

795
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,400
No, Dad. We were just talking.

796
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,080
Type, you're defending him?

797
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,840
Do you respect me at all?

798
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,280
Are you totally against him?

799
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,600
Yes.

800
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,200
I don't want a son-in-law.

801
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,640
I want a daughter-in-law!

802
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,680
How do you know he'll be the son-in-law?

803
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:08,240
Because he's a man.

804
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,760
Type bringing a man home
means he's the wife.

805
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,440
So you just want a daughter-in-law.

806
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,120
Yes.

807
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,600
I want a daughter-in-law.

808
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,920
What would you do
if you got a daughter-in-law?

809
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
What do you mean?

810
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,960
Type is our son, right?

811
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,680
He brought Tharn to our house,
so Tharn is the daughter-in-law.

812
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,360
His reputation is tainted.

813
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:42,640
So you must prepare a dowry for Type
to propose to Tharn.

814
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:47,360
Happy now? Are we clear? Confused?

815
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,240
Dad, give up.

816
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,480
He's been tainted for months, anyway.

817
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,560
That's right.

818
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:02,960
Wait.

819
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,840
-Wait a minute!
-What?

820
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,320
So you have…

821
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,000
a male wife?

822
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:13,840
Honey, you said it yourself.

823
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,400
People in our family
never go back on their word.

824
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,520
What's wrong?

825
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,600
What?

826
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,760
Okay! Okay!

827
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,600
I'm a man of my word.

828
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,400
If Tharn is the wife,
I have no choice but to accept.

829
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:36,560
But!

830
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,240
If Type is the wife…

831
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,120
I'm going to kill your husband!

832
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,720
Are you the wife or the husband, Type?

833
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:56,480
-Run!
-Where are you going?

834
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,200
Let me go!

835
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,880
Type! We need to talk!

836
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,160
You always spoil him!

837
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,960
Bye, Dad. We won't be back tonight.

838
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:10,360
We'll do couple stuff somewhere
a geezer can't spy on us.

839
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:13,800
-Did you hear him?
-Deal with it. I won't break up with him.

840
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,640
-Bye!
-You son of a…

841
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,960
-Honey! Stop!
-You shitty son! Come back here!

842
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:22,480
Stop!

843
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,200
I'm tired!

844
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,760
-Will you stop?
-I'm tired too!

845
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,640
-Will you stop!
-Yes!

846
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,760
I don't know if I should
laugh at my parents or not.

847
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,280
One is stubborn.

848
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,280
The other accepted you so easily
just because you're handsome.

849
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,680
You're lucky you were born with that face.

850
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:06,840
First time I saw you,
I knew women would be crazy for you.

851
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,320
I don't care about anyone else.

852
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,840
Because you're the only one for me.

853
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:21,760
Don't say a word…

854
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,960
if you're happy with what I said.

855
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,760
Asshole.

856
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,280
And don't forget…

857
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,560
you're all mine.

858
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:43,960
Whether it's my brain, my body,
or my heart…

859
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,640
I've already given them all to you.

860
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,280
Drink it.

861
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,320
Damn.

862
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:00,080
I can be embarrassed too.

863
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,400
Honestly…

864
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,640
being with you is not easy at all.

865
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,400
You just realized that?

866
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,120
I've realized for a while now.

867
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,240
But I can't stop loving you.

868
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,000
I hate your cheesiness.

869
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,120
-Hate means--
-That's enough.

870
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,160
I won't say it.
My quota is used up for today.

871
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,040
So, what are you going to do?

872
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,280
Let's do it.

873
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:49,800
You sure?

874
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,000
Yeah.

875
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:55,160
My dad sleeps early today.

876
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,360
Want to switch roles?

877
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:36,800
Might help change my dad's mind.

878
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,560
Dream on.

879
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,960
Tonight…

880
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,280
I'm going to be your husband.

881
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,600
I've never taken anyone here before.

882
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,720
From now on…

883
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,080
take only me to this place.

884
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,720
From now on…

885
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,520
I definitely won't say
the word "break-up" to you.

886
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,120
You've promised.

887
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,440
You're not the only one
who can't live without me.

888
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,480
I can't live without you too.

889
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,800
Type…

890
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,200
I love you.

891
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:49,760
Damn!

892
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:53,640
What the hell was that dream?

893
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,680
What time is it?

894
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,600
Six o'clock.

895
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,040
Go back to sleep.

896
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,000
I can't sleep anymore.

897
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:20,960
I was dreaming
about the first time I met your dad.

898
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:23,000
Really?

899
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,240
I had the same dream!

900
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,160
-You too?
-Yeah!

901
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,440
I bet it's because
of what we talked about before bed.

902
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,480
I can't get the image of my dad
wielding the machete out of my head.

903
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,680
I'm still getting chills down my spine.

904
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,800
But since we're awake…

905
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,400
let's…

906
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,400
do something.

907
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,880
What are you doing?

908
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,200
Put it on.

909
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,680
Are you crazy? Cat ears?

910
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:22,360
Dream on!

911
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,520
Type…

912
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,400
What the hell?

913
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
-Put it on.
-No, I won't.

914
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,160
Please.

915
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,400
No, put it on yourself!

916
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,560
Let's do it together.

917
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,160
Man up.

918
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:45,600
I'd rather not.

919
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,520
Then, you're a coward.

920
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,440
I won't dance to your tune.

921
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,600
It's just a simple favor.

922
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:56,840
Don't pretend to sulk.

923
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,680
Asshole.

924
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,480
You can't even do me a simple favor.

925
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,840
Happy now?

926
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,040
Do me one more favor.

927
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,600
What now?

928
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,720
Can you say…

929
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,480
"meow" for me?

930
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:34,840
No way!

931
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,480
Please, Type.

932
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,760
-No!
-Please.

933
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,520
No, I won't say it!

934
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,960
-Please, just once.
-I already put on the ears!

935
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,160
-Say it for me.
-No!

936
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,800
Fine! It's my fault.

937
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,080
I'm asking for the impossible.

938
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,120
I'm going to take a shower.

939
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,080
Meow.

940
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,360
What did you say?

941
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,760
Meow.

942
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,240
Happy now?

943
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:17,480
You're the best.

944
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,240
Meow.

945
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,280
I think I'll stay in today.

946
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,440
Tharn!

947
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,760
You're so cute!

948
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:49,880
Hello, Princess.

949
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,320
I've gotten you the chocolate cake.

950
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:55,480
Do you need anything else?

951
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,640
Okay, just the cake, then.

952
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:04,880
See you tonight.

953
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,960
Lhong?

954
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,960
Thorn.

955
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,920
Why are you avoiding me?

956
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:20,480
Hello.

957
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:23,960
Do you have a minute? I want to talk.

958
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:26,080
I…

959
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:30,760
How can you refuse
when we haven't met in years?

960
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,520
I thought I was like a brother to you.

961
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,560
How have you been after all these years?

962
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:56,800
I…

963
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:02,000
I've been fine.

964
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,280
Glad to hear to that.

965
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,560
How are your studies going?

966
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,400
I don't live in Thailand anymore.

967
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,680
After what happened…

968
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,200
I moved abroad to live with my sister.

969
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,320
I just came back last week.

970
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,200
Then, I'm very lucky I ran into you today.

971
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,720
-How--
-Tharn?

972
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,360
He's fine.

973
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,240
-Good.
-He's fine.

974
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,360
And he's still with Type.

975
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,200
Just knowing he's doing well…

976
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:51,520
is enough for me.

977
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,640
If you're really okay,
then why the long face?

978
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,320
You're an adult, you know?

979
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:04,960
Thorn…

980
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:07,640
seriously…

981
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,080
aren't you mad? Don't you hate me at all?

982
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
After…

983
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:15,760
everything I did to Tharn.

984
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,200
How can I hate you or be mad at you?

985
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,320
By the looks of you…

986
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,600
you must have been punishing yourself.

987
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,160
You've changed, right?

988
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,520
I don't know.

989
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,240
But for the past years…

990
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,240
I've been suffering so much.

991
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,640
Let your suffering be a lesson to you.

992
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,200
Don't do it again.

993
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,400
Do you understand?

994
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,280
Thank you…

995
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,000
for not hating me.

996
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:15,040
Lhong, I told you, didn't I?

997
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,720
You're like a brother to me.

998
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,080
So, how can I hate you?

999
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,440
Thank you so much.

1000
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And…

1001
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,960
I'm sorry for everything.

1002
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,040
I think…

1003
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:39,000
I'd better go.

1004
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,640
All right.

1005
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,640
I wish you the best of luck.

1006
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,800
I hope I can see you happier one day.

1007
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,480
I hope that day comes soon.

1008
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,280
-Pete.
-Yes?

1009
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:19,320
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at the field?

1010
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,360
It's noisy at the field.

1011
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:25,520
I need a quiet place
to study for my quiz tomorrow.

1012
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,120
Pete, let me ask you something.

1013
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,080
Did Tin go to Can's house?

1014
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,640
Yes.

1015
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:35,680
So, how did it go?

1016
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,360
I asked both of them.

1017
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:41,400
Tin told me it was okay.

1018
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,520
But if Tin says it's okay,
I bet it must have been really great.

1019
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:49,760
And Can said Tin's father
let him call him "Dad."

1020
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,360
-Dad, huh?
-Jealous?

1021
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,040
A little bit.

1022
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,280
Can is so lucky.

1023
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:02,960
That's not a little bit.

1024
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,000
What's the matter?

1025
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,200
Nothing. He's just envious.

1026
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:17,120
I think the two of you are more enviable.

1027
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:22,400
According to Techno,
you've been dating since first year.

1028
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,960
I had no choice.

1029
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,120
Really, Type…

1030
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:29,920
Then…

1031
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,880
I hope you have no choice
but to be with me for a long time.

1032
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,000
See what I mean?

1033
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,720
You're more enviable than other couples.

1034
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,560
That's enough.

1035
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,720
We've taken up enough of your time.

1036
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,880
We'd better go.

1037
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,680
-Okay.
-See you later.

1038
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,320
What are you thinking about?

1039
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,440
A bunch of stuff.

1040
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,480
You sure?

1041
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,560
How have we…

1042
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,920
come this far?

1043
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:38,200
I don't know.

1044
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:40,480
Seems like all of a sudden,

1045
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,640
I've been with you for four years.

1046
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:49,560
You're right.

1047
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:56,520
Don't tell me you still envy Can.

1048
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:02,160
Just a little.

1049
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,680
My motto is…

1050
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:13,960
"Moderately self-confident…

1051
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,800
But over 100% certain
I've got you hooked."

1052
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:20,120
Since you're so obsessed with me,

1053
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,280
keep trying to win over my dad.

1054
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,040
But I thought your motto was…

1055
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,200
"You always get what you hate."

1056
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,320
That's why you're mine now.

1057
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,080
I'm so in love with you.

1058
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:06,560
I can't help it.

1059
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:20,400
Type…

1060
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,000
let's go home.

1061
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,160
Let's go.
