1
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,440
Hey.

2
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,720
What's wrong?

3
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,880
No, it's nothing.

4
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,160
Then why did you startle?

5
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Who are you texting?

6
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,040
Take a look.

7
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm talking with Lhong
about an assignment.

8
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
Glad everything's fine then.

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,760
I won't cheat on you.

10
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,720
Paranoid, aren't you?

11
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,920
Let's find something to eat.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,040
I have to finish the assignment.

13
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
Bring it with you.

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,840
You're the hubby.
You have to pamper me.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,160
Well, hubby?

16
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,160
Will you come with me?

17
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,840
Whatever wifey wants to eat…

18
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,480
hubby will get it for him.

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,360
Very good.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,440
They say your life gets better
if you pamper your wife.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Have I become someone
who's afraid of his wife?

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,560
Aren't you then?

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,440
Come on, have lunch with me.

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,400
I'll buy dinner for you later.

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,240
Thank you, wifey.

26
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
What's up?

27
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
You…

28
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Tharn's friend.

29
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,520
You can't remember my name.

30
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
I am…

31
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,480
-your boyfriend's--
-Freaking Lhong!

32
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,480
Just Lhong is enough.

33
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,320
That's me.

34
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
The handsome lead singer of the band.

35
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,000
But I've heard you're not
as popular as the drummer.

36
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,800
Harsh.

37
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
That really hurts.

38
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,840
Don't be overdramatic.

39
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,160
I'm going to tell Tharn
you're picking on me.

40
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,200
Go on, and let's see whose side
he's gonna take.

41
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,280
Playing the boyfriend card?

42
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,280
I'll lose for sure.

43
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,880
How about…

44
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,480
you treat me to a meal in exchange for…

45
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,000
Tharn's information?

46
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,280
I just bought a new guitar.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,400
I can't even buy cafeteria food
with money I have left.

48
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,440
Tharn's info?

49
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,840
I know everything.

50
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
He can confirm it.

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Interested?

52
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,160
Deal.

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,640
Thank you.

54
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,960
I paid for your food.

55
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,080
Your turn.

56
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,480
Ask anything you want to know.

57
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
I know everything.

58
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,040
Especially about ex-boyfriends.

59
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,000
Why would I need to know about his exes?

60
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
He has quite a reputation
when it comes to dating.

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
He'd dated people from every class year.

62
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,480
But the flings didn't last long.

63
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,800
I guess he's cursed.

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,600
With what?

65
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,880
I've been going out with him just fine.

66
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,000
You're the one who broke the curse.

67
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,920
If you don't count San though.

68
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,880
You know him?

69
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
Apart from San…

70
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
all of Tharn's exes were assholes.

71
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,880
Tharn had his first boyfriend…

72
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,440
when he was in tenth grade.

73
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,960
He was a sophomore student
and extremely handsome too.

74
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
He was a violin major.

75
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,280
But Tharn…

76
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
caught him…

77
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,720
five-timing.

78
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
You heard it right.

79
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,040
Five-timing.

80
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,080
He even had a sugar daddy.

81
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
Tharn said…

82
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,600
he was lucky he didn't catch any STDs.

83
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,760
But at that time, he was totally crushed.

84
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,680
After that…

85
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,080
the two-month curse had begun.

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,840
What two-month curse?

87
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Excuse me, I want to order a drink.

88
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,560
-What would you like?
-What do you want?

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,680
I'm good.

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,280
Then…

91
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,600
-I'll have Sprite.
-Okay.

92
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
Thank you.

93
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,880
You see…

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,040
Tharn never dated anyone
more than two months.

95
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,280
He either got cheated on…

96
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,080
or dumped…

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,440
with stupid-ass reasons.

98
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,480
Like, "you're too good, Tharn."

99
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,080
At one point, he began to sleep around.

100
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,760
He had sex with anyone who offered.

101
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,520
Until he met…

102
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,400
Tar.

103
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,160
Who?

104
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,800
Tar.

105
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,600
My ex-bandmate's little brother.

106
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,200
He was cute, tiny, and all that stuff.

107
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,800
He had a crush on Tharn.

108
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
He said he fell in love the moment
he saw Tharn playing drums.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,360
So he plucked up the courage
and confessed.

110
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,680
Seriously, it was like
reading a romance manga.

111
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,280
They even declared their love
in front of everyone at a bar.

112
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,920
And then they…

113
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,640
did it.

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
Isn't that skipping steps?

115
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
They really did it.

116
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,440
During that time,
Tharn was deeply in love.

117
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,960
He even wrote songs for Tar.

118
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,200
They were so much in love.

119
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,240
What happened next?

120
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
They…

121
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
broke up.

122
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
The end.

123
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
How did it end just like that?

124
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,840
They really broke up.

125
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,560
No. I mean, why did they break up?

126
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
The kid found a new guy?

127
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,960
Tharn got bored?

128
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,280
Or what?

129
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,280
It couldn't have just ended like that.

130
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,440
I really don't know.

131
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,680
Tharn told me they broke up.

132
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Tum punched him,
saying he hurt his brother.

133
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,960
And Tar…

134
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,280
never saw him again.

135
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,520
He even wrote him love songs,
so why did they break up?

136
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Come on.

137
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,800
In the end…

138
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,360
you and Tharn ended up together.

139
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
And if you want to know more,
go ask Tharn.

140
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,760
Most importantly…

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,520
don't rat me out.

142
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,880
I don't want him to blame me
for putting heavy stuff

143
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,360
in his darling boyfriend's head.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,720
I'm gonna tell him
you sold him out over food.

145
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,040
But I know you won't do that to me.

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,640
Right?

147
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,680
You haven't touched your food.

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
Let me eat it.

149
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,240
The hell?

150
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
You sure eat a lot.

151
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,400
I don't get fat.

152
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,840
Tharn.

153
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,200
May I sit with you?

154
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,520
Tar, I have to go.

155
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
Wait, Tharn.
I need to talk to you.

156
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,360
But I have nothing to talk to you.

157
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,680
I have work too. Bye.

158
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,280
Tharn, wait!

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
We used to…

160
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,640
hold hands like this.

161
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,840
What do you want?

162
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,120
I want talk to you about something.

163
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,760
You must be really mad at me.

164
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm not mad anymore.

165
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
It's been over a year, Tar.

166
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,320
Don't worry about it.

167
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm sorry for what I did.

168
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,080
Actually, just say what you want to say.

169
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,880
I told you I have to go to work.

170
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,880
Well…

171
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,880
I don't know how to tell you…

172
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,280
or explain it to you.

173
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,320
But I have my reasons
for everything I did.

174
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,360
When you figure it out…

175
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,000
go tell Tum and have him tell me then.

176
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,760
I have to go.

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
I never wanted to break up with you!

178
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
Why are you saying this now?

179
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,240
Well, Tar?

180
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
It's okay.

181
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm sorry, Tar.

182
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,240
It's okay.

183
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,480
I never wanted to break up with you.

184
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,280
So why did you do it?

185
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,440
I can't tell you.

186
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
But I really have my reasons.

187
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,720
Is it so hard to tell me?

188
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,960
Or did you break up with me
because I did something bad?

189
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,640
I really can't tell you.

190
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,680
But…

191
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,120
please forgive me, Tharn.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,320
What if I say…

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,160
no?

194
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,040
Then I'll keep apologizing
until you forgive me.

195
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,960
Why are you doing this?

196
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,480
What do you want?

197
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's get back together.

198
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
I love you.

199
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,120
I loved you then and I love you still.

200
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,000
Please give me a second chance.

201
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,920
-Tar, I…
-Don't reject me just yet.

202
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,320
Please give me one more chance
to make it up to you.

203
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,840
Tar, I have to go.

204
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,640
Tharn.

205
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,640
Tharn.

206
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,360
Freaking hot.

207
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,960
You're back?

208
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,120
I've been back for a while now.

209
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,560
Are you hungry?

210
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,520
I bought you dinner.

211
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,680
Yeah.

212
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,360
But let me take a shower first.

213
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,880
Tharn.

214
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,240
Is there a party or something?

215
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,160
Whose birthday is it?

216
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,920
My birthday is on April the second.

217
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,960
Tharn.

218
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,600
Don't hug me. It's hot.

219
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm sorry.

220
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,840
The hell is wrong with you?

221
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,920
You're sorry for buying too much food.

222
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,560
Next time, just buy enough to eat.

223
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
I'm sorry, Type.

224
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,840
What's going on with you?

225
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,480
You keep saying sorry.

226
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,680
Did you do bad things behind my back?

227
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,920
I didn't.

228
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,000
I just feel that…

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,200
lately…

230
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I've rarely had time for you.

231
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,120
You worry too much.

232
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,800
Don't sweat the small stuff.

233
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,920
I understand you're busy with the band.

234
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,160
And I'm also busy with the team.

235
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,200
If you say it's your fault
you haven't had time for me…

236
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,520
you're implying it's my fault too.

237
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
I didn't mean to imply that.

238
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,480
So…

239
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,560
are you going to eat?

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,920
Of course, you already bought them.

241
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,240
Let's eat just a few things
and put the rest in the fridge.

242
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,640
I love you, Type.

243
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,280
Don't say it too often.

244
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,760
It'll lose meaning.

245
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,520
I'm gonna take a shower.

246
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
Type.

247
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,400
Why are you so adorable?

248
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,960
Whatever, let me take a shower first.

249
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Tar.

250
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,120
Stop doing this.

251
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,600
We won't get anything out of it.

252
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>I really messed up, Tharn.</i>

253
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,120
I have something to tell you.

254
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,040
<i>Okay.</i>

255
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I've found someone new.

256
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,320
And I love him very much.

257
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
What happened between us…

258
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,160
is over.

259
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,800
It was over last year.

260
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,080
Don't bring up the past again.

261
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,360
Do you understand me?

262
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,760
If you really love me…

263
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,960
don't ever do this again.

264
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,840
<i>Break up.</i>

265
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,160
What did you say?

266
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,160
<i>You'll eventually break up with him.</i>

267
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,240
<i>Your love will never last.</i>

268
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
<i>Never.</i>

269
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,680
Tar!

270
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,240
How could you say that?

271
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,040
Tar! Hello!

272
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,640
Tharn.

273
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,720
What were you yelling about?

274
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,280
Are you okay?

275
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,160
Who was on the phone?

276
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
Well…

277
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,360
I was arguing with Lhong.

278
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,880
What about you?

279
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,480
Why haven't you taken a shower?

280
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,000
We're out of soap.

281
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,080
I told you to keep the spares
in the bathroom cabinet.

282
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,120
Where do you keep them?

283
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,160
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,320
I'll get it for you.

285
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,200
Tar

286
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,160
Do you want to eat right after
I set up the table?

287
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,680
Tar.

288
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,880
Tar.

289
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,400
Do you want to eat right after
I set up the table?

290
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,280
Tar.

291
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,120
-Tar.
-Yes?

292
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I said, do you want to eat right after
I set up the table?

293
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,480
No, not now.

294
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,040
I'd better take a shower first.

295
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,280
Tar.

296
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,320
Tar.

297
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
Tar.

298
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,120
Tar.

299
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Tar.

300
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,440
Tar!

301
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,280
Tar!

302
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
Are you okay?

303
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,240
Tar! Tar!

304
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,920
Tar.

305
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,280
Tar, look at me. Tar.

306
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,560
Wait here.

307
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,720
Tar! What's wrong?

308
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,640
Tar, are you okay?

309
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
Look at me, Tar!

310
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,800
Tar!

311
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,160
Look at me!

312
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,480
Look at me! Tar!

313
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,880
Look at me!

314
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
Tar.

315
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Tum.

316
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm a bad person.

318
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,240
How are you bad?

319
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,640
How can you be bad?

320
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,800
Do you know?

321
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,440
In my entire life…

322
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,840
you're the most important person to me.

323
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,440
I really don't know
how to live without you.

324
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,880
Please don't do it again.

325
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,240
Don't be like this again.

326
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,480
I'm sorry.

327
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,640
Tar.

328
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm sorry.

329
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
Tharn, I'm exhausted.

330
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,800
Okay.

331
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,640
I'll get you some food.

332
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,360
I'll put it here.

333
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,560
Tharn.

334
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm thirsty.

335
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,960
My feet hurt from running all day.
I'm too lazy to get up.

336
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,880
I'll get you water.

337
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,320
I…

338
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,760
Your hands are too tired
to pick up the spoon.

339
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,720
Do you want me to feed you?

340
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
You're reading my mind.

341
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,360
And you…

342
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,640
are asking for more attention.

343
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
Dick, who's asking for your attention?

344
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,120
Then why do you want me to feed you?

345
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,360
You're so annoying.

346
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
I should just smack you.

347
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,160
Tharn.

348
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,840
I wanted to ask you something.

349
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
What is it?

350
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,080
We're using the same shampoo brand.

351
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,360
But why is your hair so soft?

352
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,920
Look at my hair, it's so coarse.

353
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,520
You play football under the sun.

354
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,360
I barely go outside,
so my hair is softer, I guess.

355
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,080
What's wrong with you?

356
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,080
Do you enjoy it?

357
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,320
And are you enjoying
rubbing your head on me?

358
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,360
I'm not only enjoying it, but I'm also…

359
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
on cloud nine.

360
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,000
So corny.

361
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,000
I admit it.

362
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,360
I'm happy too.

363
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,960
Don't die this time.

364
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,680
Tharn!

365
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,600
Come sit here.

366
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,400
Tum.

367
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,320
Anyone has a portable charger?
My battery is running out.

368
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,360
I have a request.

369
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,840
I have nothing to talk to you.

370
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,240
It's about your brother.

371
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,120
I'm not trying to start a fight.

372
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,720
But your brother called me the other day.

373
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,280
I don't believe you.

374
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,600
Shit!

375
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,760
Calm down. Both of you.

376
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,360
My brother will never
get involved with you.

377
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,600
Is this…

378
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,040
his new phone number?

379
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,840
Why do you keep in touch with Tar?

380
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,360
I don't.

381
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,680
-Tar called me.
-I don't believe you.

382
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,800
My brother will never get involved
with a scumbag like you.

383
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,720
Take it easy, will you?

384
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,640
We're in a classroom.

385
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Tum.

386
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm begging you.

387
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,840
Let's talk outside.

388
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,560
Okay.

389
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,200
Want me to come with you?

390
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,600
Wait here.

391
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,640
I don't believe Tar contacted you.

392
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,240
Believe what you want.

393
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,680
But I need to talk to him.

394
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,200
No way!

395
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,520
I don't know…

396
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
why you hate me so much.

397
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
But I swear.

398
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,920
I never hurt your brother.

399
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,400
And one more thing, Tum.

400
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,240
Tar wants me back.

401
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,640
I don't believe you.

402
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,240
You don't have the slightest idea, Tharn…

403
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,440
what Tar's been through all this time.

404
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,880
He wouldn't eat…

405
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,440
wouldn't sleep…

406
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,440
and wouldn't go to school.

407
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
We had to take him to a psychiatrist.

408
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,640
But Tar never said anything.

409
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,040
And do you know…

410
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,400
how much pain…

411
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,040
I've had to endure…

412
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,160
to see Tar getting hurt
by someone like you?

413
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,920
Don't tell me…

414
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,240
-You think of him more…
-That's none of your business!

415
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,000
And bear this in mind!

416
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,280
No matter how much you beg me…

417
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,400
I'll never let you see Tar ever again!

418
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,440
<i>When you feel like drawing again…</i>

419
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,760
can you draw me a picture?

420
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,560
Okay.

421
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,800
I'll do it.

422
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,640
I have to take Song's call.

423
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,240
Type.

424
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,760
I'm going to Jeed's bar.

425
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,040
But you're not playing today.

426
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,680
Well…

427
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,680
A junior asked me to join him.

428
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,680
And if you're not hungry yet…

429
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,040
can we have dinner around 10:00?

430
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,160
Are you crazy? I'd be starving by then.

431
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,200
Who said you could kiss me?

432
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,240
Please wait for me.

433
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,200
I hope you don't mind the kiss this time.

434
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,280
Then…

435
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,440
I'm leaving.

436
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,000
Be a good boy
and don't eat dinner without me.

437
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,720
Bye.

438
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Do you think I'll be waiting idly
like an idiot?

439
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Dream on.

440
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,400
Here you go, three drinks for two people.

441
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
Don't get too drunk
and have a safe trip home.

442
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,760
-Tharn? Hello.
-Hello, Jeed.

443
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,320
What are you doing here?
You're not playing today.

444
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
I'm here to meet someone.

445
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,080
Where's the bright-eyed boy?
He's not with you?

446
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
No.

447
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,200
By the way, I saw Tum and…

448
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,440
Tar. They're here.

449
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,480
I don't want you to fight with them.

450
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,560
I know you two broke up.

451
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,720
We're not going to fight.
Tum's asked me to come.

452
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,720
-Okay, that's a relief. So, no fighting?
-No.

453
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,440
-Then I'll go take care of the customers.
-Sure.

454
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,600
Tar.

455
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,160
Tharn.

456
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,280
Don't sit next to my brother.

457
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,600
And don't sit next to me.

458
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,160
Tum.

459
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,640
Don't be like this.

460
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,960
Tar.

461
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
Yes?

462
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,280
You know why I wanted to see you, right?

463
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,560
Why did you say I would break up
with my boyfriend?

464
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,360
What are you thinking?

465
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,520
Even though we used to be together…

466
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,200
I don't like what you said.

467
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I came to see you today…

468
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,200
not because I wanted to.

469
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,120
But I want to know why you said
what you said.

470
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,440
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,720
I'm really sorry.

472
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,560
This is the last time I'll see you.

473
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,480
If you have something to say…

474
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,840
say it now.

475
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,880
I can't tell you.

476
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,880
Tharn.

477
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,760
Please believe me just this once.

478
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,360
What do you expect me to believe?

479
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
Believe that I love you.

480
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,560
I really love you.

481
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,000
But I don't love you anymore.

482
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,440
I know that.

483
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,440
I just want to say I love you.

484
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,160
I really love you, Tharn.

485
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,600
Who is he, Jeed?

486
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,720
Type, I think you should calm down.

487
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,400
It may not be what it looks like.

488
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,760
Tell you what.

489
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,680
He's Tharn's ex-bandmate's brother.

490
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,240
Maybe he's asking for advice or something.

491
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,680
There's nothing to worry about.

492
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm leaving.

493
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,200
Don't tell him I was here.

494
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,680
I'll talk to him when he gets back.

495
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,200
Take it easy, okay?

496
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,120
Hello, Lhong.

497
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:19,720
Tell me everything
about Tharn's ex-boyfriend.

498
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,680
Stop crying, okay?

499
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,400
This time…

500
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,640
is the last time I'll see you.

501
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,920
-But--
-If you really love me…

502
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,160
respect my wishes.

503
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,760
I don't want any problems
with my boyfriend.

504
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,560
Okay.

505
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,480
I wish you two the best of luck.

506
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,440
Don't end up like we did.

507
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,720
I have to go.

508
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,600
Good luck, Tar.

509
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,760
You finally came back.

510
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,160
Are you okay?

511
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,160
Why were you sitting in the dark?

512
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,960
Where have you been?

513
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,960
I went to Jeed's bar.

514
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,200
Who did you meet?

515
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,240
Song.

516
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,640
I'll let you say it one more time.

517
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,520
Who did you meet?

518
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,440
I met Tar.

519
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,400
He is…

520
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,760
my ex-bandmate's brother.

521
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,800
And why don't you also tell me…

522
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,040
that the kid…

523
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,720
is your ex-boyfriend.

524
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,840
You must be shocked I know about him.

525
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,040
Because I'm not a moron!

526
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,480
You think I didn't know…

527
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,840
you were lying?

528
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,520
You think I didn't know…

529
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,440
you were acting suspiciously?

530
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,720
So how was it?

531
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,880
Did he taste as good…

532
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,560
as when you were together?

533
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,520
Was it satisfying?

534
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,400
You hadn't seen him for a year.

535
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,520
Type!

536
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,760
What?

537
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,240
What do you want to say?

538
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,720
What did I say wrong?

539
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,840
That kid was crying for your attention.

540
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,640
Or are you gonna tell me…

541
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,320
Tharn who screws around…

542
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,960
couldn't get it up?

543
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,680
It's not what you think.

544
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,800
There's nothing going on.

545
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,560
Do you expect me to believe
someone who's been lying to me?

546
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
Cat got your tongue?

547
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,520
Argue with me.

548
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,080
Answer me.

549
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,480
I'm sorry.

550
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,560
But I didn't sleep with him.

551
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,840
I believe you.

552
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,000
You couldn't have slept with him.

553
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:52,320
Because you couldn't cum
in such a short time.

554
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,360
But do you still have feelings for him?

555
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,760
Answer me!

556
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,960
Do you still have feelings for him?

557
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,760
Just deny it…

558
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,920
and I'll believe everything you say.

559
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,080
Answer me!

560
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,160
I love you with all my heart, Type.

561
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,600
Do you expect me to believe someone
who can't answer a simple question?

562
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,600
But I didn't do anything.

563
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,640
I swear.

564
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,120
I'll never meet Tar again.

565
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,240
I don't want to hear that brat's name
in this room.

566
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,680
Type.

567
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,840
Let go of me.

568
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,480
-Where are you going?
-None of your goddamn business!

569
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,520
Techno.

570
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,280
What are you doing?

571
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,080
-You don't know gold facial mask?
-This is not the time for that.

572
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,080
Facial care is important.

573
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,800
Focus on Type first.

574
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,760
What's the matter with him?

575
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,560
You know.

576
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,760
It's a grown-up thing.
You don't need to know.

577
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,440
Harsh.

578
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,160
The thing is…

579
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,560
we'll let him stay for the night.

580
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,920
Got it?

581
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,320
Okay, got it.

582
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,200
Type.

583
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,280
Did you have a fight with Tharn?

584
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,760
I'll let him sleep in my room.

585
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,040
I brought you some water.

586
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,680
Type.

587
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,280
I don't want to get involved
in a lovers' quarrel.

588
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
But…

589
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,680
I have something to tell you.

590
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,440
The other day…

591
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,800
I skipped the practice.

592
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,720
And I saw Tharn at a department store.

593
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,960
I don't know…

594
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,960
if it's related.

595
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,920
But did you leave the apartment…

596
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,520
because of that high school boy
with pale skin?

597
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,160
What did you say?

598
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,480
I had to do some shopping that day.

599
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,440
And I saw Tharn with that kid.

600
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,320
I thought he was a junior
from Tharn's school.

601
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,680
But on a closer look.

602
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,480
That kid wore the same school uniform
as Technic.

603
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:02,240
Techno!

604
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,440
What?

605
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,400
Did you just say that kid
went to the same school as Technic?

606
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,840
Don't tell me you're gonna…

607
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,280
I'm gonna find him.

608
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,560
Shit.

609
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,880
Type, isn't there any other way?

610
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:25,920
No.

611
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:28,520
I'm gonna deal with him.
