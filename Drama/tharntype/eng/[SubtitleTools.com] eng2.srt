1
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Type, wake up.

2
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,240
You've been lying on my arm
the whole night.

3
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,720
My arm is numb.

4
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,240
Type.

5
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
Don't squeeze my shoulder. It hurts.

6
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,880
What's with the shocked face?

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,400
You got into my bed last night.

8
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,560
You… me… on a bed…

9
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,800
and you're naked.

10
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,160
Last night, you and I--

11
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,120
I don't believe it!

12
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,280
Tharn, you bastard!
Asshole! Son of a bitch!

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,960
What's happening? Are you okay?

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,120
Do you want me to tell them
last night you and I--

15
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,080
No!

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,280
Type.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,280
Type.

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,560
You can be surprisingly cowardly.

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
Are you…

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,040
going to cry?

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm not!

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,800
How did I end up in your bed?

23
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,400
You got in it yourself.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,240
Liar!

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,720
Are you implying I dragged you to my bed?

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,680
It's because I was drunk.

27
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,360
Why would I drag you to my bed
if you were sleeping in yours?

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,520
I could have done it in your bed.

29
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,200
Except you already did!

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
How your body feels…

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,320
is my answer.

32
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Shit.

33
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
My butt hurts.

34
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,520
But I fell off the bed.

35
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,840
Nothing happened to me.

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
Tharn! You tricked me!

37
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
I'll get you back for this.

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
Just mosquito bites.

39
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Not a goddamn hickey or anything!

40
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,360
Tharn, I'm gonna kill you!

41
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,480
When we're seniors,
don't forget to vote for me.

42
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,640
-Vote to be what?
-Team captain.

43
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
Techno!

44
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Type! He's my friend.

45
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Please, calm down! I'm begging you!

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,120
Stop! Calm down.

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,640
How can I be frickin' calm?

48
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,800
This is because of you, mother trucker!

49
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,320
You ditched me last night.
Do you realize what happened to me?

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,400
Don't tell me you two already…

51
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,120
Wait! Stop! Stop right now!

52
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,000
I had nothing to do with this.

53
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,200
You climbed into his bed!

54
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,800
What's wrong with you, Techno?
I'm leaving.

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
Can't you help me?

56
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,200
I climbed into his bed?

57
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,080
Yeah, you climbed into his bed.

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
I tried to drag you off,
but you wouldn't budge.

59
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,880
It's not my fault, I'm telling you.

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Besides, the dorm was about to close.

61
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,840
My mom would've killed me
if I had slept over.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Stop right there!

63
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,320
This whole thing is your fault.

64
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,280
You got yourself drunk
when you knew who you were with.

65
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,440
My head!

66
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,160
Which means I went through hell
this morning because you left me.

67
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,840
I didn't leave you.

68
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,040
-So, did you two do it?
-No!

69
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,640
How did you get out of it unscathed?

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,080
Believe it or not, I did.

71
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,960
-Tharn is true to his word.
-What the hell do you mean?

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,080
Take it easy and listen to me, okay?

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,080
Last night, I asked him
not to do anything to you.

74
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,160
He said he wouldn't do drunk people.

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,160
That's why I said he was true to his word.

76
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,920
That asshole!

77
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
Why are you still mad?

78
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,560
He said that because he's confident

79
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,760
that anyone who jumps
into his bed is willing.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,360
If something really had
happened last night,

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,680
it would mean I'd done it willingly,

82
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
and that's impossible.

83
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,320
Just forget about it, man.
It's in the past.

84
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,640
Actually, I have good news for you.

85
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,800
What is it? Nothing's ever been
good ever since I met Tharn.

86
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,560
Come on, this one is for real.

87
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,560
I've found someone
to switch rooms with you.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,840
Who?

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,560
Hey, Champ! Over here. Come here.

90
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
What's up, Techno?

91
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,920
This is the guy I told you about.

92
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
He's the only one who's agreed
to switch rooms with you.

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Yeah, I want to switch rooms too.

94
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Not that my roommate is bad,
but he studies medicine.

95
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,720
He's up reading all night. I can't sleep.

96
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,160
That's why I want to switch rooms.

97
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll let you discuss
and go to the Dorm Office to…

98
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,640
I changed my mind.

99
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,880
Thanks for agreeing
to switch rooms with me,

100
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,280
but I have some unfinished business
with my roommate.

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
Sorry for wasting your time.

102
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,840
It's all right. Come talk to me
if you change your mind again.

103
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
See you.

104
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,080
-Where are you going?
-To the locker room to change.

105
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,560
Okay.

106
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,120
What the hell is wrong with you again?
I tried to help.

107
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,600
If I move out, I'll lose the war.

108
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,120
He's the one who must leave, not me!

109
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,800
But, Type, your grudge…

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,520
will put your ass virginity on the line.

111
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
BUILDING THREE

112
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,640
How is Techno doing?

113
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,040
Techno? He's fine.

114
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,120
He's been practicing hard lately.

115
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
He wants to be team captain.

116
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,760
That's awesome.

117
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,280
Wait a sec, let me tie my shoelaces.

118
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,720
-What the hell?
-What's up with him?

120
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,920
-Should've watched where he was going.
-Yeah.

121
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
-Someone's here to pick him up again?
-Who are you talking about?

122
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,400
That student from the French program
who bumped into you.

123
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,440
He always has someone to pick him up.

124
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,880
But he took time off school last year.

125
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,280
Do you know why?

126
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,880
Forget him. I don't care.

127
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,520
I only care about Techno.

128
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,960
You prick.

129
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,040
What else do you care about
aside from my brother's butt?

130
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,080
Send me his pictures,
and I'll give you anything you want.

131
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,760
You really know me well.

132
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,080
In that case,
I'll go to my room first, Tum.

133
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Okay.

134
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
Hello, Mom.

135
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
I can take care of Tar.

136
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
You don't need to worry.

137
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,360
Let me see.

138
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,000
Hurry up and taste it.
I want to know if it's delicious.

139
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,080
Looks as good as always,
but I'm not sure if it tastes good yet.

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,520
How is it?

141
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
Is it bad?

142
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,040
But I followed the recipe
exactly like last time.

143
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,960
Did I make too much sauce?

144
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm just kidding.

145
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,120
Why are you spacing out, Tharn?

146
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,240
It's nothing.

147
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm just…

148
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,160
thinking about what to eat.

149
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,760
Just eat whatever you want.

150
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,080
And stop looking so stressed.

151
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,720
Or…

152
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,320
does one of your exes want to make up?

153
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
No.

154
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm stressed out…

155
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
about forming a new band.

156
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,800
Come on, we have plenty of time
to find new members.

157
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
We only need to find
a bassist and a guitarist.

158
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
That reminds me.

159
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,960
I found this clip…

160
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
being shared on Facebook.

161
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,920
Do you remember Song?

162
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,200
-Song?
-Yeah.

163
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,720
Song, who calls you his "idol."

164
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
Yeah, that's him.

165
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,360
I think his guitar skills are pretty good.

166
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,680
I'll let him audition for our band.
What do you think?

167
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,280
I'm okay with it. I think he's good.

168
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,000
-Then, I'll leave it to you.
-I'm on it.

169
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,640
I'll tell you the date
as soon as possible.

170
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,320
-I'm going to buy lunch.
-Okay.

171
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,680
DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF!

172
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
"Don't touch my stuff!"

173
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,480
Think of it as payback
for what you did this morning.

174
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,160
Just a bunch of cheap snacks.

175
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:38,320
In case you're hungry,
lick the bed, roomie.

176
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,680
I ATE THEM. SO WHAT?

177
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,040
What the hell did you do?

178
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,160
What did I do? I didn't do anything.

179
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,800
If it wasn't you, then which jerk did it?

180
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,840
Damn it! I don't know!

181
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,640
Stop making so much noise, God damn it!

182
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,280
WATCH BEFORE IT'S DELETED.

183
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,800
WHAT DID YOU JUST SEND?

184
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,520
DO YOU STILL SEE ME AS A WOMAN?

185
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,560
THERE ARE SO MANY
INSPIRING CLIPS OUT THERE.

186
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,640
INSTEAD, YOU SENT PORN.

187
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,840
MY MOM'S SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

188
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,280
IF SHE SAW ME WATCHING PORN,
I'D BE KILLED.

189
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,880
MORE. GIVE ME MORE.

190
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
BE RIGHT BACK.

191
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,360
I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT. THANKS, DUDE.

192
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,480
This is good stuff.

193
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,240
The hell are you smiling at?

194
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you looking at! Get out!

195
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,480
And why is that?

196
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,560
It's you who should know
this is a shared room.

197
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,800
And I thought you were disgusted by me.

198
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,880
Or do you…

199
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,400
-have feelings for me.
-The hell I do!

200
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,400
I hate you so much I don't even want
to breathe the same air as you.

201
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,360
Why did I have to be put
in the same room as you?

202
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,480
Did your dad not love you as a kid?

203
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,400
Is that why you go after men?

204
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,200
-Don't insult my dad!
-What are you doing?

205
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,040
I've had enough
of your shitty attitude, Type!

206
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,320
Let me go!

207
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,360
Kick me, I dare you. Kick me.

208
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,920
-I said let go.
-Why should I do as you say?

209
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,840
Let me go.

210
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,560
Where's the arrogant bastard
who insulted my dad?

211
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,880
Let me go!

212
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,520
Please, let me go.

213
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,680
Don't hurt me.

214
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,200
Please.

215
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,240
I'm sorry.

216
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
Please, let me go.

217
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
I just want to help you relax.

218
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Calm down.

219
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,760
Don't.

220
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,160
Let me go.

221
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,360
Are you okay?

222
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,440
Get off me!

223
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,520
What the hell is wrong with you, Type?

224
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,440
I hate you.

225
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,240
It's okay, Type.

226
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,200
What's up?

227
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
I thought you didn't want to eat.

228
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,800
Good thing I haven't gone home yet.

229
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,640
Sorry.

230
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,880
I forgot I didn't have
any food in my room.

231
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
Are you okay?

232
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
I'm fine.

233
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,600
I ordered for you.

234
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,960
Do you want to eat anything in particular?

235
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
No, I'll eat what you ordered.

236
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,160
I hate you.

237
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,760
What's the matter, Tharn?

238
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm sorry, Lhong.

239
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,720
-I have to go.
-What?

240
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,400
What about your dinner?

241
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,080
Excuse me, I want to cancel…

242
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,560
the order.

243
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,280
Too late for that.

244
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,320
I'll finish all of it.

245
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,160
Just two dishes.

246
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,680
No!

247
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,880
Don't do it!

248
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,960
Type!

249
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,960
What are you doing here, kiddo?

250
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
You like football?

251
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,440
Yes.

252
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,960
I know a football field
with lots of balls.

253
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,120
Do you want to play there?

254
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,720
Yes.

255
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,160
Don't do it!

256
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,240
Type!

257
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,640
<i>Don't!</i>

258
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,120
Daddy! Mommy! Help me!

259
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,000
Let me have fun with you, kiddo.

260
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,640
What's the matter, Type?

261
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,600
Let me go.

262
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,280
Let go! Let me go!

263
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,200
Type, what's wrong?

264
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,120
Help me.

265
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,680
-Type, wake up.
-Help me.

266
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,280
Wake up.

267
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,960
-Wake up, Type. Wake up.
-Help me.

268
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,440
Help me…

269
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,880
Tharn.

270
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,880
-Wake up, Type!
-Help me, Tharn.

271
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,520
Wake up!

272
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,920
Wake up.

273
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,080
It's okay, Type.

274
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,280
It's okay, Type.

275
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm here.

276
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm here with you.

277
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
It's okay.

278
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,200
Leave me alone!

279
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,600
What the hell was that for?

280
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,880
I helped wake you up!

281
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
I didn't ask you to do it.

282
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,680
That's true, you didn't.

283
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,560
But I'm kind enough…

284
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,680
to help a grown man
who's still afraid of his nightmares.

285
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,080
I'm not afraid of nightmares.

286
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
You don't know anything. So, back off!

287
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,640
Then, what are you afraid of?

288
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm not afraid of anything!

289
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm never afraid of anything.

290
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,920
Do you expect me to believe that when
you're crying and trembling like that?

291
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,240
Stop being so cocky!

292
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,560
I can be as cocky as I want.

293
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,840
I'll tell you this.

294
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,080
Even if I cried myself to death,
I wouldn't ask for your help.

295
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,520
Remember that.

296
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,920
I'm sorry…

297
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,680
for meddling in your life.

298
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,280
I didn't ask for your help.

299
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,600
Type.

300
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,680
Wake up. It's almost 8:00.

301
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,680
Get up, already.

302
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,520
I'm waking you up…

303
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,920
not because I have a thing for you,
but because I pity you.

304
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,040
-Wake up, it's almost 8:00.
-Shut up!

305
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,800
Leave me alone.

306
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,800
Suit yourself.

307
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,680
Sleep all you want.

308
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
What the hell?

309
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,880
My head is killing me.

310
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,400
Techno.

311
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,560
<i>Type, where are you?</i>

312
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,200
<i>I'm already on campus.</i>
<i>Let's have some breakfast.</i>

313
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,680
I don't want to.

314
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,440
<i>You sound weird. Did you just wake up?</i>

315
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,800
<i>Get up now. The class is about to start.</i>

316
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,280
<i>Don't tell me you're going to skip.</i>

317
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,160
I have a headache.

318
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,880
<i>You're sick?Should I go check on you?</i>

319
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,520
Don't, I'll be fine.

320
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,240
I'm hanging up.

321
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,880
Damn.

322
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,120
Shit, what should I do?

323
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,920
Tharn. Come this way.

324
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,400
What's wrong? Feeling cranky?

325
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,720
What do you want? I'm in a hurry to class.

326
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,080
I wanted to ask if Type is seriously ill.

327
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,560
You didn't know he's sick?

328
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,080
And how do you know that?

329
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,440
I called him this morning
to invite him for breakfast,

330
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,480
but he said he had a headache.

331
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,840
And his voice was really hoarse.

332
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,400
I called him again just now,
but he didn't pick up.

333
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,520
That's why I asked you
if he's seriously sick.

334
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,240
Sorry, you have class, right?

335
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,800
It's okay. Just go.
I'll go check on him myself.

336
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,440
I have to hurry back to class too.
The professor is super strict.

337
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,800
See you.

338
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,360
What?

339
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,960
You…

340
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,240
can go back to class.

341
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,160
I'll check on him.

342
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,000
Didn't you say you have to hurry to class?

343
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Just go. This rice soup
is for him, right? Give it to me.

344
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:20,160
So, I'll go check on him,
and you go to class. See you.

345
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Tharn! That's my rice soup. It's mine.

346
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Type, take some medicine.

347
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,120
Take some medicine.

348
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,920
Get up.

349
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,520
Type.

350
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,040
I'm going to try to bring your fever down.

351
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
Dad, don't go. Dad!

352
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't leave me.

353
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,920
I'm not going to leave you.

354
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,960
Just trying to lower your fever.

355
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,520
Don't go.

356
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,160
I'm not going anywhere.

357
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,560
I'm sitting right beside you.

358
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,600
Stupid me, I forgot to ask
for Tharn's number.

359
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,480
Tharn, where are you going? How's Type?

360
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
Still sleeping.

361
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,960
He's been sleeping since morning.

362
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,040
I'll go buy medicine and gel patches.

363
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
It's okay. I already bought them.

364
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,680
I asked Champ to let me in.

365
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,360
You go with Type's roommate.
Take care of him.

366
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,320
I'll go find something to eat.
See you, Tharn.

367
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,280
Bye.

368
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,480
Yeah, thanks a lot.

369
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,520
I'll go with Tharn.

370
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,400
Why are you looking at me like that?

371
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,880
Nothing.

372
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
It's just that you have my respect.

373
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,920
You guys fight every day,

374
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,200
but you're still helping him
with his fever.

375
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,560
We live in the same room.

376
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,200
I can't let him die in there.

377
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,560
That's why I said you're super-duper nice.

378
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,600
Let's say you were the one who's sick.

379
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,120
I bet he'd leave you to rot.

380
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,600
-Techno.
-What?

381
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,960
Can you do me a favor?

382
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,320
What is it?

383
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,080
Don't tell Type I'm the one
who took care of him.

384
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
Why not?

385
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,280
Come on. Pretty please.

386
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,640
Okay, if that's what you want.

387
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,480
You two are equally weird.

388
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,640
Just a sec.

389
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Give me your number.

390
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,440
In case I want to ask you
how Type's doing.

391
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,200
Okay. Let's go.

392
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,640
Why are you being nice to me?

393
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,720
What exactly do you want?

394
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,720
What a nice smell.

395
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,920
Is it a sin to steal food from the sick?

396
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,560
You're awake? How are you?
Feeling better now?

397
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,840
Let me check.

398
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,880
I skipped practice to take care of you.

399
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,960
Is this your rice soup?

400
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,240
Yeah, I bought it for you this morning,

401
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,120
but you were sleeping,
so I didn't wake you up.

402
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,400
I already reheated it, though.

403
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,360
I'm about to eat it myself if you don't.

404
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,760
-So, it's you.
-I'm what?

405
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,000
Nothing.

406
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,200
Get up and eat, so you can take the meds.

407
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,840
I'm not hungry.

408
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,040
Don't be like this. You have to eat.

409
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,000
Come on, the meds will hurt your stomach
if you don't eat anything.

410
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,800
Come on, get up.
At least take a few bites.

411
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,240
You're so stubborn.

412
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Where is he?

413
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,560
He?

414
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,000
You mean Tharn?

415
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,360
I don't know.

416
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,240
Why do you ask?

417
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,560
Never mind.

418
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,080
I'm full.

419
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,400
Only three bites?

420
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,080
The meds.

421
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,720
Are you okay?

422
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,360
So, you've been taking care…

423
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,600
Tharn, you're back?

424
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,040
Where have you been? Type's up.

425
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,160
I went out to get worksheets.

426
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,800
Type, what were you saying?

427
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Nothing.

428
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,720
Who's calling?

429
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
Shit!

430
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,880
-Type, the senior's calling me.
-What?

431
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,880
-I'm screwed.
-Just pick up.

432
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,360
I know that.

433
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,720
I'm screwed big time.
I'll take the call outside.

434
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,840
Hello.

435
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,600
Yes.

436
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,480
Who took care of me?

437
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,680
You don't want it to be me, right?

438
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,560
That's right.

439
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,760
Then, you're lucky.

440
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,520
Because I'm too busy
to nurse a big baby like you.

441
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
So, it was Techno.

442
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,640
Your friend took care of you.

443
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,680
Good thing you got better.

444
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,040
Go take a shower if you're awake.

445
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,480
I don't want to be near a germ spreader…

446
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,240
who's also dirty.

447
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,880
My fever's still high.

448
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,360
I'm not blushing or anything.

449
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,760
-So close.
-I'll play with one hand.

450
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,560
Where the hell is Technic?

451
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,000
Hello, Type.

452
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

453
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,640
Game over. You lost.

454
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,600
Where have you been since morning?

455
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,920
You took my motorbike again, didn't you?

456
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,440
-You're lucky I didn't call the cops.
-Are you crazy, Techno?

457
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,280
I went to see Kla. He got me snacks
from Japan. Don't you want some?

458
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,880
-Really? Give it to me.
-Yeah.

459
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,040
I almost forgot.

460
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,600
Don't throw!

461
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,320
-What's this?
-My dad bought them for you.

462
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,000
What's this?

463
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,640
Salted eggs.

464
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,760
I talked to my dad
on the phone the other day.

465
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,280
When he found out I was sick,

466
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,000
he sent this as a thank you gift
for taking care of his beloved son.

467
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,280
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

468
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,080
Why are you giving it to me?
Why not give it to Tharn?

469
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,320
Tharn? Why him? It'd be a waste.

470
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,800
Don't you know the one
taking care of you was Tharn?

471
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,600
What did you say?

472
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,480
-It wasn't you?
-No.

473
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,520
I didn't do it.

474
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,240
Tharn was the one who took care of you.

475
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,040
He gave you food and water, meds,
helped reduce your fever, and…

476
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,640
changed your clothes too, I guess.

477
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,200
Type.

478
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,680
-What?
-Listen to me.

479
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,440
Tharn, your so-called enemy,
is a really great guy.

480
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,400
Type.

481
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,160
He skipped classes to take care of you.

482
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,440
By the way, how come you didn't realize
the one who helped you get better

483
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,680
was the one you hated the most?

484
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,080
He said you took care of me.

485
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,600
Definitely not me.

486
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,240
As I recall, I checked on you
the first day you got sick.

487
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,920
Bastard!

488
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,840
You're my friend.
Why didn't you take care of me?

489
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,640
Yes, I'm your friend.

490
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:42,880
But if I take care of you now,
you'll end up in a hospital.

491
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,680
Tharn is the right guy for the job.

492
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,040
Damn, it hurts.

493
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
I'm going.

494
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,040
-Where?
-Back to my dorm.

495
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
I thought you didn't want to go back.

496
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
-Piss off!
-What the hell?

497
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,720
What was that for?

498
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,120
Salted eggs and taros.
I'll be totally stuffed.

499
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,320
Type, what are you doing?
Why aren't you going in?

500
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,400
What's wrong?
Fighting with your roommate again?

501
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,120
Who told you?

502
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,320
Techno.

503
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,320
Why? Is he a total prick
despite his good looks?

504
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,240
No.

505
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,360
He's too good.

506
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,080
So good…

507
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,200
that I feel guilty for hating him.

508
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,080
And why do you hate him…

509
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,200
if he's that good?

510
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm still confused why you wanted
to switch rooms with me.

511
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
What's with him?

512
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,240
{\an8}Tharn.

513
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,640
{\an8}Tharn.

514
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,960
{\an8}Last night, did you do something to me?

515
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,600
{\an8}Where are my boxers?

516
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,880
{\an8}Give them back!

517
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,200
{\an8}Let me shower with you.
