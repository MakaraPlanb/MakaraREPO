1
00:00:07,112 --> 00:00:08,439
What are you doing?

2
00:00:09,086 --> 00:00:10,221
-A sex scene?
-Hey!

3
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,660
If I help, you might finish early.

4
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:13,967
Shit!

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,320
I think your NC scenes
have gotten much better.

6
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:18,743
Don't worry, I'll be your guardian.

7
00:00:19,037 --> 00:00:20,280
You're so cute.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,040
That's dangerous!
Be careful.

9
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:24,720
It seems like Nubsib likes you.

10
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:27,126
Nubsib's become really attached to you.

11
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,760
He's always asking about you.

12
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,345
Cute my ass!

13
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:32,609
Gather your stuff and prepare to move out.

14
00:00:58,009 --> 00:00:58,909
Who is it?

15
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:11,272
Who is it?

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,640
Don't tell me it's...

17
00:01:24,624 --> 00:01:25,560
Ugh!

18
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,598
That damn Tum.

19
00:01:30,752 --> 00:01:34,200
How many times have I told you
I want my privacy?

20
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,640
Mom?

21
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Hello Gene, what are you doing?

22
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:44,374
Woah.

23
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,177
Where are you? It's loud.

24
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,177
I'm dancing at the gym
with Auntie Orn, is it loud?

25
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,640
It's okay, are you doing aerobics?

26
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,200
Yes, how are you?

27
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:59,380
You've disappeared...

28
00:02:01,048 --> 00:02:03,947
I'm working on my manuscript,

29
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:05,600
but I'm okay, you don't need to worry

30
00:02:06,498 --> 00:02:08,880
I thought you forgot about your parents.

31
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,880
Auntie Orn has been asking about you.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,220
I'll go home when I get some free time.

33
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:16,600
Gene, Auntie Orn wants to talk to you.

34
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:19,440
Gene, I miss you so much!

35
00:02:19,943 --> 00:02:22,720
I haven't seen you at all.

36
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,652
Sure, when I come home I'll go visit you.

37
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:28,360
You're the sweetest!

38
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:32,200
When you come over
I'll make something for you to eat.

39
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:35,608
You're the sweetest too!

40
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:39,287
Talk to your mom,
I'm going to go bust some moves.

41
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:41,775
Please take care of your health.

42
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:42,808
Okay.

43
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:46,208
You really know how to sweet talk!

44
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:48,080
What do you mean?

45
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:53,226
How's dad and Jap?

46
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:56,600
Some old Jap's still living at home.

47
00:02:56,925 --> 00:03:00,080
After work all he does is stay
in his room and play games

48
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,040
And when dad nags they give
each other the silent treatment.

49
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,080
It's so tiring.

50
00:03:04,372 --> 00:03:07,951
Don't nag so much, you'll get old quickly!

51
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:10,360
Are you calling me old?

52
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,791
No.

53
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:16,920
I'm going to go dance now,
don't forget to eat on time!

54
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:19,312
You too.

55
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,698
Take care of your health.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,400
Tell dad and Jap too.

57
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,684
Okay, don't forget to come home.

58
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:27,431
Sure, when I have some
free time I'll go straight home.

59
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:28,320
I promise.

60
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,440
Fine! Bye-bye.

61
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,158
Bye.

62
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:44,080
(Tum: Everyone is at
the hotel's dining room.)

63
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,087
(Gene: I'm on the way.)

64
00:03:48,334 --> 00:03:50,137
(Gene: Today I want
to get really drunk LOL.)

65
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:52,134
Hey!
Hey!

66
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,960
Hey! Why are you in here?

67
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,320
Get out!

68
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,720
I heard that you're going out tonight.

69
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,240
But you're not leaving yet
so I'm checking in on you.

70
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:05,321
I'm brushing my teeth right now.

71
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,200
I'll leave when I finish showering.

72
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,960
Don't rush brushing your teeth.

73
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:14,120
Your gums might bleed
or it's not clean enough.

74
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,680
Let me tell you something.

75
00:04:17,159 --> 00:04:20,687
The toothbrush I'm using has a large head,

76
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:23,210
while the bristles are tapered and soft.

77
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:27,920
It's also tight and gentle
towards your teeth.

78
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:31,946
You're so good at selling.

79
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:36,880
Tum just told me I have a toothbrush brand
contacted me to be the presenter.

80
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you interested in
being the presenter with me?

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,120
Quit teasing me and get out.

82
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:45,720
It's only because I care.

83
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,149
Get out!

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,422
Do you need help brushing your teeth?

85
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,920
No, I can do it myself.

86
00:05:55,638 --> 00:06:01,691
The latest news I've heard
Jim's finally getting a girlfriend!

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,280
Shut up, don't make fun of me.

88
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,272
It's a good thing!

89
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:08,920
He's been talking to four to five girls,
being a total player.

90
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,000
We're just all glad to hear the news.

91
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't be so damn nosy!

92
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:15,927
What about you Tum?

93
00:06:16,178 --> 00:06:17,424
Do you have a girlfriend yet?

94
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,680
No, I haven't met anyone yet.

95
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:22,505
I think me and Gene has zero chance
of getting a girlfriend.

96
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:23,720
Really?

97
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,280
Isn't there anyone you have your eyes on?

98
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:27,720
It's true.

99
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:29,736
Thing aren't the same as they were before.

100
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:31,073
It's better than before?

101
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:31,984
It's worse!

102
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,013
This clown!

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm just kidding!

104
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:37,425
It should be better!

105
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:39,440
Look at you, all hot and handsome.

106
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:40,516
There should be someone.

107
00:06:40,786 --> 00:06:42,760
Tum, don't try and hide from us.

108
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,558
If you ask if I have feelings for anyone.

109
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:47,880
There's someone.

110
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:49,920
But I'm not confident at all.

111
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,032
Nevermind.
I'm not taking it too seriously.

112
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:52,920
I'm focused on work.

113
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,945
Ah

114
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:57,425
Hey, but...

115
00:06:58,222 --> 00:06:59,320
Did Gene forget to come?

116
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:01,528
Does he know that we're meeting up.

117
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,151
Oh yeah.
Did he forget again?

118
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:05,352
Speak of the devil.

119
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,360
We were just talking about you.

120
00:07:08,236 --> 00:07:09,199
Come sit.

121
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,560
Sorry I'm late, the traffic was terrible.

122
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:12,441
Took you so long.

123
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,183
We were just gossiping about you.

124
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:17,640
Real hot gossip, did you know that?

125
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,208
What were you talking about?

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
-The wine's here!
-Come one, we barely see each other.

127
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,608
Cheers!

128
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,058
Cheers!

129
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,166
Gene.

130
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:31,823
How's life?

131
00:07:31,864 --> 00:07:33,120
Are you happy?

132
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,320
All I do is work,

133
00:07:35,858 --> 00:07:37,440
but who could be as happy as you?

134
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,000
I heard you're getting married.

135
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,640
I can't thank you guys enough.

136
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:48,049
Normally, he doesn't know a thing.

137
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,247
I'm always updating on you guys.

138
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:53,160
Hmm... Full of shit!

139
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:55,927
I'm the one who's sending the news.

140
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:57,703
He doesn't know about anything at all.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,884
All Gene does is write his novel.

142
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:02,342
You're a writer?

143
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:03,787
Whan told me you're a writer.

144
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:05,760
Novel? Love novels?

145
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah, something like that.

146
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,245
It's a Boy Love novel.

147
00:08:12,365 --> 00:08:14,080
I'm a fan!

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,560
So shippable.

149
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:18,740
Tum also told me,

150
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:22,139
that your novel is being
turned into a series!

151
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,163
Our friend is getting famous!

152
00:08:24,204 --> 00:08:27,269
-Wow
-It's not like that.

153
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,800
Nubsib is in it right?

154
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,560
I screamed so loud when I found out.

155
00:08:32,601 --> 00:08:33,883
Too much..

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,220
You know Nubsib?

157
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,366
Of course!

158
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm like... Hmm

159
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:41,280
That's enough. Settle down.

160
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,179
And you're husband is sitting right here.

161
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,883
-What husband?
-This is a friend.

162
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,707
What are you looking at Korn?

163
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:56,360
Is there something on my face?

164
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,763
Nothing.

165
00:08:58,094 --> 00:09:01,832
I was just going to ask
what your Boy Love series is about.

166
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:03,280
It's about guys screwing each other...

167
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:04,702
Ouch!

168
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:07,289
It's just a love novel.

169
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,720
Just like a boy-girl love story,

170
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,825
but it's just two male leads.

171
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,800
You're capable of writing stuff like this?

172
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,332
Don't tell me that you're...

173
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:26,163
Gay?

174
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:29,177
What's that got to do with it?

175
00:09:29,218 --> 00:09:31,720
These type of novels are
mostly written by women.

176
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,200
I think your logic is weird.

177
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:36,520
I was just asking!

178
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,450
But lately you've been
looking more feminine.

179
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:42,760
Looking so cute!

180
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:45,880
Any guy would catch feelings!

181
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,027
Your dad!

182
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:48,908
My dad?

183
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,000
But for real,

184
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:53,957
I've felt that there's something there
since we were in university.

185
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,480
He's never had a girlfriend...

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,360
and cute girls swarmed all over you
but you still dumped all of them.

187
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:02,120
-Kat!
-Yeah, Kat.

188
00:10:02,931 --> 00:10:03,840
Or...

189
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:06,040
You began liking guys around that time?

190
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,495
You can be gay we're okay with that,

191
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:19,764
and we're really into shipping!

192
00:10:19,805 --> 00:10:20,720
We'll even help you ship!

193
00:10:21,196 --> 00:10:22,798
We're totally okay with it.

194
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,490
Very happy.

195
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:27,463
You can be one, totally shipping!

196
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:41,320
I should tell you if I'm gay or not?

197
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:45,121
When I think about it,

198
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,320
it's really none of your business.

199
00:10:50,076 --> 00:10:51,050
That's enough.

200
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,500
Why are you guys bothering him so much?

201
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,440
Whatever he is still our friend.

202
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,943
When the time comes
he'll tell you all about his life.

203
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:04,003
It's just that
I want to know how our friend is.

204
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,155
I just wanted updates.

205
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:06,773
Getting all serious.

206
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:07,840
Yeah

207
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,120
You guys should stop
prying and let's party.

208
00:11:10,413 --> 00:11:11,640
We haven't seen each other in ages.

209
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,454
Asking him so many questions,
I thought we're on a variety talk show!

210
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:17,744
How much fun do you want out of it?

211
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:21,088
Wait, I have a surprise for you too.

212
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:22,155
Over here please.

213
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:29,240
Here!

214
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,615
Drink up for the next biggest star
of the Boy Love industry!

215
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:35,748
Hello!

216
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,880
Hello, hello?

217
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,485
Nubsib.

218
00:12:39,948 --> 00:12:41,280
Where are you?

219
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,524
Gene, are you drunk?

220
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,214
No.

221
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:47,640
What do you mean drunk?

222
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:49,532
You're drunk.

223
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:51,698
Nubsib can you come pick me up?

224
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:54,164
I want you to come pick me up right now.

225
00:12:54,205 --> 00:12:56,200
Who are you with right now?

226
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:57,903
There's Tum...

227
00:12:58,164 --> 00:13:02,938
and all of my nosy friends are all here.

228
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:06,707
Let's just say
if you don't come pick me up.

229
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,560
I'm going to sleep right here
and I'm not coming home.

230
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:10,920
Can I talk to Tum?

231
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:14,400
Sure, Mr Nubsib.

232
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:15,461
Tum!

233
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,240
He misses you and wants to talk to you.

234
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:22,684
-Hello
-Where are you guys?

235
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,080
We're at Hotel L.

236
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,640
We're at Hotel L.

237
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:27,080
You don't need to come.

238
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:28,120
I think he's just blabbering, I'll just...

239
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:29,720
Please take care of Gene.

240
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,360
I'm on my way.

241
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,560
Gene, get up.

242
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,360
Let's go home.

243
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,261
Tum let go of me.
I'm going to sit right here.

244
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,720
-Come on Gene.
-No!

245
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:02,080
I'm drunk and I'm going to sit here!

246
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,812
Why did you let him get this drunk?

247
00:14:06,347 --> 00:14:07,801
I warned him but does
he ever listen to me?

248
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,860
Dunking shots like
he's never drank before.

249
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:17,584
Gene, Gene.

250
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:22,360
Oh, how did number 18 get here?

251
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,120
You called and told
me to come pick you up.

252
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:28,652
Nubsib.

253
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:31,320
Why are you this drunk?

254
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:36,685
Tum kept telling me to drink.

255
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:37,803
You forced him to drink?

256
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:39,285
That's just funny.

257
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:40,350
You wouldn't stop drinking,

258
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:41,320
and you're saying
I'm the one who told you to drink?

259
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,385
Nubsib.

260
00:14:45,344 --> 00:14:46,786
You guys are this drunk,

261
00:14:46,827 --> 00:14:48,840
so you've probably both had a lot!

262
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:50,643
It's been ages since
we've seen our friends!

263
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,240
Right Whan?

264
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,200
This bitch already fell asleep
and Jim's just useless.

265
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:03,082
Sorry Sib, I'm starting to get blurry,

266
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:04,360
and I have to work early tomorrow.

267
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,012
Could you just take Gene home?

268
00:15:06,384 --> 00:15:08,840
Then I'll be taking him now.

269
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,800
Give me another glass!

270
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:18,720
Tum, I drove my car over
as for Gene's car could you clear that up,

271
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:20,040
and take it back to Gene's condo?

272
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,348
I'm leaving the city really
early tomorrow morning.

273
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:22,640
Then leave earlier!

274
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,360
Drop it off that the condo's lobby.

275
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:25,640
And I'll go pick it up.

276
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:26,877
Jerk.

277
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:30,225
Well, I am your manager.

278
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,480
Nubsib.

279
00:15:33,658 --> 00:15:35,195
Be careful Gene.

280
00:15:35,236 --> 00:15:36,400
Nubsib!

281
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,800
It's that clear
and he's acting all stuck up when I asked.

282
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:48,800
He could just answer and get it over with,

283
00:15:49,763 --> 00:15:51,200
it's not like we can't handle it.

284
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:54,760
Why would you try to
force the answer out of him?

285
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,360
It's not everybody...

286
00:15:56,401 --> 00:15:57,720
who wants to tell others
about themselves all the time.

287
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,100
Why would he want to cover it up from us?

288
00:16:01,141 --> 00:16:02,955
We're friends so we would be okay with it.

289
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:04,760
How many years have we known each other?

290
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:07,425
If he would just accept who he is.

291
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,556
That's all.

292
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,077
We're friends,
so we would be cool with it.

293
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:11,726
Hiding in the closet,

294
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,274
why is he embarrassed by it?

295
00:16:14,257 --> 00:16:15,400
He has his reasons.

296
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,652
Things like this take time,

297
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:20,946
and if he wants to talk about it or not
it's his choice.

298
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,281
And you're his friend,

299
00:16:22,322 --> 00:16:24,760
so you should understand him
not just want to know his business.

300
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:28,118
Holy shit.

301
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:33,760
I'm leaving now, look after the others.

302
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,357
I have to work early tomorrow.

303
00:16:35,557 --> 00:16:36,480
This asshole!

304
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:37,880
Just leaving me like that.

305
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,900
Oho.

306
00:16:47,194 --> 00:16:49,680
I'm so drunk.

307
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:52,079
Gene.

308
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:53,440
Are we at the car yet?

309
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:54,854
Have some patience.

310
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:04,720
Gene.

311
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:08,462
If you're not going to stay still,
I'm going to carry you.

312
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,440
Carry me?

313
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:16,826
Come on.

314
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:18,200
Carry me!

315
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:19,760
Carry me!

316
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:28,080
Can we change it to a piggyback ride?

317
00:17:29,733 --> 00:17:34,000
I've been wanting to ride for sometime.

318
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:41,560
Okay, I'll be a piggy for you to ride

319
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:59,066
If I can't carry you
you might drop to the floor,

320
00:17:59,747 --> 00:18:01,880
so hold on and hug me tight.

321
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,360
Careful!

322
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:35,800
Mind your head.

323
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:06,798
So handsome.

324
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,599
You're so cute.

325
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,672
Is this your car?

326
00:19:24,046 --> 00:19:24,886
You don't have a car.

327
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,000
You're drunk but you
still have a great memory.

328
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:53,143
Gene, don't be so naughty.

329
00:19:57,173 --> 00:19:59,802
Why? Did your boyfriend give it to you?

330
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:04,515
I've been staying with you for a month
and you still don't know if I'm single?

331
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:06,840
Of course you have one,

332
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:12,040
because you're so handsome
so a lot of people like you.

333
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:15,416
Even I like you.

334
00:20:25,511 --> 00:20:26,640
You like me?

335
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:31,640
Why?

336
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,476
Do you think I'm lying?

337
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:35,869
Because you're drunk.

338
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:39,720
And why do you think
drunk people would lie?

339
00:20:43,644 --> 00:20:45,720
What do you like about me?

340
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,785
I don't know...

341
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:05,200
you're handsome.

342
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,430
Here...

343
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:11,410
Those eyes... Big and round.

344
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:15,680
Those long beautiful eyelashes...

345
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,983
Perfectly shaped.

346
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:22,240
And high nose bridge...

347
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,560
Those full lips.

348
00:21:30,286 --> 00:21:31,480
Let me look at your teeth.

349
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,240
Your teeth are so straight,

350
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:42,755
and those muscles make you look like...

351
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:55,760
Like what?

352
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,520
Like a lead from a Boy Love novel,

353
00:22:11,991 --> 00:22:16,640
and you're so nice
helping me write it too.

354
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,845
I'm starting to see
the positive side of drunk people.

355
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:49,280
Be careful Gene.

356
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,160
What are you trying to do?

357
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,400
You should know.

358
00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:54,640
I don't.

359
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:04,200
I thought you said you're going to help me
here's to help me write my novel.

360
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:05,684
What?

361
00:24:11,132 --> 00:24:11,998
Gene...

362
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:17,440
Gene..Can you tell me
what you're doing right now?

363
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:34,600
Gene, calm down.

364
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:38,315
Calm down.

365
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:41,680
Gene, can you calm down.

366
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:50,920
Gene.

367
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,520
Are you sure?

368
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,840
Can you stop asking?

369
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:06,800
I know you're trying to seduce me!

370
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:10,680
Or are you trying to say that
you see me as an older brother?

371
00:25:11,992 --> 00:25:14,333
What the hell?

372
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:29,600
All this time...

373
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,480
I've never thought of you
as an older brother at all.

374
00:25:39,066 --> 00:25:40,120
Then what the hell is this?

375
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:45,871
I just want to wait
until we're more ready.

376
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,480
Do you understand?

377
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,310
I'm...

378
00:26:03,914 --> 00:26:04,969
I'm confused.

379
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,830
About what?

380
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,270
About...

381
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:27,736
It's okay.

382
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:13,071
Can you sleep with me tonight?

383
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:15,958
Just sleeping.

384
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,520
I don't want to sleep alone.

385
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,516
Can you hug me?

386
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:50,035
Please hug me.

387
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:37,800
Hey!

388
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:43,887
Are you already awake?

389
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:49,772
Last night...

390
00:29:50,303 --> 00:29:51,400
Last night...

391
00:29:51,852 --> 00:29:52,799
What about it?

392
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,320
Let's just let it slide.

393
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,600
We're all guys here...

394
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:07,134
But last night you
kissed me so many times.

395
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:08,911
Shit!

396
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,102
You're a guy and I'm a guy...

397
00:30:15,143 --> 00:30:17,080
another thing is
I was so drunk last night.

398
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,760
Don't think about it too much.

399
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:22,800
Of course I'm thinking about it,

400
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:24,920
or are you not thinking about it?

401
00:30:28,347 --> 00:30:29,203
No.

402
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:30,918
I'm not thinking about it.

403
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,480
But that's not what
your face said last night.

404
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:40,505
Fine,

405
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,840
I'm thinking about it

406
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,360
but it's not a big deal.

407
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:50,160
Another thing is
you're also moving out soon.

408
00:31:03,636 --> 00:31:04,600
Why are you making that face?

409
00:31:05,838 --> 00:31:08,080
I was so drunk last night,
I don't know what happened,

410
00:31:13,326 --> 00:31:14,448
but last night,

411
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,800
you told me that you liked me.

412
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,260
Like..?

413
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:27,681
Yes.

414
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,254
You told me that you liked me.

415
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:35,585
I've been staying with you for a month,

416
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,240
and you still don't
know if I'm single or not?

417
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:39,880
So a lot of people like you.

418
00:31:42,113 --> 00:31:43,371
Even I like you.

419
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:51,200
You're talking nonsense.

420
00:31:53,798 --> 00:31:55,348
Get out!
Get out of my room!

421
00:31:58,857 --> 00:31:59,832
Go!

422
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:04,887
Fine,

423
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,400
but I'll still remember it.

424
00:32:28,581 --> 00:32:30,915
(Come get your kid ASAP!)

425
00:32:53,582 --> 00:32:55,183
(Come get your kid ASAP!)

426
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:04,960
Sorry. I just got off work.

427
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,375
What happened?

428
00:33:07,043 --> 00:33:07,930
What did Nubsib do?

429
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,360
Nothing,

430
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:13,080
he didn't do anything
but it's almost a month!

431
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:14,680
Have you spoken to Sib?

432
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:16,560
Go talk to him first

433
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:18,017
Talk about? Why?

434
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:22,194
This is what we agreed to
so come and take him, bye.

435
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:25,240
Hey Gene, wait!

436
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:30,640
That brat
how am I going to talk to him?

437
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:51,907
What's up?

438
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:54,800
What are we going to do
about Nubsib's living situation?

439
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:58,240
The current contract is almost over.

440
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:00,040
What should we do?

441
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:01,906
You're a big boy,

442
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:03,998
why don't you figure out
how to solve the problem yourself?

443
00:34:04,324 --> 00:34:05,645
Do you need me to tell you everything?

444
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,484
I was just asking!

445
00:34:07,525 --> 00:34:10,120
Just get it over with
and don't embarrass me.

446
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:11,440
I gotta go.
I'm busy.

447
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:14,120
Geez, have some manners.

448
00:34:14,873 --> 00:34:15,840
I wasn't even finished

449
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:52,199
Gene.

450
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,211
Hey, ouch!,

451
00:36:54,262 --> 00:36:56,276
ouch!, shit, ouch!

452
00:36:56,317 --> 00:36:57,480
Ouch!

453
00:36:59,114 --> 00:37:00,452
Ouch!

454
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:21,143
That hurts!

455
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:47,357
Hey, that's too much.

456
00:37:47,947 --> 00:37:48,840
Let me do it.

457
00:37:50,436 --> 00:37:51,439
Stay still.

458
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:09,040
It burns!

459
00:38:15,576 --> 00:38:17,000
Ow! Right there!

460
00:38:19,678 --> 00:38:23,093
Down there, right by my fingers.

461
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,840
You're so clumsy.

462
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:31,960
Stay still.

463
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:34,400
This one is a bit sticky.

464
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,606
Ouch!

465
00:38:42,206 --> 00:38:44,120
Ouch!

466
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:46,800
My fingers too.

467
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,717
Stay still,

468
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,200
if you don't stay
still it's going to hurt.

469
00:38:53,605 --> 00:38:55,640
How can I stay still
when I hurts this much?

470
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:31,960
Enough.

471
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:35,915
Go get some rest.

472
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:37,520
I'll finish it up.

473
00:40:38,372 --> 00:40:39,240
What are you looking at?

474
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:41,891
Nothing.

475
00:40:51,543 --> 00:40:54,040
I'm already full, thanks.

476
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:57,880
Wait Gene.

477
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,368
If you're not going to sleep yet,
spray this on.

478
00:41:04,297 --> 00:41:05,662
It's extracted from butterfly pea.

479
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,160
And it helps get rid of unwanted smells.

480
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,397
No.

481
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:12,440
I've used it before and
the alcohol stung my mouth.

482
00:41:13,448 --> 00:41:14,653
I won't sting your mouth.

483
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:17,640
There's no alcohol and no sugar.

484
00:41:19,904 --> 00:41:20,900
Geez, you keep pestering me.

485
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,400
Thanks.

486
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:26,800
Gene.

487
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:29,903
What now?

488
00:41:29,943 --> 00:41:31,280
Let me see you spray it first.

489
00:41:31,545 --> 00:41:32,385
Huh?

490
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:34,520
Why do I have to show you?

491
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:36,760
You're hard headed.

492
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:41,300
I know that when you get in your room
you won't spray it,

493
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:44,240
so spray for me to see first.

494
00:41:46,328 --> 00:41:48,112
If you won't do it,

495
00:41:48,153 --> 00:41:49,200
then I'll do it for you.

496
00:42:11,847 --> 00:42:12,775
Here.

497
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:15,160
Are you happy now?

498
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,840
It smells so nice.

499
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,421
Gene.

500
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:46,520
Sweet dreams.

501
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,240
You're so clumsy.

502
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:14,000
Let me do it.

503
00:44:15,592 --> 00:44:16,556
Stay still.

504
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:22,600
Go get some rest.

505
00:44:23,162 --> 00:44:24,160
I'll finish it up.

506
00:44:24,712 --> 00:44:26,360
Can I ask you something?

507
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:30,120
How do you feel after I moved in?

508
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:49,400
Sweet dreams.

509
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:19,711
Tum.

510
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:24,240
You don't need to come
and pick up Nubsib anymore.

511
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,720
Hello?

512
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:18,823
Tum?

513
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,600
Who's number are you calling from?

514
00:46:21,847 --> 00:46:22,835
Aren't you awake yet?

515
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm in the lobby of your condo.

516
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:27,520
What?

517
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,360
Didn't you listen to
the voice text I sent?

518
00:46:32,598 --> 00:46:34,139
I dropped my phone into the water,

519
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,888
so I just bought a new phone
and I already called Nubsib.

520
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:40,774
Wait, Tum!

521
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:42,582
Come on quickly,

522
00:46:42,873 --> 00:46:43,800
I'm waiting for you downstairs.

523
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:54,858
Nubsib.

524
00:46:57,259 --> 00:46:58,295
Is there something wrong?

525
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:00,533
Did you have a bad dream?

526
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:03,127
No.

527
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:05,467
Where are you going?

528
00:47:06,164 --> 00:47:08,638
I'm going downstairs to meet Tum.

529
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,680
Do you need anything?

530
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:16,749
Nothing.

531
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:19,320
You look sleepy,

532
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:20,632
maybe you should go back to sleep.

533
00:47:20,897 --> 00:47:22,320
I'm going to go see Tum downstairs.

534
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,920
Um... Hey

535
00:47:25,636 --> 00:47:26,480
Hmm?

536
00:47:30,196 --> 00:47:31,926
Nothing. You should go.

537
00:48:05,128 --> 00:48:06,320
Is there something wrong?

538
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:10,007
Let's go Sib.

539
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,644
Pack your things so we can get going
you don't have a lot of stuff right?

540
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:13,572
Pack?

541
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,040
Why do I need to pack?

542
00:48:16,232 --> 00:48:17,800
Gene called me to pick you up.

543
00:48:18,246 --> 00:48:19,320
It's been a month.

544
00:48:19,851 --> 00:48:21,560
I already called to reserve
you a temporary room.

545
00:48:22,314 --> 00:48:24,307
Gene really likes his privacy.

546
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:25,659
You have to understand him.

547
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:27,971
He probably really doesn't
want you to bother him.

548
00:48:28,012 --> 00:48:28,920
Tum.

549
00:48:29,759 --> 00:48:31,084
You're running your mouth again

550
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,623
Why are you suddenly pissed off?

551
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,920
His personality or likes and dislikes,
I know it.

552
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:45,807
I don't need you telling me.

553
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,480
Gene... Gene...

554
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:56,080
Help me please!

555
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:00,320
Did you tell him to come down?

556
00:49:00,361 --> 00:49:02,240
I didn't!

557
00:49:05,278 --> 00:49:06,280
I came down myself.

558
00:49:07,743 --> 00:49:08,647
Aren't you sleepy?

559
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,880
I told you that you
could go back to sleep.

560
00:49:12,698 --> 00:49:13,691
I can sleep later.

561
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:15,081
I should clear this up first.

562
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,360
Come on, let's go talk upstairs.

563
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:44,360
I'm leaving now,

564
00:49:45,152 --> 00:49:46,370
so you guys go work it out.

565
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,720
Do you need me to take you downstairs?

566
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:49,144
It's okay.

567
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,680
I'm not in a rush to die.

568
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:07,978
Gene, will you be mad,

569
00:50:08,019 --> 00:50:09,640
if I stay here longer?

570
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:19,040
If you really need to
then I'm fine with it.

571
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:23,000
But for real,

572
00:50:27,234 --> 00:50:28,880
why do you want to stay here so badly?

573
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:31,342
Because...

574
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,520
I like you

575
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:57,433
Like me?

576
00:50:59,014 --> 00:50:59,854
Yes...

577
00:51:02,854 --> 00:51:04,160
I really like you.

578
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:46,551
Are you free this evening?

579
00:51:46,592 --> 00:51:48,788
Could you go help me pick out my makeup?

580
00:51:50,851 --> 00:51:52,200
Are you a hamster?

581
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,043
You can't keep it in your cheeks.

582
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,920
You know that I like Sib right?

583
00:51:58,311 --> 00:52:00,077
I think I'm going to go after him more.

584
00:52:00,213 --> 00:52:03,325
Let's get some dinner
and it's almost my birthday too.

585
00:52:03,413 --> 00:52:04,280
Dinner's on me.

586
00:52:05,286 --> 00:52:07,000
If Gene doesn't want me to go,

587
00:52:07,612 --> 00:52:08,720
then I won't go.
