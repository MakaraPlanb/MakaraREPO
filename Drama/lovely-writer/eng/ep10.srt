00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,370
(Previously On Lovely Writer)
Did you come to see me

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,750
because you are worried?

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Do you think

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,200
we should tell our parents?

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,420
Don't worry.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,720
I'll be by your side no matter what.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,350
What if the two of us are really together?

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,750
You shouldn't be angry about me on this.

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,020
If I recall correctly,

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,270
you dated boys before you met Mom.

11
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:29,320
Shut up!

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,170
I want you to go upstairs!

13
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,870
Orn.

14
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,300
Okay, the first action is to punch

15
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,100
and back.

16
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,870
And punch like this.

17
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,720
Is everyone ready?

18
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,200
Okay, let's begin.

19
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,570
Three, two, one.

20
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,450
Punch and back.

21
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,070
Punch and back.

22
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,300
Punch.

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,520
Okay. March on the spot.

24
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,300
Keep your rhythm.

25
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,220
Next action, squats.

26
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,300
Is everyone ready?

27
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,970
Three, two, one, go.

28
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,820
Squat and stretch.

29
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,800
Squat and stretch. Good.

30
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,370
Squat and stretch.

31
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,150
Squat and stretch.

32
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,900
Squat and stretch.

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,050
Two.

34
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,800
One.

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,450
Okay. March on the spot.

36
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,470
Keep your rhythm.

37
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,620
Next action, back kick.

38
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,850
Use our heels to touch our hips.

39
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,270
Ready.

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,000
Three, two, one.

41
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,070
Kick. Kick. Kick. Kick.

42
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,550
Move your arms.

43
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,300
Tuck in.

44
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,750
Move your arms.

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,720
Two, one.

46
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,150
Hello, Jap. How is everything?

47
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,470
What about your family? Is everything all right?

48
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,000
There are some minor problems.

49
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,120
I don't think it's a minor problem anymore.

50
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,900
Jap.

51
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,450
Actually, I have something to tell you.

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,370
Well...

53
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,470
What is it?

54
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,870
I was the one who asked
Nubsib and Gene to tell our parents.

55
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,470
But I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,550
I understand.

57
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,600
It's just that...

58
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,250
I don't want them to hide their relationship.

59
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,220
You don't have to blame yourself.

60
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,850
No one knows how things will turn out.

61
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,170
But, you need to give my parents some time.

62
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,720
My mother likes Gene a lot.

63
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,120
She loves him like her own son.

64
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,420
If it's me, I would be very shocked too.

65
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,620
Seeing both of my sons falling in love
with each other.

66
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,400
It's ridiculous.

67
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,720
What should we do next?

68
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,600
I don't know.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,450
All right. I'll hang up now.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,300
Call me if there's anything.

71
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,800
Okay.

72
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,020
You need to smile more.

73
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,320
Understand?

74
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,220
You are his elder brother.

75
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,050
Gene is troubled right now.

76
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,950
You need to support him.

77
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,620
I'll also take care of Nubsib here.

78
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,920
Okay. I'll leave it to you.

79
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll call you again if there's anything.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay. Let's keep in touch.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,570
♪Stop thinking. Just let me kiss you♪

82
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,470
♪Don't be afraid of love, just say it out loud♪

83
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,870
♪Just imagine♪

84
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,850
♪Before I kiss you♪

85
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,150
♪But it seems like♪

86
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,750
♪You want to kiss me too♪

87
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,850
♪I wanna kiss, kiss you♪

88
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,750
♪I wanna love, love you♪

89
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,550
♪I'm gonna kiss you♪

90
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,500
♪1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and kiss♪

91
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,470
Mom.

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,750
Gene, where are you going?

93
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:01,300
No. I didn't sleep well last night.

94
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,900
What's up?

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,270
Go out with me later then.

96
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,170
Take a seat, son.

97
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,620
Mom.

98
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,920
I want to have a talk with Dad.

99
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,970
Dad doesn't want me to be with Nubsib, right?

100
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,850
I don't know.

101
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,770
If he doesn't want me to be with Nubsib,

102
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,420
I want to hear his reasons.

103
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Gene.

104
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,500
Your father has his own reasons.

105
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,100
If you want him to understand you,

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,220
you have to understand him too.

107
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,620
I'm not saying that he is unreasonable.

108
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,550
I just want to have a chat with him.

109
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,050
Gene.

110
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,050
Give your father some time.

111
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,220
Have some tea first.

112
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:14,120
When you said you wanted to be together with Nubsib,

113
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,450
I was shocked.

114
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,300
But how I think of it isn't important.

115
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,070
Try to make this tea.

116
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,800
I'd better not.

117
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,650
The taste is so bad compared to yours.

118
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,550
Gene.

119
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,450
You should understand.

120
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,220
I can't make tea for you forever.

121
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,220
There will be a day

122
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,050
when you have to make it yourself.

123
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,120
If it's bad,

124
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:55,750
you have to find a way to make it better.

125
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,950
Do you understand what I'm saying?

126
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,470
Our family might not speak about love often,

127
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,550
but I want you to know that

128
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,420
we did what we did because we love you.

129
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,520
What's left now is more understanding.

130
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,350
Everything will get better.

131
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
I love your father.

132
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,850
I love you too.

133
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,000
I love you.

134
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,400
Why do you look so carefree?

135
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,820
Do you still remember this bonsai plant?

136
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,150
Yes.

137
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,670
Isn't this the Yu Garden Bonsai Plant
I won for you in an auction?

138
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes.

139
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,300
Didn't you want to get it badly?

140
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,200
Yes.

141
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,850
I wouldn't admit defeat.

142
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,170
It's funny now that I think about it.

143
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,220
We met at that time

144
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,700
and no one was willing to give in.

145
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,820
In the end, my flower pot
ended up with your bonsai plant.

146
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,150
Who would've imagined that?

147
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,000
If I knew about the ending,
I wouldn't be fighting with you for it.

148
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,750
If I knew it would still end up with me.

149
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,870
Why are you bringing this up suddenly?

150
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,320
We've been pruning this
bonsai plant for a long time, right?

151
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,700
Do you think

152
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,200
we should let it grow freely now?

153
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,850
Where are you?

154
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,420
Sorry.

155
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,770
My family is still...

156
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,770
It's all right.

157
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,300
I understand.

158
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,070
It's the same with my family as well.

159
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,520
I see. What about you? Is everything all right?

160
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,420
Dad still wouldn't talk to me.

161
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,470
If he doesn't agree with our relationship,

162
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,000
what will you do?

163
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,050
Will you break up with me?

164
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,070
Of course not.

165
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,420
You'll still be my boyfriend no matter what.

166
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,850
Nubsib, come here for a while.

167
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,000
I have to go downstairs.

168
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,300
I'll call you later.

169
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:57,870
Okay.

170
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,750
Sit down.

171
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:05,970
Nubsib.

172
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,370
Tell me everything honestly.

173
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,670
How did it happen between you and Gene?

174
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,850
Didn't you ask me before?

175
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,370
Why didn't I have a girlfriend?

176
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,820
Don't tell me it's because of Gene.

177
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,270
Yes.

178
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,200
I tried dating someone else

179
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,470
but it's no use.

180
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,750
Why would you be together with Gene?

181
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,200
Actually, Gene didn't remember me.

182
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,250
But I'm the male lead of his adapted series.

183
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,920
Everyone knows about that.

184
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:56,320
My manager, Tum, is Gene's friend in university.

185
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,620
He asked Gene to take care of me.

186
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,100
To be frank,

187
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,120
I don't agree with this.

188
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,500
Our family is running a business.

189
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Image and reputation are very important to us.

190
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
You should know that.

191
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,770
We need to do business with others.

192
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,900
I know.

193
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,200
But you are my son.

194
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,720
I'm also treating Gene as my son.

195
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,350
If it's already like this,

196
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,800
both your mother and I will not say anything else.

197
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,420
Even if we are going to, I'm sure you won't listen to us.

198
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,370
There will only be more arguments
if we don't allow it.

199
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,970
I don't like it too when other people force me.

200
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,870
I've talked to your mother.

201
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,800
From now on, you have to
be responsible for what you do.

202
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,100
I can't stop anything

203
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,600
concerning the love between Gene and you.

204
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,070
Thank you, Dad.

205
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,800
Thank you, Mom.

206
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,500
Look how happily you're smiling now.

207
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,150
What will you do if we don't agree?

208
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,550
That piece of land in Pattanakarn.

209
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,420
Who told you I wanted that piece of land?

210
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,650
Didn't you fail to get it?

211
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,350
Deal.

212
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,100
Get me that deal.

213
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,020
If they are willing to sell it,

214
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,170
I will no longer interfere with anything of yours.

215
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,170
Are you going back on your words?

216
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,870
So what?

217
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,920
Are you going to refuse my proposal?

218
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,020
If Uncle Teep doesn't agree,

219
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,170
you have to talk to him personally.

220
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,320
It's a deal.

221
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
Transfer the money to me.

222
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,470
I'll get you the deed.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,270
Okay. Deal.

224
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,320
I wonder from whom NubSib
inherited his personality.

225
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,100
Nubsib, this is your choice.

226
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
I love Gene like my other son.

227
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,650
Sorry.

228
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,370
I was just shocked at what happened.

229
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,900
It's fine, Mom.

230
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,770
I need to apologize to you too.

231
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,170
Take good care of Gene.

232
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,600
Have a good relationship.

233
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,700
Yes. I guarantee.

234
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
I'll definitely take good care of Gene.

235
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
Teep.

236
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,700
Where's our son?

237
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,550
He went to sleep.

238
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,720
Has he eaten anything?

239
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,120
He said he was not hungry.

240
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,620
Teep.

241
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,300
Are you all right?

242
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:07,520
I'm afraid.

243
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,150
I'm afraid that our son will experience
what I've experienced before.

244
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,820
I've been afraid of this.

245
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,920
What is there to be afraid of?

246
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,050
I want our son to have a better life.

247
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,250
A life that's better than mine.

248
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,870
I don't want others to point fingers at our son.

249
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,050
I don't want others to look down on him.

250
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,200
And I don't want them to hate him.

251
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,170
Teep.

252
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,170
Times have changed.

253
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:56,000
I know you are worried about him,

254
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,270
but if you keep this up,

255
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,850
he will keep feeling that you hate him.

256
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,170
If other people don't understand him,

257
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,270
you should know
who he wants most to understand him.

258
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,020
Teep.

259
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,220
Do you still remember the feeling at that time?

260
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,000
That was the time you wanted most.

261
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,050
Right?

262
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,470
Run.

263
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,120
I'm so afraid.

264
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,070
I love you.

265
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,370
Hello.

266
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,920
That was fast.

267
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,570
Did you miss me?

268
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:16,970
No.

269
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,220
My phone is just beside me.

270
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,200
What are you doing?

271
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,820
Are you feeling shy?

272
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,420
Shy my foot.

273
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,850
Have you eaten?

274
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,500
No.

275
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm not hungry.

276
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,250
How are you doing at the set?

277
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,370
It's still the same.

278
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:39,320
It'll be a wrap soon.

279
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,550
The shooting has ended early today.

280
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm back at home now.

281
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,020
Hold on. Someone is knocking.

282
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,850
Come in.

283
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,750
Dad.

284
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,120
What's wrong?

285
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,920
You're showing me that face when you see me?

286
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,000
Why aren't you eating?

287
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,970
I'm not hungry yet.

288
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,150
Is that the truth?
Or you just don't want to see me?

289
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,600
Gene.

290
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,150
Do you really love Nubsib?

291
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,820
Why are you asking this?

292
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,320
Just answer me.

293
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,020
Yes.

294
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,170
You should know.

295
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,150
Love is not just about two people.

296
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,850
There are many things involved.

297
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,500
Whether it's your job

298
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,770
or Nubsib's job.

299
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,250
If people see you two in a relationship,

300
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:38,400
they will blame you both.

301
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,170
Even though you say that times have changed,

302
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,900
do you really believe that's the case?

303
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,100
That is why I ask you if you really love Nubsib.

304
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,420
Nubsib is a smart kid.

305
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,420
He can solve any problem.

306
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
But you?

307
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,550
Are you prepared to face this?

308
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,920
I really want to be together with Nubsib.

309
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,820
I do envy you.

310
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,900
You are loyal to your feelings.

311
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,570
Be persistent in a relationship like this

312
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,400
and be with him forever.

313
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,870
Because I've never forgotten
about a relationship like this.

314
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,450
What about Mom?

315
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,500
It doesn't mean that I don't love your mother.

316
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,970
Right?

317
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:27,050
Gene.

318
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,750
You need to stay strong

319
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,550
and overcome any troubles.

320
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,100
Love with all your heart.

321
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,050
Even if you're destined to lose him,

322
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,800
it's fine.

323
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,500
You should know.

324
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
I love everyone in this family.

325
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,520
I will always be with you.

326
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,950
Dad, sorry.

327
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,970
Sorry for being rude to you.

328
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,270
I'm not angry at you.

329
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm happy for you.

330
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,970
You didn't choose to run away.

331
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,470
Do you remember?

332
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,500
You were stubborn when you were young.

333
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,700
Yes.

334
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,270
You are still together with Nubsib, right?

335
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,270
Yes.

336
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,620
That's Nubsib, right?

337
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,550
Hello.

338
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,000
Gene.

339
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,120
Yes.

340
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,450
I'm in front of your house.

341
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,250
Can you come down and meet me?

342
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,600
What? What did you say?

343
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,600
Hello, Uncle Teep.

344
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,700
You came as soon as I agreed.

345
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,000
Kids act so quick nowadays.

346
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:41,950
Yes.

347
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,950
Your father messaged me yesterday.

348
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,450
He has cleared all the obstacles.

349
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,050
I'll leave Gene in your care.

350
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:56,100
Yes. I'll take good care of Gene.

351
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,000
I hope you keep your promise.

352
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,350
Why are you here?

353
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,600
Sorry.

354
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,450
I was so happy when I heard that

355
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,020
and ran here unconsciously.

356
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,220
You heard everything?

357
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,070
I want to hug you.

358
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,720
Wait, this is my house.

359
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,400
I want to kiss you.

360
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,800
No.

361
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,220
Why?

362
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,500
Can't I kiss you?

363
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,800
Let's go in first.

364
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,620
(Run: Orn, our sons have made up with each other)

365
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,770
(Orn: Let's go to the aerobics class tomorrow)

366
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,470
Sorry, Dad.

367
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,770
You don't have to apologize.

368
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,700
I understand.

369
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,650
You should be better.

370
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,500
Yes.

371
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,750
I'll also work hard to be better.

372
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,320
Do you want to go back today?

373
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,350
I feel like staying for two more days.

374
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,820
You can go back first.

375
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,900
It's troublesome to go back and forth.

376
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,850
I'll wait for you to go back together.

377
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,370
Up to you.

378
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,400
How is it with the land?

379
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,070
I've made another application.

380
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,870
I think it will pass this time.

381
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,470
Are you sure?

382
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,300
Of course.

383
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,320
Don't you believe in my capabilities?

384
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,170
I do.

385
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,320
Nubsib.

386
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,300
If my father doesn't agree with our relationship,

387
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,970
what will you do?

388
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,820
Uncle Teep is a reasonable person.

389
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm sure he will understand.

390
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,200
What if it's not so simple?

391
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:52,120
Where will you get that deed in exchange?

392
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,270
Or will you get your father to talk to my Dad?

393
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,320
No.

394
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,820
Uncle Teep is not like my father.

395
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,470
He is not a businessman.

396
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,450
Uncle Teep will
not exchange his son for anything else.

397
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,870
That's because you are
far more valuable than anything else.

398
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,470
Besides, I think the same as Uncle Teep.

399
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,920
Tiffy.

400
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,170
Tiffy.

401
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:48,220
What do you want again?

402
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,550
I really like you.

403
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,470
Enough, Tum.

404
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,200
I don't think it's funny.

405
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,450
Tiffy.

406
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:10,470
I'm not joking.

407
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm serious.

408
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,870
What are you trying to do again?

409
00:44:34,070 --> 00:44:35,070
Tiffy.

410
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,650
I really like you.

411
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,220
Enough, Tum.

412
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,420
I don't think it's funny at all.

413
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,300
I'm not joking.

414
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,650
I'm serious.

415
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,450
What do you mean?

416
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:57,420
Tiffy.

417
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,420
Listen to me.

418
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,400
Enough, Tum.

419
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,520
Stop fooling around with my feelings.

420
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,600
Can you?

421
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,120
Enough.

422
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,750
I told you.

423
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,070
I'm serious.

424
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,800
But you are gay!

425
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:48,650
I'm not.

426
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:49,870
I never am.

427
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,100
Why do you think I'm gay?

428
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,900
How many times do you need me to say it?

429
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,450
I'm not gay.

430
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,470
How many times do I have to tell you I like you

431
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:00,720
for you to believe me?

432
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,400
Enough.

433
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,350
I don't want to hate you more than I do now.

434
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,120
You've always been the only person I want.

435
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,370
There were too many things I wanted
to say to you when we were together.

436
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,850
I'm willing to do anything to make you smile.

437
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,200
When you put on makeup or lipstick,

438
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,600
and when you hold my hand or approach me,

439
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,020
I miss every moment.

440
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:54,670
Even if there's only a slight chance.

441
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,170
What if I'm gay?

442
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,850
Am I wrong to like you?

443
00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:59,850
I only want you to know my feelings.

444
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:01,420
I like you even though I look gay.

445
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,700
Why don't you understand?

446
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,900
Will you believe me now?

447
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:24,720
I can believe you.

448
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,420
You rap well.

449
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,070
Me?

450
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:57,050
I used to go on a program.

451
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:58,420
What kind of program?

452
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,420
Do you want to watch it? I can take you.

453
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,420
Are you going to behave like that now?

454
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:03,870
Do you want to?

455
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:05,750
In a room.

456
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,850
To watch me rap.

457
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,500
Hold it.

458
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,700
Don't you want to?

459
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:13,220
What?

460
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,420
Gene, what are you doing?

461
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,600
I'm posting a story on Instagram.

462
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,650
The first episode is airing today.

463
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,320
Why don't you dry your hair?

464
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:53,320
It will dry naturally.

465
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,700
Let's watch the series first.

466
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,450
Watch it later.

467
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,220
Take a picture for me.

468
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:05,820
Tum wants to help the client promote on Instagram.

469
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,020
Sure.

470
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:09,550
Can you wait for a while?

471
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,800
Let me finish this episode.

472
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:31,980
(Is Gene watching?)
(Whose voice is that? Sounds familiar)

473
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:33,900
(It's Nubsib. So they are together.)

474
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:41,700
Are you watching the television
or playing with your phone?

475
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,970
Watching the television.

476
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:59,670
That's your friend, Aey.

477
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,850
I know.

478
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,620
Senior.

479
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,570
What is it?

480
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,020
This male lead is so fierce.

481
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,770
I wonder who played him.

482
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,950
Yes.

483
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:34,820
I wonder who wrote it.

484
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,350
Why aren't you focusing?

485
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,320
Do you want to watch the re-run?

486
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,050
Why?

487
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,870
It's your own series.

488
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,700
You should watch it.

489
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:01,420
When my boyfriend is acting one day,

490
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,220
I'll definitely finish the series
without shifting my attention.

491
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,720
You're joking again.

492
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,120
What's wrong?

493
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,220
Are you shy?

494
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,150
You brat.

495
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:27,950
Sorry.

508
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,250

00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,050
No.

562
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,600
Hey, Nubsib.

563
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:00,470
Your mask will fall!

564
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,600
My face is all wet!

565
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:09,420
(Coming Out is Not Honesty)

566
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,620
What are you doing?

567
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,570
I'm writing the setting about announcing
to come out in front of the family.

568
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,700
You're not writing a sex scene?

569
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,420
I want to help you with that.

570
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,570
That's nonsense.

571
00:55:58,450 --> 00:56:00,170
How can you be so cute?

572
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,420
Cute my foot.

573
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm working right now.

574
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:17,950
Nubsib, it's ticklish.

575
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,170
Stop.

576
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:24,950
Your phone?

577
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:25,920
Yes.

578
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,400
What is it?

579
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:40,050
Are you free to speak?

580
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,300
Yes.

581
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:43,500
It's like this.

582
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,370
Have you seen Twitter?

583
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,470
Yes.

584
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:50,950
Everyone is saying it's your voice.

585
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,670
Tam is not okay with it.

586
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,750
But I've explained it for you.

587
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:55,970
I said I was there too.

588
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:56,820
Okay.

589
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,920
You should be more careful.

590
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,620
You should know how Tam is.

591
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,720
Thank you.

592
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,800
Is there anything else?

593
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:07,950
If you don't, I'll...

594
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,050
Wait, why are you in a rush?

595
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,070
What is it?

596
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,870
It's about the summer shoot.

597
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,570
It's confirmed for the 6th of this month.

598
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,500
I've already arranged

599
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,270
the flight tickets and hotel.

600
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,850
Thank you.

601
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,150
Can you book an extra room for me?

602
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,870
For Gene?

603
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,950
Yes.

604
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,620
What if someone sees you two
in the same room?

605
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:36,050
I'm telling you.

606
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,850
Be wary of the staff.

607
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:43,900
I'll just book a room
that's far away from everyone else.

608
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,370
Sure. That works.

609
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:47,420
It's safer.

610
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,420
I'll arrange it.

611
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,150
Thank you.

612
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,970
Was that Tum?

613
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,350
Yes.

614
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,020
What is it?

615
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,520
I have a photoshoot at the beach on the 6th.

616
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:09,120
You should come together.

617
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,420
Me?

618
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,200
What am I going there for?

619
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,200
Aren't you going to work?

620
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:30,770
I'm not shooting for the whole day.

621
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:32,850
Let's go together.

622
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,420
Let's go together.

623
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,320
Don't you want to play at the beach?

624
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,170
The beach?

625
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,070
All right? Just go.

626
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:50,920
Let's go together.

627
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,200
To be honest, I'm lazy to go out.

628
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,100
Whatever.

629
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,950
I can go with you.

630
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,570
Nubsib, enough.

631
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:09,770
Let me finish my work.

632
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:10,650
Let's go together.

633
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,470
Fine. I'll go.

634
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:44,520
(Gene: I'm here. I'm waiting for Hin)

635
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,750
(Nubsib: All right)

636
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:53,420
Hello. It's been so long.

637
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,150
I miss you a lot.

638
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,420
Forget it.

639
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,100
Are you sending the picture to Nubsib?

640
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:02,650
Mind your own business.

641
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:03,950
So fierce.

642
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:07,400
Gene, Nubsib belongs to me.

643
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,300
Just take him away.

644
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,650
You said it.

645
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,050
Don't regret if I steal him away.

646
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,470
You are so annoying.

647
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,800
By the way, how's your draft?

648
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,300
It's almost done.

649
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:26,600
It's coming to an end.

650
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,420
How many chapters are you
going to write for the spin-off?

651
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:31,500
What about five to six chapters?

652
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,770
It's just right.

653
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,200
It's about that many, I guess.

654
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,270
But the spin-off needs some sex scenes.

655
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,220
Write a couple in.

656
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,550
What? You want a couple of sex scenes?

657
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,400
Yes. What's wrong?

658
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,350
If you can complete it before the 18th,

659
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,320
you can enter the book fair with your draft.

660
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,970
Okay.

661
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,020
Bua also said

662
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,650
the sex scenes have to be
as hot and juicy as possible.

663
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:10,670
What's wrong?

664
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,820
Why are you giving me that look?

665
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,300
This is a spin-off.

666
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,520
The sex scenes must be hotter than usual.

667
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,720
All right. I understand.

668
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,470
But I don't know how to write it to good effect

669
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,970
and tie it in with the main storyline.

670
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:30,670
Try it.

671
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:32,770
Send it to Bua.

672
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,970
Maybe she can make adjustments for you.

673
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:39,520
Okay.

674
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,100
Oh, Gene.

675
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,050
Did you receive the draft I sent you?

676
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,020
I'm not confident.

677
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:56,870
Hin.

678
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,250
To be honest,

679
01:01:58,350 --> 01:01:59,750
I have no time to read it.

680
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,120
Why don't you upload it onto the internet?

681
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,500
What? Upload it?

682
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:07,450
Yes.

683
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:09,050
Is that good?

684
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,270
Of course.

685
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:12,200
I used to do that too.

686
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,000
Don't you remember?

687
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:16,870
Okay.

688
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,670
I'll try...

689
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,170
What's wrong?

690
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,470
Why are you here?

691
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:30,470
You are the one who sent the picture.

692
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:34,800
You know where I am
from the picture of the cake?

693
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,250
This area is close to my university.

694
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,970
I know all of the shops here.

695
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:44,700
Well, well, well.
You two are sticking together like glue.

696
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:46,470
Hin, shut up.

697
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,150
Why don't you let Nubsib
help you out with the sex scenes?

698
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:50,450
Hin!

699
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,850
What?

700
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:55,520
What scenes?

701
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:58,870
No.

702
01:02:59,020 --> 01:02:59,820
It's nothing.

703
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,400
Nubsib, finish this cake for me.

704
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:08,250
Are you going to feed me?

705
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,350
No.

706
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,400
Eat it yourself.

707
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,800
I won't eat it if you don't feed me.

708
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:17,550
Forget it then.

709
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,350
Pay for me and Hin.

710
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,750
Sure.

711
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,750
Even if you eat a few more, I'll still pay for you.

712
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,070
Miss, give me 20 boxes of cake, please.

713
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,550
I'm sorry, Hin.

714
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:33,400
You're not Gene.

715
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,870
That's so mean.

716
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,400
I'm just joking.

717
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:41,220
What did I do wrong?

718
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,470
Nubsib.

719
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,170
Are you done?

720
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,270
We will be late.

721
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:09,750
I'm done.

722
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,520
Let's go.

723
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,100
We will miss the plane if there's a traffic jam.

724
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:18,750
Wait.

725
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,000
Did you forget anything?

726
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:24,150
No.

727
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:27,200
But you look more excited than me.

728
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:29,650
Are you mad?

729
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,000
Who's excited?

730
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,600
I'm just afraid of being late.

731
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:35,650
Wait.

732
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:37,770
We are going to the beach together.

733
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,720
The sun is bright. Don't forget to apply this.

734
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:47,570
No.

735
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,570
I don't like to apply stuff like this.

736
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:51,720
It's sticky.

737
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,870
I might be allergic too.

738
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:54,800
Trust me.

739
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:56,570
The things I tell you are good

740
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:58,000
will definitely be good.

741
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,270
It won't cause an allergic reaction.

742
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:01,900
All right?

743
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:38,920
It's done.

744
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,170
You have to use it when I'm not around too.

745
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,650
I don't want the UV rays
to take your cuteness away.

746
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,520
I'm going to vomit.

747
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:54,570
Let's go. We'll be late.

748
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,020
Hurry up.

749
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,350
Where are you going?

750
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,550
Why aren't you going to work?

751
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:33,400
I'm going.

752
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:35,000
Where are you going?

753
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:38,020
I'm going to the sea.

754
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,670
Didn't I text you?

755
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,850
Can't you wait until it's not so sunny?

756
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,820
I've used sunscreen.

757
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:51,900
But you are going without me.

758
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,850
So, you won't let me go?

759
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,600
Wait for me.

760
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,700
I'll finish at 5 PM.

761
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:03,550
All right?

762
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,100
There's that cute expression again.

763
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,050
I've told you not to be so cute.

764
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:16,770
Seriously.

765
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,300
Come on!

766
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,270
Nubsib. Gene.

767
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:24,770
Be careful, both of you.

768
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:26,200
I'm going crazy.

769
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,270
What will you do if I'm not the one passing by?

770
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,520
It's not bad.

771
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,350
Nubsib!

772
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,820
You jerk!

773
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,050
Your actor doesn't allow me to play at the sea.

774
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,200
Are you done?

775
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,400
Yes.

776
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,050
Thank you for paying for my room.

777
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:43,300
The room is more comfortable now.

778
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:45,470
You're welcome.

779
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,350
Gene, what did you say?

780
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,450
It's nothing.

781
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,650
Okay. Let's go.

782
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,670
The crew is waiting.

783
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,050
Let's go.

784
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,600
Wait for me.

785
01:08:01,350 --> 01:08:02,520
I'll play with you.

786
01:08:04,070 --> 01:08:05,020
Okay?

787
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,920
Hey, seriously.

788
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:22,350
Good. Good. Good.

789
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,870
Change another pose.

790
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:29,600
Very good.

791
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,570
Another pose. Another one.

792
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,700
Okay.

793
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,770
Wait.

794
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,900
Give him a touch-up.

795
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,470
I'll give you a touch-up.

796
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,520
-Nubsib.
-Yes.

797
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,500
What is it?

798
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,550
What are you looking at? Is there anything?

799
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:00,550
No.

800
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,570
Please look up then.

801
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:32,200
How is it, Hin?

802
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,300
Have you uploaded your work to the internet?

803
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:39,520
I haven't seen it yet.

804
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:42,400
I've decided not to write it.

805
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:44,800
Why?

806
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,270
I feel stressed.

807
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,150
I haven't finished it yet.

808
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,750
You can just upload it first.

809
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,470
Upload it while writing.

810
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,650
You've uploaded it, haven't you?

811
01:10:05,570 --> 01:10:06,300
Yes.

812
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:11,070
Did someone criticize your novel?

813
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,000
Yes.

814
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,850
Not many people read it either.

815
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,070
Most of the readers are criticizing me.

816
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:22,370
How do you feel now?

817
01:10:25,250 --> 01:10:26,570
I don't want to write it anymore.

818
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,720
Hin.

819
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,850
Think about it.

820
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,920
Do you still want to be a writer?

821
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Yes.

822
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,400
But seeing what's happening now,

823
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:43,500
I think I might not be suitable to become a writer.

824
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:50,450
Did anyone praise it after you upload your novel?

825
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,670
Yes.

826
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:53,870
But it's not a lot.

827
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,650
You see that?

828
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,170
At least there are some people who like it.

829
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,700
-But...
-How about this?

830
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:03,220
Read your own novel again.

831
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:07,820
But you need to read it
like how you were reading mine.

832
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:09,220
Understand?

833
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,400
What do you mean?

834
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,620
When you were reading my novel,

835
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:16,920
you were from a reader's point of view.

836
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:18,750
You could see my blind spot.

837
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:20,970
When you've seen the blind spot,

838
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:22,700
you won't feel stressed anymore.

839
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,200
Do you still remember
the first time you work for me?

840
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,950
You found many blind spots

841
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,900
when you read my novel.

842
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,800
Thanks to you,

843
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:33,170
my novel got approved.

844
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:35,220
But that's different.

845
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,070
I know it's different,

846
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,070
but have you tried it?

847
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,250
Not yet.

848
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:44,970
See?

849
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:47,250
Give it a try.

850
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,170
If it doesn't work, I'll help you.

851
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,420
There must be a way.

852
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:55,720
Okay. I'll give it a try.

853
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,420
Thank you.

854
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:02,150
Show it to Bua when you've finished.

855
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,870
You might get it published.

856
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,520
You are not an outsider anyway.

857
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,200
It should be easy.

858
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,320
Get it published? I don't think I'm that good.

859
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:18,520
Don't underestimate yourself.

860
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,450
Give it a try.

861
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:21,800
Trust me.

862
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,650
Gene.

863
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:27,170
Do you believe that I can make it?

864
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,150
Of course, I do.

865
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,750
Why did I say it otherwise?

866
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:34,720
Don't underestimate yourself.

867
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:36,420
Be confident.

868
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:38,520
Don't give up.

869
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:40,970
Bye.

870
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:42,250
Thank you, Gene.

871
01:12:53,150 --> 01:12:54,170
That's so bad.

872
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,770
Be more careful.

873
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:31,400
Language isn't stable.

874
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,870
Mixed-up logic.

875
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:44,200
The first part is too short.

876
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:23,070
You're here?

877
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,900

Is it because of the #SibGene topic?

924
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,320
I'm worried about you.

928
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:06,150
I was pressured by the
production company of the series.

929
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:08,020
They want me to take care of my own authors.

930
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,300
