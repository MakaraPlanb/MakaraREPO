00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,775
(Previously On Lovely Writer)
Look around you.

2
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:10,600
They did nothing but they have been affected.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,775
I need to apologize to everyone.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,475
I didn't expect this to blow up so quickly.

5
00:00:15,475 --> 00:00:18,975
I hope that Nubsib and Gene
stay away from each other.

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,125
I'm disappointed in you.

7
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,125
You are too selfish.

8
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,875
Don't you get it?

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:28,650
You should be with Aey, not me!

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,975
I beg you, Gene.

11
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:31,350
Don't leave. Okay?

12
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,375
Let's end it, Nubsib.

13
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:38,450
Gene, I beg you!

14
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,025
Gene.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,500
Are you okay?

16
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:14,750
Why did you come here?

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,870
I'm here to fetch you to the press conference.

18
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:24,100
What about Nubsib?

19
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:26,600
Nubsib is already there.

20
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:28,350
He is doing his make-up.

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,125
I didn't see you.

22
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,675
I was worried and came to find you.

23
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,400
Okay.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,850
Get ready.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,575
There's a traffic jam today.
We might not make it on time.

26
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,675
Gene.

27
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,925
Gene, are you all right?

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,075
Yes.

29
00:01:56,775 --> 00:02:00,025
Oh. Nubsib was right.

30
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:02,150
My sister wants to extend his contract.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,875
She has planned everything.

32
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,775
She had a talk with the TV station directors.

33
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:11,950
She wants Nubsib and Aey to be
the double male leads in the next series.

34
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,400
With that, the TV station
will make a profit for a long time.

35
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:21,750
Tum, it's too late.

36
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:23,775
Forget it.

Nubsib.

44
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,075
-I...
-Aren't you going to celebrate?

45
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,575
I didn't make this happen on purpose.

46
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,675
Someone like you

47
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:06,375
didn't do it on purpose?

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,400
If I still have a bit of strength left,

49
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,925
I would've already punched you in the face.

50
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

51
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,825
See?

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,950
You did do it on purpose.

53
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,025
Sorry.

54
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,850
Aey, I understand.

55
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,025
You want everyone to care about you.

56
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,950
But do you need to do it to this extent?

57
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,450
What you have today

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,925
comes from hurting others.

59
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,900
You are proud of it, right?

60
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,325
Wait.

61
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:10,000
We are not done yet.

62
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:12,825
We are done.

63
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:14,625
Not yet.

64
00:06:16,925 --> 00:06:20,500
I will help you with this.

65
00:06:26,175 --> 00:06:27,075
Thanks.

66
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,550
That's enough, Aey.

67
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,550
Don't worry that I'll hate you.

68
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:46,650
Don't worry that
I won't be "loving" you anymore.

69
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,025
I can act.

70
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:50,425
I'm a professional.

71
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,175
See?

72
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:53,975
I "love" you to death.

73
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:24,550
How was that?

74
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,600
Is it good enough for you?

75
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,100
Gene.

76
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,000
Gene.

77
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:39,900
Gene!

78
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:42,725
What?

79
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,025
My friend.

80
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,925
Are you ready?

81
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,200
Yes.

82
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,550
Let's go.

83
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,900
I'll take you to the press conference.

84
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,250
It should be ready.

85
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,241
(#SAGMustSpeakTheTruth)
(Aey, you are the best)

86
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:42,850
(I won't watch the series
if they can't give an explanation)

87
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,452
(It's trending)
(I support every staff member)

88
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:47,800
(When is it starting? I can't wait for it to start)

(Production team, do your best)

90
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,775
(Aey, I'll always support you)
(Everyone can't wait for it to start)

91
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,825
Tiffy, are you all right?

92
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,225
Aey.

93
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:40,200
Take care of yourself in the future.

94
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,650
Why?

95
00:10:50,925 --> 00:10:52,675
I will not be your manager anymore.

96
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,500
So,

97
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm taking care of you for the last day today.

98
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,800
Tiffy, what did I do wrong?

99
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:06,950
What did I do wrong?

100
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,400
Tell me.

101
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,825
Am I not paying you enough?

102
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,425
I'll pay you 30%.

103
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,325
35% works too.

104
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:25,675
40%! Please don't abandon me.

105
00:11:28,225 --> 00:11:29,350
Okay, Tiffy?

106
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,350
It's not about the money.

107
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,050
You should know.

108
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,175
Tiffy.

109
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,575
Don't abandon me. I beg you.

110
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,350
Aey, don't cry.

111
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,150
Or your make-up will smear and run.

112
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,675
Don't you hate that?

113
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:00,600
I'm leaving.

114
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,725
Oh, Aey.

115
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,425
Wipe your tears.

116
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,625
We'll go out together.

117
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:16,750
It's ready outside.

118
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,875
Friends from the media. Hello, everyone.

119
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:41,275
Today, the staff members
and cast of "Bad Engineer The Series"

120
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,450
has organized this press conference

121
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,075
because the rumours on social media

122
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:51,325
have caused trouble for everyone.

123
00:13:51,325 --> 00:13:53,775
The press conference today

124
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:56,000
is to clarify the situation.

125
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,350
Before that, please allow us
to do a self-introduction.

126
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,775
I am Fah Sirinapha.

127
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,425
I'm the producer of this series.

128
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,200
I am Aey. I play Namcha in the series.

129
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,450
I am Nubsib. I play Kin in the series.

130
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,525
I am Gene, the author
of the novel "Bad Engineer".

131
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,600
I am Tam. I am Nubsib's manager.

132
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:29,975
Next, we will be hearing
the truth from the three of them.

133
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,325
If you have any questions, you may ask them.

134
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,000
Please take turns so they can hear your questions.

135
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,375
-Let me ask first.
-Sure.

136
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:55,075
How did the relationship between
Mr. Nubsib and Mr. Gene get so close?

137
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,075
My relationship is close with Nubsib

138
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,175
because I'm the author of the novel.

139
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,300
The production team wants me
to coordinate the characters better

140
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,400
so my relationship is good
with the male lead, Nubsib.

141
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,650
Yes.

142
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:34,175
We did invite Mr. Gene to help
our actors with character coordination.

143
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:38,325
Are you only close with Nubsib?

144
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,175
My relationship with Gene is close too.

145
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:47,550
They are close...

146
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,150
Regarding Aey's live broadcast

147
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,400
that caused a stir on the internet,

148
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,675
someone said you did it to
clear the rumour about SibGene couple.

149
00:16:00,675 --> 00:16:02,125
What do you have to say about that?

150
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,725
Before that,

151
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,950
I want to apologize for doing
a live broadcast due to my foolishness.

152
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,475
I didn't expect things to turn out like this.

153
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,175
It's all my fault.

154
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,875
If I can turn back time,

155
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,575
I will never do that.

156
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,325
There are rumours saying that Mr. Gene
and Mr. Nubsib are staying together.

157
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,800
Is that true?

158
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,100
What's going on?

159
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,175
What happened?

160
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:00,325
Yes.

161
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,350
We are staying at the same house.

162
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,500
How did Nubsib end up
staying together with Mr.Gene?

163
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,750
I had a problem with the talent agency's dorm.

164
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,225
Allow me to answer that question.

165
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,450
There was an issue within our talent agency.

166
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,375
Due to the increase of our talents,

167
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,525
we didn't have enough dorms
to provide for our talents.

168
00:17:29,525 --> 00:17:31,475
So, we lacked dorms at the time

169
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,525
and needed to find Nubsib a new place to stay.

170
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:40,125
Fortunately, we were close with Mr. Gene.

171
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:43,950
That was why Mr. Gene lent Nubsib a helping hand.

172
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,100
That was why Nubsib got to stay
at his house while filming the series.

173
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:51,075
I hope all of you can understand.

174
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,075
They were staying under one roof after all.

175
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:54,500
It's not weird for them
to enter or leave the place together.

176
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,400
Right?

177
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:02,225
Let me ask a question
that everyone is curious about.

178
00:18:02,225 --> 00:18:06,950
What is the relationship
between Mr. Gene and Mr. Nubsib?

179
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,550
What is the relationship? Please answer.

180
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,625
Please answer the question.

181
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,125
There is nothing between us.

182
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,900
Mr. Gene and I

183
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,850
are like brothers.

184
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:05,850
Yes.

185
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,575
We are just brothers.

186
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,850
Really?

187
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,975
Why did you look so shocked then?

188
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:18,900
Sorry.

189
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm not a star.

190
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:25,000
I've never participated
in a press conference like this.

191
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,450
Actually,

192
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,450
Mr. Gene and Tam's brother,
which is my manager, Tum,

193
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,850
are friends.

194
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,975
So, we used to be together in public

195
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,425
and caused a misunderstanding.

196
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,700
I wanna say sorry to everyone right here, right now.

197
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,150
That includes the fans of the novel as well.

198
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,300
Don't worry.

199
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:52,250
No matter what, Aey and I are a couple now.

200
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,825
Gene, please smile at the reporters.

201
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,600
(Four Months Later)

202
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,525
(Bua)

203
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,875
Hello, Bua.

204
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,200
Hin, come over here.

205
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,025
I have something urgent to tell you.

206
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,950
Okay. I'll go there immediately.

207
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:58,700
What is this?

208
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:03,625
-Resignation...
-A merit envelope.

209
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,075
Right?

210
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,675
That's definitely what a white envelope is for.

211
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm someone who likes to do merit.

212
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:18,375
Here you go.

213
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:25,350
By the way, why did you call me here?

214
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,950
Oh, I want to tell you.

215
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,925
The novel you wrote

216
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,300
is going to be published.

217
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,975
What?

218
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:36,925
The parts where I've marked in red concern me.

219
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:39,325
Please amend it for me.

220
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,150
By the way, where did you get this draft?

221
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,425
I got it from Gene.

222
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,825
He brought it to me when I called him here.

223
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,150
Thank you for giving me an opportunity.

224
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,475
I'm very happy.

225
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:05,250
Your novel talks about what
happens in a publishing company.

226
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,425
I like it.

227
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:07,925
Thank you so much, Bua.

228
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:13,625
Oh, Hin.

229
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,900
Did you talk to Gene recently?

230
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,300
I didn't talk much to him recently.

231
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,550
Is that so?

232
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,275
Please ask him to send me his draft.

233
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,550
It's been four months
since he sent me a draft last time.

234
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,475
Pass this message to him.

235
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:34,950
Tell him I understand that he wants
to say something through this novel

236
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,575
and tell him that I'm sorry.

237
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:41,675
I apologize for the things I did to him.

238
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,200
Okay?

239
00:24:47,925 --> 00:24:51,025
Okay, I'll tell him that.

240
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,050
Good.

241
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:54,775
Thank you.

242
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:01,125
Hin, wait! I want that envelope back.

243
00:25:04,175 --> 00:25:04,950
Yes, the envelope.

244
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,025
Bring it here.

245
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,650
Why are you hesitating?

246
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,500
We must put our names for merit.

247
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:20,100
Bua Bua and Fam.

248
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,375
Amitabha.

249
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:36,900
I'll send your merit immediately.

250
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,625
Great.

251
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,550
I've fulfilled my merit.

252
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,025
Buddha will bless you.

253
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,600
Have a nice day.

254
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:36,400
(Hin: I'm heading over to your apartment)

255
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:18,950
(The Final Chapter)

256
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,350
Why are you so fast?

257
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,100
I was already downstairs when I texted you.

258
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,775
You don't have to text me if you are already here.

259
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,150
My room is quite messy.

260
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,350
I haven't tidied the place yet.

261
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,800
What smell is that?

262
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,150
Don't overreact.

263
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,750
It's not that bad, isn't it?

264
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,525
So, why did you come here?

265
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,875
Oh, it's about your novel.

266
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,575
Bua asked me to follow up on you.

267
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,450
Oh, she also said sorry.

268
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:38,850
She is sorry for what happened.

269
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,700
She also said you can
write the novel in any way you like.

270
00:28:43,725 --> 00:28:46,400
It's fine even if there are no sex scenes.

271
00:28:51,075 --> 00:28:52,275
As you can see,

272
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,550
I did my best.

273
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,025
I can't write anything.

274
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,125
Why?

275
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,550
Maybe I can't get myself immersed in the story.

276
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,225
Immersed?

277
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:08,925
You couldn't write it because
you can't immerse yourself in the story?

278
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,525
Are you too free?

279
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,050
It's not funny at all.

280
00:29:12,275 --> 00:29:16,325
I was just joking, Gene.

281
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,200
It's a joke.

282
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:29,700
-Gene.
-Yes?

283
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:33,775
I want to drink coffee. Make me a cup of coffee.

284
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh, are you my boss now?

285
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,275
Am I your lackey?

286
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,725
But you helped to give my draft to Bua.

287
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,125
I did it as an act of kindness.

288
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:51,800
You found out?

289
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,475
Yes.

290
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,300
Do you know?
My novel is going to be published soon.

291
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:01,850
Really?

292
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,100
Yes!

293
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,375
Congratulations.

294
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,075
I'm so excited.

295
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,475
Thank you.

296
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,575
I'm really grateful.

297
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,550
Can you stop looking so touched?

298
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,525
I'm not acting.

299
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:16,800
Without you,

300
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,425
my novel might not even be published.

301
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:23,000
Also, if you didn't call me that day,

302
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,925
I would've stopped writing it.

303
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,550
It's all because of you.

304
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:35,350
Oh, don't cry.

305
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,400
Who is crying? I haven't cried yet.

306
00:30:40,625 --> 00:30:44,825
Hin, do you know?

307
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,725
Actually,

308
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,625
you are the one who didn't give up.

309
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,325
You did this on your own.

310
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,025
I didn't help you at all.

311
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,675
Do you still remember?

312
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,725
You have always been helping me.

313
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:05,750
If it wasn't for you,

314
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,800
I won't be where I am today.

315
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,975
Both of us

316
00:31:11,325 --> 00:31:13,125
have always been helping each other.

317
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,475
Are you going to give up on this novel then?

318
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,650
Hey, are you lecturing me with my own words?

319
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:22,800
No.

320
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,375
It was just a random question.

321
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:29,625
It's not that I want to give it up.

322
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,700
When I think of writing it, I'll...

323
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,500
Then,

324
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,225
do you need to change your environment?

325
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,025
For example, writing at home.

326
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:50,100
Forget it.

327
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,050
Come on, give it a try.

328
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,200
Maybe it's better.

329
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,825
Try to go back to where the story started.

330
00:31:57,525 --> 00:31:59,850
Are you using my words on me again?

331
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,125
No.

332
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:02,675
I just want you to give it a try.

333
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,650
Okay, I'll consider your advice.

334
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:17,250
Okay, I'll be going back then.

335
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,025
What's the rush?

336
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,650
Let's eat together.

337
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:22,600
My treat.

338
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,125
No. I'll eat with you next time.

339
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,675
I have to amend the draft for Bua.

340
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,775
Oh, you are rejecting my invitation now.

341
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,725
You've really improved a lot.

342
00:32:33,725 --> 00:32:35,675
Of course.

343
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,900
I'm no longer who I used to be.

344
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,600
That's right. You need to get my autograph first.

345
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,875
You won't get a chance otherwise.

346
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,900
If my novel becomes popular,

347
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,050
it will be difficult for you to get my autograph.

348
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,325
You need a beating.

349
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,600
It's a joke.

350
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:02,925
That's right.

351
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,925
Did you contact Nubsib?

352
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,150
Thank you for your gifts, my fans!

353
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
This...

354
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,525
I'll finish all of them later.

355
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:10,450
Let's see if it's delicious.

356
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:17,375
Also, thank you for always supporting me

357
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:21,800
when I'm in pain, when I'm sad
and when I'm feeling dejected.

358
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,425
My motivation to work comes from all my fans.

359
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,700
No matter what, don't forget me

360
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,200
and please don't abandon me.

361
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:42,150
Oh, it's already so late.

362
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,575
I'll be going off now.

363
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:48,225
I'll see you guys again tomorrow at 9 p.m..

364
00:34:48,225 --> 00:34:50,250
I'll try my best to be on time.

365
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,375
If I'm late...

366
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,100
If I'm late, I'll receive a punishment tomorrow.

367
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,800
That's all for today. Bye.

368
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,174
(Please do a longer broadcast next time)
(I feel empty after the series ended)

369
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:24,775
(Aey is so cute. I will follow
@AEY_ATHIKAN forever and be your fans)

370
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:28,971
(Aey, always be happy)
(Aey, I miss you. Do more broadcasts)

371
00:35:29,051 --> 00:35:33,325
(Mhok has a new drama.
When will Aey have a new drama?)

372
00:38:39,225 --> 00:38:40,550
Come in.

373
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:51,025
-Sister.
-Yes?

374
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:52,325
I need to talk to you.

375
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,425
Say it.

376
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:05,025
Hurry up.

377
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,800
I don't have a whole day's time for you, Tum.

378
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,750
I'm resigning.

379
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,725
No way. Resigning after a minor issue...

380
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,125
We don't have any binding contract.

381
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,075
You don't have to pressure me.

382
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,750
Are you for real?

383
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:28,375
Just tell me what you want.

384
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:31,125
It doesn't have to be like this.

385
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,150
I've told you what I want.

386
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,775
Can you stop acting like a child, Tum?

387
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,375
That is why I'm resigning.

388
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,925
I'm a child. I'll forever be a child in your eyes.

389
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,100
Leaving here

390
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,800
will let me grow into an adult.

391
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:50,925
You can't abandon me like this.

392
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,250
We built this company together.

393
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,300
How can the company operate without you?

394
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:01,400
Sister, don't try to act
how important I am to you here.

395
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,325
No matter what, you can still
find someone to replace me.

396
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,050
How are you not important?

397
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:09,875
You have always been important to the company.

398
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,350
No one can be compared to you
no matter what, Tum.

399
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:13,950
Stop being so petty.

400
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,475
You are lying.

401
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:18,375
I'm not lying. I'm telling the truth.

402
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,450
If I'm that important,
did you even listen to my opinions?

403
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,425
You have been forcing me.

404
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,825
Since I was in elementary school,
you've been forcing me.

405
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,100
When I started work,

406
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,475
you asked me to resign to help you out in the company

407
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,625
so you could keep forcing me.

408
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:41,725
I want my own life. Do you understand?

409
00:40:46,925 --> 00:40:48,300
The reason why I'm important

410
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,775
is that I still have to listen to you in the end.

411
00:40:52,425 --> 00:40:53,475
It's because of that, right?

412
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,250
That is why you said I was not like others.

413
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:57,200
Why did you listen to me then?

414
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,350
Because I love you!

415
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,700
What about you? Can you see that?

416
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,650
I can!

417
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,750
I'm begging you, all right?

418
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,850
I beg you to let me live my own life.

419
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,250
I'm worried about you, Tum.

420
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,525
You are weak.

421
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,025
Both of us are weak, Sister!

422
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,375
Am I right?

423
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:47,100
Since you dare talk to me like that,

424
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,250
I won't stop you
if you want to resign from my company.

425
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,450
You came here just to say that?

426
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,450
You may leave now.

427
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,550
Wait.

428
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,100
Remember one thing.

429
00:42:28,825 --> 00:42:30,475
You will still be my brother no matter what.

430
00:43:21,775 --> 00:43:22,525
Hello.

431
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,650
I've settled things over here.

432
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:29,275
Okay.

433
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,175
What are you going to do next?

434
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,250
I don't know yet. Can you give me some time?

435
00:43:35,625 --> 00:43:38,400
Okay. You'll be fine, right?

436
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,450
I'm fine. Don't worry.

437
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,350
Take care of yourself.

438
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,475
What's wrong? You look annoyed.

439
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:49,850
I can't write anything.

440
00:44:51,075 --> 00:44:52,400
What are you going to do then?

441
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:54,925
I don't know.

442
00:45:02,675 --> 00:45:04,325
Oh, Jap.

443
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:05,925
Yes?

444
00:45:06,475 --> 00:45:07,875
Did Nubsib come back?

445
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,400
Gene.

446
00:45:28,675 --> 00:45:29,125
What?

447
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,850
Your novel. Where did your inspiration come from?

448
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,775
From my own life.

449
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,650
If it's from your own life,

450
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,350
why don't you go to the places in your memories?

451
00:45:45,925 --> 00:45:47,800
-The places in my memories?
-Yes.

452
00:45:49,025 --> 00:45:52,300
Come on. Maybe you'll find something great.

453
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,325
We have to be quick.

454
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,450
Is the opponent hacking?

455
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,700
I'm sure they are using cheats.

456
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,575
Shoot, there are three of them.

457
00:46:31,475 --> 00:46:32,925
We are doomed.

458
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:34,525
Get ready to die.

459
00:46:40,125 --> 00:46:42,950
Jap, go to the other side. Why are you hitting me?

460
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:44,600
Take another route.

461
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,525
I was hiding and got spotted.

462
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,125
I escaped.

463
00:47:00,175 --> 00:47:03,425
Jap, I think I heard footsteps just now.

464
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:04,775
Something's wrong with your ears, Gene.

465
00:47:04,775 --> 00:47:06,550
Don't disturb me. I'm trying to focus.

466
00:47:07,175 --> 00:47:09,900
Maybe it's Nubsib. If he knows we sneaked out...

467
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,300
It's fine, Gene. It's just a prank.

468
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,950
Besides, he is too young. He can't play with us.

469
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:16,475
We are not kids.

470
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:18,425
Do you think we should play
a childish game like hide-and-seek?

471
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:20,900
Darn. Jap, run.

472
00:47:22,175 --> 00:47:23,500
Careful, on your right.

473
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:28,250
I know.

474
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,550
The enemy is coming. Hide.

475
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,475
Let him go.

476
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,425
Oh, thank you.

477
00:48:32,425 --> 00:48:35,250
I'm Orn. My house is just over there.

478
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,175
Thank you, Orn. I'm Run.

479
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:40,150
I just moved here.

480
00:48:40,475 --> 00:48:43,150
How nice it is for us to get to know each other!

481
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,150
Our kids can play together in the future.

482
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,825
I'll go home first.

483
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,825
Sib. Sib. Nubsib, come out.

484
00:50:51,075 --> 00:50:52,625
Sib, where are you?

485
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,100
Gene, come out!

486
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,925
Why are you trespassing?

487
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:29,125
It's your turn.

488
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:37,750
Sib.

489
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:50,250
Gene, close your eyes and count to ten.

490
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,000
Hurry up.

491
00:52:07,075 --> 00:52:25,450
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

492
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,400
You...

493
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,675
What's wrong?

494
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,100
Why are you here?

495
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,350
I'm waiting for you

496
00:53:17,075 --> 00:53:18,200
at our old place.

497
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,950
Oh.

498
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,850
What is it, Jap?

499
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:12,300
My face is not as red as yours
even after I drink, Gene.

500
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,875
Stop teasing me.

501
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,850
Why? Are you feeling shy?

502
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,375
Okay. Fine.

503
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,925
I won't interfere with you.

504
00:54:28,625 --> 00:54:29,750
Are you feeling shy?

505
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,975
So cute.

506
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,825
Don't do that, Gene.

507
00:54:48,425 --> 00:54:50,850
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

508
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,550
Can I?

509
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,850
Your parents are not at home.

510
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,175
I want to hug you to sleep
to cure my lovesickness.

511
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:05,275
That means you won't hug me

512
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,000
if you don't miss me?

513
00:55:07,225 --> 00:55:08,275
Of course, I'm hugging you.

514
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:11,400
So, you've agreed.

515
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,575
No, I don't want to be
the centre of attention again.

516
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,400
It's over.

517
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:27,700
My contract with them has ended.

518
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:32,725
From now on, only our promises are left.

519
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:36,825
I'm going to throw up if you continue.

520
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,675
Can you promise me?

521
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,050
We will never let go of each other's hand ever again.

522
00:56:04,825 --> 00:56:05,850
No.

523
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,175
Can you promise me?

524
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,000
No.

525
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,750
All right.

526
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:23,525
Fine.

527
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,675
I can promise you.

528
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:43,500
Didn't I say I promise?

529
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,025
Why are you still kissing?

530
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,175
I just want to kiss you. Can't I?

531
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:56,075
Fine. Just kiss me if you want to.

532
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,450
Kiss me until you're satisfied.

533
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:25,625
Nubsib.

534
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,150
Yes?

535
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,000
Do you know?

536
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:36,100
When you skipped piano lessons to play with me,

537
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:38,425
Aunty Orn asked me

538
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,100
to practice with you after she found it out.

539
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,500
That's right.

540
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,250
You liked sitting on that chair.

541
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,925
Do you remember where I liked to sit?

542
01:00:07,525 --> 01:00:08,800
Here.

543
01:00:17,475 --> 01:00:19,675
Why did you like to sit here?

544
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,400
It's because...

545
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,175
I can see your face clearly.

546
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:42,675
I'm very happy.

547
01:00:43,325 --> 01:00:44,675
You've returned.

548
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,275
I love you, Nubsib.

549
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,900
I love you more and more.

550
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:06,950
I'll love you

551
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,225
more than you do.

552
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:19,375
Move.

553
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:34,800
Nubsib, play a song for Brother Gene.

554
01:02:53,725 --> 01:02:54,650
Sign here.

555
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,800
Sign at the back too.

556
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,450
It's okay.

557
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:12,775
Wait, aren't you reading the contract, Nubsib?

558
01:03:12,975 --> 01:03:15,425
What's wrong with you? Where are you rushing off to?

559
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,900
I'm rushing off to see Gene.

560
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:20,700
Were you tired yesterday?

561
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,175
Just now.

562
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:26,900
That's too much.

563
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:28,475
I was joking.

564
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,000
Please take good care of my friend.

565
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,200
Just think of it as compensating him
for the times when he was sad.

566
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,400
Don't worry.

567
01:03:35,425 --> 01:03:37,875
I'll take good care of every inch of him.

568
01:03:42,525 --> 01:03:43,600
It's done, right?

569
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:46,375
I can't see you off.

570
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:48,725
You can go back on your own, right?

571
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:51,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

572
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:00,800
-Hey.
-Yes?

573
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:02,475
Should we do it too?

574
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,625
Do what?

575
01:04:04,675 --> 01:04:06,150
You pervert!

576
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,175
Just a bit.

577
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,325
I'll kick you. Don't.

578
01:04:10,325 --> 01:04:12,175
Tum. Enough!

579
01:04:38,425 --> 01:04:39,350
How's it going?

580
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:40,475
How's your progress?

581
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:43,650
Look. I'm writing the ending now.

582
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:46,550
But I don't know if it's any good.

583
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,225
Piano?

584
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:52,800
It seems familiar.

585
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,425
I'm wondering

586
01:04:58,575 --> 01:05:00,150
if this ending is good.

587
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,750
Oh, my love.

588
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,675
Who would do this to you?

589
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:36,700
My true love's kiss will wake your soul.

590
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:25,525
Your highness.

591
01:07:27,525 --> 01:07:29,425
Did you come to rescue me?

592
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:55,450
Will you accept my love?

593
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:07,025
I accept.

594
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:38,350
Nubsib, I don't think it works.

595
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,275
In that case...

596
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:06,850
Hey.

597
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,150
That's you, right?

598
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:17,800
Yes.

599
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:23,675
It would be my honour
if you would share this dance with me.

600
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:06,625
Won't you tell me your name?

601
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:20,450
I have to go.

602
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,750
I have no time to explain.

603
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:23,450
Wait.

604
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,800
Where are you going?

605
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:29,275
I thank you for this special night.

606
01:11:36,725 --> 01:11:39,675
Wait, don't go!

607
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Gene, you are good at pretending.

608
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:07,075
I heard that, Your Highness!

609
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:09,775
Give it back.

610
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:12,425
Are you being shy?

611
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:14,325
What are you talking about?

612
01:12:15,175 --> 01:12:16,575
You're always coming up with nonsense.

613
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:00,550
My true love.

614
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,350
My soul.

615
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:09,725
Death has taken away your sweet soul.

616
01:13:10,775 --> 01:13:13,150
Yet, the last breath off your beautiful lips

617
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:20,500
still remains.

618
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:25,725
I request to kiss you.

619
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:15,825
Nubsib.

620
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:19,450
What is this?

621
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:23,525
It's poison.

622
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:34,175
Nubsib.

623
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:37,025
Nubsib.

624
01:14:38,275 --> 01:14:39,475
Nubsib.

625
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,625
You drank the whole vial?

626
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,800
Won't you leave some for me?

627
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,675
I want to kiss you.

628
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,325
There might still be poison
remaining on your lips.

629
01:15:09,675 --> 01:15:11,825
Your lips are so soft.

630
01:15:19,675 --> 01:15:23,550
Then, I'm willing to die after this kiss.

631
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:34,175
Nubsib!

632
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,550
Nubsib!

633
01:15:39,725 --> 01:15:40,900
Nubsib!

634
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:42,525
Nubsib!

635
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,050
I want to die together with you.

636
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,600
Hey, isn't that too sad?

637
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:48,250
I think so too.

638
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,525
Let's do it again.

639
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,125
Aren't all your ideas funny?

640
01:17:06,425 --> 01:17:08,025
I really can't think of the finale.

641
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,100
I'm just joking.

642
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,275
But

643
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:15,775
there's still another type of ending.

644
01:17:19,025 --> 01:17:20,150
What is it?

645
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,500
This is your ending?

646
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,075
No, help me figure it out first.

647
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I don't want it to end yet.

648

What are you looking at?

659
01:19:03,775 --> 01:19:04,925
What are we gonna eat?

660
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,425
I don't know either.

661
01:19:06,425 --> 01:19:08,600
What about you? What do you want to eat?

662
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:09,550
Excuse me.

663
01:19:09,550 --> 01:19:11,725
Are you Nubsib and Gene?

664
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:16,875
Yes.

665
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,550
Can we take a picture together?

666
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:19,950
Sure.

667
01:19:24,425 --> 01:19:26,800
I like your novel.

668
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,450
It is very interesting.

669
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:30,575
I'm looking forward to your next novel.

670
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:31,600
Thank you.

671
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,725
Thank you, bye.

672
01:19:37,175 --> 01:19:38,900
Come on.

673
01:19:39,825 --> 01:19:42,450
You are more popular than me now.

674
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:45,850
Should I be jealous?

675
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,125
Why are you jealous?

676
01:19:47,425 --> 01:19:50,725
I'm standing right here. I'm not going anywhere.

677
01:19:51,025 --> 01:19:52,925
Don't you think it's weird then?

678
01:19:53,275 --> 01:19:56,800
Everyone knows you are a guy
who writes BL novels.

679
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:03,925
There's nothing weird about it.

680
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:06,900
It's just another novel.

681
01:20:07,375 --> 01:20:08,675
Besides...

682
01:20:16,475 --> 01:20:18,200
I wrote it from our story.

683
01:20:32,075 --> 01:20:33,775
Let's go to eat.

684
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,250
Come on.

685
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,727
(Don't you feel shy now?)
(Nubsib asks his lover)

686
01:22:46,807 --> 01:22:48,659
(Nubsib looks forward to his reply)
("I wrote it from our story.")

687
01:22:48,739 --> 01:22:50,475
(Gene smiles and they hold hands)
(The End)

688
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:17,900
Hello.

689
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:20,775
Hello, can you get Ms Rose to answer?

690
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:23,575
Oh, speaking.

691
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:27,550
We want to make "Lovely Writer" into a series

692
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,525
but we might make some changes to the content.

693
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:35,750
Did the publishing company contact you
or tell you about this?

694
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:38,450
Oh. They've told me.

695
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,500
Let's meet later and
talk about the changes then, Ms Rose.

696
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:44,150
Okay.

697
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,675
Thank you very much.

698
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:47,020
