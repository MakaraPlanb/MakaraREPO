Does drinking that makes you full?

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,720
(Previously On Lovely Writer)
Hey!

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,220
Nueng wants us to tell our parents
about our relationship.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,990
If you're not ready yet,

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,350
I can wait for you.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,750
Can we get Nubsib and Aey
to take a picture together?

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,520
Can you wait?

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
We are taking pictures of Gene and Nubsib.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,270
You like Nubsib.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,670
Seems like you are naughty too, Gene.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,820
Don't go overboard.

12
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,870
I didn't.

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,450
I'm serious.

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,170
Who is it?

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,470
(Nubsib: Remember to eat)

16
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,500
(Nubsib: I'll go back after a while)

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,650
(Gene: Okay.)

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,370
Who is it?

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,850
(Aey: The one beside me is not Nubsib. Don't be jealous.)

20
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,720
How dare he plays guessing games with me.

21
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,270
(Gene: The fact that he is Nubsib
has never crossed my mind at all)

22
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,770
(Aey: Let's meet.
I have something to talk to you about.)

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,400
(Aey: Don't you want to know
what happened between me and Nubsib?)

=Lovely Writer=

31
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,900
I knew you would come.

32
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,820
What do you want to drink?

33
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,000
It's on me.

34
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,120
It's all right.

35
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,320
Get the bill. I'll send you back.

36
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,070
Why are you in a rush?

37
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,350
Since you're already here,

38
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,900
why don't you stay for a while?

39
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,970
We can discuss this in the car.

40
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,720
Waiter.

41
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,850
Get me two B-52 cocktails.

42
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,020
I want it to be specially made.

43
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,670
Wait, Gene.

44
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,300
Let's continue our previous chat.

45
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,850
Fine.

46
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,600
Get it over with and go home.

47
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,020
You...

48
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you really like Nubsib?

49
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,470
Do you really like him?

50
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,000
You do like Nubsib, right?

51
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,750
I can see that Nubsib likes you too.

52
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,270
How much did you drink?

53
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,870
Are you worrying about me?

54
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,970
I did drink a lot.

55
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,620
The person in the picture I sent you
bought me those drinks.

56
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,970
I didn't think of rejecting.

57
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,420
Where did he go?

58
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,750
Aren't you going to the TV station banquet?

59
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,020
I don't know.

60
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,900
I'm not really interested anyway.

61
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,970
I'm only interested in you.

62
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,500
You...

63
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,350
Are you really gay?

64
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,770
Do you think I'm acting?

65
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,670
Do you think I'm joking with you?

66
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:13,270
Yes. I don't like girls.

67
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,970
And I think...

68
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,420
I'm cuter than girls.

69
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,670
Your expression looks so funny.

70
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,470
Another glass of B-52 cocktail.

71
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,200
Enough, Aey.

72
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,170
Don't worry.

73
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,400
I can hold my liquor.

74
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,100
I'm just feeling a bit dizzy.

75
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,950
I've finished drinking mine.

76
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,520
But you've yet to drink the drinks I got you.

77
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,820
You'll hurt me.

78
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,220
Well...

79
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,150
You are showing that cute expression again.

80
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,650
Aren't you the cute one?

81
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,600
You said that yourself.

82
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,950
If you're not cute,

83
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,300
why did Nubsib fall for you?

84
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,950
I'm envious of you.

85
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,620
Everyone loves you.

86
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,620
No one cares about me.

87
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,120
That's wrong.

88
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,300
You have many fans

89
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,950
and your family too.

90
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,420
Are you trying to say that I still have my parents?

91
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,670
No one cares about me.

92
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,250
I'm jealous of you.

93
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,220
I want to hate you

94
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,870
but I can't.

95
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,050
You are too nice.

96
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,300
Did you come to see me

97
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,250
because I was drinking alone?

98
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,900
And are you worried about me?

99
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,550
No.

100
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,120
Gene.

101
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,770
Aey!

102
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,270
Sit there. I can't carry you.

103
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,920
You are so kind.

104
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm sure you won't hate me.

105
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,170
Aey.

106
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,420
Stop it.

107
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,220
Stop loving Nubsib.

108
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,020
Love me.

109
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,870
I'm cute too.

110
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,070
If you're worried about that,

111
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,820
you don't have to.

112
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,850
I'm good on the bed.

113
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,700
Aey!

114
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,750
Stop fooling around!

115
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,750
I want to go home!

116
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,970
You're so drunk. There's nothing left to say to you.

117
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,050
You don't have to go back.

118
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,420
Stay here with me tonight.

119
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,750
Will you, Gene?

120
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm begging you.

121
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:23,800
Wait.

122
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,620
Gene, you haven't drunk the drinks I got you.

123
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,150
How cruel.

124
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,000
Just drink it for the sake of
the time we spent together.

125
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,520
Aey, what are you planning again?

126
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,250
Where are you going?

127
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,170
I'm going home.

128
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,820
Why are you so annoying?

129
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,020
I know what you want to do.

130
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,800
Why did you ask then?

131
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
I wasn't asking you.

132
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,970
I just want to remind you.

133
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,920
I don't want you to become like this.

134
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,050
Do you think you are smart?

135
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:10,900
You like Gene, right?

136
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,000
Do you really want to hear that?

137
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,050
Yes. I like him.

138
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,700
Happy?

139
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,900
Can you stop annoying me now?

140
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,870
Do you know what you've done?

141
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,570
There's no good person who would do that.

142
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,570
-You should know...
-Why should I be a good person?

143
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,500
What can I get from being good?

144
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:30,900
Answer me.

145
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,440
Do you think that's how you can gain happiness?

146
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,250
When can someone like me

147
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,200
gain happiness then, Mhok?

148
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,300
I've never done anything I like.

149
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,850
Not even now.

150
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,070
Have you ever thought that
what you did will cause people troubles?

151
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,670
Has anyone cared about me at all?

152
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,250
Have they considered my feelings?

153
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,870
You know it too.

154
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,870
You've always known.

155
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,970
-Aey, don't...
-Stop controlling me.

156
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,270
-But I...
-Enough.

157
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,700
That's enough.

158
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,750
You annoy me.

159
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,650
Let go.

160
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,870
I'm telling you to let go.

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,800
Let go! I'm telling you to let go!

162
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,320
Let me go, Mhok!

163
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,250
I'm telling you to let me go!

164
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,020
Can you stop acting like my parents?

165
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,070
Why are you always annoying me?

166
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,250
Why are you always teaching me
how to become a good person?

167
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:01,020
Can't you let me live my own life?

168
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,500
-Aey, I want...
-You want me to become a good person.

169
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,100
Let me ask you then.

170
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,870
Am I really that bad?

171
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,650
Sorry.

172
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,620
I can't become a good person anymore.

173
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,050
You saw that I've already tried.

174
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,920
I really tried.

175
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,920
I've tried too.

176
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,220
On what?

177
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,800
On making you notice me.

178
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,420
Are you so foolish that
you haven't noticed that I like you?

179
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,170
You said no one cared about you

180
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,370
and no one considered your feelings.

181
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,850
I'm the one.

182
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,820
I care about you.

183
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,420
I consider your feelings.

184
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,950
I knew that.

185
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,400
Then, you should also know why I did that, right?

186
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,870
I'm really worried about you, Aey.

187
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
But you have to stay away from my life.

188
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,270
I beg you.

189
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,620
I beg you, Mhok.

190
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,020
Why, Aey?

191
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
Because I don't like you.

192
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,100
I don't want to hate you too.

193
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,070
You know that, right?

194
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,970
If you don't stop,

195
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,350
I'll hate you like how I hate my parents.

196
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,470
I don't want to do that.

197
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,470
How should I put this?

198
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,520
Do you know your mistakes?

199
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,950
Yes.

200
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:52,150
I got myself tangled with Aey.

201
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,100
No.

202
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,670
You made me worried.

203
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,320
I was planning to go for just a while.

204
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,650
I didn't expect it to be so long.

205
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,500
Sorry.

206
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,150
Do you know?

207
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,470
Besides getting worried about you,

208
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,920
I'm also jealous of you.

209
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,920
Let's make a promise, all right?

210
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,850
What promise?

211
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,400
From now on,

212
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll tell you wherever I go.

213
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,450
You have to tell me where you are going too.

214
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,200
Okay?

215
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,700
Okay.

216
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,070
Can I ask you a question?

217
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,120
Aey likes you, so he comes
and fools around with me?

218
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,370
I don't understand.

219
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,570
Don't worry.

220
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,250
Aey doesn't like me.

221
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,050
How do you know?

222
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,150
Actually, our relationship isn't good.

223
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,700
I only know that we like something similar.

224
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,120
Something similar?

225
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,150
You.

226
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,620
Aey doesn't like me.

227
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,600
He likes you just like me.

228
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,600
What?

229
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,620
Then...

230
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll call someone to get your car from the hotel.

231
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,100
Don't run away.

232
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,350
Hello.

233
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,120
Yes.

234
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,600
Uncle Tod, I need your help.

235
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,770
(Aey: Gene, I mixed Viagra in the B-52 cocktail)

236
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,920
(Aey: Good luck)

237
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,700
You can contact the staff when you've arrived.

238
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,770
Thank you.

239
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:11,850
(Tiffy: Aey, are you home?)

240
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,900
I think I like you.

241
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,150
Ever since we went everywhere together

242
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,550
and did everything together,

243
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,200
my feelings have changed.

244
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,000
Enough, Tum.

245
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,150
I'm going back to work.

246
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Tiffy!

247
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,550
Have you ever liked me?

248
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,590
(How should I stop loving a gay person?
Those who had a crush on one, help me)

(Friendship is the best)

251
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,570
It's so hot.

252
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:11,400
Gene, what do you think?

253
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,450
Take a bath if you're hot.

254
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,600
Wait.

255
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Take a cold shower. It's better.

256
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,550
But I like to take a hot shower.

257
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,120
No. It's because...

258
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,000
A cold shower is better for you.

259
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,920
It helps to open your pores.

260
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,570
A doctor told me that,

261
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,220
so I don't like to take hot showers now.

262
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,300
Really?

263
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,100
Yes.

264
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
Fine.

265
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,600
I believe you.

266
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,100
Mr. Gene.

267
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,070
Hey!

268
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,920
That was fast.

269
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,470
It's just normal.

270
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,320
You should take a shower too.

271
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
You...

272
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,020
Are you still hot?

273
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes. The heat is still here.

274
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,420
Then, let's go to the hospital.

275
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,170
Hospital?

276
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,600
For what?

277
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,120
What's wrong with you, Mr. Gene?

278
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,850
It's nothing.

279
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,770
I'm fine.

280
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,600
You, on the other hand. Are you allergic to alcohol?

281
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,370
I'm not allergic to alcohol.

282
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,220
Are you okay?

283
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,050
I don't know what's happening.

284
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,670
I'm feeling hot.

285
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,850
My whole body is heating up.

286
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,120
What should I do?

287
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,320
Wait. Let me get you a glass of water.

288
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,120
What are you doing?

289
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,120
I don't know.

290
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,020
Nubsib.

291
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,370
Calm down.

292
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:27,270
Wait.

293
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
Calm down.

294
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,650
Be rational.

295

296
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,020
Mr. Gene, where are you going?

297
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,650
Don't come here.

298
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,650
Calm down.

299
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,200
Calm down.

300
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,620
Breathe. Get a hold of yourself, Nubsib.

301
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,320
Nubsib.

302
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,800
Calm down.

303
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,770
Nubsib, wait.

304
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,320
Mr. Gene.

305
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,620
Don't come here.

306
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:14,850
Stop.

307
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,070
Calm down.

308
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,770
Nubsib.

309
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,520
Calm down.

310
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,550
Nubsib.

311
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,600
Don't come here.

312
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,000
Nubsib. You...

313
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,920
Breathe slowly, Nubsib.

314

315
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,300
Breathe slowly.

316

317
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,070
Nubsib.

318
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,850
Do you feel better this way?

319
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,770
Mr. Gene, you don't have to force yourself to do this.

320
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,350
I'm not forcing myself.

321
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,920
You should know what's on my mind.

322
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,870

Like.

What?

327
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,700
I like.

328
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,970
Happy?

329
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,900
I like you too, Mr. Gene.

If you are not ready yet,

331
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,950
I can wait.

332
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,300
Cut the crap and just do it.

333
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,920

Yes. It's just a different model.

375
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,920
This has a finer brush.

376
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,620
It's easier to clean.

377
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,750
I bought it especially for you.

378
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,570
Let's brush together.

379
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,670
Why are you laughing?

380
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,520
What are you looking at?

381
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,970
I'll beat you up if you laugh again.

382
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,120
"Bad Engineer The Series" Scene 9 of 10.
Cut 1 Take 1.

383
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,370
And, action.

384
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,570
Can you stop this?

385
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,270
Can you not do that?

386
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,350
But... But I...

387
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,770
I asked you to stop!

388
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,670
Don't you know?

389
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,570
I know.

390
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:41,970
What do you know?

391
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,550
I... I know I shouldn't...

392
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,300
What do you want from me?

393
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,850
I can't take it anymore.

394
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,600
You are just my senior.

395
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,050
Why are you always troubling me?

396
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,970
You still don't get it?

397
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,300
You still don't understand?

398
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,400
You belong only to me.

399
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,850
All this while,

400
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,670
I've never had such a feeling for someone else.

401
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,800
I love...

402
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:42,950
I... love...

403
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,220
I...

404
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,370
I...

405
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,370
Cut!

406
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:02,070
Hey.

407
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:05,720
You need more emotion when you say you love him.

408
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,820
How can the audience get immersed
if you do it like this?

409
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,870
Right?

410
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:11,000
Okay.

411
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,250
You've been doing well.

412
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,270
Don't make any mistakes in this scene.

413
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,750
This is the drama's climax. Got it?

414
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,400
You need to believe that Kin loves Namcha.

415
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,770
When you have that emotion, express it.

416
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,550
You know that, right? Love.

417
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,870
Sorry.

418
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,520
Again.

419
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,270
Starting from the confession scene.

420
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,250
Sound.

421
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:37,500
Ready.

422
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:38,620
Camera.

423
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:39,370
Ready.

424
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,750
And, action.

425
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,950
I love you.

426
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,500
All this while,

427
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,220
I...

428
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,320
Keep shooting. Don't stop!

429
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,700
What's going on today?

430
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,120
Say it with emotion.

431
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,450
Again.

432
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,520
And, action.

433
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,120
I love you.

434
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:19,970
All this while,

435
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,420
I only have eyes for you.

436
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:28,250
I...

437
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,920
Cut!

438
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,220
Sorry.

439
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,200
Nubsib, you can try

440
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,050
to imagine that I'm the one you really love.

441
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:27,620
Okay. I'm ready.

442
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,850
Ready?

443
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,950
Okay, everyone. Actors, get ready.

444
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,050
Crews, in position.

445
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,770
And, action.

446
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,300
I love you.

447
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,070
All this while,

448
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,770
I've never had such a feeling for someone else.

449
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,950
You are the only one for me.

450
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:00,450
I really love you, Namcha.

451
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm not joking.

452
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,670
I'm serious.

453
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:07,770
It's true. I really love you.

454
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,300
I really love you, Namcha.

455
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,150
Cut!

456
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,170
Next!

457
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,170
I was still thinking that you lack acting skills.

458
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,120
Thank you.

459
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,120
You're welcome.

460
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,750
Hey.

461
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,070
Hello, Gene.

462
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,570
Have you seen Tum?

463
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,350
Oh, both of you didn't come together?

464
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,570
No.

465
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,850
I haven't seen him today.

466
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,420
Gene, why are you looking for him?

467
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,550
It's nothing.

468
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:07,620
I just have some questions.

469
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:10,350
Okay. Let me know
if there's anything you need.

470
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,370
Okay.

471
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,600
I'll be leaving.

472
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:21,170
It's hot today. Right, Gene?

473
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:26,150
What's wrong, Gene?

474
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,400
Are you ill?

475
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:31,320
I'm worried about you.

476
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,820
Why do you look like that?

477
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:41,550
You didn't even reply to my messages.

478
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,500
Gene, are you still angry at me?

479
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,200
I'm just...

480
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:55,950
joking with you.

481
00:50:58,900 --> 00:50:59,920
Joking?

482
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:05,720
About the pill.

483
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,050
I didn't put anything in the cocktail.

484
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:09,820
What?

485
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,400
I didn't put anything inside.

486
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,050
You are nice to me.

487
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:17,220
If I did that,

488
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:21,620
I'll be guilty for my whole life.

489
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,320
Sorry.

490
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,620
Aey, lying like that isn't funny.

491
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:36,120
What if I called the police?

492
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,350
What would you do?

493
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,250
I apologize.

494
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,500
Apologies won't do anything.

495
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:50,000
Don't prank others next time.

496
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,270
I didn't do it on purpose.

497
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,900
I'm not sure why I did that.

498
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,400
Gene, do you hate me?

499
00:52:10,350 --> 00:52:13,950
No, I don't hate you.

500
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,970
If I hate you,

501
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,850
why would I still remind you?

502
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,370
Do you know?

503
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,270
I don't want you

504
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,300
to hate me.

505
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,220
Sure.

506
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,420
In the future,

507
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,700
don't prank others like this.

508
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,220
Understand?

509
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:43,850
Yes.

510
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,570
Gene, are you not feeling well?

511
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,070
Why don't you have some rest at home?

512
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:53,400
Oh. Don't worry.

513
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,820
I have a slight fever.

514
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,470
I took some medicine.

515
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:56,170
I'll be better later.

516
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,900
How can I not be worried?

517
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:03,020
You look pale.

518
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,600
Nubsib is not taking care of you well?

519
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:09,450
No.

520
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,950
Why don't I take care of you?

521
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,220
No, thanks.

522
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,250
So you are still angry at me.

523
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,050
I really don't like Nubsib.

524
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,820
I'm not angry at you.

525
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,700
But I really like you.

526
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,370
You are doing that cute expression again.

527
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,270
I like you

528
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:09,350
because of that.

529
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:27,070
I'll be leaving.

530
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,350
Nubsib.

531
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:02,750
Yes?

532
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,070
You didn't take the pill yesterday?

533
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,700
What pill?

534
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,770
Viagra.

535
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,750
Viagra?

536
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,100
What Viagra?

537
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,270
Stop pretending.

538
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,770
You said you felt hot yesterday.

539
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,770
I did.

540
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,370
Why are you like that?

541
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,550
You made me worried.

542
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,650
But I'm happy to see you worried.

543
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,620
Are you fooling me around?

544
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,770
No. I'm not.

545
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,100
Why are you laughing?

546
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,800
I'll beat you up.

547
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,350
Remember to hit harder. I want to be beaten up.

548
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,550
You are really...

549
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,400
Keep your voice down.

550
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,320
Otherwise, everyone will hear you.

551
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:09,650
I'm going back to the set.

552
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,320
Hey.

553
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:42,950
You're all wet.

554
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,400
What's wet?

555
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,100
Mr. Gene, are you wet?

556
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,920
Nubsib, you jerk.

557
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,500
You are the one who's not clear with your words.

558
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,700
What? What are you trying to do to me?

559
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:00,400
Give me the towel.

560
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,770
Turn around.

561
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,870
You are so nice today.

562
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:13,170
I'm nice every day.

563
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:18,250
Can you dry my hair every day?

564
00:57:19,050 --> 00:57:20,800
You're an adult. Can't you dry it yourself?

565
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:29,920
Hey.

566
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,820
Yes?

567
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,720
Aren't you bored?

568
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:36,400
Staying at home every day.

569
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:38,820
If you're bored, you can go out with your friends.

570
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:42,450
I'm not.

571
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,470
I want to stay with you more.

572
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,170
No matter where it is

573
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,100
or what we are doing,

574
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:52,750
I just want to be with you.

575
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,400
I won't be bored.

576
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,470
Mr. Gene.

577
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,120
Mr. Gene.

578
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,100
What about you?

579
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,620
Aren't you bored?

580
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,050
I'm not bored either.

581
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:01,250
Nubsib, who is it?

582
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,250
I don't know.

583
00:59:03,770 --> 00:59:05,800
Get dressed.

584
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:06,700
I'll open the door.

585
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:10,000
Let's do it tonight then.

586
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,900
Nubsib.

587
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,020
Darn it, Nubsib.

588
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:22,270
It's Aunty Orn.

589
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,050
What?

590
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,800
Aunty Orn.

591
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,200
Who?

592
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,300
Your mother!

593
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,770
Oh.

594
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,550
What do you mean oh?

595
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,150
What should we do?

596
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,670
Get my mom to sit on the sofa.

597
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,900
I'll go and get dressed first.

598
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,550
You should open the door and welcome my mom.

599
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,300
If you look like this,

600
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:54,000
it'll be more suspicious.

601
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,420
Okay. Hurry up and get dressed.

602
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,450
Okay.

603
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:16,750
Gene.

604
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,700
Hello, Aunty Orn.

605
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,700
Why are you here?

606
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,270
Oh. My room is just beside coincidentally.

607
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:30,820
Oh. I see.

608
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,320
It's like that.

609
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,600
What a coincidence.

610
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,720
Yes.

611
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:38,570
Come in.

612
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,750
Please wait for a while.
Nubsib went to take a shower.

613
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,050
Okay. Come and sit here.

614
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,400
Nueng told me Nubsib has moved,

615
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,720
so I came to visit.

616
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,100
Oh.

617
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,020
Are you two going somewhere?

618
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:10,200
No.

619
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,470
I'm free so I came to accompany him.

620
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,500
It's been a long time since you last saw him.

621
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:15,800
Is everything all right?

622
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:16,670
Yes.

623
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,620
Hello, Mom.

624
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:19,770
Hello.

625
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,100
I called you. Why didn't you answer?

626
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:24,300
I thought you were not home.

627
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,470
I was taking a shower.

628
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,220
You didn't tell me you were coming either.

629
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,870
Would that still be a surprise if I had told you?

630
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,550
If you hide a woman here,

631
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:38,450
I'll be able to catch her.

632
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,370
But,

633
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,300
the more surprising thing is

634
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,720
I get to meet Gene here.

635
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,300
Gene is free today
so he came here to accompany me.

636
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,070
Why did you call him Gene? He's your elder brother.

637
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,470
Be respectful.

638
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,920
Are you moving here?

639
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,400
Yes.

640
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:05,770
It's convenient here.

641
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,020
How fortunate

642
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:10,500
for Gene's room to be right beside.

643
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:12,650
Yes.

644
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,370
You are still the same

645
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:18,120
as when you were a child who stuck to Gene.

646
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:24,550
In that case,

647
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,250
come home tonight

648
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,550
and stay for a few nights.

649
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:31,400
If you have class,

650
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,220
just get Uncle Tod to fetch you.

651
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,050
You don't have to drive on your own.

652
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,050
Okay?

653
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:38,350
Nubsib, you have a shoot tomorrow.

654
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:39,370
You might not wake up on time.

655
01:02:39,370 --> 01:02:40,720
I don't have a shoot tomorrow.

656
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:43,500
That's great.

657
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,250
Gene, come back together.

658
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:46,870
Okay?

659
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,200
Gene.

660
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,270
It's fine if you are busy.

661
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,350
Sure. I'll go.

662
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,770
Pack your things then.

663
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:07,320
I'll give a call to Aunty Run.

664
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,550
All of us are gathered again.

665
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:11,300
Aunty Run must be happy.

666
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,600
Wait for a while.

667
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,600
Hello.

668
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,770
Run.

669
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,000
Do you know who I met today?

670
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,820
No.

671
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,050
I met Gene.

672
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,170
It's true.

673
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:36,220
Nubsib moved to the unit beside him.

674
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,750
Yes.

675
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:41,170
That's right.

676
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:42,850
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

677
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:45,020
Everyone will be here.

678
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,770
Really?

679
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,450
That works too.

680
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:49,500
We can have dinner at your house.

681
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,650
I'll bring some dishes over later.

682
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:53,520
Okay.

683
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:54,300
Sure.

684
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,270
See you later.

685
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,720
What is it, Gene?

686
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,700
Do you think

687
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,800
we should tell our parents?

688
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,070
What?

689
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,920
Is it bad?

690
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:35,720
No.

691
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,750
If you are not ready yet,

692
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,820
I can wait.

693
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,300
You don't have to rush.

694
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,000
As long as you feel comfortable.

695
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,450
I don't want to hide it anymore.

696
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,620
Don't worry.

697
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,150
I'll be by your side no matter what.

698
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,950
Dinner's ready, kids!

699
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:23,850
Where are you?

700
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,100
Let's eat?

701
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:32,970
Let's go.

702
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:50,820
Jab.

703
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,820
Jab. Eat slowly, kid.

704
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:52,920
No one is stealing your food.

705
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,620
Eat slowly.

706
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,770
Yes.

707
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,150
Brother Jab, don't choke on a fishbone.

708
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,350
I really miss Aunty Orn's Lemon Fish.

709
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:09,600
If you like it, come and eat often, Jab.

710
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,100
Our houses are so close.

711
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,200
Okay.

712
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,320
Why are you being so polite?

713
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,520
"Polite" is not a word to describe you.

714
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:18,600
Right?

715
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:19,750
I'm very happy.

716
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:21,770
I feel so happy when I see how Jab eats.

717
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,700
Is that really a praise, Aunty Orn?

718
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,570
Gene.

719
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,070
Enough.

720
01:06:29,070 --> 01:06:30,770
All of you are just like kids.

721
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:31,620
Eat.

722
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,570
That's right.

723
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:34,270
Stop teasing Jab.

724
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:35,700
Eat.

725
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,020
The prawn is so big, dear.

726
01:06:48,770 --> 01:06:50,620
How are the two of you?

727
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,100
Aunty Orn said both of you
are staying in the same apartment.

728
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:55,400
Gene, you've never told me that.

729
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,470
Yes.

730
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:05,670
Uncle Teep, the Curry Prawn is good.

731
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:07,620
Do you want some? Let me get it for you.

732
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,320
Why are you both together?

733
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:19,600
It's a small world, dad.

734
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,170
Nubsib is the actor of my novel,

735
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:28,420
the novel that has been adapted to a drama.

736
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,800
That is how both of us met.

737
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:37,070
That novel of yours where
two boys fall in love with each other?

738
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:48,350
These novels are very popular now.

739
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:49,320
What kind of novel is it?

740
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,500
What is that group called?

741
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,920
The one you told me.

742
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:52,920
Wait, Orn.

743
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,600
Girls who love BL.

744
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,070
Yes. Girls who love BL.

745
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,650
Young actors nowadays are cute.

746
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:00,720
They are attractive, right?

747
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,200
Yes.

748
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,000
I went to a mall that day

749
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,350
and see the kids gathered around.

750
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,750
They got two attractive boys

751
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,650
to stand on stage and
both of them were hugging and kissing.

752
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,820
They did something so funny

753
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:18,370
and the fans were screaming so loud.

754
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:19,820
Wait, Orn.

755
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,370
It reminds me of the time

756
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,100
when we screamed for Bird.

757
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,700
Bird.

758
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:27,700
-Were you born yet?
-Not yet.

759
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,920
But these are not good people who act that, Run.

760
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,450
I was thinking. How is that possible?

761
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,470
That's so weird.

762
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,450
When I saw them screaming, I didn't get it.

763
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:45,020
Wat, this is the current trend.

764
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,220
It's popular right now.

765
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,620
I'm working hard to understand them recently too.

766
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:56,170
Why are you trying to understand that?

767
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:00,050
These things will pass soon.

768
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,250
It won't last long.

769
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,300
It's an open-minded world now.

770
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,550
There are many couples.

771
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:07,020
It's a menace.

772
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,800
I couldn't even keep pace with the update.

773
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,920
Exactly.

774
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,870
If Nubsib becomes popular,

775
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,070
he will be making a fortune.

776
01:09:16,150 --> 01:09:17,850
Those fans are all rich.

777
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,300
That's right.

778
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:20,950
Nubsib.

779
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
Are you going to do that too?

780
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:27,070
That's the genre of Gene's works.

781
01:09:27,070 --> 01:09:28,620
Of course, he has to show that.

782
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:30,020
Don't tell me...

783
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,170
Dear.

784
01:09:32,650 --> 01:09:35,100
They are close.

785
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,320
They work together.

786
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,700
That is how they help each other.

787
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,350
Work is work, dear.

788
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:42,450
Don't overthink.

789
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,920
Nubsib, whatever you do,

790
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:49,170
don't destroy your own personality

791
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:49,970
and also my company.

792
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,750
I'm not going to say anything

793
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:53,920
but you should know best

794
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:55,770
about things that exceed limits.

795
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:56,700
Yes.

796
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,050
Actually,

797
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:01,870
in my memory,

798
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,000
these two have been sticking to each other

799
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,910
like twins when they were young.

800
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,470
They eat together, sleep together

801
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,020
and play together, right, sister?

802
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,150
When Gene is going to boarding school,

803
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,000
Nubsib

804
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,470
cried buckets

805
01:10:15,470 --> 01:10:17,170
for so many days.

806
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,170
Really, Aunty Orn?

807
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:20,270
Yes.

808
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,670
Because I missed Gene.

809
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:26,770
You are really saying everything.

810
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:28,300
You're an adult now.

811
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:30,700
But now,

812
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,270
you don't have to miss him.

813
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,920
The two of you are always together.

814
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,720
Even his fans

815
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,820
are joking about them.

816
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:40,000
They think they are dating each other in secret.

817
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:55,400
By the way,

818
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,100
if our sons got together,

819
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:01,120
it will be really interesting, right, sister?

820
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:03,020
Yes.

821
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:04,700
Both of them will wear the groom's suits.

822
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,000
I've seen it on the internet.

823
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,370
Right?

824
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:09,420
If they got married for real,

825
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:09,750
Yes.

826
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,820
I'll make Lemon Fish for every table.

827
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:16,920
You are all joking, right?

828
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:18,920
How could they be together?

829
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,820
Both of them are our kids.

830
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:23,800
Honey.

831
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,670
Why are you so serious? We are joking.

832
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,420
Yes. Because they have been close since young.

833
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:33,150
You are too serious.

834
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,300
Right?

835
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:38,420
I think both of you
are just like the girls you mentioned.

836
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,650
Girls who love BL.

837
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,950
You are making everything worse.

838
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,050
Gene.

839
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,820
This is your favourite.

840
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,570
Have more.

841
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,370
What if the two of us are really together?

842
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:14,800
It's time to end this joke.

843
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:18,120
This is starting to get annoying.

844
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:24,870
Gene is not joking.

845
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,500
Both of us are dating each other.

846
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:38,470
If you need a reason

847
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:41,020
for why we are staying in the same apartment,

848
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,600
it's because I love Gene.

849
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,470
I've loved him for a long time.

850
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:12,950
Yes.

851
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,300
What Nubsib has said is the truth.

852
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,420
Let me fill your glass.

853
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,420
Do you know about this, Jab?

854
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:40,120
Nueng?

855
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:45,570
Yes.

856
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,800
Thanks for the dinner tonight.

857
01:14:54,070 --> 01:15:00,350
I should be thanking you for cooking for the boys.

858
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:03,370
But, about what happened today...

859
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,650
It's all right. We'll go back for now.

860
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:06,870
Okay.

861
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,250
Aunty Run. Uncle Teep.

862
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,050
I'll be leaving.

863
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:14,900
Thank you.

864
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,350
I'm leaving. Goodbye.

865
01:15:32,350 --> 01:15:34,220
Nubsib. Come.

866
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:41,070
Nubsib.

867
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:51,100
Dad, but Gene and I did nothing wrong.

868
01:15:59,570 --> 01:16:01,600
That's enough for today.

869
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:07,000
You are fortunate that both
your mom and I weren't shocked to death.

870
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,020
Dad.

871
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,450
Why aren't you talking to me?

872
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:55,900
You couldn't accept it, right?

873
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:57,820
The fact that I love Nubsib.

874
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,950
Just do whatever you want.

875
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,420
I don't want to talk to you.

876
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:05,000
When are we going to talk if it's not now?

877
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,400
Why?

878
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,350
Is it something serious?

879
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,420
Nubsib and I are only dating each other.

880
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,100
Go up.

881
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,070
No. I'm not going up.

882
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,050
I know.

883
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,050
You and Mom couldn't accept the fact that I'm gay.

884
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,120
But it has already happened.

885
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,850
I didn't expect that to happen either.

886
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,550
Or, do you hate gays?

887
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,570
I have no choice then.

888
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:54,670
I've already fallen in love with Nubsib.

889
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,370
I want you to go upstairs.

890
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:06,950
If I'm not sure,

891
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,870
I wouldn't have told you and Mom.

892
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,050
I can keep lying to both of you.

893
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:21,600
But I don't want to do that.

894
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,300
I'm honest with myself.

895
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,200
I'm honest to everyone.

896
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,050
Is that what I deserve, Dad?

897
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,100
But

898
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,970
you shouldn't be angry about me on this.

899
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,220
If I recall correctly,

900
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:02,520
you dated boys before you met Mom.

901
01:20:08,450 --> 01:20:10,070
Does that mean that

902
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:12,420
you hate yourself?

903
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,650
Shut up!

904
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:15,220
I want you to go upstairs!

905
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:16,200
Go up!

906
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,370
What you did today was too much.

907
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,770
I'm so disappointed in you.

908
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,500
Have you asked me before?

909
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:54,500
Am I disappointed in both of you?

910
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,770
Have you thought about it?

911
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,250
A lazy person like you
wouldn't have thought about it!

912
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:06,370
Go wherever you want.

913
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,370
I don't want to quarrel with another person.

914
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,470
Do you think

915
01:21:11,870 --> 01:21:13,720
you can just do anything as a father?

916
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,150
Fathers are not always right!

917
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:20,750
Do you know?

918
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,120
What you are doing now

919
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,400
is tyranny!

920
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:25,820
Jab!

921
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,800
Enough.

If they don't allow us to be together,

958
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,770
what will you do?

959
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:52,970
Are you going to break up with me?

960
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,000
Didn't you ask me before?

961
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,650
Why didn't I have a girlfriend?

962
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:58,000
Don't tell me it's because of Gene.

963
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:58,770
Yes.

01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:00,470

965
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:03,100
If you don't want me to be with Nubsib,

966
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:05,370
I want to hear your reason.

967
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,050
Do you really love Nubsib?
