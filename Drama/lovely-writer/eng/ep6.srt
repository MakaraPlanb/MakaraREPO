1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,635
You know that I like, Sib right?

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,709
Nubsib, kiss for real.

3
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,515
But kissing with my feelings.

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,380
I don't want to kiss anyone...

5
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:16,477
except for you.

6
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:19,804
Get the hell out
because I never had a son like you.

7
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:24,503
What did I order you to do?

8
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,549
You can go take care of your errands.

9
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,503
Gene.

10
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,155
Are you at the condo with Sib?

11
00:00:31,587 --> 00:00:32,883
I'll meet you there.

12
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:41,426
Oh, you are awake?

13
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:49,481
Lately, you've been waking up early.

14
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:56,174
I've been sleeping early.
I only slept at 4:00 AM last night.

15
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:59,853
Four AM? 4:00 AM is not early.

16
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,496
Why don't dry your hair well.

17
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:14,951
Just let it dry.

18
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:21,283
Well, what are you doing here manager.

19
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,720
There's no filming set today.

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,032
I have a photo shoot.

21
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:26,966
Do you want to go? Let's go together.

22
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,260
Can I?

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,410
Why not. They will capeted you.

24
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,887
You've got more Fan on twitter!

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,555
Don't tease me.

26
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:39,488
Let me get change and put on contact lens.

27
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:41,887
But Gene, you didn't have breakfast yet.

28
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,020
There's some food in the kitchen.

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,698
Nubsib bought one for you.
You can eat first.

30
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:49,912
I have to talk with Nibsib a little while.

31
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:52,613
Then, I'll eat later.

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,282
From now on, you have to be careful
of what you post.

33
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:06,092
I warn you
because it's not a big deal yet.

34
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:09,856
But if Tam know it,
it's bad for eveyone.

35
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:13,495
I understand but it's hard to do.

36
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:18,376
How is it hard? Just not too revealing.

37
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:23,143
Gene is cute. What's wrong
if I want to show him off?

38
00:02:23,634 --> 00:02:26,462
Oh, you are so stubborn.

39
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:29,016
Why don't people see this side of you?

40
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:34,108
In front of Gene, you're so polite.

41
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,397
Tum.

42
00:02:36,966 --> 00:02:38,523
I'm just joking.

43
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:28,945
=Lovely Writer=

44
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:47,955
Hey, you get jealous.

45
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,361
Jealous? I'll kick you.

46
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,541
I'm so sorry for my friend. So sorry.

47
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:26,478
I will go grab some coffee.

48
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,224
Hurry up.

49
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:30,437
If Nubsib doesn't see you
after he finishes his photo shoot.

50
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,750
He will blame me.

51
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,238
We're not together. Don't exaggerate.

52
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,764
They're cute.

53
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,254
They look like a family.

54
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:15,134
I'm not that old.

55
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,213
I'm just a beautiful sister.

56
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,727
Sure! I see wrinkles on your forehead.
You need more Botox.

57
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:25,401
So harsh, Tum!

58
00:05:25,902 --> 00:05:31,065
Thank you for taking care of Aey
last time.

59
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,265
No problem. Where did you go?

60
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,829
Gosh. Her face is getting greasy.

61
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,678
Makeup artist, please check her face.

62
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,770
Where is the makeup artist?

63
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,737
They are in the restroom.

64
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,509
Let me get some tissue in my bag.

65
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,531
No, no, I will take care of it.

66
00:05:57,977 --> 00:06:00,542
I'm here. Tum, I'm here.

67
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:02,580
Makeup artist
ate spicy salad this morning.

68
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,682
So...

69
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,942
Please pick them up
from the restroom. Thank you.

70
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:07,809
Okay, come on.

71
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,930
Ice latte and ice americano are ready.

72
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:52,823
180 baht, please.

73
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,236
Sir, sir.

74
00:06:58,841 --> 00:06:59,994
What?

75
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:01,962
180 baht for 2 coffee please.

76
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:09,786
There you go.
And may I have one green tea as well?

77
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:14,331
Hey, you don't need to pay. I can pay.

78
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:18,304
Think of it as a payback
that you let me in your series.

79
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,510
It's not that big of a deal.

80
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,762
May I sit here?

81
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:24,863
Okay.

82
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,656
We rarely talk to each other.

83
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:42,891
That's right. We just cross path often.

84
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,176
How old are you?

85
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:49,437
I'm almost 26.

86
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:53,285
Really? You look young.

87
00:07:53,365 --> 00:07:55,134
I thought you are in high-school.

88
00:07:55,214 --> 00:07:58,728
Don't exaggerate.
Are you done with photo shoot?

89
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:03,187
I'm on a break. Only one more set to go.

90
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:10,513
Can I ask you something?

91
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,303
Why did you choose the Boy Love series?

92
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,763
My sister urge me to cast.

93
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:22,504
She is a Love Boy Fans
and she is your Fan.

94
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:27,015
She wanted me to bring a book
to get your autograph.

95
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,112
Are you okay?

96
00:08:31,192 --> 00:08:35,425
No, I just feel weird.

97
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,070
When someone like my novel.

98
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:40,745
You don't have to feel weird.

99
00:08:40,825 --> 00:08:42,527
Your novel is quiet popular.

100
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:47,540
It's ice green tea.

101
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,885
Thank you.

102
00:08:54,613 --> 00:08:56,291
Because I'm a man.

103
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:59,925
Because I'm a man.

104
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,145
I didn't see it strange.

105
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:05,428
I will get your autograph next time.

106
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:07,630
Okay.

107
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,814
Shall we go inside?

108
00:09:09,894 --> 00:09:11,754
I have to give Tum this coffee.

109
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:13,890
Gene.

110
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,315
I would like to warn you about something.

111
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,559
I want you to stay away from Aey.

112
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,174
What do you mean?

113
00:09:35,723 --> 00:09:38,323
Did Aey do something bad to you?

114
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,479
Never, why?

115
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,855
If Aey did something bad to you,

116
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,478
I'm so sorry for him.

117
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,032
If he really did bad thing to me,

118
00:10:01,515 --> 00:10:03,666
why you have to say sorry for him?

119
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:15,529
When I first saw you,
I thought you're quiet.

120
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:18,695
You keep to yourself.

121
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:21,084
Just like writers usually are!

122
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:26,755
To be honest, I thought
it's just a stereotype.

123
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:31,676
Writers are just human.
Not everyone is like that.

124
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:37,701
But sometimes, I don't like when
someone bother me when I work.

125
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:39,795
That's true.

126
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:43,375
Nubsib!

127
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,859
Staffs are looking for you,
didn't you know?

128
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,515
What, I just go get coffee.

129
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,866
Gene, don't forget what we talked about.

130
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:15,032
Don't forget what we talked about!
Talk about what?

131
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,140
Nothing.

132
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,084
Mhok's sister want me to sign on the book.

133
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,272
Gene, Don't talk to stranger.

134
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:30,088
It's dangerous.

135
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,332
I'm not 10 years old.

136
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,768
But it seems like it.

137
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:38,926
I will kick you.

138
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,746
Let me help you.

139
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:43,923
Don't touch me.

140
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,520
Oh, my gosh.

141
00:13:10,092 --> 00:13:12,283
Ouch!

142
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:31,971
What's wrong with your car?

143
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:33,187
I don't know.

144
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:34,659
The car isn't starting.

145
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,962
Why don't you use oil...

146
00:13:38,042 --> 00:13:40,876
Stop it, that's too old.

147
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:46,525
Let me see.

148
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,233
Can you do it?

149
00:13:51,886 --> 00:13:54,783
Move.

150
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:01,974
It's hot.

151
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,060
Tiffy.

152
00:14:23,638 --> 00:14:24,944
Should I sew it first?

153
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,125
You can do that?

154
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,493
You are talented.
You can do girly things too.

155
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:44,264
It's not weird.

156
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,462
No, its not.

157
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:50,375
Who would have known.

158
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,809
Don't forget. I didn't have
the car repair skill like you.

159
00:14:58,614 --> 00:14:59,750
That's true.

160
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:05,442
Okay. Done.

161
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,150
Thank you.

162
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:22,654
You've been busy
taking care of other's face...

163
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:24,574
that you forgot to take care of your face.

164
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:58,680
I often helped my father
fix a car when I was young...

165
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,410
because my family owned the garage.

166
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:07,388
You like it? Fixing a car is...

167
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:08,799
Girls don't seem to like.

168
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,456
I like it.

169
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,408
I don't know why.

170
00:16:18,094 --> 00:16:19,271
It's just feel cool.

171
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:26,197
I envy that your family understand...

172
00:16:26,965 --> 00:16:29,402
and happy of what you like.

173
00:16:31,218 --> 00:16:32,635
It's not like that.

174
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,315
Believe it or not, I used to date a girl.

175
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,740
Maybe it's because
I went to all girls' school,

176
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,687
so I didn't find it strange.

177
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,546
But my mom,

178
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,156
she was not okay when I told her this.

179
00:17:03,642 --> 00:17:05,349
So, I moved to Bangkok...

180
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,698
because I don't want mom
to feel uncomfortable.

181
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,794
What exactly do you like?

182
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,254
I don't know.

183
00:17:20,093 --> 00:17:22,275
I like the one who make me feel good.

184
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:24,189
Isn't it enough?

185
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:30,626
How about your mom?

186
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,116
It's not important.

187
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,917
She's not with me anymore.

188
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:45,762
I just came back from my mom's funeral.

189
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:54,746
Oh, I didn't know about it.

190
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:57,512
It's okay.

191
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:00,083
I didn't tell anyone about this.

192
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:10,148
I lived with Tam since we were young.

193
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:14,473
Both my parents pass away by an accident.

194
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:16,458
At that time, I was still a child...

195
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:19,791
Tam become head of the family.

196
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:24,581
For me, I did everything I could.

197
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,117
Sometimes, I think
why did I have to grow up so fast?

198
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,956
I have to be mature.

199
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,469
I just wanted to act like a kid sometimes.

200
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,347
And not have to worry like other kids...

201
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,828
but I could never do that.

202
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,150
The car started. It's time to go.

203
00:19:49,028 --> 00:19:52,759
This is yours and this is mine.

204
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:56,462
This is also yours.

205
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,478
This is also yours.

206
00:20:06,698 --> 00:20:07,871
That's it!

207
00:20:10,427 --> 00:20:11,947
This is not mine.

208
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,468
I did not buy this.

209
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:18,420
I bought one for you.

210
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:23,236
For me, why did you buy it for me?

211
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:25,585
You always drink coffee.

212
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:27,449
I want you to try something else.

213
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,764
No, you can have it.

214
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:08,456
Its good. Do you want to try?

215
00:21:12,463 --> 00:21:15,948
You can try mine.

216
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:19,669
Try.

217
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,768
Try it.

218
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:30,266
Just try.

219
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,299
This is yummy.

220
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:03,815
It's like you kiss me.

221
00:22:06,436 --> 00:22:09,265
What? When did I kiss you?

222
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,059
Never mind.

223
00:22:15,882 --> 00:22:19,620
I think, I will go back home
two to three days.

224
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:24,847
Stay over?

225
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,573
Two nights. Can you stay by yourself?

226
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,317
What if I say no?

227
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:36,607
Then, I'll ask, how old you are.

228
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:38,545
I feel lonely.

229
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,841
Can you watch my room?

230
00:22:42,468 --> 00:22:45,003
If I miss you, can I text you?

231
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:51,061
If its not important, I'll not reply.

232
00:22:56,392 --> 00:22:57,620
Gene.

233
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:06,359
That's mine and this's yours.

234
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:13,442
But you can have both.

235
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:17,329
Because my bottle was yours
since you drink it.

236
00:24:38,284 --> 00:24:39,518
Hey.

237
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,920
Oh, gosh.

238
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:52,661
You like teasing me. What brings you here?

239
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,476
I thought you forgot the family.

240
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,983
I had a cake recently.

241
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,730
I saw Foi Thong cake so I thought of you.

242
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,902
I have to thank the cake.

243
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:04,647
Is this Foi Thong cake?

244
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,240
No, it's cereal cake.

245
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:12,203
I thought you bought it for me.

246
00:25:14,812 --> 00:25:16,735
Your blood sugar will go up again.

247
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:20,194
It's okay to eat once in a while.

248
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,912
I know you're naughty since the old day.

249
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:26,970
But our body is not stable,

250
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,560
let me help you take care of what you eat.

251
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,545
I'm so happy. Please take care of mom.

252
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,781
Sure. Let's post a story.

253
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:39,976
Okay, okay.

254
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,048
So cute. What are you doing?

255
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:54,467
I'm writing an article.

256
00:25:54,547 --> 00:25:57,312
I have to submit this week
and I've not finish yet.

257
00:25:57,958 --> 00:25:59,363
What is the article about?

258
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:03,669
It's about gender
diversity in Thai dramas.

259
00:26:04,122 --> 00:26:05,914
This has your Boy Love series too.

260
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:09,935
Oh, is this Boy Love Fans pioneer.

261
00:26:10,366 --> 00:26:16,047
It's good that you're here
so that I can ask questions.

262
00:26:16,127 --> 00:26:19,752
Because I think you would
understand better than me.

263
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:22,635
I don't know much about it.

264
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:27,273
As you know,
Boy Love series is under focus.

265
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,738
Mainly, it doesn't really drive any point.

266
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,477
It's just a fantasy of love.

267
00:26:37,212 --> 00:26:40,445
But what you said, it works.

268
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:45,243
Let's have dinner at home
so we can discuss.

269
00:26:45,323 --> 00:26:51,562
They all miss you. Especially your father.

270
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:55,906
I told him to call you
but he's just stubborn.

271
00:26:57,144 --> 00:27:00,869
Of course, please make
me something delicious.

272
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,359
Okay, I'll make a full table.

273
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:04,382
-Sure.
-Sure

274
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,223
-I will go upstairs to unpack my stuff.
-Yes.

275
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:15,365
Love fantasy.

276
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,378
Gene, eat up.
These are all your favourite.

277
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:29,014
You look so skinny.

278
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,857
I want you to see me
when I stay at my condo.

279
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:35,672
You will say
"Gene, please don't eat anymore."

280
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:38,828
The frozen food doesn't count!

281
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,504
Don't pretend you know it all.

282
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:42,988
Come on, mom, look at him.

283
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:46,226
It's easy to eat.

284
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:48,632
When I am writing the novel,

285
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:51,702
I don't like to go anywhere,
my idea will be lost.

286
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:55,977
Just an excuse! They have delivery app.

287
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:00,581
Enough, what he said is right.

288
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,861
You have to take care of yourself.

289
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:05,706
You're getting older and older,
who will look after you?

290
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:08,462
You seem like it'll be difficult
for you to find the partner.

291
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,469
Right, mom.

292
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,217
You have to think of
yourself when you're old.

293
00:28:12,297 --> 00:28:15,590
Mom and dad will not
stay with you forever.

294
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,504
You're so mean, K. Run.

295
00:28:21,761 --> 00:28:24,821
If you only write the novel,

296
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,116
I think you should come back home.

297
00:28:27,627 --> 00:28:31,787
I saved money for it.
It'll just be deserted.

298
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,798
That's okay. Just leave it there.

299
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:37,109
You can stay there when you visit Bangkok.

300
00:28:38,606 --> 00:28:40,380
I've been busy recently.

301
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,255
My novel is being made to a series.

302
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:49,480
Let's decide later.

303
00:28:50,602 --> 00:28:54,705
Gene, who is the actress for your series?

304
00:28:54,785 --> 00:28:56,251
New actress.

305
00:28:56,331 --> 00:29:00,497
It calls "Lead", not actress.

306
00:29:08,407 --> 00:29:10,241
Don't forget mom when you're famous.

307
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,729
Yeah, yeah, me too.

308
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,001
Who can forget you!

309
00:29:14,081 --> 00:29:15,247
-Yeah, yeah, me too.
-Me too.

310
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:16,778
You forget me for sure.

311
00:29:17,495 --> 00:29:18,774
Let's eat.

312
00:29:57,465 --> 00:29:58,778
(#Nubsin.)

313
00:30:02,123 --> 00:30:04,971
(I agree with Nubsib.
Gene is so cute. #Nubsib.)

314
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:06,593
(Awww, sweet #Nubsib.)

315
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:09,206
(Captain takes a lead, crew
members can stop #Nubsib.)

316
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:10,948
(Are you going to sleep, yet?)

317
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:18,561
(Not yet. What's up?)

318
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,114
(I miss you.)

319
00:30:24,374 --> 00:30:25,894
(Joking?)

320
00:30:28,817 --> 00:30:30,120
(If you mess around don’t text me)

321
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,351
(I told you I will not
reply if its not important.)

322
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:33,932
(But you're replying.)

323
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:38,047
(I thought its important.
I'll not reply anymore.)

324
00:30:41,902 --> 00:30:43,548
(You're so mean to me.)

325
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,460
(Mean? It's late, let's go to bed.)

326
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,710
(I'm not sleepy.)

327
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,917
(Cal I call?)

328
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,748
(Nope.)

329
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:07,588
(Please don't post your picture so often.)

330
00:31:07,668 --> 00:31:09,144
(You've got a lot of followers)

331
00:31:09,224 --> 00:31:11,009
(I don't want anyone else to see.)

332
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:14,490
(I don't want anyone else to see.)

333
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:18,778
(What's wrong with you.)

334
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:27,669
(I want to throw up)

335
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:32,421
(Sleep?)

336
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,720
(Have a good night.)

337
00:32:48,255 --> 00:32:49,259
Gene.

338
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,061
Gene.

339
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,117
Yes.

340
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:56,896
Whose cereal cake is this?

341
00:32:57,791 --> 00:33:00,322
It's Auntie Orn.

342
00:33:00,402 --> 00:33:03,857
Why don't you give it to he?

343
00:33:03,937 --> 00:33:10,627
Okay, then, I'll go now.
Is Auntie Orn home?

344
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:14,810
She's always at home. You should go now.

345
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,449
Gene.

346
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:24,808
Gene, don't go back to sleep.

347
00:34:02,963 --> 00:34:04,392
Hey, Gene.

348
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:07,285
Oh, Nueng. Why are you honking?

349
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:09,896
Sorry, sorry. You come here to see my mom?

350
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:11,440
Yes.

351
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,836
I just drop her off.

352
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:15,900
Ah, you're not going to the office?

353
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,485
I stopped by to get some
documents and drop my mom off.

354
00:34:18,565 --> 00:34:19,837
I'm about to go.

355
00:34:20,837 --> 00:34:25,360
Oh, handsome. Long time no see.

356
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,953
Na "Run and Lung" Teep must miss you.

357
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:31,478
Are you free tonight?
Let's eat at my house.

358
00:34:31,558 --> 00:34:33,138
My mom must be so happy.

359
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:36,667
I have to ask my family first.

360
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:38,903
I've plan to stay only two nights.

361
00:34:38,983 --> 00:34:43,141
Oh, Please invite Na'Run
and Lung'Teep too.

362
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,656
Is jab here?

363
00:34:46,075 --> 00:34:49,255
Bring him with you.
I want to meet everyone.

364
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:52,364
I will ask my family.

365
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:57,119
Okay, I have to go to the meeting.
See you tonight.

366
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,331
Gene, since when have you been here?

367
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,387
What are you looking at?

368
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:54,151
This photo was taken
at the end of last year.

369
00:36:54,231 --> 00:36:56,363
Nubsib is the one who
standing next to father.

370
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:00,777
Nubsib?

371
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:03,163
Can you remember Nubsib?

372
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,826
Gene.

373
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,055
Nubsib.

374
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:12,532
He came back from overseas last year.

375
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:17,082
I remember.

376
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:20,476
Nubsib is always asking for you.

377
00:37:20,556 --> 00:37:23,098
He is in the university
and staying in the condo.

378
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:26,272
Otherwise, you should meet him.
He is an actor.

379
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:29,138
He is super busy
and rarely come back home.

380
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,363
I see him on the internet often.

381
00:37:37,443 --> 00:37:42,577
Have you seen him?
Like I said, you're the same age.

382
00:37:42,657 --> 00:37:44,713
So, you remember.

383
00:37:44,793 --> 00:37:47,643
I'm old, I can't remember anyone.

384
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,508
Nubsib ask me to use his aunt's surname...

385
00:37:51,588 --> 00:37:54,569
because his father doesn't
support him to become an actor,

386
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,324
but I don't want to stop him as well.

387
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,741
Oh, is it Auntie Orn' surname?

388
00:38:03,821 --> 00:38:06,909
Yes, it's my previous surname.

389
00:38:15,555 --> 00:38:16,743
Gene.

390
00:38:17,877 --> 00:38:19,438
Are you okay?

391
00:38:19,518 --> 00:38:21,018
Are you not feeling well?

392
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,540
Nothing.

393
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:29,340
I think I have to go.

394
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,186
Oh, you just arrived.

395
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:36,602
I realize that I have something urgent.

396
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,447
I have to clear it.

397
00:38:39,103 --> 00:38:41,283
May I give you a hug?

398
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:45,727
I missed you.

399
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:55,265
I bought this one for you.

400
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,072
Thank you.

401
00:38:58,652 --> 00:38:59,845
Gene.

402
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:02,029
Gene, please come visit Auntie often.

403
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:03,304
I miss you.

404
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,801
(What's wrong?)

405
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,088
(Answer me please. I'm worried about you.)

406
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:44,722
Gene.

407
00:41:47,144 --> 00:41:49,511
You said you will stay home
for two nights.

408
00:41:52,361 --> 00:41:56,682
Go pack your stuff
and move out of my condo tomorrow.

409
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:01,614
Why?

410
00:42:03,015 --> 00:42:05,497
You said I could stay with you.

411
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,712
You have several rooms.

412
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,781
You don't need to stay with me.

413
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,952
You remember who I was...

414
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,793
Did you remember from the beginning?

415
00:42:27,855 --> 00:42:29,814
You know, I can't remember you.

416
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:33,648
Why don't you tell me?

417
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:47,093
Shit!

418
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,988
I have a reason.

419
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:53,989
The reason is
you're having fun lying to me.

420
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:58,212
If you weren't Auntie Orn's son,
I would punch you.

421
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,559
Please do.

422
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,590
Don't challenge me.

423
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,037
I didn't.

424
00:43:14,516 --> 00:43:17,677
I know that I'm wrong.

425
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,622
If you punch me and you feel better,
then go ahead.

426
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,528
But could you please listen to me?

427
00:44:31,387 --> 00:44:33,235
Get out of my room.

428
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:41,181
Can't you listen to me?

429
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,524
I don't want to hear anything.

430
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,202
I don't want to see your face either.

431
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:49,369
I don't want to be a stupid
to be fooled by you again.

432
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:51,569
I never think you're stupid.

433
00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:54,628
Whatever!

434
00:44:56,253 --> 00:45:01,102
Get out right now.

435
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:03,494
Your stuff will be pick up by Tum.

436
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:09,352
If we still not talk,
I'll not go anywhere.

437
00:45:09,432 --> 00:45:11,815
What else do you want to lie about?

438
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:16,411
I'm not lying,
I told you I have a good reason.

439
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:20,523
Do you think, I still believe the person
who has always fooled me?

440
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:36,645
If you don't go, I'll call the security.

441
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:17,926
-Move.
-Gene.

442
00:46:18,006 --> 00:46:19,373
-Move.
-Gene.

443
00:46:19,453 --> 00:46:20,625
I told you to move.

444
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:22,302
Gene, where will go you?

445
00:46:22,885 --> 00:46:24,636
Gene, Gene.

446
00:46:24,716 --> 00:46:25,952
Move.

447
00:46:32,453 --> 00:46:35,648
If you don't go, I will go.

448
00:46:40,814 --> 00:46:43,981
Gene, wait. Please listen to me.

449
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,917
(Nubsib Missed call.)

450
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,149
Why are you barking so much?

451
00:50:09,872 --> 00:50:11,028
Gene.
