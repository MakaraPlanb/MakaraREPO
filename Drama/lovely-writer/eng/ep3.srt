1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,386
Can Nubsib stay for a month?

2
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,318
Okay. One month is fine.

3
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:09,409
Stay as you please.

4
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,912
The only thing I ask is
to not bother me while working.

5
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,414
Are you an actor?

6
00:00:14,494 --> 00:00:17,540
You've got the wrong guy.
I just moved in with my boyfriend.

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,580
What?

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,310
Can you help me put makeup on?

9
00:00:22,253 --> 00:00:24,796
Can you help me practice my lines?

10
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,122
But it's a kissing scene.

11
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,450
If you're not comfortable
with kissing then never mind.

12
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:31,188
I don't want to put you in
an uncomfortable position.

13
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:33,607
Fine, we can kiss.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,798
Stop, Kin.

15
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,780
Someone might see us.

16
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,478
Kin.

17
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,270
Kin.

18
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,642
Kiss, kiss.

19
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,136
Kiss!

20
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:37,315
Kiss!

21
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,014
Kiss, kiss.

22
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:41,863
Kiss!

23
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,078
Kiss!

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,699
Kiss!

25
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:50,241
Cut!

26
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:52,791
Just kiss already!

27
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,826
This is a Boy Love series.

28
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,147
Kissing scenes need
to be hot and passionate!

29
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,755
If you can't do it
maybe I should do the kissing for you?

30
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:04,570
I'm sorry
but can we use the camera's angle?

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,925
I feel kind of sick
and I'm afraid Aey might catch my cold.

32
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:12,852
Didn't anyone tell me that my boy is sick?

33
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,461
I didn't know that either.

34
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:17,682
I found out the exact moment
you did that Nubsib is sick.

35
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:23,074
That's just great,
maybe I should fake being sick too.

36
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:27,119
I don't want a camera angle, if we can't
do it today then shoot it another day.

37
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,055
Nope, definitely no camera angles.

38
00:02:30,135 --> 00:02:34,866
This scene requires real kissing only
and we have to do at least 80 takes.

39
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,386
So we'll get the best shots, right?

40
00:02:36,466 --> 00:02:39,664
Yes and this is an important
scene too, we have to do it.

41
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,486
Listen up!

42
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,673
Nubsib is feeling sick so he can't kiss.

43
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:45,724
We'll move on to shoot other scenes first.

44
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,196
We're not doing it?

45
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:51,451
Yes and Fah is okay with that.

46
00:02:51,531 --> 00:02:52,571
Fine.

47
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:57,502
PM, go check if my boy is okay.

48
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:59,058
Sure.

49
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:01,226
Let's change the set.

50
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,491
We'll be shooting scene
three of two, next.

51
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,599
Mai, I have something for you.

52
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,686
What is it?

53
00:03:09,192 --> 00:03:11,326
Our sponsor passed this onto me.

54
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:12,900
Add some scenes for it.

55
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,583
I've used this mask before, it's very
good! Should I make a big scene for it?

56
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:22,746
Like actually using the masks in a scene.

57
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,873
Let's have it in the whole scene.

58
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:26,045
Okay.

59
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:33,532
Everyone please hurry up
or we'll be behind schedule.

60
00:03:33,624 --> 00:03:35,162
There are so many scenes left,

61
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:38,047
and if we don't finish on time,
I'm not paying you for over time.

62
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,007
Oh, hello Gene!

63
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:46,040
Hello.

64
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,191
Please take a seat.

65
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,136
Please take a seat.

66
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:55,440
Wow, there's so many people.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,374
Where did the acting
teacher from casting day go?

68
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,307
Oh, he's back at Bangsaen.

69
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,619
He's on a vacation?

70
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,682
He's selling Stir-fried Crab and Basil.

71
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:06,555
What? Why?

72
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:10,554
He was fired after getting
into a disagreement with Fah...

73
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:13,404
so he was fired just like that.

74
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:15,571
Oh! It's that bad?

75
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:20,112
I don't want to spill the tea
but whoever disagrees with Fah...

76
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,988
and argues with her is doomed.

77
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,759
Too bad that Gene
didn't see the kissing scene earlier...

78
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,212
because Nubsib suddenly told us he's sick,

79
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,136
so he didn't want to kiss Aey but
wanted to use the camera angle instead.

80
00:04:31,216 --> 00:04:33,735
The whole crew was confused!

81
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,979
That must have caused some problems.

82
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:40,151
A bit! But it's normal.

83
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:44,311
There's always small
inconveniences happening.

84
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:47,298
But we can't fake the kiss, right?

85
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:51,240
In this day and age,
it has to be real kissing!

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,379
We can't do camera angles or we won't
be able to compete with other series!

87
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:56,691
You understand that right Gene?

88
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,556
Mai, could you check this out?

89
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:01,733
Feel free to hang around, I have to
go check something in front of the set.

90
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:02,679
Mai!

91
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,075
I know! Geez, can't you
guys do anything yourselves?

92
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,416
Hin, I'll be right back.

93
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:18,493
Where are you going?

94
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:28,745
Hello, Bua.

95
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:32,124
Hey Hin, how are you? Is Gene on set yet?

96
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:33,952
I'm at the set.

97
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,466
I think they're setting up for the next
scene, is there something you want?

98
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,128
Yes! Don't forget that
assignment I gave you.

99
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,366
Ah, the promote stuff again?

100
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,898
Yeah, the book sales
are just off the charts!

101
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:50,432
So our publishing house needs a lot of PR.

102
00:05:50,512 --> 00:05:54,797
Okay, I'll take pictures for you to use.

103
00:05:54,878 --> 00:05:57,878
That's fabulous! Don't forget.

104
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,700
Sure! Bua?

105
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,145
My novel I sent you...

106
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:09,398
What...

107
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,143
Where did Gene go?

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,987
=Lovely Writer=

109
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:14,764
Gene? When did you get here?

110
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:18,427
I got here around noon.

111
00:07:18,507 --> 00:07:22,843
Who are you looking for. Is it me?

112
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:29,587
No, I'm just grabbing a bite
and doing research for my novel.

113
00:07:31,271 --> 00:07:35,832
I heard that you're sick
so you didn't do the kissing scene.

114
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:40,675
I have a sore throat,

115
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:43,627
I don't want Aey to catch my cold.

116
00:07:43,707 --> 00:07:48,280
But before this, you weren't sick.

117
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:51,976
I think it's the hot weather.

118
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,694
There's no fever.

119
00:08:03,622 --> 00:08:05,023
That's a good thing.

120
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:07,428
Go find something to eat
and take some medicine too.

121
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:08,610
Gene...

122
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:15,163
Would you stop being so polite?
It's gives me the chills.

123
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,383
I'm being respectful to you,
you're letting me crash at your place.

124
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:22,246
So I want to be good to you.

125
00:08:22,326 --> 00:08:28,541
Whatever! Call me whatever you want.

126
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,834
Are you finished shooting?

127
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,283
Yes.

128
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:38,477
Can you give me a ride back to the condo?

129
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:43,316
Tum had to leave early
so I don't have a ride home.

130
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:45,240
What?

131
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,521
Sure, but I have to tell Hin first
because I gave him a ride over here.

132
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,894
Let's go.

133
00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,632
Shit!!

134
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:01,243
It's okay, Gene.

135
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,931
How can it be okay?
Your shirt is all messed up.

136
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,304
It's okay, I don't have any more scenes.

137
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:08,457
But it's the crew's shirt.

138
00:09:11,716 --> 00:09:15,146
I'll go get changed and then
let's go grab something to eat.

139
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,946
Won't they get mad?

140
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,193
No, it was an accident.

141
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:23,282
How about you take the shirt off
and I'll wash it off.

142
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,997
What are you looking at? Take it off.

143
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:32,271
Take it off here? I'm shy.

144
00:09:33,744 --> 00:09:35,582
I'm just going to go wash it off!

145
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,897
I thought...

146
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,835
Just go change your shirt.

147
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,231
Quickly.

148
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,481
Wait for a minute, Hin's coming soon.

149
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,845
Okay.

150
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,572
Nubsib's also here?

151
00:10:58,012 --> 00:11:03,048
I don't know which is hotter,
the sun or Nubsib.

152
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:04,723
Just one look and I melt.

153
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,213
Sib lives in the same condo
so he's tagging along for a ride.

154
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:14,526
Are you trying to show off
that you live in the same condo?

155
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:15,834
Like hell I am.

156
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:18,793
Get in the car now, I'm hot.

157
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:25,910
Stop making that face and hurry up!
Nubsib is hungry.

158
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:28,199
I know.

159
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,102
Hin, I'm sorry
but can I sit in the front seat?

160
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,264
I get quite car sick.

161
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:37,990
Sure!

162
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,007
Please?

163
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:40,066
Here you go.

164
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:41,206
Thank you.

165
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:46,984
Let me get the door for you,
careful with your fingers.

166
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,403
Come on Hin, stop playing around.

167
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:53,600
Okay, I know.

168
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,064
So how's your novel coming along?

169
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:03,586
I'm just asking, no pressure.

170
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,460
I've written some of it.

171
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:10,721
But if you're not pressuring me
then why the hell are you asking?

172
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:14,313
So that means you're not busy?

173
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:20,683
I'm not busy like right now I'm not busy.

174
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:23,771
Could you take a look at my plot?

175
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,995
When did you start
wanting to become a writer?

176
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,668
I wanted to try writing Boy Love novels.

177
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:37,766
My plot is about the lead being a writer
while the other is the editor-in-chief!

178
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:44,041
Why don't you have Bua read it?

179
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:48,311
I think you might get something
out of talking to her more than me.

180
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:55,111
We're closer and you're my idol!

181
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,888
Another thing is out of all the
writers I know, you're the best.

182
00:13:04,557 --> 00:13:06,826
Tell me the truth, Hin.

183
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,213
Fine.

184
00:13:10,737 --> 00:13:13,638
She doesn't have the time to read it.

185
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:19,632
But you being my idol is not a lie.

186
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:26,336
Why do you want write Boy Love?
It's not easy!

187
00:13:26,852 --> 00:13:29,796
And if you've never written it before,
you'll feel so pressured...

188
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,049
and forced, you've seen what happens.

189
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,839
I know but the Boy Love market
is so popular that I want to try it out.

190
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:44,576
I want money and fame
so things might become better.

191
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:53,056
And another thing is
there are hardly guys writing BL novels.

192
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:56,471
I want to be successful like you.

193
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:03,236
And I might meet someone
handsome like...

194
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,347
You talk too much.

195
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,070
Do you really need to choose violence?

196
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,376
Nubsib, look what Gene did!

197
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:20,668
E-mail it to me
and I'll take a look at it.

198
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,504
Really? For real?

199
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:24,740
Yeah.

200
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,741
Thank you so much Gene! I love
you! I'll send it as quickly as possible.

201
00:14:29,821 --> 00:14:35,529
I knew choosing you as my idol
was not the wrong choice!

202
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,081
(#BadEngineerTheSeries.)

203
00:14:46,613 --> 00:14:51,399
(I ship this couple, I can feel something
there! #SibGene #BadEngineerTheSeries.)

204
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:58,266
Hey, are you okay?

205
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:29,126
There's no need for you to overreact.

206
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:34,399
What are you looking at?

207
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:36,229
Nothing, just looking at the kimchi.

208
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,776
And what are you looking?

209
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm looking at you, looking at me.

210
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:45,671
When did I look at you?

211
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,281
Right now.

212
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:49,094
Getting on my nerves again.

213
00:15:49,175 --> 00:15:51,142
I wasn't trying to.

214
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:53,023
Just eat your food.

215
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:11,331
(Editor-in-Love.)

216
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:15,171
(He suddenly choked on his water.)

217
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:44,320
(Look at the mess you've made,
how did you manage to spill this.)

218
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,726
(I'm was so hungry, if you want to take
care of me then please wipe my lips.)

219
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,384
I just got back to my room, just a minute.

220
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:26,797
What did you just say?

221
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:30,942
How was the shoot today?
Did you guys finish all the scenes?

222
00:17:31,022 --> 00:17:35,855
Almost all, except the kissing scene.

223
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:37,239
Why?

224
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:45,745
Nubsib said the he had a cold
and was afraid that I might catch it...

225
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:51,005
so he wanted to use the camera angle but
Mai said no and the whole scene was moved.

226
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:55,781
That's a good thing,
I don't want you to get sick.

227
00:17:57,946 --> 00:18:02,551
I just find it strange but never mind.

228
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:04,734
I'm happy.

229
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:07,549
That's great that you're happy.

230
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,306
I so sorry I wasn't there
to look after you today.

231
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,710
It's totally fine, didn't you have to
go take care of something today?

232
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,901
Next time I won't miss out, so sorry.

233
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,906
Okay.

234
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,833
I need to get back
to it but get some rest.

235
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,910
Okay, I love you.

236
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:35,507
I love you too,
don't get all sentimental with me.

237
00:18:35,587 --> 00:18:36,789
Okay.

238
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:43,116
(Aey is so adorable!!
#BadEngineerTheSeries.)

239
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:44,735
(Even from the side he still
slays!! #BadEngineerTheSeries.)

240
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:46,228
(That smile! Brb gonna die
#BadEngineerTheSeries.)

241
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:47,815
(That smile! Brb gonna die
#BadEngineerTheSeries.)

242
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:50,443
(Look at Namcha and Kin playing
together! Too cute #BadEngineerTheSeries.)

243
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,381
(Namcha is always looking at Kin,)

244
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,355
(I can smell love in the air
#BadEngineerTheSeries.)

245
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:02,208
(These two pics are so sweet that it makes
sugar taste bland! #BadEngineerTheSeries)

246
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:09,288
(I ship this couple, I can feel something
there! #SibGene #BadEngineerTheSeries.)

247
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:07,364
They should already kiss in this scene,

248
00:20:07,444 --> 00:20:10,101
just putting their faces close
is not enough.

249
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:12,452
But that's harassment.

250
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:16,790
Believe me, it's not harassment!
Write it again.

251
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:47,717
There's a lot you need to change,
it just doesn't make sense.

252
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:50,460
But I think it has a main point.

253
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:53,677
The lead saying I love you
to the other lead...

254
00:20:53,757 --> 00:20:55,379
that's the only man on this earth?

255
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:59,071
I know but the readers
want to be entertained,

256
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:03,381
if there's not only one
in this world might make it better.

257
00:21:04,173 --> 00:21:09,048
People won't read it if it's too serious,
they could just read a research paper.

258
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,589
Fix it.

259
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:48,776
There's not enough NC, 2 chapters
with NC then 1 with none is okay Gene.

260
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,598
Then we're just selling sex now.

261
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:56,394
No, we're selling ships and
moments for people to sail with!

262
00:21:56,474 --> 00:22:03,090
I want a lead who is always
kissing and horny! You understand?

263
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:24,870
No more!

264
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:31,672
I don't want to do this anymore, please.

265
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:36,445
Please, Bua?

266
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,159
Please, Bua?

267
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:13,045
Hey Gene, our university friends...

268
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,091
are having a party, are you free? Join us.

269
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:19,652
Wait a minute.

270
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,050
Are you sleeping?

271
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:27,591
Are you sleeping?

272
00:27:27,671 --> 00:27:31,545
Who would know that you're sleeping?
So are you coming?

273
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:38,044
Sure, but I'm free
only on Saturday and Monday.

274
00:27:38,682 --> 00:27:42,286
Okay, I'll tell them.

275
00:27:42,366 --> 00:27:44,750
Did you know that Jim has a girlfriend?

276
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,687
There's only you and me who is single now.

277
00:27:49,937 --> 00:27:52,696
If you know someone
then introduce them to me.

278
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:54,026
I'm not picky.

279
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:58,443
I can't even find one myself,
like I have the time.

280
00:27:58,523 --> 00:27:59,965
I'm always working.

281
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:03,443
Speaking of work,
did Nubsib leave for class yet?

282
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,318
I think so.

283
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:14,887
Do you have his class schedule?

284
00:28:15,617 --> 00:28:17,642
I do, why?

285
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:25,627
I think I'm going to pick him up
and grab a bite.

286
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:29,028
The kid has got some serious luck.

287
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,779
I was right to leave him with you.

288
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,204
Shut up and send me the damn schedule.

289
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:36,645
Fine.

290
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,976
Okay, thanks.

291
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:41,979
I have to get back to work.

292
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:45,710
-Bye.
-Bye.

293
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:19,084
(Rice is in the cooker.)

294
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:44,899
(Eat up!)

295
00:30:27,344 --> 00:30:29,645
(Does bottoming the first time hurt? 18+.)

296
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:32,923
(You should try but if you're
still under age then don't.)

297
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:35,422
(The first time hurts so much so
don't expect any pleasure from it.)

298
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,992
It hurts so bad.

299
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:56,717
(Beginner's Guide to Bottoming.)

300
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:24,386
(A film for you to research.)

301
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:47,583
Hello.

302
00:32:48,786 --> 00:32:49,922
It's me.

303
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:52,339
Hello, Gene.

304
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:59,184
Are you done with class? Hello?

305
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,595
Hello.

306
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,969
Hello, Nubsib can you hear me?

307
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,043
Yes, I can.

308
00:33:08,543 --> 00:33:11,565
Then why didn't you answer me?

309
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,087
Nothing, I was just shocked
that you called me.

310
00:33:17,687 --> 00:33:20,233
Shocked that I called? Why?

311
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,931
I never thought that you'd call me.

312
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:29,645
Of course I'd call,
I'm on my way to pick you up.

313
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:36,132
I got your number from Tum,
I thought we'd grab a bite.

314
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:37,844
Today?

315
00:33:39,644 --> 00:33:40,586
Today.

316
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:42,483
I'm very available.

317
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:47,980
Just wait there and I'll go pick you up.

318
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,712
Pick me up in front of my faculty.

319
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:54,696
Pick me up in front of my faculty.

320
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,259
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

321
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,655
Okay, bye.

322
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:31,667
Nubsib, get in the car.

323
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,427
Did you wait long?

324
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:44,770
Not at all, I just got here
and you arrived.

325
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:52,736
You didn't wait long but
you're sweating all over.

326
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:58,617
Let's go to Chinatown, I want noodles.

327
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:01,424
Anything you want.

328
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,845
-What are you smiling at?
-Nothing.

329
00:35:08,888 --> 00:35:10,571
Getting on my nerves again?

330
00:35:11,149 --> 00:35:13,964
I think you're cute
so I was caught off guard.

331
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:15,150
What?

332
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,118
That's dangerous! Be careful.

333
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:22,848
It's because of you! Are you crazy?

334
00:35:25,566 --> 00:35:27,668
You don't need to flatter me so much.

335
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:31,560
Flatter? That wasn't my intention.

336
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,857
It's just a compliment.

337
00:35:34,524 --> 00:35:36,602
Compliment?

338
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:41,746
Should I be happy
that a guy called me cute?

339
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,756
Has a guy ever said you're cute?

340
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:57,661
No, only you.

341
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:05,555
I'm glad that I'm the only guy
who has said that you're cute.

342
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:39,984
(Here are some more films,
I'm afraid only one is not enough)

343
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:43,166
(but if you wanna dig deeper,
you might have to try it out LOL.)

344
00:37:07,734 --> 00:37:09,501
What are you doing?

345
00:37:09,582 --> 00:37:11,138
Hey!

346
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,207
Hey!

347
00:37:27,919 --> 00:37:29,306
A sex scene?

348
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:32,297
That's just rude.

349
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:46,905
It's something I'm working on,
I feel like it's not good enough yet...

350
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:48,526
so I have to change it a bit.

351
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:54,742
Do you need my help?

352
00:37:56,677 --> 00:37:57,806
Help with what?

353
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:00,011
We could try those positions.

354
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:03,743
Are you mad, joking about this stuff?

355
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:06,421
It's all up to you,

356
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:11,647
if I help
you might get a better picture.

357
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:15,458
A better picture? Of what?

358
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:21,489
Wouldn't it be weird if we...

359
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:27,367
Just acting out the
positions not actually doing it.

360
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:31,787
Roleplay! Didn't you say
that you're on a deadline?

361
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:38,544
Are you for real?

362
00:38:39,053 --> 00:38:42,120
If I help, you might finish early.

363
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,299
What?

364
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,122
You helped me practice my lines
so I want to return the favor.

365
00:38:50,058 --> 00:38:56,476
Don't need to worry,
I learned it in a Workshop.

366
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:04,054
What do I have to do?

367
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,427
Just stay still.

368
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:10,384
I'll lead.

369
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:28,819
I feel strange.

370
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,700
You don't like it?

371
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,430
If you're not okay with it, I can stop.

372
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,016
Wait.

373
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,491
Why? Is this position uncomfortable?

374
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:57,279
It's very uncomfortable.

375
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:39,203
How about this?

376
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:46,587
Because if you're not comfortable,
you might get hurt.

377
00:40:48,341 --> 00:40:49,457
Hurt?

378
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,230
What are you laughing about?

379
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,944
You might hurt yourself,
don't overthink it.

380
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:00,426
I wasn't thinking about anything.

381
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:29,509
Fuck! Get off! Nubsib! Enough.

382
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:33,198
I'm sorry, Gene.

383
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,740
Are you okay?

384
00:41:37,643 --> 00:41:42,939
I understand now how the feeling is I...

385
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:10,291
I think your NC scenes have gotten better.

386
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:15,537
I understand that.

387
00:42:15,887 --> 00:42:21,413
But from now,
I want hot and steamy scenes.

388
00:42:22,151 --> 00:42:27,978
I think I want to reduce
the NC scenes in this novel...

389
00:42:28,058 --> 00:42:31,075
and focus on the characters.

390
00:42:31,835 --> 00:42:37,363
Sure, but if you can slide
them it then make it extra hot!

391
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:42,288
Try reading the western novel
I sent you the other day.

392
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:48,186
Try to adapt and apply because I think
the sexual tension will be off the charts!

393
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:49,897
Sure.

394
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:53,518
Have you ever tried reading Korean novels?

395
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:56,047
I read on social media that said that
the feedback was very good.

396
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:02,010
Stop! Hin, I already told you that
it's already been done! Shut up.

397
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:08,594
Please, Gene?
Add more in the later chapters.

398
00:43:10,977 --> 00:43:14,360
Please? Add more for me.

399
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:37,780
Okay.

400
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,839
Hello, have you seen Nubsib yet?

401
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:43,859
He's here, gotta go.

402
00:43:43,939 --> 00:43:44,971
Okay.

403
00:43:45,903 --> 00:43:46,912
Nubsib.

404
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:49,996
Gene? Why did you come?

405
00:43:50,707 --> 00:43:52,793
Today I'll be the one
taking you to the shoot.

406
00:43:52,873 --> 00:43:55,273
Tum is busy so he had
me help look after you.

407
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:59,744
Don't worry,
I'll be your guardian for today.

408
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:04,506
Okay, my guardian.

409
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,514
Sib!

410
00:44:10,642 --> 00:44:13,324
Oh, hello, Gene.

411
00:44:14,662 --> 00:44:16,583
Where are you headed?

412
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:18,926
The shoot.

413
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:23,286
Really? Today Aey and Sib
both have scenes to shoot.

414
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,912
So can I tag along?

415
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:29,499
Sure, we're all going
to the same destination.

416
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:32,992
Thank you, Gene! You're the best.

417
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:36,789
Have I told you yet?

418
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:41,101
I've read your fantasy novel before,
it's really awesome.

419
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:45,475
You told me last time but thanks so much.

420
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,951
I really like the character, Stephan.

421
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:50,977
I wish I could be that cool.

422
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:53,978
When I was writing the novel
Stephan was my favorite character too,

423
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,775
and I did the most
research for his character.

424
00:44:55,855 --> 00:45:00,305
Wow, writing a novel is not easy.

425
00:45:01,685 --> 00:45:06,251
I think it's different for each person
but for me, none of my novels were easy.

426
00:45:10,178 --> 00:45:13,414
Are you hungry? Did you eat yet?

427
00:45:13,494 --> 00:45:14,493
Not yet.

428
00:45:14,573 --> 00:45:15,640
What about you?

429
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,854
Nope.

430
00:45:16,934 --> 00:45:21,861
Should we stop at a gas station?
There's still time, right?

431
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:23,001
Yes.

432
00:45:23,522 --> 00:45:24,749
Let's go.

433
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:18,798
Isn't this the women's dressing room?

434
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,653
Excuse me,
there's a man in the dressing room.

435
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,074
I think our customer
went into the wrong room.

436
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,061
This is the women's dressing room.

437
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:34,897
Oh? Really?

438
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:36,341
Yes.

439
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:45,215
I'm so sorry, I thought it was unisex.

440
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,070
It's okay, Gene.

441
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,800
Just take it, if you feel uncomfortable
you can pay me back next time.

442
00:47:19,775 --> 00:47:20,898
Thank you.

443
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:38,221
Are you hungry?

444
00:47:39,646 --> 00:47:41,088
No.

445
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,396
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat anything?

446
00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:54,457
Anything is fine.

447
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:13,485
Just buy something you want to eat too.

448
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:18,872
Let's just say I'm feeling generous today
so I'm paying.

449
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:23,611
Gene.

450
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:28,541
From now on,
you have to be generous to me only.

451
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:49,761
That was quick.

452
00:48:57,132 --> 00:49:02,471
Are you and Tum close?
I see you guys together all the time.

453
00:49:02,993 --> 00:49:09,088
We're university friends so we're close.

454
00:49:11,755 --> 00:49:13,205
Oh, it's like that.

455
00:49:14,051 --> 00:49:18,317
So that's the reason
you and Nubsib are close?

456
00:49:21,866 --> 00:49:26,711
I don't think I'm as close to him as you!

457
00:49:26,791 --> 00:49:29,386
Aren't you guys university friends?

458
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,827
Not really, we're not that close.

459
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,939
I just thought that it's strange.

460
00:49:41,243 --> 00:49:43,708
I'm so jealous of you.

461
00:49:43,788 --> 00:49:46,894
It seems like Nubsib likes you.

462
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:54,503
What? Like me? That's not true.

463
00:49:58,118 --> 00:49:59,145
Really?

464
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:07,073
You don't need to service me,
I can wipe it myself.

465
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:15,870
That's so cute,
you guys wipe each other's mouth.

466
00:51:26,108 --> 00:51:29,643
Take it.

467
00:51:29,723 --> 00:51:31,976
The light is almost green,
I'll eat it later.

468
00:52:24,336 --> 00:52:26,318
What do you need me to do?

469
00:52:27,342 --> 00:52:29,771
What should we have you do...

470
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:32,227
Should we have you ask
Tawan to be your boyfriend?

471
00:52:32,307 --> 00:52:35,174
I'm so shy!

472
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:37,204
Me too.

473
00:52:37,968 --> 00:52:39,355
I don't think that's a good idea.

474
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:40,771
Of course it is.

475
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:42,196
Don't you agree?

476
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,784
Oh, my! That's Kin!

477
00:52:46,864 --> 00:52:51,174
He's so hot.

478
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,094
I know!
Namcha, do you still want my signature?

479
00:53:11,174 --> 00:53:12,397
I do.

480
00:53:12,477 --> 00:53:16,942
Go hug Kin nice and hard
then you can have my signature!

481
00:53:17,308 --> 00:53:20,151
Wow! That's just fab!

482
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:26,152
Quickly, if you want it
then go hug him tightly!

483
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:36,050
Kin.

484
00:53:38,492 --> 00:53:40,144
Kin.

485
00:53:45,797 --> 00:53:46,898
Kin.

486
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,129
What?

487
00:54:05,194 --> 00:54:06,594
It's me.

488
00:54:06,674 --> 00:54:08,148
Spit it out.

489
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:12,660
I wanted their signatures...

490
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:18,672
and they said that I had to...

491
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:23,538
hug you!

492
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,758
You!

493
00:54:56,838 --> 00:54:58,179
I'm sorry.

494
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:02,192
Maybe he likes you.

495
00:55:03,746 --> 00:55:05,514
What the fuck are you playing at?

496
00:55:07,961 --> 00:55:09,175
Cut!

497
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:15,338
Nubsib, can you hear me?
Push Aey's arm a bit slower.

498
00:55:15,418 --> 00:55:19,923
Don't need to rush it?
And Aey, when you hug Nubsib,

499
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:25,970
I want you to really hug him, okay? Again.

500
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:30,218
Again, everyone.

501
00:55:30,298 --> 00:55:33,253
Please come to your positions on set,
we're doing it one more time.

502
00:55:33,334 --> 00:55:39,251
Actors are ready, sound, camera,

503
00:55:40,843 --> 00:55:42,553
and action.

504
00:55:57,265 --> 00:55:59,902
(Aren't you coming today?)

505
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:04,701
(Could you look after Aey?)

506
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,633
(Sure.)

507
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:20,685
(Thank you so much.)

508
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,776
Hey, Gene.

509
00:56:46,225 --> 00:56:50,575
You look really good today!

510
00:56:51,105 --> 00:56:53,862
I wanted to try a new look,
what do you think?

511
00:56:55,834 --> 00:57:00,533
Very sharp, all the guys
can't take their eyes off you.

512
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:03,715
Guys my ass.

513
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:10,065
Oh, our friends are meeting
up on Saturday, 9:00 PM at Hotel L.

514
00:57:10,577 --> 00:57:14,992
Hotel L? I think I'll drive there.

515
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:18,457
That's great and you can drop me off
on the way home.

516
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:24,753
Nubsib's become really attached to you,
he's always asking about you.

517
00:57:26,564 --> 00:57:29,576
That's not true, attached like hell.

518
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,038
But you're letting him stay
and you don't have a problem with it.

519
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:36,214
It's come this far, you should
just let him live with you.

520
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:40,481
No! We're not close.

521
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:44,183
And another thing is you only have
one month left...

522
00:57:44,264 --> 00:57:47,296
and then you gotta come
to take him back.

523
00:57:48,696 --> 00:57:51,686
Really? Not close?

524
00:57:52,562 --> 00:57:54,297
That's right.

525
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:10,817
Hey.

526
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,359
I've been living here so long...

527
00:59:28,937 --> 00:59:31,667
but this is the first time
I've seen you do a face mask.

528
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:38,089
I found it in the fridge, is it yours?

529
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:40,417
I remember that you're the presenter.

530
00:59:40,871 --> 00:59:42,048
You remember?

531
00:59:43,556 --> 00:59:49,251
Yeah, I'll be having a small
reunion with my university friends.

532
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:52,553
I'm afraid
they'll say that I've gotten old,

533
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:57,691
I've not been getting much sleep
so can I have it?

534
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:01,918
Have you been sleeping for a long time?

535
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,200
About half an hour.

536
01:00:24,793 --> 01:00:26,278
I think that's okay now.

537
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:40,885
Wow, time really flies!
It's almost a month.

538
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:50,386
Is there something you want to say?

539
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:56,012
Nothing!

540
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:00,627
Can I ask you something?

541
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:06,605
What is it?

542
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:12,511
How do you feel after I moved in?

543
01:01:18,555 --> 01:01:19,745
I feel good.

544
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:29,367
That's all?

545
01:01:31,710 --> 01:01:37,809
What response do you want?
Living with you is the best!

546
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:44,022
I don't have to hire a maid!
Are you happy now?

547
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,854
You're so cute.

548
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,743
Cute. Cute. Cute.

549
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:04,773
Hey.

550
01:02:21,403 --> 01:02:22,689
Shit!

551
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:25,855
I think you're cute.

552
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,576
That's dangerous! Be careful.

553
01:02:30,648 --> 01:02:31,741
Hey.

554
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:36,885
Nubsib's become really attached to you,
he's always asking about you.

555
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:39,263
I'm so jealous of you.

556
01:02:39,343 --> 01:02:42,324
It seems like Nubsib likes you.

557
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:49,718
Cute my ass!

558
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,923
Have you found a new place yet?

559
01:02:56,259 --> 01:02:58,662
Gather your stuff
and get ready to move out.

560
01:03:31,571 --> 01:03:33,891
Let's go Sib,
go get your stuff so we can leave.

561
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:35,652
He probably really doesn't
want you to stay and bother him.

562
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:37,356
You're running your mouth again.

563
01:03:37,436 --> 01:03:39,077
Why are you suddenly so mad?

564
01:03:39,157 --> 01:03:40,819
Why are you suddenly so mad?

565
01:03:40,899 --> 01:03:42,257
Cheers!

566
01:03:42,337 --> 01:03:44,104
Don't tell you're...

567
01:03:44,184 --> 01:03:45,143
Gay?

568
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:46,981
Hey, Sib.

569
01:03:47,061 --> 01:03:48,305
How did you get here?

570
01:03:48,385 --> 01:03:49,805
Gene please behave yourself.

571
01:03:49,885 --> 01:03:50,964
Did your boyfriend buy this for you?

572
01:03:51,044 --> 01:03:53,344
I've been staying with
you for almost a month.

573
01:03:53,424 --> 01:03:54,515
And you still don't know?

574
01:03:54,595 --> 01:03:56,067
You look like you have one.

575
01:03:56,147 --> 01:03:57,413
Because you're so handsome.

576
01:03:57,493 --> 01:03:59,681
I know you're trying to seduce me.
