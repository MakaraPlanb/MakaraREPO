1
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:06,841
Don't tell me that you're...

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:09,735
Or did you begin
to like guys around that time?

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:11,481
I'm confused.

4
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:13,160
It's okay.

5
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:15,560
Can you sleep with me tonight?

6
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:17,121
Just sleeping.

7
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:18,401
-Gene?
-Hey.

8
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:19,481
Ouch!

9
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:22,041
Gene, you're not being careful.

10
00:00:22,121 --> 00:00:23,240
Sweet dreams.

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,841
But why do you want to stay here so badly?

12
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:28,840
Because I like you.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,920
(Previously)

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,680
(Lovely Writer)

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,240
(By Wizard)

16
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:49,366
I've read the latest chapter, Gene.

17
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:50,759
Oh, my!

18
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,151
My heart is beating so hard!

19
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,319
The NC scenes are good,

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:57,200
like so much better!

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,932
I called you
as soon as I finished reading it!

22
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:00,988
I want to scream!

23
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:03,840
The lead is just so hot,
reading it has got me...

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,961
Like wheezing for air!

25
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:09,001
But I'm a bit curious.

26
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,721
Why did you change the lead's career
from being an actor...

27
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,481
but into a writer?

28
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:15,881
You also changed the name
from "LOVE ACTOR"

29
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,560
to "LOVELY WRITER."

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,330
Or are you in love?

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,640
It's nothing.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,924
I just wanted the character
to be a writer...

33
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,080
because I'd be more in-depth with it.

34
00:01:33,665 --> 00:01:35,000
Another thing is...

35
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:37,587
I want to write about our industry.

36
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:39,954
Are you going to throw shade at me again?

37
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,452
But it's okay.

38
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,777
Because it's gotten more fun now
and I like it too.

39
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:47,610
But don't take it too seriously, Gene.
We're writing it for entertainment.

40
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,381
To make it even better,

41
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:51,681
I think you need to add more NC scenes.

42
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:55,398
Guaranteed!
The readers will be so into it!

43
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,562
I'm sure!

44
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:58,841
Okay, I'm not going to bother you.

45
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,310
Keep working on the manuscript!

46
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,748
I'm going to hang up now,
I'm waiting to read it.

47
00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,828
Okay. Goodbye, Bua.

48
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,444
(#Badengineer
They look so cute! Love them #SibAoey)

49
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:37,227
(#SibAoey #Badengineer
Look at Kinn's hand on Namcha! Dead!)

50
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,961
(There's no need for words
when Aoey looks at Sib)

51
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,041
(#SibAoey #Badengineer
it's all in his eyes, I can see it!)

52
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:54,038
Don't you ever mess with him again.

53
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:56,118
Otherwise, don't say I didn't warn you.

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,400
Who the hell do you think you are?

55
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,280
His parent?

56
00:03:06,162 --> 00:03:07,200
Or boyfriend?

57
00:03:08,614 --> 00:03:09,720
You're not!

58
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,480
So stop trying to tell me what to do.

59
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,643
In reality, you're just a damn wuss...

60
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,919
who's secretly in love with him
but too scared to say,

61
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:28,200
and all he can do
is harass the person he likes.

62
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,029
Mind your own damn business!

63
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,166
Just remember
that I won't let anyone bully him!

64
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,039
Cut!

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,361
There was wonderful! So real...

66
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,160
But I want another take.
This time, I want it over the top.

67
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:52,963
I'll keep it
and use it to choose from later.

68
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,424
As for the crew, I want a close-up shot.

69
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:58,504
Quickly!

70
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,200
Gene.

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
Oh, Aoey.

72
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,720
You've come today?

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,000
I had a bit of free time today.

74
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:24,560
You should come more often.
I haven't seen you in such a long time.

75
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,464
I also bought your novel.

76
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:33,544
Could you sign it for me?

77
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:36,520
Sure, come on.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,975
Thank you.

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,480
With you here,

80
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,040
it makes me even more nervous.

81
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,305
You're going overboard.

82
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:57,472
Don't you have a scene to do next?

83
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,745
I do.

84
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:01,440
The next scene is where...

85
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,560
Namcha will be felt up by Kinn
in the toilet.

86
00:05:12,524 --> 00:05:13,680
You've got this.

87
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,480
So, I think I'll...

88
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,080
Gene?

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,121
It's that...

90
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,720
You know that I like Sib, right?

91
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:41,800
It's just that...

92
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,160
I don't know what to do.

93
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,320
Should I tell Sib?

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,680
And if he's doesn't feel the same way,

95
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm afraid I might lose a friend.

96
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,920
And he doesn't seem
to be interested in me.

97
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,920
So I don't know what to do.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,882
You write these kinds of novels
so you might know what to do.

99
00:06:11,962 --> 00:06:13,962
So I wanted to ask for your advice.

100
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:22,560
Or is it because Sib's a guy?

101
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:26,280
Well, if Sib likes girls,

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,400
then it wouldn't seem strange
that he wouldn't like you.

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,444
Does this mean that I'm out of hope?

104
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:37,900
Well...

105
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,112
Why don't you try writing how you feel
to Nubsib?

106
00:06:56,328 --> 00:06:57,780
To tell how I feel?

107
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:01,766
That's so adorable of you.

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,578
Isn't "Dear John" a bit outdated?

109
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:08,680
Then...

110
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,160
how about sending a text from your phone?

111
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:17,480
What do you think you should I do?

112
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,280
I think I'm going
to try going after Sib more.

113
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,520
Go after him more?

114
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,680
Yes, go after him more.

115
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,600
I'll start with asking him out to eat.

116
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:35,120
It's that...

117
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:40,761
I think I'll invite Nubsib to dinner
for my birthday after the shooting.

118
00:07:40,841 --> 00:07:43,000
Nubsib is staying at your condo, right?

119
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,400
Then after dinner,

120
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,600
I'll drop him off safely.

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,760
Sure.

122
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:58,280
Then...

123
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,231
Can you help me with something?

124
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:05,342
It's just that...

125
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,434
Can you help talk Sib into going with me?

126
00:08:08,514 --> 00:08:09,480
Huh?

127
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,160
Please.

128
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,515
I think that you should talk
to Nubsib yourself.

129
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,292
Please, Gene?

130
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,168
-Or else...
-Aoey?

131
00:08:23,248 --> 00:08:24,498
Why are you sitting here?

132
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:26,001
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the next scene?

133
00:08:26,081 --> 00:08:27,200
Did you go over your lines?

134
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,480
Okay.

135
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,760
Nubsib.

136
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,560
Don't let it drop this time.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,864
Keep your energy up.

138
00:08:39,066 --> 00:08:41,815
And those of you on set,
quickly change the set.

139
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,369
We're going to go over the schedule.

140
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:45,673
So little ques and such low budgets.

141
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,700
(Lovely Writer)

142
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:31,601
We'll take a break now.
I'll see you all after the break.

143
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:33,571
Let's go.

144
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,880
Crew and extras,

145
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:37,560
quickly grab your lunch box
and quickly eat.

146
00:10:05,644 --> 00:10:07,160
You also came today?

147
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah.

148
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,720
Sib, here's some water.

149
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:30,643
I look over and always see you talking.

150
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:32,723
Why aren't you looking at me
while I'm acting?

151
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,031
I've seen it so much that I'm bored of it.

152
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,840
Unlike me.

153
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,635
No matter how long I look at you,

154
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,840
I can never get bored.

155
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:55,560
You should get some rest.

156
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,974
Maybe you should join me.

157
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,440
Tum is over there.

158
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
It's fine.

159
00:11:02,566 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm fine right here.

160
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:11,760
Sib...

161
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,760
Can...

162
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:19,691
we go out for dinner tonight?

163
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:21,920
It's almost my birthday. I'll pay.

164
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,601
We could go to the same hotel
as last time,

165
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,680
and I'll drop you off at home
at Gene's condo.

166
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,160
Maybe some other time.

167
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,120
Why?

168
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,600
You're not going anywhere after the shoot.

169
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:44,640
And Gene's busy.

170
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:46,560
Right?

171
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,560
You're busy?

172
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,400
I...

173
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,309
Hey. Are you guys going to talk for long?

174
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:05,040
Hey, that group.
Come and eat or we'll run out of daylight.

175
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,109
Come on, Sib.

176
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,200
Let's go.

177
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,341
Kinn...

178
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:57,401
That hurts.

179
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,680
Good.

180
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,920
So your brain will remember
that you shouldn't make me angry.

181
00:13:03,393 --> 00:13:06,200
You want to tell my business
to Tawan so much, right?

182
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,120
Fine.

183
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:21,360
Keep roll. Keep roll.

184
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,566
Stand a bit further from each other.

185
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:27,566
Kinn, can you be more aggressive?

186
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:30,561
As for Namcha,
like the woman from "365 days,"

187
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,721
act like you don't want to,
but you actually want it.

188
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,321
"I'm ready to be yours."

189
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:36,661
Do you get it?

190
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,280
Come on, let's do it again

191
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:41,559
Three, two... Action.

192
00:13:42,577 --> 00:13:44,080
Let go of me!

193
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,621
Kinn, that hurts!

194
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,840
Good!

195
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:53,466
So your brain will remember
that you shouldn't make me angry.

196
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:58,206
You want to tell my business
to Tawan so much, right?

197
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,840
Fine.

198
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,521
Keep roll. Keep roll.

199
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,745
Kinn, I want you to be more aggressive.

200
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:18,840
More touching and more dramatic.

201
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,134
But this is almost rape.

202
00:14:22,214 --> 00:14:24,000
From the script that I read,

203
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,247
Kinn wasn't that aggressive.

204
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,327
And doesn't Kinn become more gentle later?

205
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,735
Just do what I tell you to do.

206
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,456
They're in love.

207
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,421
Don't you understand soap opera vibes?

208
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,760
Don't ask so many questions.

209
00:14:38,146 --> 00:14:40,905
Just do what I tell you.

210
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:43,520
Come on. Three, two... Action.

211
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,929
That hurts.

212
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,160
Kinn.

213
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:52,575
Nubsib, slip your hands into Aoey's shirt.

214
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:58,260
Yep, Slip right in. Slip your hands in.

215
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,041
Yeah, use your fingers.

216
00:15:00,121 --> 00:15:02,981
Aoey, try to pull his hand out,
but you can't do it...

217
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:05,061
and get seduced by it.

218
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,697
Moan a bit...

219
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,777
Just like that...

220
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,644
Fabulous.

221
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,724
Nubsib, kiss for real.

222
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,860
A real juicy kiss.

223
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,200
Kiss.

224
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:26,560
Just like that.

225
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,859
Just like that, Nubsib.

226
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,092
Now, Aoey, I want your arms
and legs to go weak.

227
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:23,641
Act more shyly.

228
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,200
Try to fight him off.

229
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Sib, I want more loving.

230
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,161
How was it? Did you like it?

231
00:16:34,241 --> 00:16:36,162
I guarantee you
that after seeing this scene,

232
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:39,440
the fans will tear their pillows apart.

233
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,360
Is there something wrong?

234
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:46,730
Was my directing not good or what?

235
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:51,255
Oh, nothing.
It's just that I feel a bit hot.

236
00:16:51,335 --> 00:16:53,703
I think I need to sit somewhere
less crowded.

237
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:55,201
Hey, don't go yet.

238
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,521
The next scene is a highlight.

239
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,841
I ensure you that is scene
will be so heart-wrenching.

240
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,720
I thought you wanted to see it.

241
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,680
It's okay. Please go ahead.

242
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,429
What's up with him?

243
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:14,024
Or is he hot because the scene I directed
was hot?

244
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:17,552
Okay, cut. That take was okay.

245
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:38,880
Is this the cushion
that everyone is saying that's so good?

246
00:17:39,677 --> 00:17:41,677
Do you think it suits me?

247
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,601
This one is suitable for sensitive skin.

248
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:48,476
The cream is lighter and it's not thick
so it doesn't make you get pimples.

249
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,556
Sib has to use this
because his face is really sensitive.

250
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,376
What about this sunscreen?

251
00:17:55,456 --> 00:17:56,640
What do you think?

252
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,400
This one?

253
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,120
I don't think it's good
if your skin is oily.

254
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,351
Why?

255
00:18:10,431 --> 00:18:13,917
You didn't even try it yet,
so how do you know it's not good?

256
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:15,134
For some things,

257
00:18:15,214 --> 00:18:17,214
you know with a slight look
and the person using it.

258
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:20,941
Are you picking on me?

259
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:23,240
No, I'm just saying the truth.

260
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,560
For you, you're more suitable
for another formula.

261
00:18:30,954 --> 00:18:32,360
Then...

262
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:35,600
Are you free this evening?

263
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:38,831
Can you go help pick out
the one that suits me?

264
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,577
Sure.

265
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:49,800
What time do you want to go?

266
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,563
Today, shooting ends early.
How about we go to a nearby mall?

267
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:55,840
Deal, right?

268
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:58,441
See you at the parking lot. Okay?

269
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:05,240
Good work.

270
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,400
(Arghhhh. My main hardly ever lives.)
(My Kinn.)

271
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,363
(Please get some rest,
both Nubsib and Tum.)

272
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:22,160
Does Nubsib have lots of work?
(So cute.)

273
00:19:22,978 --> 00:19:24,172
Yes, he does.

274
00:19:24,252 --> 00:19:25,880
There's no time to rest.

275
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,200
Is there anything you'd like
to say to fans?

276
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,560
Thank you for every support.

277
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,960
What are you doing?

278
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,555
Let Tum stop the live video first.

279
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:40,785
Just a moment.

280
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:45,437
Are you going to the event
at Siam Paragon?

281
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,840
We'll have to see if Nubsib
is available at the time or not.

282
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,320
I think I can go.

283
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:52,800
Don't get me in the live.

284
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:57,290
That's it for today's live, everyone.

285
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,081
Just enough for those who miss him.

286
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,400
When we have some free time,
we'll have a long live session.

287
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,120
Say something before we go.

288
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,672
See you again, bye-bye.

289
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:06,880
Bye.

290
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,920
Okay, all done.

291
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,269
Why are you guys going live here?

292
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:15,451
Why don't you go live at home?

293
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:17,661
I don't live with him anymore.

294
00:20:17,741 --> 00:20:19,440
I'm just afraid his fans might disappear.

295
00:20:20,923 --> 00:20:22,844
You can do the live at my room.

296
00:20:22,924 --> 00:20:23,931
Have I ever complained?

297
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,801
Don't get all angry at me.

298
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:28,960
Come on, let's go.

299
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:34,960
Sib.

300
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,541
Are you finished?

301
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,760
Let's go for dinner.

302
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,419
I already told you
that we'd do it some other time.

303
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,401
Can't we go today?

304
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,441
It's almost my birthday.

305
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:57,280
Please?

306
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:02,120
Another thing is, if you go home now,
you wouldn't know what you'd eat.

307
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,760
It won't take long.

308
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,360
I'll drop you off at your doorstep.

309
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,923
Please?

310
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,400
Please, can we go have dinner?

311
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,800
Please?

312
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,881
I'm going to go pee.

313
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,440
Then, I'm going with you. Let's go.

314
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,600
What do you think?

315
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,031
What?

316
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,560
Do you want me to go?

317
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,530
Gene.

318
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,587
If you don't want me to go,

319
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,880
then I won't.

320
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,790
Wanting to go or not,

321
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,061
that's up to you.

322
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:58,420
So that means that if I go,

323
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:01,240
you're okay with it?

324
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:10,400
Then take a shower and get some rest.

325
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,974
When I get back,

326
00:22:13,054 --> 00:22:15,054
I'll try to be as quiet as I can.

327
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,904
Okay.

328
00:22:22,392 --> 00:22:24,050
See you in front.

329
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,292
Sure.

330
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,720
Gene.

331
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,600
Thank you

332
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,601
I think that...

333
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:44,440
today, I'm going to confess my love
to Nubsib.

334
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:48,240
See you.

335
00:22:58,551 --> 00:22:59,600
Hey.

336
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,731
What the hell are you looking at?

337
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:05,880
Nothing...

338
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,112
Should we go?

339
00:23:07,192 --> 00:23:09,400
Of course, Nubsib's not here anymore.

340
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,741
Do you want to go grab a bite?

341
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,760
Sorry, I can't go.

342
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,680
I'm already going to go see someone.

343
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,509
Fine.

344
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,589
I'll go home and eat by myself.

345
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:05,000
That's all it takes to help
with how much you missed us. Bye.

346
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:15,980
Say bye-bye.

347
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,388
Why did you have to push me?

348
00:24:21,468 --> 00:24:22,720
Then what did you just do?

349
00:24:23,468 --> 00:24:25,720
I just took a story. It's for the fans.

350
00:24:28,262 --> 00:24:29,200
Let's go.

351
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,200
I thought you were going to bail on me.

352
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,181
Sorry.

353
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:55,000
I was doing a live video with Nubsib.

354
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,920
Come on, let's go.

355
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:03,440
Wear this.

356
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:14,810
(Tum, come back and take Nick
to Teacher Durian's acting class.)

357
00:25:17,554 --> 00:25:18,720
Haven't you ridden this before?

358
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:21,475
Uh, yeah.

359
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,476
Not really.

360
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:25,476
So I'm not really used to it.

361
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:27,476
You can hold on to my waist.

362
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,930
You'll be safe. I won't crash.

363
00:25:50,571 --> 00:25:51,480
Okay.

364
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,102
Why?

365
00:25:54,182 --> 00:25:55,320
Does it make you uncomfortable?

366
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:57,760
Or are you secretly crushing on me?

367
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,920
All hell would break loose.

368
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,401
Thank you for helping me choose.

369
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,000
It's that I see the reviews
and I'm scared to buy it.

370
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,249
It's always so over the top.

371
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:21,177
Actually, it's up to that person's skin.

372
00:26:21,257 --> 00:26:24,240
Some might review that it's great,
while some would say it's not.

373
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,320
It's normal.

374
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,200
I buy based on reviews too.

375
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:29,280
Some of it, I used and don't see results.

376
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,400
I give it to the kids
in the modeling department to use.

377
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,708
But honestly?

378
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:36,121
I always use the same ones.

379
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,720
Some brands,
I've been using up to five bottles.

380
00:26:40,873 --> 00:26:42,721
But you're really good at this.

381
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,521
You know more than me.

382
00:26:44,601 --> 00:26:46,661
You're really conscious
of beauty and appearance.

383
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:48,280
You're almost prettier than a girl.

384
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,001
Today, you're dressing differently.

385
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,240
Are you changing up your look?

386
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:57,111
Why?

387
00:26:57,191 --> 00:26:58,121
Is it not good?

388
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,654
It's good,
but it's just not like before this.

389
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,280
But do you like it?

390
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,081
Why?

391
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,120
Why would you ask me if I like it or not?

392
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,701
If you like it, then just dress like that.

393
00:27:18,781 --> 00:27:20,781
You don't need to care about other people.

394
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,035
(Sister Tarm is calling)

395
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:43,332
Hello, Sis.

396
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:45,716
What are you doing?

397
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,880
What is it?

398
00:27:48,261 --> 00:27:49,902
I'm in the middle of something.

399
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,640
What did I order you to do?

400
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,440
I already took Nick to his acting class.

401
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,480
And what next?

402
00:27:57,915 --> 00:27:59,721
I already had an appointment with someone.

403
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,200
Why'd you order me so suddenly?

404
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,240
Did you tell me first?

405
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,920
No.

406
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,782
But I already did everything
you planned out.

407
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,440
So could I have some personal time?

408
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:12,953
What do you do with your personal time?

409
00:28:16,001 --> 00:28:18,001
Is that Tam?

410
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,084
Can you stop acting like a child, Tum?

411
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,440
Sis,

412
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,200
I don't understand.

413
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,200
I did everything you told me to do.
What else do you want?

414
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,321
Managing the actor's lives
in a modeling agency isn't fun.

415
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:41,841
But don't you forget...

416
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:45,207
that every penny you spend comes
from that work.

417
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,200
You can't even do this simple task.

418
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,120
And that office job
as a graphic designer you want to do?

419
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:54,749
I don't think you could survive that.

420
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:56,040
And people like you...

421
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:12,240
Hey.

422
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,211
You can go take care of your errands.

423
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:17,600
You've been helping me out all-day.

424
00:29:18,939 --> 00:29:20,440
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

425
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,280
Never mind.

426
00:29:22,939 --> 00:29:24,468
She's always like this.

427
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:25,560
You know that.

428
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,400
Let's eat.

429
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
What do you think?

430
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,049
Do you want me to go?

431
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:21,800
Wanting to go or not,

432
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,680
that's up to you.

433
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,640
I think that, today,
I'm going to confess my love to Nubsib.

434
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,840
Haven't you had anything to eat yet?

435
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:48,080
Well?

436
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,853
Do you want to ask me something?

437
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,942
Ask...

438
00:31:58,022 --> 00:31:59,040
Ask what?

439
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,480
You're always looking at me.

440
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:03,560
You have something to ask me, right?

441
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:11,608
But if the person asking is Gene...

442
00:32:13,717 --> 00:32:15,300
then I can answer anything.

443
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,460
I wasn't...

444
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:27,660
Fine.

445
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,720
If you want me to ask, then I'll ask you.

446
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,800
How was it?

447
00:32:36,013 --> 00:32:37,400
I'm fine.

448
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,720
Not that.

449
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:43,160
Then what?

450
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,800
You just went to dinner.

451
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:50,600
How was it?

452
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,233
It was good. The food was delicious.

453
00:33:05,745 --> 00:33:07,666
If you want to try it,

454
00:33:07,746 --> 00:33:09,640
we can go together sometimes.

455
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,211
I didn't want to know about that.

456
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,640
Then what else is there to know?

457
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,650
If you're not straightforward,

458
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,560
then it's hard for me to answer.

459
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,941
What did Aoey say?

460
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,080
Are you guys together yet?

461
00:33:32,217 --> 00:33:33,640
Oh, about that.

462
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,827
And why do you think I'd be with Aoey?

463
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,360
Well...

464
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:46,724
Today, I saw you guys in the parking lot.

465
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,280
Did you see?

466
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:52,159
Yeah...

467
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,560
It was a coincidence.

468
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:56,575
It's not like that.

469
00:33:57,024 --> 00:33:59,024
I went with Aoey...

470
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,322
because we had to talk about something.

471
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:06,840
Talk?

472
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:09,040
About what?

473
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,760
Today,

474
00:34:12,816 --> 00:34:15,151
didn't I see you talking to Aoey
at the shoot?

475
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,486
I saw your pouting face at the shoot.

476
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,040
And...

477
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,110
did you guys get into a fight?

478
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:30,720
No.

479
00:34:32,886 --> 00:34:34,886
Aoey and I are just friends.

480
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,920
Nothing more.

481
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,013
If I knew
that you were going to get jealous,

482
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:46,196
I wouldn't have gone with Aoey
in the first place.

483
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:48,880
Jealous?

484
00:34:49,851 --> 00:34:50,971
Who got jealous?

485
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,024
I asked cause I just wanted to know.

486
00:34:53,104 --> 00:34:57,120
Don't tell me you saw me and Aoey kissing
and you're overthinking about it?

487
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,472
Today,

488
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:10,680
I saw you and Aoey on my timeline.

489
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,880
And...

490
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,960
when I went to the parking lot,

491
00:35:17,088 --> 00:35:18,920
I really thought you guys
liked each other.

492
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,735
Gene, you should know...

493
00:35:23,347 --> 00:35:26,633
that the series wants us to promote stuff.

494
00:35:29,786 --> 00:35:30,840
But...

495
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,520
it looks really real.

496
00:35:34,673 --> 00:35:35,680
There it is.

497
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:37,520
You're jealous.

498
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,440
Sib.

499
00:35:41,126 --> 00:35:43,046
If it doesn't look real,

500
00:35:43,126 --> 00:35:44,600
then who would believe it?

501
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:53,680
As for the kiss, it's only for work.

502
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,570
But kissing with my feelings...

503
00:35:57,647 --> 00:35:59,280
I don't want to kiss anyone...

504
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,000
except for you...

505
00:36:16,152 --> 00:36:18,152
You don't need to get jealous of me.

506
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,000
I told you I wasn't.

507
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,505
I'll try to believe you.

508
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,800
What are you doing?

509
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,890
When you get jealous,
you like to puff your cheeks.

510
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,607
It's really cute, you know?

511
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm going to go take a shower.

512
00:37:19,091 --> 00:37:21,141
"Happy birthday to Aoey."

513
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:24,640
"I hope you'll be
your cute self forever. From Art."

514
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:10,600
Nothing tastes good.

515
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:31,640
Everything sucks.

516
00:38:52,137 --> 00:38:54,137
(Studying Bakery in France.)

517
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,435
(If it's possible
I don't want to return to Thailand.)

518
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:00,789
(I want to stay and bake there.)

519
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,160
(This Saturday is your birthday.)

520
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,440
(Can you come home
and eat dinner with all of us?)

521
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,600
(Everyone at home is waiting for you.)

522
00:39:18,338 --> 00:39:19,840
Cause love is not a joke...

523
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,800
You want to say it, but can't

524
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,485
Want to listen, but...

525
00:39:24,565 --> 00:39:27,269
Want to listen but can't.
It's not easy and can't you say it all.

526
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:29,269
The story of love that's there.

527
00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:31,800
Love is probably good

528
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,495
I want to tell you...

529
00:39:33,575 --> 00:39:36,600
I want to tell it to you every day
so you can hear me.

530
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,320
The love inside.

531
00:39:38,986 --> 00:39:40,960
Oh, you also came today?

532
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,120
I've been here since early morning.

533
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,601
I came really early today.

534
00:39:46,681 --> 00:39:48,621
Why? I have to look after Sib.

535
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,661
But you're being strange, waking up early.

536
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:53,080
What compelled you out of your room?

537
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,160
Sib?

538
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,080
What does that have to do with him?

539
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,522
Then what would it be?

540
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,877
It's because I went to sleep early,

541
00:40:03,957 --> 00:40:06,410
and I have to do some research
on my novel.

542
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,951
-Has Sib seen you yet?
-I don't know.

543
00:40:11,031 --> 00:40:12,225
I don't think so.

544
00:40:12,305 --> 00:40:16,840
Whatever. He'll see you soon enough
because he has an invisible GPS on you.

545
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,970
(Tiffy)

546
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,480
What's that?

547
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,440
I'll be right back.

548
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,840
I need to take this.

549
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,040
Are you a hamster?

550
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,258
You can't keep it in your cheeks.

551
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,280
What are you doing?

552
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,160
Feeding you snacks.

553
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,320
I know that.

554
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,811
I mean, why are you feeding me?

555
00:41:51,563 --> 00:41:53,563
I want you to eat.

556
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,821
If you want to eat,
then just eat it yourself.

557
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,261
I'm not hungry.

558
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,234
But you wouldn't stop chewing on it.

559
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:09,680
Don't you have to be on set?

560
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,880
Almost.

561
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,973
I have to go change soon.

562
00:42:15,053 --> 00:42:17,668
Nubsib, you can go change your outfit.

563
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,960
Please excuse me.

564
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:09,450
(I had Waew prepare everything,
please come back this Saturday.)

565
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,720
Aoey, I'm so sorry I'm late.

566
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:17,441
I was so lost
that I had to have Tum pick me up.

567
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:18,640
It was so hard to find.

568
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,255
What's wrong?

569
00:43:28,753 --> 00:43:30,200
Nothing.

570
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,680
It was just an ad text.

571
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:39,680
Don't overthink, Aoey.

572
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:43,800
I know you're under a lot of stress,
but you're going on set soon.

573
00:43:44,383 --> 00:43:48,283
So leave everything behind
and concentrate, okay?

574
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:52,640
It just so that the director
won't bitch at us.

575
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,080
I'll be right back.

576
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,577
I'm hungry.

577
00:43:59,657 --> 00:44:02,301
I'm so late. I don't know
if there's any food left for me on set.

578
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:03,895
I'll be right back.

579
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,480
I'm going to get the sheet from my friend.

580
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,280
Where do you want me to wait?

581
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,800
Do you want to go eat cake
in front of my university?

582
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,952
Cake?

583
00:44:41,032 --> 00:44:41,960
Is it good?

584
00:44:42,641 --> 00:44:44,361
I don't eat dessert.

585
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:46,720
But I've seen reviews
on popular pages before.

586
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,661
Sure, fine.

587
00:44:50,741 --> 00:44:53,001
Send the location,
and I'll go wait at the cafe.

588
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,080
Okay.

589
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,448
When you hear about dessert,

590
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,000
you just can't stop smiling.

591
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,840
I'm going to go now.

592
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:29,321
Is that the person we saw on Twitter?

593
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,880
-I think so.
-Take pictures.

594
00:45:39,801 --> 00:45:41,722
He's so cute.

595
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:43,880
Take more pictures.

596
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,240
It's not good to take pictures
of other people.

597
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:05,581
I'm sorry. It's just that, he's so cute.

598
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:07,641
So we wanted to take his pictures
to share in our group.

599
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:09,600
We have no bad intentions.

600
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,280
I understand, and I'm not debating on it.

601
00:46:16,136 --> 00:46:17,840
He really is cute.

602
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,250
But I think you should ask
before you take photos.

603
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:30,960
Then can we take photos
of the both of you?

604
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,880
Gene, they want to take photos of us.

605
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,280
Can they?

606
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,651
One, two, three...

607
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,865
One, two, three...

608
00:46:59,738 --> 00:47:03,021
Can you both move closer?

609
00:47:03,101 --> 00:47:04,200
Sure.

610
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,800
Look at the camera. One, two, three.

611
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,874
Can you take photos from my phone?

612
00:47:14,954 --> 00:47:16,954
Sure.

613
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:25,496
Look at the camera. One, two, three.

614
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,553
Can you take our photo?

615
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,240
Okay.

616
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,021
Smile, look at the camera.

617
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:42,400
One, two, three.

618
00:47:43,687 --> 00:47:45,687
Another picture, One, two, three.

619
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,301
-All done.
-Thank you.

620
00:47:48,381 --> 00:47:49,878
You're welcome. Thank you.

621
00:47:59,196 --> 00:48:00,880
-Cute.
-What?

622
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,320
They go to the same university as you?

623
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,080
How cute.

624
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,800
Yep.

625
00:48:29,131 --> 00:48:30,421
What about you?

626
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:32,501
I hardly see you go anywhere
with your university friends.

627
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,440
Or do all your friends have girlfriends?

628
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:37,411
Why do you want to know?

629
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,650
Well, I was just asking.

630
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,170
If you want to ask, then ask about me.

631
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,970
Why would I ask
about stuff I already know?

632
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,400
Are you sure?

633
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,997
Then...

634
00:48:54,077 --> 00:48:56,400
Do you know what I like?

635
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,840
I do...

636
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,560
Me.

637
00:49:09,706 --> 00:49:11,800
I know you were going to say that joke.

638
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,840
Very smart.

639
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,200
You're starting to get me.

640
00:50:25,954 --> 00:50:26,980
Aoey...

641
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,000
How are you?

642
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:13,440
I'm fine.

643
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,811
Is life out there hard?

644
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,120
I'm used to it.

645
00:51:30,626 --> 00:51:32,810
If you're not okay, then come home.

646
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,800
I'm okay, Earn.

647
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:48,782
Happy Birthday, Aoey.

648
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,480
Thank you.

649
00:52:08,181 --> 00:52:09,520
Mhok...

650
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:14,066
Aoey, I forgot to tell you.
I also invited Mhok over for dinner.

651
00:52:14,146 --> 00:52:15,941
Our parents miss him.

652
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:17,640
I saw you're in the series together.

653
00:52:19,025 --> 00:52:21,696
Mhok is always giving me updates on you.

654
00:52:23,991 --> 00:52:25,480
You're still the same as always.

655
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:31,194
I'm going to go check on Waew's cooking.

656
00:52:31,274 --> 00:52:34,360
Aoey and Mhok, stay and talk
until Mom and Dad get home.

657
00:52:41,017 --> 00:52:42,080
Hey.

658
00:52:43,017 --> 00:52:44,480
You finally came back.

659
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:50,120
Why are you always trying to run away?

660
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,810
Why am I always trying to run away?

661
00:52:59,642 --> 00:53:00,840
Let me think.

662
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,240
It's because I don't want to talk to you.

663
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:10,518
And the next time you're coming,

664
00:53:10,598 --> 00:53:12,800
please tell me
so that I don't have to come.

665
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:16,440
Actually,

666
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,926
Mom and Dad would be so happy...

667
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:23,031
if their son weren't me,

668
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,480
but was you instead.

669
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,839
And you'd probably be so happy
to part of this family.

670
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:36,261
I saw you've always wanted
to be part of this family.

671
00:53:36,341 --> 00:53:37,400
Right?

672
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,240
There's nothing good about it.

673
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,865
Say what you want,

674
00:53:44,945 --> 00:53:49,000
but I'm glad to see you step down
from your ego...

675
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:50,810
to care about others.

676
00:54:25,653 --> 00:54:26,880
Why did you come back?

677
00:54:32,418 --> 00:54:36,600
Didn't Earn tell you
that I was coming back for dinner?

678
00:54:39,428 --> 00:54:43,049
She said everyone missed me so much.

679
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:46,720
Yes.

680
00:54:47,488 --> 00:54:50,527
I didn't think
that it would be a bad thing,

681
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:53,450
and we haven't seen Aoey
in such a long time.

682
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,680
Aren't we going to eat?

683
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,320
If you're not,
then I'm going to eat now.

684
00:55:11,595 --> 00:55:13,181
You're probably out of money.

685
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:14,320
Dad.

686
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,560
I really want to know...

687
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,970
Would you come home
if you didn't run out of money?

688
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:30,040
This is just what I thought.

689
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,760
But I'm not that desperate.

690
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,246
Don't worry.

691
00:55:37,326 --> 00:55:38,880
I'm not worried about you.

692
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,019
You can sit on your high horse,

693
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,681
but don't think that what you're doing
is going to make enough money.

694
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,280
So you can go learn
and make that damn bakery in France.

695
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:55,467
Look at your sister.

696
00:55:55,547 --> 00:55:58,944
She's never let us down nor made us worry.

697
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:01,920
It's you who are stupid...

698
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:06,663
and like to act lowly.

699
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,960
So?

700
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,332
Being what you want me to be
is uncomfortable!

701
00:56:25,352 --> 00:56:27,352
You already took everything away from me!

702
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:31,400
My future, my lover, my life!

703
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,022
Aren't you happy yet?

704
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,840
Are you full?

705
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:47,880
Or if you're not,

706
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,880
what else do you want to eat?

707
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,771
Because all I have left are bones
for you to pick at.

708
00:56:55,851 --> 00:56:57,721
-Aoey...
-Mind your own damn business!

709
00:56:57,801 --> 00:56:59,001
Don't try and argue with me!

710
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:01,472
You're still as evil as before!

711
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,911
Don't you remember?

712
00:57:05,991 --> 00:57:09,444
That person who said he loved you so much
tricked you!

713
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,040
You loved each other so much that you
tricked me that you needed cram classes.

714
00:57:15,275 --> 00:57:16,413
How did that turn out?

715
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:18,241
I just gave him some money,

716
00:57:18,321 --> 00:57:21,040
and he carried that money away,
closing his shop to abandon you.

717
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,800
What you did...

718
00:57:29,658 --> 00:57:31,579
didn't fill me.

719
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:32,909
Honey.

720
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:34,910
But it embarrassed me.

721
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,520
That's enough.

722
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:56,578
Aoey.

723
00:57:56,658 --> 00:57:59,880
If you think you're so great,
then don't ever come here again.

724
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:03,520
And if you hate me so much,

725
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,001
then don't think of this place as home.

726
00:58:06,081 --> 00:58:09,000
Get the hell out
because I never had a son like you.

727
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:10,800
Dad...

728
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,802
I'll go talk to Aoey.

729
00:59:06,482 --> 00:59:07,760
Aoey...

730
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,180
Is this another one of your schemes?

731
00:59:18,249 --> 00:59:20,696
You knew if I came back
that it would be like this.

732
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,320
Why would you make me come back?

733
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,489
It's not like that.

734
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:28,490
I just wanted our family
to be together like we used to be.

735
00:59:28,922 --> 00:59:30,160
The same us we used to be?

736
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,520
Do you know when things
were never going to be the same?

737
00:59:37,577 --> 00:59:40,490
It was never the same
since you told dad about Time and I.

738
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:46,640
My life is like this because of whom?

739
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:49,320
Are you happy now, Earn?

740
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,831
Is it going according to your plan?

741
00:59:55,482 --> 00:59:56,520
The same as always.

742
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,121
Mark my words.

743
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:00,760
It's never going to be the same.

744
01:00:03,657 --> 01:00:04,730
Fine...

745
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,228
I hate you!

746
01:00:06,308 --> 01:00:07,838
Back then, I was jealous of you!

747
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:09,280
Are you happy?

748
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,466
You're the favorite son.

749
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:15,520
You get all the good things.

750
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:19,840
I worked my ass off,
but never got anything good.

751
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,613
So I went ahead and told dad.

752
01:00:24,674 --> 01:00:27,080
But now,
I know that I don't want it anymore.

753
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,743
Ever since you left,
dad won't stop pressuring me.

754
01:00:33,324 --> 01:00:36,141
I never knew what you went through...

755
01:00:36,221 --> 01:00:38,040
until I found out for myself.

756
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,262
I'm so sorry, Aoey.

757
01:00:42,022 --> 01:00:43,200
I'm sorry.

758
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:47,680
Thank you.

759
01:00:50,058 --> 01:00:53,344
Thank you for at least being honest
with yourself.

760
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,800
But you want me back home...

761
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,800
to get dad off your back?

762
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,272
That's great...

763
01:01:08,352 --> 01:01:09,480
and really selfish of you.

764
01:01:10,352 --> 01:01:11,600
That's enough.

765
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,840
Calm down.

766
01:01:23,808 --> 01:01:25,360
I'll take care of this.

767
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:39,840
I'll take you home.

768
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,560
Can you stop bothering me?

769
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,571
You're the one who is making this worse.

770
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,101
Come on. Do you want to walk?

771
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,520
It's dangerous.

772
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:01,589
Let go of me!

773
01:02:01,669 --> 01:02:03,031
I said, let go of me!

774
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:04,120
Let go!

775
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:06,960
Let go of me.

776
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:11,280
Let go! Let go!

777
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,600
Let go of me!

778
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,078
Isn't my day already bad enough?

779
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:49,600
It's okay.

785
01:04:30,461 --> 01:04:31,840
Is there something wrong?

786
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,800
There's nothing wrong.

787

I wish you all the happiness in the world.

And I wish for you
to be my cute brother like this forever.

Don't get all sentimental.

796
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,080
At first, I was going
to surprise you at the set.

797
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:24,320
Come on. Make a wish
and blow out the candles.

798

Yeah.

799
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,820
You took such a long time
to make your wish.

800
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,880
What did you ask for?

801
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:57,221
I wished for you
to be my lovely manager forever.

802
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,400
Wow. No doubt.

803
01:06:02,279 --> 01:06:03,840
Don't cry.

804
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,320
Tiffie.

805
01:06:15,632 --> 01:06:17,632
Can I lie on your lap?

806
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,440
Sure. Come on.

807
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,680
Aoey?

808
01:06:46,237 --> 01:06:47,440
Is there something wrong?

809
01:06:49,379 --> 01:06:51,080
Do you want to tell me about it?

810
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:58,880
I just wanted to lie on your lap.

811
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,560
Just let me lay like this for a while.

812
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,283

813
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,442

Yeah.

824

I'll meet you there.

From now on,
be more careful of what you post.

827
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,301
There's something I want to warn you.

828
01:09:44,381 --> 01:09:46,381
I want you to stay away from Aoey.

829
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,960
Thank you for looking after Aoey for me.

830
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,640
It's alright.

831
01:09:54,423 --> 01:09:57,701
Hey. What happened?
What made you come home?

832
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:00,000
I thought you already forgot
about your family.

833
01:10:00,317 --> 01:10:02,747
Gene, when did you come home?

834
01:10:02,827 --> 01:10:05,581
This is Sib.
Standing right next to his father.

835
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:07,040
Please excuse me.
