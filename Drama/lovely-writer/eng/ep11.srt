00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,525
(Previously On Lovely Writer)
I've talked to your mother.

2
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:07,275
From now on,

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:09,225
I can't stop anything

4
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,650
between your love with Gene.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,125
You are still together with Nubsib, right?

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,225
Yes.

7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,225
Tiffy.

8
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,375
I really like you.

9
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,350
Will you believe me now?

10
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:20,075
I can believe you.

11
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,875
Don't you want to play at the beach?

12
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:23,950
The beach?

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,325
I can go with you.

14
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:25,850
Nubsib!

15
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:38,700
(#Geneisafool #SibGene #SibAey #BadEngineer)

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,600
(Is this the reason why I didn't see Aey
and Nubsib together recently? #SibGene)

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,925
(The male lead is indecent and
the writer needs a beating #SibGene)

18
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,575
(The couple I ship is moving fast.
Serve the official couple fans right #SibGene)

19
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:48,950
(They look like a match. #SibGene)

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,275
(How could Nubsib do that to Aey?
I pity Aey #SibGene)

21
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:53,425
(I couldn't accept this if I'm Aey.
The company should do something #SibGene)

22
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,575
(Young writer taking advantage of his own actor.
How convenient #SibGene)

23
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:55,475
(Did he know that he has violated the
third law by stealing someone's partner? #SibGene)

24
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,750
(How can the company
allow this to happen? #SibGene)

25
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,500
(I support them. I can separate
the series and the reality #SibGene)

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,050
(There's a real-life couple.
How can I still watch the series? #SibGene)

27
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,825
(Stop the broadcast.
I can't watch it anymore #SibGene)

28
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,525
(Nubsib, I'll stop being your fan.
We'll stop supporting you #SibGene)

29
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:00,375
(While the fake couple earns money,
the real couple is having fun #SibGene)

30
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:00,925
(SibGene is real!
Fujoshis, please respect them.#SibGene)

31
00:01:00,925 --> 00:01:01,625
(Aey, I hope the series ends now so I can
beat them both for not respecting you #SibGene)

32
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,125
(I'm totally speechless #SibGene)

33
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:02,775
(There's such a big change to Aey
I couldn't keep up with him #SibGene)

34
00:01:02,775 --> 00:01:03,450
(My SibAey can't end like this.
I'm running out of breath #SibGene)

35
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,300
(Whoever ships this couple,
please block me. So annoying #SibGene)

36
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,675
Nubsib.

37
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:43,775
What's wrong?

38
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:45,650
Let's take a picture together.

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,625
Are you uploading it to Instagram?

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,175
No.

41
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,500
I want to send it to my family.

42
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,400
Look at the camera.

43
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:03,025
One, two.

44
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,700
Hey, can you stop pretending
that you look better than me?

45
00:02:13,325 --> 00:02:15,075
I didn't do anything.

46
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:19,625
Are you trying to say that you
look good without even doing anything?

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,225
No.

48
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:25,625
Fine.

49
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:28,650
Let's make funny faces.

50
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,100
How?

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,400
Like this.

52
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,400
Hurry up.

53
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,750
One, two, three.

54
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,075
One, two, three.

55
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,025
Put some effort when you make your funny faces.

56
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,325
One, two, three.

57
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:02,900
Hey, Nubsib!

58
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,450
Nubsib!

59
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,475
Hey, that tickles!

60
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:07,125
Nubsib!

61
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:09,650

Hello.

73
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,150
Oh, it's nothing. I'm fine.

74
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:25,975
It's really nothing.

75
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:26,950
I'm fine.

76
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,175
Is it because of the hashtag, SibGene?

77
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,450
I'm worried about you.

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,400
No.

79
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,550
It's not because of that.

80
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,150
What happened on Twitter,

81
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,900
about the hashtag, SibGene.

82
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,700
I saw people scolding Gene and Nubsib.

83
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:17,450
All of you, please don't scold Gene.

84
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:21,275
Gene is a person I like and appreciate a lot.

85
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,425
Maybe things are not what they seem to be.

86
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,125
I think we shouldn't come to
a conclusion because of a few pictures.

87
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,100
Actually,

88
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,825
if they are together,

89
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,450
I will not say anything.

90
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:56,200
But I feel sad

91
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,800
knowing something like that happened.

92
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,675
It's bad for everyone.

93
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,850
To be honest, Gene, Nubsib

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
and I.

95
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,325
All three of us are getting along well.

96
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,475
What happened between Nubsib and Gene...

97
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,050
I'm not sure

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,950
because I'm not the one involved.

99
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,850
Besides, I don't think I have the right
to talk about their matters.

100
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,500
Even if there's something between them,

101
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,450
I won't mind.

102
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,025
I just hope that...

103
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,050
I just hope that none of you
will forget about SibAey.

104
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:34,125
I just hope that all of you
can keep supporting me.

105
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:12,008
(Aey, I'll always support you #Aeylive)
(Aey, don't cry #Aeylive)

106
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:14,600
(They don't love you but I do. #Aeylive)
(He is always around Nubsib. Now I know why. #Aeylive)

107
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,578
(I pity Aey #Aeylive)
(Wait for their statements #Aeylive)

108
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:19,625
(He is just pretending #Aeylive)
(Beware when you go out, Gene #Aeylive)

109
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,765
(This is showbiz #Aeylive)
(Best Actor in Oscar #Aeylive)

110
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:25,425
(You are not a real couple. #Aeylive)
(Do your best, Aey #Aeylive)

111
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:27,789
(If I were him, I'd drown the jerk #Aeylive)
(Aey is too nice. #Aeylive)

112
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,050
(I know why he picked Gene now #Aeylive)
(Gene is much cuter #Aeylive)

113
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,922
(Aey, come home with me #Aeylive)
(He's such a good actor #Aeylive)

114
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,300
(Nubsib escaped!!!! #Aeylive)
(I'll give you a hug, Aey #Aeylive)

115
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,875
(Tiffy: Aey, are you all right?
Do you need me to be there for you?)

116
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:18,300
(Tiffy: Aey, how are you? I'm worried about you.)

117
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,100
(Tiffy: Aey)

118
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,375
(Tiffy: Aey, say something.)

119
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:33,750
(Tiffy: How can I help you
if you don't reply to my messages?)

120
00:09:59,425 --> 00:10:01,850
Bua, I'm here to show you the completed novels.

121
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,000
Hin, do you know your position?

122
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,025
What did I hire you to do?

123
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,125
What did you do instead?

124
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:20,175
You are not doing the job I've given you

125
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,300
but you're doing this.

126
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,800
Do you know what has happened?

127
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,075
Look.

128
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:31,075
You don't know

129
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:33,400
because you are not focused on your own job at all.

130
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,750
See for yourself.

131
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:43,025
The hashtag, SibGene on Twitter.

132
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,175
Do you know how much the sales
have taken a hit because of this?

133
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:49,025
It gave the publishing company such a bad image.

134
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,675
Where were you?

135
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,300
Were you together with Gene?

136
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,175
Did you remind him?

137
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,975
I don't want to say this, Hin.

138
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,025
If you made a mistake at your job,

139
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:04,275
I'd have to get someone who
won't make any mistakes to replace you.

140
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,150
Do you want that to happen?

141
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,800
No.

142
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,575
Bua, I'm really sorry.

143
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:14,225
Hold it.

144
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,125
Apologizing is not enough.

145
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,775
What do you want me to do?

146
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,200
I think you should be able to figure it out.

147
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,900
Otherwise, why do I spend
so much money to hire you?

148
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,125
Am I right?

149
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,875
But this is unfair to Gene.

150
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,975
Whether it's fair or not depends
on your perspective on this issue.

151
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,425
Now that it has happened,

152
00:11:48,525 --> 00:11:49,925
you need to solve it

153
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,675
by all means.

154
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,125
I'll do my best.

155
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:01,300
Wait.

156
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,750
Bring your things back.

157
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:07,125
If you can't solve the problem,

158
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,975
I won't help you look at it.

159
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
I hope you can understand.

160
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,150
I'm pressured by my superior too.

161
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,350
I understand.

162
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,750
What is it?

163
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,800
Tum, where are you?

164
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,325
I'm on my way back.

165
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:36,425
I'm at the petrol station.

166
00:12:36,425 --> 00:12:37,525
What is it?

167
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,750
Open the link I sent you right now.

168
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:43,825
What is it?

169
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:45,600
She sounds rush.

170

(The battle for the male lead)
(Writer VS Actor)

171
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,150
Have you seen it?

172
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,925
Yes.

173
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,625
How could you let that happen, Tum?

174
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,175
Do you know?
The TV station is very unhappy about this.

175
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:14,625
They called me and chewed me out.

176
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:15,825
Why didn't you think it through?

177
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,175
What now? Your so-called private life
has affected work.

178
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,300
Can't you be more mature?

179
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,000
I can explain.

180
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:25,550
That's...

181
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't waste your time apologizing to me.

182
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Go and take care of things.

183
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,375
It must be the same thing.

184
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,450
You've seen the news, right?

185
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,100
Yes. I've seen it.

186
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,675
Why did you and your artist behave like that?

187
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,250
I thought you were different
from the other talent managers.

188
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,275
I thought we can communicate well.

189
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,625
-Tiffy, no...
-In the end, it's still the same.

190
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,575
I feel I'm so stupid.

191
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,425
I thought we won't end up like this.

192
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,850
Listen to me.

193
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:05,200
Enough.

194
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,025
I can't contact my artist now.

195
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:08,925
Didn't you see his live broadcast?

196
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:10,475
He looks so sad.

197
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:12,900
Tiffy, listen to me.

198
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,225
It's over for us.

199
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,150
Tiffy.

200
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,375
Nubsib,

201
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,575
did you go to the beach?

202
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:58,450
No.

203
00:14:58,475 --> 00:14:59,925
I was sitting by the pool.

204
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:00,875
When I tried to stand up,

205
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
I slipped and fell.

206
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,150
Go take a bath and get changed then.

207
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,700
Don't move.

208
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,950
What are you doing?

209
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:16,925
Nubsib.

210
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,350
You might wet the floor.

211
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:20,775
Let me go.

212
00:15:20,775 --> 00:15:21,575
I can walk myself.

213
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:22,200
Don't move.

214
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,075
You're not as light as you think.

215
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,025
Do you have the right to say I'm heavy?

216
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,475
How dare you say I have no right?

217
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:33,325
I did so much more than that to you.

218
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,625
Stupid Nubsib.

219
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,950
You should eat less

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,500
so I can carry you more easily.

221
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,325
Can you stop talking like a pervert?

222
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:45,825
I'm not thinking about anything.

223
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:47,825
That means you are thinking about it.

224
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:20,125
This room is so troublesome.

225
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:25,450
An apartment is troublesome for you?

226
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:29,350
You are the one who's causing me trouble.

227
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,125
The room is so big.

228
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:36,800
Why do you like to stay
in the small room beside mine?

229
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,875
That's because it's beside yours.

230
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,100
Is this the one in your car?

231
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:00,625
You like it this much?

232
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,750
You think of it as your family?

233
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,250
You're jealous of a doll?

234
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,200
No.

235
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:11,950
But I used to be jealous of it.

236
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,550
What?

237
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,925
You were jealous of a doll?

238
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,425
Don't you remember?

239
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,000
We had a quarrel because of the doll.

240
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,875
At that time,

241
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,575
when I entered your room,

242
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,550
I saw how much you treasured it.

243
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,425
So, I wanted the doll,

244
00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:42,350
but you wouldn't give it to me.

245
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,550
So, we had a quarrel and Auntie Run heard it.

246
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,875
So my mother gave it to you secretly.

247
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:56,900
You finally remember.

248
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,350
Why did you steal other people's things?

249
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,400
I didn't understand at that time.

250
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,675
I understood when I grew up.

251
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,675
That's because I was jealous of it.

252
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,150
Jealous of a doll?

253
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:22,750
Yes.

254
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:27,000
You treasured it a lot

255
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,725
so I didn't like it.

256
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,650
I hoped you care more about me.

257
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,225
Are you angry?

258
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:48,675
No.

259
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,500
Why should I be angry?

260
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,475
That's good.

261
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,300
It belongs to you too.

262
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,325
You can play with it anytime you like.

263
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,225
Just don't care about it
more than you do about me.

264
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,225
Seriously.

265
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,250
You've been so jealous since you were young.

266
00:19:15,702 --> 00:19:17,425
You are even jealous of a doll.

267
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:22,250
But you don't have to worry.

268
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,625
I care about you more than anything.

269
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,200
What is it?

270
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,775
Gene.

271
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:54,625
I went looking for you at your apartment

272
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:55,975
but you weren't there.

273
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,750
Oh, what is it?

274
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,250
I have something to tell you.

275
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,575
Is it important?

276
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,625
Can it wait?

277
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,775
It's very important.

278
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,950
Okay. Wait for me.

279
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,200
I'm going back now.

280
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,750
Who is it?

281
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,525
Hin.

282
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,925
He said he needed to tell me something important.

283
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,350
I need to go back to my apartment.

284
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,750
Let me send you there.

285
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,175
There's no need.

286
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,900
We need to keep our distance sometimes.

287
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,900
Gene.

288
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,350
I'm missing you again.

289
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,400
You are exaggerating again.

290
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:20,500
Hin, what's wrong?

291
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,150
What is it?

292
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,300
I bought you food.

293
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,950
Don't act weird around me.

294
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,400
Just tell me what's on your mind.

295
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,725
I'm not acting weird.

296
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:56,883
To be honest, I came here because of you.

297
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,150
You should've seen the news, right?

298
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,475
I've seen it.

299
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,000
Be frank with me.

300
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,325
Are you okay?

301
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,025
I'm fine.

302
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,825
I know it will happen one day.

303
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,775
By the way, Aey is not easy to handle.

304
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:39,000
Who would've thought he'd do that?

305
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:45,650
I'm sure he has his reasons.

306
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,725
Have you talked about it with Nubsib?

307
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,975
Not yet.

308
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,975
Why?

309
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,875
Nubsib seems fine.

310
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,575
I don't dare to tell him.

311
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,925
You came to me because of this?

312
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,825
Yes. I'm worried about you.

313
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,200
I want you to consider it.

314
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:43,000
What do you want me to do then?

315
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,175
I think you should be able to figure it out.

316
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,900
Now that it has happened,

317
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,325
you need to solve it

318
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,250
by all means.

319
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,075
Bring your things back.

320
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,275
If you can't solve the problem,

321
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,125
I'll not help you look at it.

322
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:16,700
To be honest, I don't know yet.

323
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,625
You came all the way here

324
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,375
just to ask me to consider it?

325
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,850
Yes.

326
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,650
I'm worried about you.

327
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,225
I don't want you to think too much

328
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:32,700
or get anxious.

329
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,075
Okay.

330
00:24:38,725 --> 00:24:40,625
I'm fine right now.

331
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,225
When I saw you getting so anxious,

332
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:46,600
I thought you were being chased
by debt collectors.

333
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:52,550
But you are so nice.

334
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,100
You came to remind me yourself.

335
00:24:58,525 --> 00:24:59,750
Do you love me so much?

336
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:00,700
Do you?

337
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:03,150
Do you have feelings for me?

338
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,925
Wait a moment, Gene.

339
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:06,975
If I don't love you,

340
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:08,325
who do you want me to love?

341
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,225
Right?

342
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:16,475
Come on, let me see what you bought me.

343
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,800
It's weird for you to come here.

344
00:25:23,525 --> 00:25:24,325
Shumai.

345
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:33,650
Gene.

346
00:25:34,775 --> 00:25:36,425
I'll be going back first.

347
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,400
You came all the way here.

348
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,450
What's the rush?

349
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:43,425
I have to take care of some matters for Bua.

350
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:44,525
She might scold me again later.

351
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,100
Okay. Hurry up.

352
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,775
Okay. Good luck.

353
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,525
(The Editor Who Risks for Love)

354
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:55,950
(Mom)

355
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,250
Hin, how are you recently?

356
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,875
Are you busy, son?

357
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,800
No. Are you well?

358
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,100
Why do you sound like that, Hin?

359
00:27:18,675 --> 00:27:21,800
It's nothing. I just had a slight fever.

360
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,925
Hin, can you keep doing your work?

361
00:27:29,925 --> 00:27:31,975
Come home if you can't.

362
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,925
I'm so tired, Mom.

363
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,500
Take a rest if you are, son.

364
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,075
It's still the same even if I take a rest.

365
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:51,500
My work is in shambles right now.

366
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,925
I just want a better life for our family.

367
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:57,250
But I couldn't do it.

368
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,975
Hin, I know.

369
00:28:00,225 --> 00:28:04,175
I know you are working
and earning money for the family.

370
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:07,725
But you have to think about yourself now.

371
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:12,325
I'm not happy seeing you like this.

372
00:28:14,075 --> 00:28:15,900
I envy the people

373
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,750
who can live a good life without doing anything.

374
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,225
That's life, Hin.

375
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,550
Life won't tell us that we will be successful

376
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,075
because of our persistence.

377
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,125
But Hin, you are already at your limit, right?

378
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:34,650
I don't know what I should do now, Mom.

379
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,975
I'm proud of you
if you've persisted until your limit.

380
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:41,525
Just let it be, son.

381
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:44,350
I trust that you will become an excellent person

382
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,975
if you overcome all these obstacles, understand?

383
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,775
I miss you, Mom. I want you to hug me.

384
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,200
I love you.

385
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,025
What are you doing?

386
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,325
Hey, you scared me.

387
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,550
I'm reading Hin's novel.

388
00:30:36,825 --> 00:30:38,350
It's cute.

389
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,900
I didn't expect him to have a talent in this.

390
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,400
What is it about?

391
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,125
A story about an editor and a writer.

392
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:55,550
If the novel is cute,

393
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:58,350
why didn't he show it to Bua?

394
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,100
Well,

395
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,100
Hin told me he had shown it to Bua.

396
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,100
But...

397
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,200
I think I'll show her again.

398
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,075
What about your novel?
Have you finished writing it?

399
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,450
It's almost done.

400
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,575
But...

401
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,925
What is it?

402
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:34,125
Right now, the character in my novel

403
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:36,925
is facing his biggest problem in the story.

404
00:31:37,925 --> 00:31:41,625
So, I don't know
how I should continue with the story.

405
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:57,675
Then, is there anything I can help with?

406
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:00,200
You are so shameless!

407
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,175
There you go again.

408
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,600
I haven't done anything yet, Mr. Gene.

409
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,825
Stop it, you.

410
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,750
But you have to promise me.

411
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,675
If we are facing a huge obstacle,

412
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,250
we have to overcome it together.

413
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,775
Nonsense!

414
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,400
I'm talking about the novel.

415
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,975
But I'm talking about the two of us.

416
00:33:16,125 --> 00:33:16,975
Okay.

417
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,500
I promise.

418
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,075
Bua, why did you call me here?

419
00:34:28,325 --> 00:34:29,300
Please take a seat.

420
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,000
You know about everything, right?

421
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,200
Currently, our sales are plummeting

422
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,975
and our company is facing a lot of trouble.

423
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:56,025
You should have known the reason for that, right?

424
00:34:58,175 --> 00:35:00,850
But, I'm just a writer.

425
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,475
I'm not a star.

426
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,350
My private life should not be related to this.

427
00:35:08,175 --> 00:35:11,875
But you are a celebrity in society right now.

428
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,125
Whatever happens to you, whether it's good or bad,

429
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,850
will directly affect our company's sales.

430
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,150
Sorry.

431
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,250
I don't want this to happen either.

432
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:31,350
I get it. You think love is
a matter between two people.

433
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,050
But the consequences of this matter are huge.

434
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:36,900
Just take a look at our publishing company.

435
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,400
If things don't take a turn,

436
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:40,900
it will be bad, Gene.

437
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,475
I am also being pressured by the
series production company.

438
00:35:45,675 --> 00:35:47,575
They want me to take care of my own writers.

439
00:35:49,775 --> 00:35:52,600
Can you find a way to deal with this relationship?

440
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,550
All right? I beg you.

441
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:00,825
Why should I be the one to bear everything?

442
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:05,225
When the company asked me to write BL novels,

443
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,900
I did.

444
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:09,150
How much profit did the company make from that?

445
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,325
But now they are pressuring me?

446
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,025
Do I have to take full responsibility for that?

447
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,200
I don't think it's fair.

448
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:20,800
Gene.

449
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,800
Nothing is fair.

450
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:24,350
You should know.

451
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,300
Look around you.

452
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,325
They did nothing but they have been affected.

453
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:34,475
Don't you think that's selfish, Gene?

454
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:36,525
But...

455
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:38,850
Stop. Listen to me first.

456
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,100
If I can solve it for you,

457
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,950
I would've already done that, Gene.

458
00:36:42,975 --> 00:36:44,600
But I couldn't.

459
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,650
You are the only one who can solve this.

460
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:55,000
Sorry, I hope you can understand me

461
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,475
and also understand it from
the company's point of view.

462
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:04,800
Whatever.

463
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,275
I don't think I have a choice anyway.

464
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,675
Trust me, Gene.

465
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,375
Go back and think about
the importance of everything.

466
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,475
It all depends on you.

467
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,525
Oh, I brought Hin's novel.

468
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,025
I think you should take a look, Bua.

469
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,150
(@Nubsib_PP Nubsib has a boyfriend?
Why isn't it Aey? I'm not okay. #BadEngineerTheSeries)

470
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,525
(Why didn't you think about your fans?
I'm so disappointed. I won't support you again. #SibAey)

471
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,000
(I don't feel comfortable especially
seeing the beach pictures. #SibAey)

472
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,250
(SibGene's fans, please don't talk
about the novel or series #SibAey)

473
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,800
(I don't care if #SibGene is real,
but Aey is better #SibAey)

474
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,300
(I don't think it's that simple after
watching Aey's live. #SibAey)

475
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,725
(Did Gene write the novel so he can
get a celebrity boyfriend who loves him so? #SibAey)

476
00:38:21,725 --> 00:38:23,450
(Whoever likes #SibGene
can unfollow me #SibAey)

477
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,250
(I pity Aey. Stupid Gene.
Just stop watching the series #SibAey)

478
00:39:32,975 --> 00:39:33,950
Sorry.

479
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:36,350
I thought you were asleep.

480
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,700
Not yet.

481
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,775
I can't fall asleep.

482
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,925
What about you?

483
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,875
Aren't you sleeping?

484
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:00,275
I can't fall asleep either.

485
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,775
Why is that?

486
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,875
Sorry. What are you doing?

487
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,425
I'm sleeping. What is it?

488
00:41:09,325 --> 00:41:10,825
There's a minor problem.

489
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,900
I'm at the Entertainment Tower.

490
00:41:13,275 --> 00:41:14,675
Can you come over?

491
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:17,825
What is it?

492
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,200
My sister wants to have a chat with you.

493
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,900
What? Talk to me?

494
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:26,325
Yes. It's about Nubsib.

495
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,525
She already called Nubsib over.

496
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,875
But she knows you are my friend.

497
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:32,750
So she wants to talk to you too.

498
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,775
Then, is Nubsib with you?

499
00:41:39,725 --> 00:41:41,400
He is talking with her.

500
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,825
I come out to call you.

501
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,550
Okay. I'll be there soon.

502
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,575
(Aey: Gene, how are you?)

503
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:58,975
(Aey: I was called by the
production company too)

504
00:42:18,025 --> 00:42:19,700
Everything will be okay, Aey.

505
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,400
Trust me.

506
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,050
Tum.

507
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,300
Gene.

508
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,850
Where are the others?

509
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,100
They are all inside.

510
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,050
What about Nubsib?

511
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:46,725
He has talked with my sister for a while now.

512
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,700
Let's go.

513
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,000
Mr. Gene is here.

514
00:43:05,175 --> 00:43:06,475
Why did you bring Gene here?

515
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,600
I asked Tum to bring him.

516
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,200
Isn't it too much to do this?

517
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,025
It's not.

518
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:30,200
Gene is directly related to this issue.

519
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:36,250
This is for the sake of the benefits of you,
Gene and the TV station.

520
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,600
But don't forget this.

521
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,250
This is not part of the contract.

522
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:42,825
Stop using the contract as a reason.

523
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:44,850
I know what's what.

524
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,725
But you've also forgotten

525
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,175
everything is related.

526
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,375
Didn't you see it already?

527
00:43:54,125 --> 00:43:55,700
What are we talking about?

528
00:43:57,925 --> 00:43:59,700
When Nubsib had his photoshoot at the beach,

529
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,000
you went with him, right?

530
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:03,950
Yes.

531
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:08,150
There's nothing in reality.

532
00:44:08,325 --> 00:44:10,900
Every fan knows that, right?

533
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,675
Gene is Tum's friend.

534
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,850
But pictures about their little moment
have surfaced on the Internet.

535
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:20,075
It isn't weird to have fans
who ship the Nubsib and Gene couple.

536
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,975
The main problem is

537
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,050
that our series is still on air.

538
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,100
The audience will be immersed in the story
while watching the series.

539
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:35,100
The lead characters
of the series are Nubsib and Aey,

540
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,000
not Nubsib and Gene.

541
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,450
The TV station needs to use sweet moments
between Nubsib and Aey to promote

542
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,475
the series, so as to gain viewership.

543
00:44:42,475 --> 00:44:44,475
When this problem breaks out,

544
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,975
the TV station is angry at us.

545
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,825
They are questioning us for the cause of this.

546
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:01,475
(Writer gets actor. Fujoshis' BL dream has come true)

547
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:03,050
I'm not using this to reprimand you.

548
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,975
But I have to use it as evidence

549
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:08,475
to tell you we really have a problem on our hands.

550
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:10,900
The TV station is very angry too.

551
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:17,825
After everything you've said,
how are we going to solve this?

552
00:45:22,175 --> 00:45:24,600
I don't want to say too much.

553
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:26,800
Since it has already happened,

554
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:31,150
I called Nubsib here
to tell him what we are going to do.

555
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,725
As for calling Gene here,

556
00:45:33,725 --> 00:45:35,500
I hope you can cooperate with us.

557
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:36,900
Gene, you should understand, right?

558
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:39,150
Now that it has happened,

559
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:41,950
everything will crumble
if we don't solve the problem.

560
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,825
Yes. I understand.

561
00:45:47,775 --> 00:45:52,125
Okay. I'll be straightforward then.

562
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,600
It might be harsh

563
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,550
but both of you are adults.

564
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,600
You should know what you should and shouldn't do.

565
00:46:00,775 --> 00:46:02,300
From now on,

566
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,425
I hope Nubsib and Gene
stay away from each other.

567
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,650
No photos with each other on social media.

568
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:10,125
No commenting on each other's photos.

569
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:11,975
Don't go anywhere with each other.

570
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:13,900
If we do that, nothing
will fall into the media's hands.

571
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,275
We are just going to let this pass?

572
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,925
Yes, the TV station will
do their own promotions on the series.

573
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,125
Regarding the relationship
between the two of you,

574
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:33,075
this Saturday, the TV station will
have a press conference to clear it.

575
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,600
I can't do that.

576
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,525
Gene is my boyfriend.

577
00:46:43,925 --> 00:46:45,700
How could you separate us?

578
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,325
That's impossible.

579
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:49,325
Don't you get it, Nubsib?

580
00:46:49,325 --> 00:46:50,850
Everything we've just said

581
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,400
is to solve the problem.

582
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,425
Didn't I say it just now?

583
00:46:57,425 --> 00:46:59,450
You shouldn't be in a relationship right now.

584
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,000
But no terms in the contract
that forbid me to be in a relationship.

585
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,475
We didn't forbid it

586
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:08,775
but you shouldn't do it right now.

587
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:10,600
You should know, young actors and models,

588
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,400
especially the ones in BL series,

589
00:47:14,775 --> 00:47:16,575
if you want to have more fans

590
00:47:16,575 --> 00:47:18,675
and keep being popular,

591
00:47:18,675 --> 00:47:20,850
you should forget about
being in a relationship for the time being.

592
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,750
You are clear about this, Nubsib.

593
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:23,875
I'm sorry to interrupt.

594
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:35,020
I think it's fine as long as
they don't do anything in public.

595
00:47:35,925 --> 00:47:38,225
We don't have to go to that extent, right?

596
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:41,025
But can they really do it?

597
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,850
They will still meet
behind everyone's back in secret.

598
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,150
Yes.

599
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,425
Meeting in secret
will still be found out by others.

600
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,950
It's like this.

601
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,800
We are not asking you to break up.

602
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,475
We just want you
to keep your distance for now.

603
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:56,475
When this is over,

604
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,675
you can fall in love with each other

605
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,250
and be together again.

606
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,200
Couples in showbiz are all like this.

607
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,950
There's no problem with that, right?

608
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,425
Exactly.

609
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:05,275
Yes.

610
00:48:17,425 --> 00:48:18,250
Everyone.

611
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,075
I need to apologize to everyone.

612
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:30,725
I didn't expect this to blow up so quickly.

613
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:33,075
It's too late now, Aey.

614
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:36,375
I'm not trying to reprimand you

615
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,300
but please consider it thoroughly

616
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:40,825
before you do something, okay?

617
00:48:46,575 --> 00:48:50,875
Nubsib, you should care about
the feelings of your fans.

618
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:52,250
They are the people

619
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:54,500
who give you jobs and let you make money.

620
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,675
Don't forget about that.

621
00:48:55,675 --> 00:48:57,125
You can't eat your contract anyway.

622
00:48:57,125 --> 00:48:58,575
I'll terminate the contract then.

623
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:01,375
Nubsib.

624
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,350
You don't have to
make it so complicated, Nubsib.

625
00:49:08,175 --> 00:49:09,950
Do you have to terminate your contract

626
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,500
just for a boyfriend?

627
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:13,575
There are only four months left on your contract.

628
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,375
If you terminate your contract now,
you'll have to compensate...

629
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:17,850
I'll pay any amount of compensation.

630
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:21,200
Why do you have to do that?

631
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:22,650
Why?

632
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:25,775
I want you to stay away
from each other. It's not a breakup.

633
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,900
We are trying to make things better, Nubsib.

634
00:49:29,525 --> 00:49:32,100
Are you willing to give up
your future and end your career here?

635
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:34,800
You are famous right now.

636
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,925
You should cherish the opportunity
that everyone is giving you.

637
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,450
Don't contact each other

638
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:44,950
so there are no more rumours.

639
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,000
We'll hold a press conference and tell the media

640
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,450
what they see on the news is not the truth.

641
00:49:48,575 --> 00:49:49,925
You are not a couple.

642
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,750
Everything is just a misunderstanding.

643
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,300
That's all.

644
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:53,975
We can control the public's opinion...

645
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:55,375
That's so selfish of you.

646
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,575
Excuse me for being so straightforward.

647
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:06,450
Ask yourself.

648
00:50:07,475 --> 00:50:09,350
Getting me to break up with Gene,

649
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,600
is it for me, or for all of you?

650
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:14,800
From what I've heard here today,

651
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:16,800
there's not a single point

652
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:18,950
where you are thinking of us.

653
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,475
That's too much, Nubsib.

654
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,275
Enough.

655
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:27,825
We'll do everything as requested here today.

656
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:28,925
Gene.

657
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,950
You understand us. Right, Gene?

658
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,900
All right, everyone. Let's calm down.

659
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,750
There's no better way
to solve this problem now.

660
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:49,950
You should sit down too.

661
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,200
I don't want things
to be like this either, Nubsib.

662
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,100
Please look at it from my point of view.

663
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,175
Why are you scolding me?

664
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,975
Okay, it's decided then.

665
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,325
Don't appear together.
Don't comment on each other's photos.

666
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:09,400
No interaction on social media.

667
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:14,800
All right.

668
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:16,900
I'll do it.

669
00:51:19,325 --> 00:51:20,325
That's all, right?

670
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:22,050
I'll be leaving now.

671
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,075
Gene!

672
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,075
Gene!

673
00:51:25,075 --> 00:51:27,025
Nubsib, we still have things to discuss.

674
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,275
What else is there to discuss?

675
00:51:30,975 --> 00:51:33,100
I'm tired from listening to all of that.

676
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:36,250
Aren't you tired of talking?

677
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,975
Nubsib, come back!

678
00:51:40,925 --> 00:51:43,250
Tum, you need to get Nubsib back
for the press conference.

679
00:51:44,275 --> 00:51:45,200
Tum!

680
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,250
Calm down.

681
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,225
I have calmed down.

682
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:57,875
Did I talk too much?

683
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,200
I'm going to the washroom.

684
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,175
I think that's too much.

685
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:20,050
Why did you force them to break up?

686
00:53:20,175 --> 00:53:21,275
Too much?

687
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,450
What do you want me to do, Tum?

688
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:26,075
I didn't ask them to break up. I just
want them to stay away from each other.

689
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:30,275
I know your personality. If it happens again,

690
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:32,525
you'll still force them to break up.

691
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,125
You're good at guessing.

692
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,725
I'm disappointed with you.

693
00:53:38,975 --> 00:53:40,925
You are too selfish.

694
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:44,250
What kind of person do you expect me to be?

695
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,275
I did everything for our company.

696
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,425
Nubsib still has a selling point.

697
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:54,450
He has much time to find a partner.

698
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,900
How old is he now?

699
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,125
How could you say that?

700
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,075
You did it for yourself obviously.

701
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,275
Really?

702
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:06,350
I did it for myself?

703
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,650
You need to understand.

704
00:54:11,725 --> 00:54:13,450
You are who you are today

705
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:14,975
because of people like me.

706
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,450
Because of my selfishness,

707
00:54:20,725 --> 00:54:22,025
you get to graduate from university.

708
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:28,100
Because of my selfishness,

709
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,875
you possess everything you have today.

710
00:54:35,625 --> 00:54:36,325
Why aren't you saying anything?

711
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:38,875
Am I not telling the truth?

712
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,500
Don't tell me that you're disappointed with me.

713
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,425
Have you asked me before?

714
00:54:49,175 --> 00:54:51,350
How many times was I disappointed with you?

715
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,375
That is why

716
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:54,750
I'm not standing on your side.

717
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,525
Can you still feel anything?

718
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,450
Where is your consciousness?

719
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,050
Don't blame me.

720
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:03,250
You are the same.

721
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,400
Everything turns out like that because of you.

722
00:55:04,975 --> 00:55:06,675
Who can stop that, Sister?

723
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,050
Do you think I don't know, Tum?

724
00:55:12,925 --> 00:55:15,400
You let Nubsib do what he pleases

725
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,150
because you only care about Tiffy!

726
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,200
Is that the personal time you wanted?

727
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,325
Is that it?

728
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:24,875
You only care about others.

729
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,325
Stop interfering with my business.

730
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,525
Who would want a terrible family like this?

731
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,750
No wonder you were abandoned by your husband.

732
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,250
Tum!

733
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,875
Don't get my private matters involved.

734
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:45,975
What?

735
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:48,150
Are you going to hit me?

736
00:55:48,175 --> 00:55:48,900
Come!

737
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,175
Or are you going to beat me up?

738
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,350
Come on!

739
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:57,392
I am that terrible person in your family.

740
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,025
It's enough to be a talent manager.

741
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,900
I'm not a star.

742
00:56:06,225 --> 00:56:08,525
Stop interfering with my business!

743
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:12,775
Tum, get lost!

744
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,850
Get lost and don't come back!

745
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:19,800
Gene.

746
00:56:21,275 --> 00:56:22,450
Gene.

747
00:56:27,475 --> 00:56:30,925
It's no use to agree with them.

748
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,200
What do you mean?

749
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,825
Not appearing together and
not taking pictures together aren't enough.

750
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:44,925
They want us to break up indirectly.

751
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,925
What do you want me to do
besides agreeing with them?

752
00:56:50,875 --> 00:56:53,200
They have invested a lot of money in the series.

753
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,675
They are expecting profits too.

754
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:58,075
No one wants this to happen.

755
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,575
Besides,

756
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,300
I don't want them to say
you are neglecting your career for love.

757
00:57:07,275 --> 00:57:09,325
But it's none of our business.

758
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:12,100
Being together

759
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,925
didn't make my performance worse.

760
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:19,100
I can still work as usual.

761
00:57:20,425 --> 00:57:23,375
We don't have to care about what they think.

762
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:26,150
But the audience care.

763
00:57:27,075 --> 00:57:28,325
The fans care.

764
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,375
You should care about them too,

765
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:33,300
because that's your job.

766
00:57:35,575 --> 00:57:36,950
Don't you get it?

767
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,025
You should be with Aey, not me!

768
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:57,750
I know.

769
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,725
I don't wish for an issue with your adapted series.

770
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:09,000
I don't mind meeting you only at home.

771
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,425
But if we agree to that,

772
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:19,250
they will find other ways to force us
into agreeing with something else.

773
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,450
Nubsib.

774
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:28,800
You are a star.

775
00:58:29,175 --> 00:58:30,725
That's what you should do.

776
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,550
You can say that I'm selfish.

777
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:38,775
But I never wanted to be a star in the first place.

778
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:42,100
I acted in this series because of you.

779
00:58:43,225 --> 00:58:45,825
If it causes a problem in our relationship,

780
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:49,225
I don't want to do it anymore.

781
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:51,900
What do you want to do then?

782
00:58:53,225 --> 00:58:54,825
Like I said,

783
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,175
once the series ends,

784
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,250
I'll tear the contract.

785
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,375
No way.

786
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,225
You don't have to worry about money.

787
00:59:06,775 --> 00:59:08,975
Do you still remember what I told you back home?

788
00:59:13,975 --> 00:59:15,550
You are far more valuable than anything else.

789
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:19,150
As long as I'm together with you,

790
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,750
I'm willing to pay any price.

791
00:59:23,575 --> 00:59:24,600
Nubsib, listen to me.

792
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:30,275
You have a job and you have your savings.

793
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:33,575
How long has it been since you
last asked for money from your parents?

794
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,150
That doesn't have to stop because of this.

795
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:41,300
Terminating the contract
will cost you a lot of money.

796
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,925
You'd rather we become like that?

797
00:59:50,575 --> 00:59:52,300
Not letting everyone know
that we are together

798
00:59:53,275 --> 00:59:55,500
but that I'm together with Aey instead?

799
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,225
Do you want things to become like that?

800
01:00:00,425 --> 01:00:02,150
There you go again.

801
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:04,725
Anyone can ask you to do anything

802
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:06,875
and you'll just agree because you are soft-hearted.

803
01:00:07,225 --> 01:00:09,100
You only care about others' feelings.

804
01:00:09,825 --> 01:00:11,875
Why didn't you care about my feelings?

805
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:16,775
I care about you.

806
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:18,900
That is why I did that.

807
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,950
That is your future, Nubsib.

808
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,275
This is not like when we were kids
where the world revolved around us.

809
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,150
Is that what you think?

810
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,950
You should grow in your own way.

811
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,225
I want to grow in my own way too.

812
01:00:57,575 --> 01:00:59,425
You promised me.

813
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,725
You said we would overcome it together.

814
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,425
But you have to promise me.

815
01:01:13,975 --> 01:01:15,875
If we are facing a huge obstacle,

816
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,225
we have to overcome it together.

817
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:26,950
Okay.

818
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:29,625
I promise.

819
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:35,275
Yes.

820
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,600
But it should only exist in a novel.

821
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:42,125
The truth is,

822
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,600
