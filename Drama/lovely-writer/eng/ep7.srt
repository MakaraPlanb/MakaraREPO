00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:07,770
I hope you can stay away from Aey.
(Previously On Lovely Writer)

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,564
The car can be started.

3
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:12,890
We can proceed now.

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,842
I need to go home for three days.

5
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,366
The one beside his father is Nubsib.

6
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,336
Gene.

7
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,290
Nubsib.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:21,961
You remember who I am, right?

9
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,835
You remember since the beginning, right?

10
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:25,035
Yes.

11
00:00:25,115 --> 00:00:27,266
If you won't leave, I will!

12
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,391
Gene, wait!

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,175
(Incoming call from Nubsib)

14
00:00:37,725 --> 00:00:39,046
Ying.

15
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,336
Get the stick.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,344
I'm going to punish you.

17
00:00:52,424 --> 00:00:54,992
You know I'm worried about you, right?

18
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:57,526
You just disappeared like that.

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,926
Do you know how I feel?

20
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:18,964
Gene.

21
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:37,575
Hello, Jap.

22
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:39,664
Hello, Nubsib.

23
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,032
I know where Gene is.

24
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:44,713
Where is he?

25
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:46,359
Tell me.

26
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,182
I think he is at the garden mansion.

27
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:51,185
-Garden mansion?
-Yes, my grandfather's house.

28
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:54,197
Gene likes to go there
to get inspiration for his novel.

29
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:55,697
Send me the location.

30
00:01:55,777 --> 00:01:57,165
I'll leave now.

31
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:58,497
Okay.

32
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,110
Wait, Nubsib.

33
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,439
What is it?

34
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,104
I'll leave my brother to you.

35
00:02:04,482 --> 00:02:05,648
Okay.

36
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:08,274
I'll take good care of him.

=Lovely Writer=

44
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,582
Nubsib.

45
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,520
Son, where are you?

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,066
Nubsib.

47
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,375
Nubsib.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,175
Come out.

49
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,583
Nubsib.

50
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:29,183
Where is he hiding?

51
00:03:29,263 --> 00:03:30,270
Nubsib.

52
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,160
Here?

53
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:34,180
Nubsib.

54
00:03:57,475 --> 00:03:59,135
Gene! Why are you trespassing?

55
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,350
Let's go.

56
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,999
Do you want to play together?
Do you know how to play football?

57
00:04:05,486 --> 00:04:07,869
Gene, I'm going to tell mom.

58
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,958
What is your name? I'm Gene.

59
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,026
Nubsib.

60
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:21,613
Nubsib?

61
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,350
Then,

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,684
do you want to play together, Nubsib?

63
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,209
Nueng, come here.

64
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
Thank you.

65
00:05:16,727 --> 00:05:17,874
Are you tired?

66
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:21,150
The field is so big and you are so tiny.

67
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,966
But you ran well just now.

68
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,972
By the way,

69
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:31,864
what were you doing hiding there?

70
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:35,140
I don't want to attend piano lessons.

71
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:37,459
Why?

72
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:40,007
Playing the piano is cool.

73
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:53,108
My teacher always scolds me and
grabs me when there's no one around.

74
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,438
It's not fun at all.

75
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:56,851
Have you told your parents?

76
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,825
But Mom thinks I'm naughty and impatient.

77
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,527
Maybe she doesn't know about it yet.

78
00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:09,687
Do you want me to tell her?

79
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:55,375
Nubsib.

80
00:06:56,813 --> 00:06:58,725
Do you know you are wrong?

81
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,195
Do you?

82
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,347
Ying.

83
00:07:10,086 --> 00:07:11,228
Get the stick.

84
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,903
I'm going to punish you.

85
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:30,437
You know I'm worried about you, right?

86
00:07:31,374 --> 00:07:33,127
You just disappeared like that.

87
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,930
Do you know how I feel?

88
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,336
Gene.

89
00:08:25,527 --> 00:08:27,672
Aunty, I was the one
who invited Nubsib to play.

90
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,448
He did nothing wrong.

91
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,674
If someone needs to be punished,
you can punish me.

92
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:00,429
Gene.

93
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,139
I'm sending Gene back.

94
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:05,805
Did Gene cause trouble?

95
00:09:05,885 --> 00:09:06,975
No.

96
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:08,410
Gene is a good boy.

97
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,405
I'm just here
to get to know Gene's parents.

98
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,463
Oh, thank you.

99
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:14,620
I'm Orn.

100
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,546
My house is just over there.

101
00:09:16,883 --> 00:09:18,156
Thank you, Orn.

102
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:19,397
I'm Run.

103
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,406
I just moved here.

104
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:24,210
How nice is it for us
to get to know each other?

105
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,461
Our kids can play together in the future.

106
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,948
I'll go home first.

107
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,021
Anyway, thanks for sending Gene back.

108
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,140
You're welcome.

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,836
I'll go home first.
Please play with Nubsib again.

110
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:39,421
-Thank her.
-Thank you.

111
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,782
Thanks a lot.

112
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,692
Nice to meet you.

113
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:45,657
-What is his name?
-Nubsib.

114
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:47,285
Gene, send your friend off.

115
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,343
Remember to close the door
when you come back.

116
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:55,017
Gene.

117
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:56,492
Does it hurt?

118
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,825
I'm fine.

119
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,327
Come and play again tomorrow.

120
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:04,434
Nubsib.

121
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,657
Nubsib.

122
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,261
Nubsib.

123
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:28,526
Let's go home.

124
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,025
O Noi Ook.

125
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,086
O Noi Ook.

126
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,686
Come on.

127
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:38,034
Gene, you'll be the ghost catcher.

128
00:10:38,114 --> 00:10:39,264
Turn over and face the wall.

129
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:41,260
Count to ten slowly.

130
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,070
Go.

131
00:10:44,587 --> 00:10:45,948
I'm starting the count.

132
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:52,175
One, two, three, four,

133
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:56,911
five, six, seven,

134
00:10:57,902 --> 00:11:00,309
eight, nine.

135
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,095
Get ready.

136
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:03,209
Ten.

137
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,142
Hey!

138
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,387
Be quiet.

139
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,021
Let's go and play games.

140
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,683
Let's go. Forget about him.

141
00:11:10,763 --> 00:11:11,847
He won't get angry even if we leave.

142
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:13,194
He will be fine
after a while even if he gets angry.

143
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,324
Let's go.

144
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,387
Let's go.

145
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,956
It's fun. Let's go and play.

146
00:11:17,036 --> 00:11:18,034
Let's go.

147
00:11:44,725 --> 00:11:45,891
Nueng.

148
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,165
Jap.

149
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:50,071
Gene.

150
00:12:12,175 --> 00:12:13,217
Walk faster.

151
00:12:14,225 --> 00:12:16,265
Look. Why are you walking like that?

152
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,098
It's like you are going to suicide.

153
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,077
We have to be quick.

154
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,838
Is the opponent hacking?

155
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:30,582
I'm sure they are using cheats.

156
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:32,340
Shoot, there are three of them.

157
00:12:33,384 --> 00:12:35,023
We are doomed.

158
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,168
Get ready to die.

159
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,284
I'm going to save you.

160
00:12:39,364 --> 00:12:40,447
Wait for a while.

161
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,510
Jap, go to the other side.

162
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,697
Why are you hitting me?

163
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:46,132
Take another route.

164
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:48,068
I was hiding and got spotted.

165
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,435
I escaped.

166
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:54,233
Hurry, run.

167
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,369
Jap, your left.

168
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,677
Come out, don't get killed.

169
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:05,305
Jap, I think I heard footsteps just now.

170
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:07,006
Something's wrong with your ears.
Don't disturb me.

171
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,421
I'm trying to focus.

172
00:13:08,939 --> 00:13:10,046
Maybe it's Nubsib.

173
00:13:10,126 --> 00:13:11,423
If he knows we sneaked out...

174
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,656
It's fine, Gene.

175
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:13,714
It's just a prank.

176
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,489
Besides, he is too young.
He can't play with us.

177
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:17,739
We are not kids.

178
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:20,088
Do you think we should play
a childish game like hide-and-seek?

179
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,513
Darn. Jap, run.

180
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:22,736
I'm running.

181
00:13:24,056 --> 00:13:25,402
Careful, on your right.

182
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:26,406
I know.

183
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:30,954
The enemy is coming. Hide.

184
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,183
Found you.

185
00:13:44,263 --> 00:13:45,511
You're here.

186
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,344
Here, I bought it for you.

187
00:13:52,424 --> 00:13:53,672
You like this, don't you?

188
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,917
Let's keep playing.

189
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,936
Are you angry with me?

190
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:11,112
Do you want to play in my room tonight?

191
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:12,960
I have a lot of toys.

192
00:14:14,525 --> 00:14:15,525
Do you want to go?

193
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,400
You're still angry at me?

194
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,950
Then...

195
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,250
I'll count to ten.

196
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
If you're still angry, I'll ignore you.

197
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,519
One, two, three, four, five,

198
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:48,136
six, seven, eight,

199
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,157
nine, ten.

200
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,962
How dare you enter my lair?

201
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,999
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

202
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:17,442
Take that!

203
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:19,957
Gene.

204
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,973
Gene!

205
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,130
What are you doing, Nubsib?

206
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:38,107
Take that.

207
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,837
What are you doing, Nubsib?

208
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,124
I want to play too.

209
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:44,457
Give it back.

210
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,089
Nubsib, give it back.

211
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:56,881
-I want to play too.
-Give it back.

212
00:15:56,961 --> 00:15:59,291
-No. No!
-Give me.

213
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:05,491
Why did you do that?

214
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:07,799
If you do it again,
I won't let you play with me anymore.

215
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,568
I did it
because I wanted to play with you.

216
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:17,483
What's wrong?

217
00:16:17,563 --> 00:16:18,751
Both of you are so noisy.

218
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,199
I can't even work.

219
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,997
Nubsib tried to take away my toys.

220
00:16:23,077 --> 00:16:24,634
I just wanted to play with you.

221
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,367
Why couldn't you just tell me nicely?

222
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:27,778
You wouldn't listen.

223
00:16:29,175 --> 00:16:30,322
Gene.

224
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,347
Why didn't you let him play?

225
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:37,121
I haven't done anything yet
but Nubsib didn't tell me nicely.

226
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,309
I'll take it for you later,

227
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:53,286
but you need to wait until Gene is asleep.

228
00:16:58,125 --> 00:16:59,216
Gene.

229
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,837
Share it with him. Play with him together.

230
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,628
Look at me.

231
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,470
Play well together.

232
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,345
Go!

233
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:35,200
That's it!

234
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,934
Gene.

235
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:10,921
Sorry.

236
00:19:57,075 --> 00:19:58,525
Is something on your mind?

237
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,962
Oh, it's nothing.

238
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,433
Oh, what's wrong with the kids just now?

239
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,804
They were so loud.

240
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:15,684
Oh, just a quarrel between kids for toys.

241
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:18,736
Kids are all like that. It's nothing.

242
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,927
Honey.

243
00:20:27,546 --> 00:20:29,695
Do you think the relationship...

244
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,190
between our son
and the neighbor's son is too close?

245
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,018
It's normal.

246
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:41,764
Don't over-think.

247
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:42,953
It's nothing.

248
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:49,775
(Two Years Later)

249
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:03,244
Gene, why are you keeping your things?

250
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:11,017
Nubsib.

251
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,232
I...

252
00:22:15,178 --> 00:22:17,984
Gene, you can tell me anything directly.

253
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:23,666
I have to study at another place.

254
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:26,137
I have to stay at the school too.

255
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,253
I'll try to come back frequently.

256
00:22:38,852 --> 00:22:40,934
Nubsib, don't be sad.

257
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:48,394
You can sleep here tonight.

258
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:53,984
Are you still angry at me?

259
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,559
All right.

260
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,788
Then...

261
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,175
Is this all right?

262
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,465
I'm counting to ten.

263
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:15,393
One, two, three, four, five,

264
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:21,807
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

265
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,500
Sorry.

266
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:40,133
Nubsib. Nubsib.

267
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:41,282
Nubsib, where are you?

268
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:42,769
Come out, son.

269
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,433
Nubsib.

270
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:48,311
Nubsib.

271
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,915
Dear, hurry up!

272
00:24:19,995 --> 00:24:21,200
All right.

273
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,330
It's getting late. Hurry up.

274
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,197
Wait, I forgot my bag.

275
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:30,835
-Everything's here, honey.
-All right.

276
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:37,488
Jap, are you done packing?

277
00:24:37,568 --> 00:24:39,646
-Have you pack up everything?
-Yes.

278
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,020
Gene, it's time to leave.

279
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,397
Dear, what did you forget again?

280
00:25:17,085 --> 00:25:18,547
Is everyone ready?

281
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:19,730
Yes.

282
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:27,914
All right.

283
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,948
When will we reach there?

284
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,498
Dear, you didn't forget anything, right?

285
00:25:31,578 --> 00:25:33,193
No. It's all here.

286
00:25:33,273 --> 00:25:34,287
Let's go.

287
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:38,808
Get ready, kids.

288
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,345
Are you ready, Gene? Jap?

289
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:50,722
We're leaving.

290
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,700
(Nubsib 31 Missed Calls)

291
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,400
This bottle is yours.

292
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:05,757
But it's fine, you can take both,

293
00:28:06,224 --> 00:28:10,587
because my bottle
has been yours ever since you drank it.

294
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:28,066
What's going on with all the barking?

295
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,318
Where did you come from?

296
00:28:42,231 --> 00:28:43,461
Where are you from?

297
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,150
Mr Gene.

298
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,299
I miss you.

299
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,046
How did you find this place?

300
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,228
Aunty Run told me.

301
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,818
Are you still angry at me?

302
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:48,225
Mr Gene.

303
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:49,783
I don't want to talk to you.

304
00:29:49,863 --> 00:29:51,862
Can't you listen to my explanation?

305
00:29:51,942 --> 00:29:54,246
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to be alone.

306
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:55,611
I like you.

307
00:30:05,725 --> 00:30:08,352
What a funny joke. Happy?

308
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:09,952
You can go back if you're happy.

309
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:11,994
I like you.

310
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,645
-I hope you...
-Since the day you left me,

311
00:30:16,975 --> 00:30:21,363
you made me realize that I liked you.

312
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,542
Is it that day
when you didn't even send me off?

313
00:30:26,105 --> 00:30:27,108
I...

314
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:28,973
Enough. Not another word.

315
00:30:29,672 --> 00:30:32,917
That day,
I waited for you at the old place.

316
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:36,938
The place where we first met.

317
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:45,491
I hope you will change your mind
and look for me like you did in the past.

318
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,644
I waited for a long time...

319
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,365
but you didn't appear.

320
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,536
Nubsib.

321
00:30:56,475 --> 00:30:57,817
Nubsib, where did you go?

322
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,744
Why didn't you send Gene off?

323
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:04,497
Nubsib.

324
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:06,577
I'm asking you a question.
Why aren't you replying?

325
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,293
Gene.

326
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,068
I missed you.

327
00:32:18,417 --> 00:32:19,609
No.

328
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:22,975
That's not all.

329
00:32:25,355 --> 00:32:27,045
I wanted you to come back.

330
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:38,906
I want to be your only one.

331
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:42,587
I want that you will only be hugged by me,

332
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:47,734
only miss me and only love me.

333
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,751
Do you believe what I say?

334
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:02,187
About you liking me?

335
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:04,631
Yes.

336
00:33:15,302 --> 00:33:16,778
Since then?

337
00:33:17,558 --> 00:33:19,114
Why are you still lying?

338
00:33:19,812 --> 00:33:21,495
You were so young at that time.

339
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:24,118
How could you like anyone?

340
00:33:27,747 --> 00:33:29,351
I like you and that's the fact.

341
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,691
I don't understand at that time,

342
00:33:37,194 --> 00:33:38,874
but I'm sure about it now.

343
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,266
I told you back then, didn't I?

344
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,475
If you still don't believe me,

345
00:33:46,437 --> 00:33:49,575
I have many ways to let you know that.

346
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:51,033
No.

347
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:52,581
There's no need.

348
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:54,870
What is the reason...

349
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,087
for lying to me about not having a place
to stay and not having a car then?

350
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:01,057
Because I wanted to be together with you.

351
00:34:03,305 --> 00:34:06,878
If I didn't say that,
could I still live with you?

352
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,739
If you've told me you are Aunty Orn's son,
I would even let you stay for a year.

353
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,500
If I told you that,

354
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:16,172
how would you treat me?

355
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,275
You should know.

356
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:28,925
I don't want you to be my brother.

357
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,234
I'm not forcing you to believe me.

358
00:34:38,625 --> 00:34:40,723
You can confess to me...

359
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:43,966
when you believe me in the future.

360
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:03,316
Fine.

361
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,618
I want you to prove what you said then.

362
00:35:12,046 --> 00:35:15,805
I'm sure it would be romantic
if this is a novel.

363
00:35:16,854 --> 00:35:17,904
But now,

364
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:20,572
you should know it, right?

365
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,563
What you did was wrong.

366
00:35:25,114 --> 00:35:26,823
If you still lie to me,

367
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,958
I'll definitely beat you up.

368
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:35,354
I'm talking about your personality.

369
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,344
Don't pretend to be a good kid.

370
00:35:37,424 --> 00:35:39,045
Just say whatever's on your mind.

371
00:35:40,074 --> 00:35:42,358
Like right now.
Say anything that comes to you.

372
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,624
What does this expression mean?

373
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,850
If you can't say it,
how am I going to believe you?

374
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,512
Okay.

375
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:02,345
I want to kiss you.

376
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,851
I want you.

377
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,118
Darn it!

378
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:22,452
What are you talking about?

379
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:25,138
You wanted me to say it, right?

380
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,877
Well...

381
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:29,439
You don't have to say everything out.

382
00:36:39,277 --> 00:36:40,267
Hey.

383
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:42,159
Let me tell you something.

384
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,745
I patted the dog's head just now.

385
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:47,330
You are kissing the dog now.

386
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:55,462
Then...

387
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,905
Let's kiss the dog together.

388
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,605
Taking advantage of me.

389
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,385
Gene.

390
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,223
Do you know?

391
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:58,467
Since you left,

392
00:43:00,357 --> 00:43:01,979
I've been very lonely.

393
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,306
Now that we can be together again,

394
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,902
don't disappear again.

395
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,944
As the car started to move,
he kept looking at the rear-view mirror.

396
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:55,478
But he didn't see the person
he wanted to see in the end.

397
00:43:56,141 --> 00:44:00,443
He felt sad like he had lost something.

398
00:44:01,355 --> 00:44:04,612
That separation is still memorable
in his mind.

399
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:06,443
But now,

400
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:09,434
the time they spent in the past
has resurfaced again.

401
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:12,600
As for the memories that are fading,

402
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:14,832
they become clear again.

403
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:19,952
They meet again
and relit their affection for each other.

404
00:44:21,044 --> 00:44:23,903
Although the way
they meet again isn't considered joyful,

405
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,187
it made him realize...

406
00:44:26,802 --> 00:44:29,767
the part that he lost
for quite some time in the past...

407
00:44:30,456 --> 00:44:32,646
has come back to hold him again.

408
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,695
But you know it, right?
(On Next Episode)

409
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:09,516
What you did was wrong.

410
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:13,176
So,
I'll give us another chance to start over.

411
00:45:13,256 --> 00:45:16,207
But I won't allow you
to stay in my apartment.

412
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:17,903
We can't stay together?

413
00:45:17,983 --> 00:45:19,359
Darn, that's enough.

414
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:22,039
Hello.

415
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:25,271
Nubsib, can you take a picture with Aey?

416
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,397
Can you wait for a while?

417
00:45:26,478 --> 00:45:29,110
We are taking a photo
of Gene and Nubsib together.

418
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,777
-You like Nubsib.
-If I...

419
00:45:30,857 --> 00:45:34,033
You knew I like Nubsib
but you still like him too.

420
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,500
You're so bad, Gene.
