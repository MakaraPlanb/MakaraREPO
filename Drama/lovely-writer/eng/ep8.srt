00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:07,995
Gene. (Previously On Lovely Writer)

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:08,945
I like you.

3
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:10,945
I'm not forcing you to believe me.

4
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:13,883
You can confess to me
when you believe me in the future.

5
00:00:13,963 --> 00:00:15,211
Let me tell you something.

6
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,704
I patted the dog's head just now.

7
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:18,575
You are kissing the dog now.

8
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,203
Then...

9
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:21,701
Let's kiss the dog together.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,827
Do you know?

11
00:00:26,907 --> 00:00:29,841
Since you left, I've been very lonely.

12
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:32,023
Now that we can be together again,

13
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:33,772
don't disappear again.

14
00:00:38,025 --> 00:00:39,511
-Hello.
-Hello, Nubsib.

15
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,595
How is it?

16
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:41,996
Did you talk to each other?

17
00:00:42,305 --> 00:00:43,783
Gene has cooled off, right?

18
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:46,299
Tell him to talk to me.

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,992
Is he angry at me too?

20
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:49,537
Gene is not angry at you.

21
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,190
Don't worry.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,598
How could he not be angry at me?

23
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,661
I was the one
who brought you into his house.

24
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:56,664
Gene asked you
to pick a souvenir that day.

25
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:58,925
You should know that
he was planning to go home.

26
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,268
Why didn't you find an excuse to stop him?

27
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:02,715
Unless...

28
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,966
You let Gene go home purposely?

29
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:07,953
I do not need to explain to you.

30
00:01:08,626 --> 00:01:11,469
You just have to know that I love Gene.

31
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,896
Come on.

32
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:14,778
You should be embarrassed.

33
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:17,454
Gene is right to get angry at you.

34
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,520
Just wait.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,582
I'll tell Gene that you lied to me too.

36
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,435
I'll tell him you don't usually
stay in the agency's dorm.

37
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:30,124
You'll say that you are using the room
when my sister wanted to use it.

38
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:31,937
Also, the casting of this drama.

39
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,010
You knew it was Gene's production, right?

40
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,411
Don't worry.

41
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:37,566
There's nothing else.

42
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:38,774
Good to hear.

43
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:40,576
Take good care of my friend.

44
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,461
-I'll hang up.
-Okay.

45
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:53,332
Why did you come out?

46
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,827
I'm out to take my clothes.

47
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:01,446
It's so dark out here.

48
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,490
You should tell me before you came out.

49
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,014
It's dangerous.

50
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:07,614
Are you worrying about me?

51
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,076
When did you wake up?

52
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:15,614
I heard the door opened.

53
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,051
You brought me to bed?

54
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,311
Yes.

55
00:02:23,074 --> 00:02:24,689
I carried you.

56
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,852
It's cold here.

57
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:30,125
It's better if you hug me when you sleep.

58
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,584
Are you hungry?

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,438
Yes.

60
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:39,844
If you're hungry,

61
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:41,445
what do you want to eat?

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,875
We can drive out to eat.

63
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:47,802
There's a small market nearby.

64
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:48,903
Can you eat something there?

65
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:50,146
Yes.

66
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,717
Is this your car?

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,504
This?

68
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:03,248
You fetched me with this at the hotel.

69
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,274
Yes.

70
00:03:17,707 --> 00:03:18,865
Get on.

71
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,515
Are you waiting for the rain?

72
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,605
Okay.

73
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:38,495
♪Stop thinking. Just let me kiss you♪

74
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:43,395

=Lovely Writer=

80
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,900
What do you want to eat?

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,432
Order for me.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,950
Sure.

83
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:30,193
Aunty.

84
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:33,021
Get me Red Pork Noodles
without dumplings.

85
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:35,593
Also, get my brother special vermicelli.

86
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:37,071
Sure, please wait a while.

87
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:45,003
What's wrong?
What's with your expression?

88
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:48,179
Don't tell me...

89
00:04:48,608 --> 00:04:50,170
You don't like vermicelli?

90
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,680
My brother?

91
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:55,687
Isn't that right?

92
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,328
I've told you.
I don't want to be your brother.

93
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,902
If it's not my brother,
what do you want me to call you?

94
00:05:04,868 --> 00:05:06,646
Do you still have to ask?

95
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,056
Boyfriend.

96
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,842
Nubsib!

97
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:13,966
What are you talking about?

98
00:05:15,533 --> 00:05:17,097
We have a 5-year-old gap.

99
00:05:17,177 --> 00:05:19,096
Calling you my brother is right.

100
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,394
I don't know whether it's right.

101
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,385
But if you call me your brother again,

102
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,278
you'll be punished.

103
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:29,153
Punished?

104
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:31,941
I'll kiss you.

105
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:39,155
You wouldn't dare.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,723
Try calling me then.

107
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,185
Brother Nubsib.

108
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:50,648
Brother Nubsib.

109
00:05:52,722 --> 00:05:54,921
What are you trying to do,
Brother Nubsib?

110
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,033
Do you want to be kissed?

111
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,239
-Brother Nubsib.
-Try sating it again.

112
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,484
Enough, Nubsib.

113
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,170
Don't be naughty, Brother Nubsib.

114
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,622
Kids, what are you fighting about?

115
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:04,134
The vermicelli is here.

116
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,430
Thank you.

117
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,867
It's all because of my brother.

118
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:08,945
He's so naughty.

119
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,396
Talking back to me.

120
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,848
That's how brothers are.

121
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,675
Just tolerate each other.

122
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,220
But you are the elder brother.

123
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,106
You should be nice to him.

124
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,741
Your brother looks familiar.

125
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,034
Is he a star?

126
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,652
Oh, I remember.

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,772
Brother Nubsib.

128
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:33,431
I'm going to kiss you.

129
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,369
Is it really you?

130
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:39,958
May I take a picture with you?

131
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:42,147
I want to put it on my stall.

132
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,563
Lad, help me take the picture.

133
00:06:45,643 --> 00:06:46,731
Sure.

134
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,222
Ready.

135
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,094
Aunty, relax.
You don't have to be so stiff.

136
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:57,154
I'm very relaxed, lad.

137
00:06:58,223 --> 00:06:59,187
I'm taking the picture then.

138
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,969
One, two, three. Okay.

139
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,956
Another one. One, two, three.

140
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:11,486
Again. One, two, three.

141
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:13,700
Okay.

142
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,079
Thanks, lad.

143
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,454
I'll print it out and frame it.
Then, I'm putting it on my stall.

144
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:20,540
As I've said before,

145
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,776
brothers should tolerate each other.

146
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,420
It's all right, Aunty.

147
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:28,244
That's how my boyfriend is.

148
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:31,135
He likes to make a ruckus when he's angry.

149
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:32,707
Hey, Nubsib!

150
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,449
Lad, don't be so fierce.

151
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:39,290
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

152
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,155
He's even a star.

153
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,366
You are so lucky
to have such a handsome boyfriend.

154
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,858
I won't bother you two anymore.

155
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:50,740
Just tell me if you need anything.

156
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,964
Oh, so cute.

157
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:54,686
Let me pinch both your faces. So cute!

158
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,519
-Thank you.
-Okay.

159
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:02,980
How's that not bothering us?

160
00:08:04,253 --> 00:08:05,185
You.

161
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:06,657
Stop saying things like that.

162
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,995
We are not related in any way.

163
00:08:08,075 --> 00:08:09,753
People will misunderstand.

164
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,284
It's all right.

165
00:08:12,364 --> 00:08:15,395
We will be lovers in the future.

166
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:18,432
Where did you get your confidence from?

167
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,622
You said you like me before.

168
00:08:20,702 --> 00:08:23,271
As long as you admit it,
I'll be your boyfriend.

169
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:33,671
Actually, I'm the only one
who can pinch your face.

170
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:04,870
If you come any closer,
I'll kick you off the bed.

171
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:07,735
Can't I hug you?

172
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,652
If you come any closer,
I'll tell Aunty Orn.

173
00:09:24,236 --> 00:09:25,337
Hey.

174
00:09:26,053 --> 00:09:27,050
Yes?

175
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:31,219
During the day,

176
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:34,277
I remember the times when we were young.

177
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:40,739
Do you still remember that?

178
00:09:41,553 --> 00:09:42,870
We used to have conflicts.

179
00:09:46,725 --> 00:09:50,453
You got angry at me because
you thought Aunty Orn loved me more.

180
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:52,575
That was so childish.

181
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:55,025
Really?

182
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:57,913
What's wrong?

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,748
You pretend to forget that now?

184
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,491
I only remember that
you want to marry into my family.

185
00:10:09,694 --> 00:10:11,414
What? No.

186
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,237
Don't you remember?

187
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:18,145
I don't, because it didn't happen.

188
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,326
It did happen.

189
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,387
You said you wanted to
marry into my family when you grow up.

190
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:29,390
I was already in fifth grade
when we first met.

191
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,346
I wasn't a clueless child.

192
00:10:31,426 --> 00:10:32,938
Stop this nonsense.

193
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,149
I...

194
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,206
What?

195
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,234
I'm very happy.

196
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:13,106
You came back.

197
00:11:25,775 --> 00:11:29,260
Since the day you moved away,

198
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:34,235
Nueng and I got sent to study
in the United States by my father.

199
00:11:37,232 --> 00:11:38,629
I felt lonely.

200
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:44,614
New friends,
a new social circle and a new place.

201
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,332
You never had
a relationship with someone else?

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,492
I did.

203
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:02,187
But I knew that wasn't the right person.

204
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,275
I didn't know why.

205
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:08,281
There were many people around me.

206
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:11,547
But I still felt lonely.

207
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,444
Until one day,

208
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:21,646
my mom sent me a photo of you and Jap
at Aunty Run's birthday party.

209
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,147
I felt extremely excited to see you again.

210
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:30,708
You were so cute
wearing the school uniform.

211
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:40,032
The memories of our childhood
resurfaced in my mind,

212
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,511
including my feelings for you.

213
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,184
After that day,

214
00:12:49,975 --> 00:12:54,098
I found Jap and asked him about you.

215
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:57,300
I decided to ask my father
to send me back.

216
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,458
Jap!

217
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,878
When I saw you again,

218
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:16,015
I realized
my loneliness all this time...

219
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,973
was because you weren't by my side.

220
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,315
It was there since you left me.

221
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,675
I missed you a lot. Do you know that?

222
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,917
Can I kiss you?

223
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,351
What?

224
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:27,498
Right now?

225
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:36,873
It's just the two of us.

226
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,968
Did you buy food for all the neighbors?

227
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,307
Sit down.

228
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,547
Hey.

229
00:16:58,916 --> 00:16:59,822
Yes?

230
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:03,624
It's time for you to go back, right?

231
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,653
That's not what I meant.

232
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,229
You need to go on set and study as well.

233
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:19,788
Why are you taking the trouble
to drive here and there?

234
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:23,399
It's not a trouble at all.

235
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,366
I'll be wherever you are.
It's just that simple.

236
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,068
Let's go back tomorrow then.

237
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,139
Fine by me. I'll follow you.

238
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:45,158
Hey,

239
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:49,054
going back doesn't mean
you get to stay at my apartment.

240
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,716
You can go back to your own house.

241
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:55,207
Why are you chasing me away again?

242
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,879
I'm not chasing you away.

243
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:01,826
But you know
what you are doing is wrong, right?

244
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,934
So,

245
00:18:07,446 --> 00:18:10,207
I'm giving us a chance
to start all over again.

246
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,878
Give each other some space.

247
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,086
Understand?

248
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:28,439
Didn't you say you will wait
until I trust you again?

249
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:33,148
Do you know?

250
00:18:34,825 --> 00:18:36,934
I don't want
to be separated from you at all.

251
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,987
Hurry up and be a good kid,

252
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:48,527
so I can trust you again
as soon as possible then.

253
00:18:51,222 --> 00:18:52,812
At that time,

254
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,172
I want you to hold me tight
and say that you love me out loud.

255
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:07,096
Let me see what you've bought.

256
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,576
Let me know when you've arrived.

257
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:44,781
Okay.

258
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:47,861
Drive safe.

259
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,423
Okay.

260
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,868
Text me if there's anything.

261
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,526
-Gene.
-Yes?

262
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,710
I might change my decision to leave.

263
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:06,133
Just leave then.

264
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:08,002
I'm leaving.

265
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,855
Changed your mind?

266
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:36,911
No.

267
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,413
Return me my key card.

268
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,939
I thought you've forgotten about it.

269
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,376
Impossible.

270
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:57,300
Your memory is so good.

271
00:20:58,278 --> 00:20:59,630
Of course.

272
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,084
You may leave.

273
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:03,146
Bye.

274
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,750
(Nubsib)

275
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,459
Have you arrived?

276
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,012
Yes.

277
00:25:12,434 --> 00:25:16,444
Really? Turn on your camera
and show me your room.

278
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:17,545
No way.

279
00:25:19,586 --> 00:25:20,628
Why not?

280
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,215
It's better
if you are here to see it yourself.

281
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:26,812
Can't I just see it now?

282
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:30,154
If you see it now,
you wouldn't feel like coming anymore.

283
00:25:30,766 --> 00:25:33,991
You can come to my room at any time.

284
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,760
Then, when is your shoot tomorrow?

285
00:25:41,578 --> 00:25:44,950
Around 2:00 PM. Are you coming?

286
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:50,769
I'm meeting the chief editor tomorrow.
I might not make it.

287
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:55,240
If you can make it,
come and pick me up at school.

288
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,148
Come on.
Where's your million-dollar sports car?

289
00:26:00,472 --> 00:26:02,874
Why are you laughing? Is it funny?

290
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,747
Won't you turn on the camera?

291
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:14,647
Why not? Can't I have a glance at it now?

292
00:26:14,727 --> 00:26:15,963
Not even if I pester you?

293
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:22,075
No.

294
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,021
But I'm not hungry yet.

295
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:42,981
Or, do you want to cook for me?

296
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,072
Gene, please sit.

297
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,816
How is it? Have you eaten?

298
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,486
Oh, not yet.

299
00:27:24,566 --> 00:27:27,322
But I've promised Hin
to eat together after this.

300
00:27:27,402 --> 00:27:29,119
That's good.

301
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,544
Let's finish this soon so you may eat.

302
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:35,694
About this,

303
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:39,588
I've marked them in red at the back,
including the details.

304
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,461
Have a look when you go back.

305
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:42,814
Okay.

306
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:47,686
Then, near the end,
I think it's quite stressful.

307
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:52,767
Oh, I wanted to focus on the development
of the characters' relationship.

308
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:56,193
It's like this, both the characters
knew each other when they were young.

309
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,582
Is it?

310
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:03,776
I'm worried
it will be too serious for the readers.

311
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:06,841
And you were on the money
for those sex scenes.

312
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,927
Why did you remove them?

313
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:10,403
I think the story's development...

314
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:13,026
is already a romantic one
up to this point.

315
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:17,283
I don't want to add the sex scenes
because I'm worried it might be too much,

316
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,071
and affects the whole story.

317
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,846
It won't be too much.

318
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:24,312
It's been a long time since the last one.

319
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:28,360
Now that there's a development,
just put it in.

320
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,556
Think of it as a bonus for readers.

321
00:28:31,636 --> 00:28:34,487
Right now,
everyone is living a stressful life.

322
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,440
Right?

323
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,372
Make life better, Gene.

324
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:39,710
Make it better.

325
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:46,205
Then, I'll add it in the next chapter.

326
00:28:46,285 --> 00:28:49,006
Yes, that's right. I think it's good.

327
00:28:49,086 --> 00:28:50,773
It needs to be juicier.

328
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:53,015
Get the person
who taught you to teach you again.

329
00:28:54,063 --> 00:28:55,455
There's no such person.

330
00:28:56,172 --> 00:28:59,649
Your reaction proves that I'm right.

331
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:01,214
I'm sure of it.

332
00:29:02,872 --> 00:29:04,603
Come, bring the things here.

333
00:29:05,256 --> 00:29:07,226
Be careful. Put it here.

334
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,397
This...

335
00:29:10,477 --> 00:29:12,203
Big boss wants me to give it to you.

336
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,400
These are the latest BL novels.

337
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,691
Bring them all back.

338
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:18,510
I'll be leaving. Bye.

339
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,453
Okay.

340
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:20,828
See you.

341
00:29:56,575 --> 00:29:57,568
Gene.

342
00:29:58,873 --> 00:29:59,982
How are you recently?

343
00:30:00,062 --> 00:30:01,286
I missed you.

344
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,815
Take me to meet Nubsib.

345
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,714
Did you miss me or Nubsib?

346
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:09,040
I missed both of you.

347
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,707
How are you recently?

348
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:12,315
You just had a meeting with Bua?

349
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,169
I'm still the same.

350
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:20,069
Bua wants me to write more sex scenes.

351
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,872
Honestly,
why should I write so many such things?

352
00:30:24,952 --> 00:30:28,030
Especially when this topic
became so controversial recently.

353
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:32,441
Perhaps sex is something
that occurs naturally?

354
00:30:32,521 --> 00:30:35,378
Just think of it
as a useful plot in the story.

355
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,010
The readers will understand.

356
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:41,988
Also, brother, the juicier it is,
the more it sells.

357
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:49,030
Like the last book
that Bua wanted me to add sex scenes in.

358
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,724
I don't think there's any story at all.

359
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:58,023
I think you can look at it
from another angle, brother.

360
00:30:58,103 --> 00:31:01,186
Bua is the representative
of the publisher, right?

361
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:02,747
She knows what readers like.

362
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:05,632
If that's what the readers like,
she will want to sell the same genre.

363
00:31:09,187 --> 00:31:10,641
But I think it's bad.

364
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:16,718
Do you know? I feel bad
every time I write something like that.

365
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,608
If the readers like my novel,

366
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:25,345
I hope they like them for the plot
and not the sex scenes inside.

367
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,071
If I have to say,

368
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:33,251
you need to balance
the things you want to express...

369
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,623
and mix them together after consideration.

370
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,649
You don't have to remove the sex scenes.

371
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,938
If it's required,

372
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:41,939
you should write it into the story
and make it more purposeful.

373
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:44,659
In the end,
I think readers will know what it means.

374
00:31:45,425 --> 00:31:49,845
If you are writing a novel about sex
but there's no sex inside,

375
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:51,950
don't you think it's a bit weird?

376
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,580
Yes, I understand.

377
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,125
You are right.

378
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:00,275
Yes.

379
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:04,221
By the way,

380
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,018
I think you've grown up a lot.

381
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,755
You are more mature too.

382
00:32:10,447 --> 00:32:12,808
What about your novel?
Are you still writing it?

383
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:15,371
I'm still writing, brother.

384
00:32:15,678 --> 00:32:19,926
But I have a huge problem
with my vocabulary.

385
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:22,475
I find it hard to write recently.

386
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:25,099
Be confident.

387
00:32:27,185 --> 00:32:28,254
There.

388
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,628
Let me know if you need help.

389
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:35,169
No matter what,
you are always my brother.

390
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,568
Okay, brother.

391
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,682
Sorry to interrupt.

392
00:32:46,762 --> 00:32:49,147
Gene, could you give me your autograph?

393
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,736
-Is this the wrong book?
-No.

394
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:00,473
Can you sign it for me, Gene?

395
00:33:00,553 --> 00:33:01,858
Sign beside Nubsib's autograph.

396
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,073
Right here.

397
00:33:20,746 --> 00:33:22,181
Thank you so much.

398
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:25,292
I have your novel too
but I didn't bring it.

399
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:28,211
I'm bringing this magazine everywhere.

400
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:31,091
I'll bring the novel to you for
an autograph if there's a chance, Gene.

401
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,030
Wait, girl.

402
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,949
By the way,
how did you get Nubsib's autograph?

403
00:33:38,703 --> 00:33:40,338
I met Nubsib coincidentally.

404
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:44,929
I told him I'll get Gene to sign beside
him and he signed it for me. How cute.

405
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:46,875
Oh, okay.

406
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,375
Wow. That's impressive.

407
00:33:51,455 --> 00:33:54,186
Gene, can you sign this for me?

408
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,515
But I don't have
Nubsib's autograph beside.

409
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,288
-Gene, can you sign it for me?
-No!

410
00:33:58,368 --> 00:33:59,765
Fine.

411
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:03,402
You are so famous now.
You can't even take a joke.

412
00:34:36,318 --> 00:34:38,287
Does drinking make you full?

413
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,460
Be careful, Gene.

414
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,225
Nubsib.

415
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,353
Yes. It's me.

416
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,908
Why are you in that unit?

417
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:05,551
I bought it from the previous owner.

418
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,781
Are you crazy?

419
00:35:08,757 --> 00:35:11,209
Don't worry about my money.

420
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:14,343
I know. But that's your money.

421
00:35:14,423 --> 00:35:15,904
Don't you feel bad about spending it?

422
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:19,725
It's worth it to me.

423
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,677
If I knew
you are going to buy the unit next to me,

424
00:35:26,265 --> 00:35:27,696
I'll rent mine to you.

425
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:30,010
I'll sell this unit then.

426
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,180
You lunatic.

427
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,404
Don't be angry.

428
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:36,250
I bought this unit a long time ago.

429
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,413
When was it?

430
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:43,083
Last year. I was planning to move here.

431
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:48,688
Coincidentally, I found out your novel
was going to be adapted into a series.

432
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,248
You...

433
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:52,912
Yes.

434
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,134
You wouldn't get angry
about me moving here, right?

435
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,873
I just want to be closer to you...

436
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:14,322
so I feel more relieved.

437
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:21,407
Actually, I'm not angry at you.

438
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,744
But you should understand, right?

439
00:36:25,824 --> 00:36:27,716
You understand why
I asked you to move out.

440
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:31,924
I understand.

441
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,780
Although I've moved here,

442
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:40,342
I guarantee...

443
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,830
I'll not disturb you.

444
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,182
I'll get your permission
every time I enter your place.

445
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:58,254
I apologize for everything
that has happened in the past.

446
00:37:05,596 --> 00:37:08,069
I'm happy that you understand.

447
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:17,437
Can I kiss your face then?

448
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:16,918
You haven't had any sleep yet, right?

449
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,849
Your eyes look tired.

450
00:38:21,154 --> 00:38:22,396
Yes.

451
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,468
Go and sleep.

452
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,135
Okay.

453
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:33,700
Good night, then.

454
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,545
Good night.

455
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,930
I'll buy you dinner next time.

456
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,003
No, I'm the one who should buy you dinner.

457
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:07,934
That's funny.

458
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:09,679
I'm a grown up.

459
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:11,501
I'm independent now.

460
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,915
But I'm really happy.

461
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:17,289
For what?

462
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,957
You've asked me out on a date.

463
00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:23,878
Are you crazy? It's not a date.

464
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:27,986
Look at you. You're pouting again.

465
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:29,278
Do you know it's cute?

466
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:30,401
You're so annoying.

467
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:32,215
Are you shy?

468
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:33,504
No way.

469
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:35,179
You're pouting again.

470
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,384
Get lost!

471
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:38,764
Nubsib.

472
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,296
Gene.

473
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,466
Nueng.

474
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,788
Did you two go out?

475
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:45,267
No one picked up my calls.

476
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:47,036
Is there anything wrong, brother?

477
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,577
No, Mom wants to know how you've been.

478
00:39:51,924 --> 00:39:54,746
Since you've moved here,
I decided to pay you a visit.

479
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,484
What about you, Gene?

480
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,580
Why are you with Nubsib?

481
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:04,058
Did you get in contact
with each other again?

482
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:05,602
Why didn't I know that?

483
00:40:07,597 --> 00:40:08,603
Well...

484
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,383
I stay here.

485
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,627
Here?

486
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:15,891
What do you mean?

487
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,544
Oh, I got it.

488
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,925
You're so sly. Did you get him already?

489
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,952
Don't forget to tell his parents.

490
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,483
Don't worry, brother.

491
00:40:38,214 --> 00:40:40,709
I'll take Gene home when I'm free.

492
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,038
It's all right, Nueng.

493
00:40:45,118 --> 00:40:47,965
I'll go back on my own.

494
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:53,120
Then, I'll visit Aunty Orn and Uncle Wat.

495
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,763
Understood.

496
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,111
Go home.

497
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:58,385
I have something to tell you.

498
00:40:58,804 --> 00:41:00,609
Nueng, are you staying here?

499
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:01,988
No.

500
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,276
I want to eat.

501
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:04,765
I'm hungry.

502
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:08,088
Didn't you go out shopping?
Your bags are full.

503
00:41:08,828 --> 00:41:10,447
We are planning to cook rice cakes.

504
00:41:10,527 --> 00:41:12,341
Oh, that's good.

505
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,769
If you want to stay here,
it's really hard to get you to leave.

506
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,216
Fine.

507
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:24,734
You can stay for a while.

508
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,157
Nubsib.

509
00:41:27,977 --> 00:41:29,569
I'm the only one here.

510
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:31,850
I won't interfere with anything.

511
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,471
I'll leave after the meal.

512
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,661
Nothing is going on, Nueng.

513
00:41:37,741 --> 00:41:38,993
You are not interfering.

514
00:41:39,073 --> 00:41:40,666
No one is chasing you away.

515
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,046
Stay and eat together.

516
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,003
Yes. That's how it is. Learn from him.

517
00:42:23,963 --> 00:42:25,403
Peel one for Nueng.

518
00:42:27,017 --> 00:42:28,485
Why should I?

519
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:30,419
He has hands.

520
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:32,521
Peel one for him.

521
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:59,852
Nubsib, peel one for Nueng!

522
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:01,622
Why should I?

523
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,973
Nueng, let me fill your bowl.

524
00:43:25,807 --> 00:43:27,869
Why won't you do it for me?

525
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,604
Why?

526
00:43:29,976 --> 00:43:31,113
You have hands.

527
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:33,309
Do you have double standards?

528
00:43:33,389 --> 00:43:34,524
What?

529
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,173
I wonder who is the one
that has double standards.

530
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:47,421
That's enough. Just eat your own food.

531
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,166
Both of you are purposely
trying to annoy me, right?

532
00:43:53,818 --> 00:43:55,284
That's not it, brother.

533
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,635
All right.

534
00:43:58,715 --> 00:43:59,644
Just eat.

535
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:00,891
I'm hungry.

536
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,656
If you two one some time alone,

537
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:08,458
just think I'm not here.

538
00:44:09,374 --> 00:44:12,992
I'll eat silently on my own, okay?

539
00:44:27,525 --> 00:44:30,620
Hello, Mom. Yes.

540
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,467
We had a meal together.

541
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:35,742
Yes.

542
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,446
Okay.

543
00:44:43,635 --> 00:44:45,264
Nubsib's fine here.

544
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,177
Okay.

545
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:48,763
Bye, Mom.

546
00:44:51,738 --> 00:44:52,956
What's wrong?

547
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,486
Are you two together?

548
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:57,616
Not yet, brother.

549
00:44:58,475 --> 00:45:01,821
Then, be kind to him.

550
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:03,845
He has been waiting for you
for a long time.

551
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,013
When you have confirmed your relationship,
go home and tell my parents.

552
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:15,887
My mother likes you.

553
00:45:15,967 --> 00:45:17,208
She won't say anything.

554
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:19,450
She will be happy.

555
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,927
Gene, don't think too much.

556
00:45:28,382 --> 00:45:30,470
Our parents are adults.

557
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:35,256
Even though my father is someone
who prioritizes the family's reputation,

558
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:37,543
he is not some closed-minded person.

559
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:43,593
Otherwise, would he allow Nubsib to act?

560
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:50,167
If he is the one who finds out,
then it's troublesome.

561
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:55,870
Even if you're an adult,
you still have your parents.

562
00:45:56,802 --> 00:45:59,680
Just tell them everything
since it's already like this.

563
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:02,746
Hold on.

564
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:04,626
There's nothing going on
between me and Nubsib.

565
00:46:04,706 --> 00:46:08,288
Well, there will be sooner or later.

566
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,682
Nubsib is my younger brother.
Do you think I wouldn't know that?

567
00:46:12,939 --> 00:46:14,230
You'll never escape from him.

568
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,550
Gene.

569
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,739
Gene.

570
00:47:26,283 --> 00:47:27,616
You're here?

571
00:47:28,254 --> 00:47:29,711
I've been looking for you.

572
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:55,021
Spray some of this after dinner.

573
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,957
Are you all right, Gene?

574
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:21,985
I'm fine.

575
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,172
I'm just thinking of something.

576
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,020
What are you thinking about?

577
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,476
Can you tell me?

578
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,550
Nueng wants us to tell our parents
about our relationship.

579
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:54,808
Yes, so?

580
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:01,132
Don't you feel anything?

581
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,212
Yes.

582
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,525
I want to tell them.

583
00:49:10,475 --> 00:49:12,230
Not just our parents.

584
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,297
I want to tell everyone.

585
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:18,569
But...

586
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,404
Don't over-think this, Gene.

587
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:23,636
If you're not ready yet,

588
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:25,664
I can wait for you.

589
00:49:28,756 --> 00:49:30,654
-But...
-Don't worry.

590
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,993
I'll wait for you to accept my love.

591
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,399

601
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:17,644
Hello!

602
00:51:17,725 --> 00:51:21,245
Dear guests and everyone from the media.

603
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:28,104
Today, we are here at the press
conference of "Bad Engineer The Series".

604
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:30,043
To be honest,
as the announcer of the series,

605
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,892
I'm really happy
to hear your passionate voices.

606
00:51:32,972 --> 00:51:38,629
I believe all of you are here to cheer for
the director, writer and cast, right?

607
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,006
Without further a due,
let us invite the director,

608
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:48,068
writer and cast to the stage
with our loudest cheers, all right?

609
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:50,074
Okay? Cheer as loud as you can!

610
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:52,189
Three, two, one, let's go!

611
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,170
Okay, director, writer and cast.
Please come on to the stage.

612
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,350
Hello.

613
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:03,475
Okay. Hello.

614
00:52:04,399 --> 00:52:10,469
Hello. Hello.

615
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:11,750
Please.

616
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,709
Hello.

617
00:52:14,789 --> 00:52:17,167
Everyone, please take a seat.

618
00:52:17,247 --> 00:52:19,387
Okay. Take a seat.

619
00:52:20,587 --> 00:52:22,185
Let's have a self-introduction.

620
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,979
Tell us about your name and role.

621
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:30,409
I'm Mai. I'm the director of...

622
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,565
"Bad Engineer The Series".

623
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,330
A round of applause for Mai!

624
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:40,200
Next, hello.

625
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:44,599
Hello, I'm Gene.
I wrote under the pseudonym, Wizard.

626
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:49,273
I'm the author
of "Bad Engineer The Series".

627
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,091
Okay. Hello.

628
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,930
Next.

629
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,840
Hello, I'm Nubsib Pipatpukdee.

630
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,638
I play Kin in the series.

631
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:06,957
How nice.

632
00:53:07,037 --> 00:53:09,143
Is Nubsib nice?

633
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:11,349
Yes!

634
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,894
Okay, that's all for Nubsib.

635
00:53:12,974 --> 00:53:14,968
Next, what is your name?

636
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:18,332
Hello, I'm Aey Atikan.

637
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:19,677
I play Namcha in the series.

638
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:29,658
How sweet is that? Very good.

639
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:31,492
Both of them are impressive.

640
00:53:31,572 --> 00:53:33,059
Our last guest.

641
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:34,371
Hello.

642
00:53:34,451 --> 00:53:36,324
Hello, I'm Mhok Metheewat.

643
00:53:36,404 --> 00:53:37,694
I play Tawan in the series.

644
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:41,167
Keep screaming!

645
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:47,910
Okay, I want to talk to Mai.

646
00:53:48,185 --> 00:53:55,036
Mai, I want to know how are you inspired
to adapt this novel into a series?

647
00:53:56,004 --> 00:53:59,798
I think this novel is very special.

648
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:02,335
I picked it up because it attracted me.

649
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:05,040
I started to talk about it
in the office...

650
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,751
and everyone thought
there are many parts in the novel...

651
00:54:08,831 --> 00:54:11,428
that makes people love them.

652
00:54:11,508 --> 00:54:13,835
It suits the audience.

653
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,556
That is why
I've decided to make it into a series.

654
00:54:16,636 --> 00:54:20,320
I had a chat with Gene recently.

655
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:22,200
We talked about...

656
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,764
I'm really proud of them.

657
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,333
Right?

658
00:54:26,525 --> 00:54:27,452
Yes.

659
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:30,936
I'm proud of both of us too.

660
00:54:31,538 --> 00:54:33,287
We never quarreled all this while.

661
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:38,444
We've broken the curse that every
BL series actor's agent must quarrel.

662
00:54:42,707 --> 00:54:44,685
Thank you.

663
00:54:45,853 --> 00:54:47,678
You always help me.

664
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,841
I'm where I'm at today because of you.

665
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,579
Stay cute.

666
00:54:55,516 --> 00:54:56,715
Don't abandon me.

667
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,008
Are you all right?

668
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:15,371
It's...

669
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,117
I have something to tell you.

670
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:21,277
I think...

671
00:55:24,374 --> 00:55:26,097
I like you.

672
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,635
What did you say?

673
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:38,938
I didn't hear it.

674
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,701
I think I like you.

675
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,240
Can you hear me?

676
00:56:00,968 --> 00:56:02,263
What?

677
00:56:02,752 --> 00:56:04,308
What's wrong with you?

678
00:56:04,388 --> 00:56:05,673
All of a sudden, you...

679
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:07,642
Louder!

680
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:16,197
Okay, in that case,
we should have a performance now.

681
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:18,617
Mai said
they will shoot a scene on stage today.

682
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:20,833
Wait, let me ask my cast first.
Let's ask them.

683
00:56:20,913 --> 00:56:21,959
Is it okay?

684
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,871
-Yes?
-Okay?

685
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:25,511
They are so cute.

686
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,153
Okay. Please stand up.

687
00:56:34,189 --> 00:56:36,422
Are you ready?

688
00:56:36,502 --> 00:56:38,084
My actors are ready.

689
00:56:38,164 --> 00:56:41,082
Audiences, fans, are you ready?

690
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:46,014
-Are you ready?
-Yes!

691
00:56:47,211 --> 00:56:48,573
Louder!

692
00:56:48,653 --> 00:56:49,775
Okay.

693
00:56:49,855 --> 00:56:51,851
That's loud enough.

694
00:56:52,528 --> 00:56:53,430
Okay.

695
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,473
Mai will say "Action".

696
00:56:54,553 --> 00:56:56,708
We are doing this for real.

697
00:56:57,712 --> 00:57:01,391
Five, four, three, two, action!

698
00:57:06,877 --> 00:57:08,355
You're here?

699
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,949
Why didn't you tell me
about your escape this morning?

700
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,663
You can never escape.

701
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:26,584
The marks I left on you...

702
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,242
is to remind you that...

703
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,819
you belong to me.

704
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,418
Okay, cut!

705
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,040
Applause!

706
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,586
Okay.

707
00:57:56,666 --> 00:57:58,684
Aey is already blushing.

708
00:57:59,404 --> 00:58:02,453
Chemistry, Physics, Biology, everything!

709
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:04,254
They can do everything, right?

710
00:58:04,334 --> 00:58:06,435
Yes!

711
00:58:10,229 --> 00:58:11,444
What?

712
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:12,834
Calm down.

713
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,697
I can't keep it to myself anymore.

714
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,207
I think I like you.

715
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,388
Ever since we went everywhere,

716
00:58:22,775 --> 00:58:26,048
did everything together
and helped each other,

717
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,083
my feelings had changed.

718
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,213
Before I met you, I thought
you were just like other agents...

719
00:58:35,624 --> 00:58:40,367
who were very competitive
and sought your own benefits.

720
00:58:40,447 --> 00:58:43,169
But I have realized
you are not one of them.

721
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:47,404
You are pretty
and have a nice personality.

722
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:51,014
Besides, you taught me many things.

723
00:58:53,287 --> 00:58:55,868
You were by my side
when I have no one else.

724
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,422
I'm sure you are the one.

725
00:59:02,775 --> 00:59:04,048
Enough, Tum.

726
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:07,226
Is this the right time to be joking?

727
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:10,790
What a waste of time.
I'm going back to work.

728
00:59:11,575 --> 00:59:15,255
Don't you feel anything
after what I said to you?

729
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:19,198
I'm not joking.

730
00:59:20,198 --> 00:59:22,971
I'm not fooling around.
What I said is all true.

731
00:59:27,491 --> 00:59:28,561
Tiffy!

732
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:34,815
Have you ever liked me?

733
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,132
Do you need to go back and reconsider it?

734
00:59:42,734 --> 00:59:46,278
Are you really sure
this is what you think it is?

735
00:59:47,736 --> 00:59:51,288
If you are using this as a joke,
I don't think it's funny.

736
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:16,870
Hello, everyone.
Welcome to "Comment Before Sleep".

737
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,220
I'm very nervous today.

738
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,070
That's because
I'm at the launching event...

739
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,745
of a TV series
that is so popular recently.

740
01:00:23,825 --> 01:00:26,495
Many people are waiting to watch it.

741
01:00:26,575 --> 01:00:29,520
The TV series
is "Bad Engineer The Series".

742
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,245
The cast, director
and writer are behind me.

743
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,920
Let's have a chat with them.

744
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,416
Follow me, everyone.

745
01:00:36,496 --> 01:00:38,281
Hello.

746
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:39,534
-Hello.
-Hello.

747
01:00:39,614 --> 01:00:41,623
Please allow me to stand in the middle.

748
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:42,588
Okay.

749
01:00:42,668 --> 01:00:43,860
Please hold the mic.

750
01:00:44,434 --> 01:00:46,438
Please hold it
like how you are holding my heart.

751
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:52,245
Okay, "Bad Engineer The Series"
has been launched today.

752
01:00:52,325 --> 01:00:54,805
How do you feel right now about
the series going on air soon?

753
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,611
I feel very nervous.

754
01:00:56,691 --> 01:01:00,094
I can see many people have come
including the audience and novel's fans.

755
01:01:00,175 --> 01:01:04,422
I'm happy to meet so many fans.

756
01:01:04,502 --> 01:01:06,682
Even the rookies are cute.

757
01:01:07,315 --> 01:01:08,850
So handsome.

758
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,066
We have questions from the audience.

759
01:01:12,149 --> 01:01:15,518
They asked whether Nubsib and Aey
would feel pressured...

760
01:01:15,598 --> 01:01:19,729
for playing as Kin and Namcha
in a BL series for the first time.

761
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,200
We actually feel the pressure.
As you've mentioned just now,

762
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,104
we are all rookies
and we are also acting in Gene's work.

763
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:32,591
He is a very famous writer
with many fans.

764
01:01:32,681 --> 01:01:37,003
There are so many fans of his,
but we will still do our best.

765
01:01:38,327 --> 01:01:41,116
Is the relationship
between Nubsib and Aey real?

766
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:45,789
How should I put this?

767
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,083
-Just stay tuned to the series.
-That's right.

768
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:52,068
Okay, finally,
say something to the audience.

769
01:01:52,148 --> 01:01:55,341
For those audience who want to watch
"Bad Engineer The Series",

770
01:01:55,421 --> 01:01:57,634
-it will be on air on Channel 10.
-Okay.

771
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,559
Please cheer for us, thank you.

772
01:02:01,149 --> 01:02:05,325
When the series starts, we'll invite
everyone to do a reaction video.

773
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:07,212
Sure.

774
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,942
-Shall we do some actions?
-Okay.

775
01:02:09,022 --> 01:02:10,107
A cute one.

776
01:02:10,187 --> 01:02:12,795
"Comment Before Sleep!"

777
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,564
Thank you.

778
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:16,581
Please like and share.

779
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:21,963
Gene.

780
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:23,951
Yes?

781
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,547
Can you take a photo?
Take a photo with Nubsib.

782
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,284
I think...

783
01:02:30,364 --> 01:02:31,583
Come, Mr Gene.

784
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,588
So cute.

785
01:02:51,735 --> 01:02:53,175
Smile wider.

786
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:56,912
That's all I can do.

787
01:02:56,992 --> 01:02:58,992
If it doesn't look cute later,
I won't forgive you.

788
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:03,842
I don't want to be cute.

789
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:07,419
Brother,

790
01:03:07,499 --> 01:03:10,555
can we ask Nubsib and Aey
to take a picture together?

791
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,103
Can you wait?

792
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:19,068
We are taking pictures of Gene and Nubsib.

793
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:24,386
You've been taking pictures for a while.

794
01:03:24,466 --> 01:03:26,043
You should give others a chance.

795
01:03:37,111 --> 01:03:39,481
I'll go to the washroom.

796
01:03:47,025 --> 01:03:48,410
Let's go.

797
01:03:51,657 --> 01:03:55,447
Aey and Nubsib,
please take a picture together.

798
01:03:55,527 --> 01:03:56,466
Okay.

799
01:03:57,598 --> 01:03:59,162
Come, Nubsib. Let's take a picture.

800
01:03:59,872 --> 01:04:01,084
So cute!

801
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:03,129
He's so sweet.

802
01:04:03,209 --> 01:04:05,065
Closer.

803
01:04:09,175 --> 01:04:10,554
So cute!

804
01:04:23,707 --> 01:04:24,730
Gene.

805
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:26,009
Who are you escaping from?

806
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,849
The fans.

807
01:04:28,929 --> 01:04:30,868
They want me to take pictures with Nubsib.

808
01:04:30,948 --> 01:04:33,489
That's normal. You are famous now.

809
01:04:34,446 --> 01:04:36,222
Do you think I wanted to be famous?

810
01:04:36,644 --> 01:04:38,888
I want to live a quiet life too.

811
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:41,096
Really?

812
01:04:41,762 --> 01:04:43,659
I think it's good.

813
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:45,351
When you were on the stage,

814
01:04:45,431 --> 01:04:49,030
I almost cried
because I felt proud of you.

815
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,362
What are you doing?

816
01:04:53,778 --> 01:04:55,680
Why are you getting so emotional?

817
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,796
It's nothing.

818
01:04:58,577 --> 01:05:00,584
Where are you going?

819
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:02,197
I'm going to the washroom.

820
01:05:02,722 --> 01:05:04,226
Okay.

821
01:05:04,306 --> 01:05:06,726
I'll be leaving then.

822
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:09,814
I have to follow up on the three of them.

823
01:05:09,894 --> 01:05:12,397
I have yet to get the draft
after a 3-day delay.

824
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,805
Good bye.

825
01:05:14,885 --> 01:05:15,762
Good luck, brother.

826
01:05:15,842 --> 01:05:16,875
Sure.

827
01:05:48,475 --> 01:05:49,703
Hello, Gene.

828
01:05:52,025 --> 01:05:53,077
Aey.

829
01:05:53,157 --> 01:05:54,355
You scared me.

830
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:56,427
Are you here alone?

831
01:05:57,388 --> 01:06:00,228
I came here
because it is too crowded over there.

832
01:06:00,308 --> 01:06:02,270
Suit yourself.

833
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,667
Wait.

834
01:06:06,163 --> 01:06:07,606
Why are you in a rush?

835
01:06:07,686 --> 01:06:09,139
It's been so long since we talked.

836
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,410
I saw your pictures all over Twitter.
They are very cute.

837
01:06:18,825 --> 01:06:21,030
Did you get together with Nubsib?

838
01:06:24,336 --> 01:06:25,493
What do you mean?

839
01:06:26,851 --> 01:06:28,397
You're still saying that.

840
01:06:29,076 --> 01:06:30,860
Let me change my question.

841
01:06:31,911 --> 01:06:33,573
Do you like Nubsib?

842
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,130
You like Nubsib.

843
01:06:46,314 --> 01:06:47,336
If I...

844
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:51,480
You knew I like Nubsib
but you still went and like him.

845
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:54,313
Aey.

846
01:06:59,475 --> 01:07:00,808
So, it has come to this.

847
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:20,393
I understand.

848
01:07:21,391 --> 01:07:23,399
You might not be satisfied...

849
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:28,489
but what you said was wrong.

850
01:07:29,751 --> 01:07:32,538
Are you trying to lecture me?

851
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,696
No, I'm not.

852
01:07:36,405 --> 01:07:38,096
I'm only telling the truth.

853
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:43,157
A normal person
would've already thought about that.

854
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:45,938
Are you saying
that I can't figure that out?

855
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:47,393
Are you taking a dig at me?

856
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,192
I thought you were a cute
and honest person.

857
01:07:53,928 --> 01:07:55,786
Seems like you are naughty too, Gene.

858
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:02,667
It's fine that way.

859
01:08:03,935 --> 01:08:05,799
I think that's how you are.

860
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:11,016
You don't look like the honest type.

861
01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:16,950
Aey, mind your words.

862
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:20,086
What?

863
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:21,654
Are you angry?

864
01:08:21,734 --> 01:08:23,012
You don't have to.

865
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:25,567
Because that's how it is. I...

866
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:27,179
Aey.

867
01:08:27,568 --> 01:08:28,622
Nubsib.

868
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:33,966
Is the interview over?

869
01:08:34,576 --> 01:08:36,792
Have you forgotten
about the things we discussed?

870
01:08:38,575 --> 01:08:41,820
Oh, the things we've discussed.

871
01:08:42,604 --> 01:08:43,689
I won't forget it.

872
01:08:44,697 --> 01:08:46,600
Don't go overboard.

873
01:08:51,625 --> 01:08:52,736
It's not.

874
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:55,981
I'm serious.

875
01:08:57,261 --> 01:08:59,019
Hey, did you see the event outside?

876
01:08:59,099 --> 01:09:00,505
It's such a grand event.

877
01:09:00,585 --> 01:09:02,210
Yes. It's very grand.

878
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:04,020
I wonder which series it is.

879
01:09:21,675 --> 01:09:24,020
I won't say it again.

880
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:32,881
Let's go back.

881
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:34,199
Tum is waiting.

882
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,300
Gene.

883
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:00,743
What?

884
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:05,467
Stay away from Aey from now on.

885
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:08,459
Why?

886
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,331
Is there a problem between you two?

887
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:14,008
It's nothing.

888
01:11:14,088 --> 01:11:15,467
It's just something meaningless.

889
01:11:18,276 --> 01:11:19,568
It's about me, right?

890
01:11:25,804 --> 01:11:26,808
Yes.

891
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:30,948
So, Aey is unhappy about me?

892
01:11:31,028 --> 01:11:32,194
No.

893
01:11:33,525 --> 01:11:34,814
No?

894
01:11:34,894 --> 01:11:36,326
He even...

895
01:11:41,925 --> 01:11:43,854
He was rude to me.

896
01:11:44,485 --> 01:11:46,627
I don't know why he got angry.

897
01:11:47,502 --> 01:11:50,587
That is why I want you
to stay away from him.

898
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,016
It's better to leave him alone.

899
01:11:53,584 --> 01:11:54,907
What if I leave him alone?

900
01:11:56,034 --> 01:11:57,559
He's not even done yet.

901
01:11:57,639 --> 01:11:59,061
I'm done.

902
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:07,661
It's still about me, right?

903
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:10,118
I should talk to him.

904
01:12:10,333 --> 01:12:11,455
No.

905
01:12:18,775 --> 01:12:20,126
Why not?

906
01:12:21,226 --> 01:12:23,405
Are you afraid
that I'm going to scold your friend?

907
01:12:25,734 --> 01:12:27,896
I don't care about that.

908
01:12:29,314 --> 01:12:31,298
I'm worried about you.

909
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,513
Worried?

910
01:12:36,181 --> 01:12:37,425
I'm a grown up.

911
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,325
You don't even want me
to call you my brother.

912
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,708
I don't like it when you get
worried about me like a child either.

913
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,466
Getting worried about you
is not related to your age...

914
01:12:49,546 --> 01:12:51,231
or the fact that you are older than me.

915
01:12:51,732 --> 01:12:53,443
I'm just worried about you.

916
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,587
Okay.

917
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:02,130
Tell me your reason then.

918
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,863
Why are you worried about me?

919
01:13:05,825 --> 01:13:07,031
Why?

920
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:09,289
Is Aey going to do anything to me?

921
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:11,373
Is he going to kill me?

922
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:15,091
Tell me.

923
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,108
Why don't you tell me?

924
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:20,814
Why are you keeping it to yourself?

925
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:25,899
Say it.

926
01:13:26,753 --> 01:13:29,194
Nubsib, Gene, where have you two been?

927
01:13:34,654 --> 01:13:36,016
Do you want to eat together?

928
01:13:36,528 --> 01:13:38,478
I have things to ask you.

929
01:13:38,558 --> 01:13:40,778
No. I'm tired.

930
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:42,542
I'm going back to sleep.

931
01:13:44,110 --> 01:13:46,419
What about the banquet at night?
I want you to be there.

932
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:51,408
Sorry. Just go without me.

933
01:13:57,005 --> 01:13:59,005
Okay. Never mind.

934
01:14:01,973 --> 01:14:02,920
Go with Nubsib.

935
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,608
-But I...
-No.

936
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:06,771
You have to go.

937
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:09,567
You've promised them.

938
01:14:10,673 --> 01:14:13,199
It's bad to reject someone, got it?

939
01:14:13,594 --> 01:14:16,405
Besides,
the organizer is the TV station.

940
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,070
You'll be in trouble if you don't go.

941
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:22,519
Wait for me in your room then.

942
01:14:23,649 --> 01:14:26,517
I'll talk with you when I'm back.

943
01:14:28,467 --> 01:14:29,564
Okay.

944
01:14:35,442 --> 01:14:36,799
What are you fighting about?

945
01:15:59,589 --> 01:16:00,948
Who is it?

946
01:16:03,575 --> 01:16:09,473
(Aey: Let's meet.
I have something to talk to you about.)

947
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:44,050
I knew you would come. (On Next Episode)

948
01:16:45,575 --> 01:16:47,450
You do like Nubsib, right?

949
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,966
Besides getting worried about you,

950
01:16:50,412 --> 01:16:51,954
I'm still jealous of you.

951
01:16:52,034 --> 01:16:53,952
Let's make a promise, all right?

952
01:16:54,032 --> 01:16:55,984
Are you still hot?

953
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:57,755
Are you allergic to alcohol?

954
01:16:57,835 --> 01:16:59,321
I'm not allergic.

955
01:16:59,401 --> 01:17:00,789
I'm feeling hot.

956
01:17:01,523 --> 01:17:03,032
My whole body is heating up.

957
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:11,038
Do you feel better this way?
