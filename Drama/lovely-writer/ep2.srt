1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,920
We want Gene
to write us another Boy Love novel!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,022
What?

3
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:11,058
They're going to have a casting
for "Bad Engineer The Series".

4
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,105
They want you to join.

5
00:00:12,185 --> 00:00:14,724
Number 18, Nubsib please come in.

6
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,462
You're mine.

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:21,548
Gene!

8
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:24,678
It's me, Tum.
I'm working as an artist manager.

9
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,065
I think you already met him.

10
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:27,191
Nubsib?

11
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:29,013
There's something urgent.
Can you come to see me?

12
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:30,898
Your condo has three bedrooms, right?

13
00:00:30,978 --> 00:00:33,318
Can Nubsib...

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,718
No!

15
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:41,393
I haven't even finished...

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:48,162
You've said so much,
do you think I can't guess?

17
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,191
Please, Gene!

18
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:54,269
I'm having a bit of
an accommodation problem.

19
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,158
Can Nubsib stay here for just one month?

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:00:58,084
No.

21
00:00:58,164 --> 00:00:59,323
-Three weeks?
-No.

22
00:00:59,403 --> 00:01:00,750
-Two weeks?
-No.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,532
No matter how many days,
the answer is still no.

24
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:07,739
Please, I'm begging you!
It's not that I want to bother you,

25
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,721
but I'm out of options.

26
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:13,723
Nubsib's home is so far
but he has to go to class and work...

27
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:18,510
so I had him live at the agency's
building but Tam got new recruits,

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,932
and this is all because of Nubsib,
I don't know how he spoke to her...

29
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:23,952
and get so mixed up that
he doesn't have a room.

30
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:27,257
Now I'm in deep shit because
I can't find a place for him to live.

31
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:31,242
The series is starting the shooting soon.

32
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:36,708
Why don't you just rent out a hotel?

33
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,338
The agency is so damn rich.

34
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:42,756
It's just a small amount of money
to pay for the kids.

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,887
Are you crazy? Nubsib is famous,

36
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,190
if people
see him at a hotel we'll be screwed.

37
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,379
Fans waiting in the
lobby and even stalkers!

38
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,468
Hotels aren't very private.

39
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,878
What about your home?

40
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:05,938
At first, I was going to do that but
my house is even further than Nubsib's.

41
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,103
It's worse!

42
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:15,516
Please? You're the best option
and Nubsib can help you with housework.

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,795
He's very good at it and he cooks too!

44
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:26,295
Tum, I'm not close with Nubsib...

45
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,386
and even though you
say it's just temporary,

46
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:34,551
but I work from home
and I can't think of a new plot.

47
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:40,906
Everybody wants their privacy,
not only me but Nubsib too!

48
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:46,421
Nubsib doesn't have a problem, right?

49
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,744
Don't you guys have other options?

50
00:02:58,195 --> 00:02:59,900
I'm at my wit's end.

51
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:05,757
I understand that we've just reconnected
so it's too soon for you to trust me...

52
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,905
but I have nobody else.

53
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:15,825
Please, Gene.
Nubsib will not stay here for free.

54
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:20,291
He'll pay the water
and electricity bills and the...

55
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:25,172
I can help clean the room if Gene is busy.

56
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:33,248
Nubsib is the best at housekeeping!

57
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:37,155
You won't see any dust!
Please? Only one month.

58
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,454
You guys are really hard selling.

59
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,346
So...

60
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:02,652
Fine, don't need to come up
with so many excuses.

61
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:04,716
One month is fine.

62
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,829
It's only because you're in trouble.

63
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,009
Do you know even my older brother
hasn't even slept here?

64
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:23,639
As for the cleaning, it's okay
and never mind about the utility bills.

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,330
Gene, you're a lifesaver!

66
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:35,888
Enough I'm going to throw up.

67
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:30,062
=Lovely Writer=

68
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,081
Gene.

69
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:52,566
Gene.

70
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,049
Gene.

71
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,521
What? Why are you calling me?

72
00:06:08,185 --> 00:06:11,028
Please get some rest, I'll do it.

73
00:06:17,861 --> 00:06:24,173
Let me nap for a while, I've been
thinking so much about work lately.

74
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:40,382
I'm a writer so my
working hours are different...

75
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,455
and I'm working on a new novel
so ideas only come to me at night.

76
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,169
If you're going to live here,

77
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,427
the only thing
I ask is to not bother me while working.

78
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:55,269
Do you understand?

79
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,469
This is your room, make yourself at home.

80
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,494
Gene.

81
00:09:12,768 --> 00:09:14,213
Gene.

82
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,481
Gene.

83
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:25,712
Gene.

84
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:31,123
Gene.

85
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:37,613
What?

86
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,354
Do you want to toast in the morning?

87
00:09:39,434 --> 00:09:43,839
Sure, put mountains of jam on it.

88
00:09:44,112 --> 00:09:45,785
Like this?

89
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,807
Are you getting on my nerves?

90
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm just doing what you told me.

91
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:08,102
How do you normally get to classes?

92
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,577
Sometimes I take the bus or a taxi.

93
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:15,183
Get ready, I'm taking
you to the university.

94
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:19,461
Really?

95
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:22,969
Why would I lie?

96
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,806
Go and get ready.

97
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:30,822
You don't have to be nice to me.

98
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,622
I'm letting you stay
because I feel sorry for Tum.

99
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:39,822
Just stay in your lane
and don't bother me.

100
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:41,717
Do you understand?

101
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,829
Go get dressed.

102
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,487
What are you doing?

103
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:34,517
You forgot to buckle in your seat-belt
so I wanted to help.

104
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:39,656
I can do it myself.

105
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:49,735
Don't forget to buckle your seat-belt.

106
00:12:16,874 --> 00:12:20,149
Here's your key-card,

107
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,114
I forgot to give it to you yesterday.

108
00:12:22,194 --> 00:12:25,165
Don't lose it, it's expensive.

109
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,242
I'm never going to lose
something you give me.

110
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:38,981
Let's go, you're going to be late.

111
00:12:39,061 --> 00:12:41,762
Thank you for dropping me off.

112
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:43,428
Study hard!

113
00:12:44,118 --> 00:12:46,218
Please drive home safely.

114
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,370
This is for you.

115
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:04,564
Thank you.

116
00:13:50,334 --> 00:13:51,661
Earn.

117
00:13:52,746 --> 00:13:56,153
Mhok! You startled me,
when did you get here?

118
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:57,621
Just a second ago.

119
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,216
You're Mr Popular now.

120
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,799
Can I have your autograph
before you get famous?

121
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:06,321
You're exaggerating.

122
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,948
I'm not! Look at the hashtag on Twitter.

123
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,324
Everybody tweeted photos of you.

124
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:16,957
It's not like that
I'm not even the main cast.

125
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,123
Not like Aey...

126
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:27,806
Can I ask you something?

127
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:37,239
If you're going to ask about Aey,
he's doing fine.

128
00:14:38,188 --> 00:14:41,789
He's bubbly and friendly with everyone.

129
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:46,566
Thank you.

130
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,538
Thank you.

131
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,192
But he's not answering my texts.

132
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:58,515
Maybe he doesn't want
to talk to me anymore.

133
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,888
It's not just you,

134
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:05,063
I'm standing right
there in front of him and he ignores me.

135
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,689
We're not kids anymore.

136
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:10,494
At least he's not doing
bad things to others.

137
00:15:10,574 --> 00:15:12,195
That's enough right?

138
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:20,660
If you see him,
can you tell him to answer my messages?

139
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:23,513
Sure, I'll tell him.

140
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,861
So how is Med school?

141
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,320
It's stressful.

142
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:39,374
I don't know
if it's from studying or something else.

143
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:42,706
What do you mean?

144
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,254
Never mind.

145
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,997
I think it's good that Aey didn't
choose Med school...

146
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:50,206
as his Dad told him to like me.

147
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,332
Aey is brave enough to defy his father,

148
00:15:54,135 --> 00:15:56,633
sometimes I get really jealous.

149
00:15:56,713 --> 00:15:58,678
I want to be like him too.

150
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,595
Hello, Mom.

151
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:02,769
What are you doing?

152
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:06,285
I just got back to my room,
what are you doing?

153
00:17:06,365 --> 00:17:09,325
I miss you so I called to talk.

154
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:14,772
I miss you too, how are you?

155
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:19,035
I'm tired from work but hearing your voice
makes me feel much better.

156
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:22,319
What about you? How was work?

157
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:25,103
Everything is the same.

158
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,209
Why won't you come to visit?

159
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,671
If I can get a day off
I'll go home to you.

160
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:35,322
How is dad?

161
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:39,701
Same old, I don't want to talk about it.

162
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,237
Don't think too much.

163
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:45,261
How can I not? He's spending so much.

164
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:49,432
I don't know how he's getting
into so much debt and trouble.

165
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:54,738
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

166
00:17:54,818 --> 00:17:57,221
Never mind.

167
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:02,219
Be patient, it'll get better.

168
00:18:03,546 --> 00:18:07,062
Quickly come home, I miss you.

169
00:18:09,602 --> 00:18:13,954
I miss you too, I love you.

170
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,395
I love you too.

171
00:19:20,567 --> 00:19:23,197
(Tum: Tell Nubsib I'm picking
him up tomorrow afternoon)

172
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,042
(to take him for the series refitting.)

173
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,208
Geez, he keeps bothering me.

174
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:04,921
Are you awake?

175
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:26,085
The way you're looking at me,
I'm getting shy.

176
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,522
I've been awake for a while, I'm hungry.

177
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:39,083
I'm going to go find something to eat.

178
00:20:39,163 --> 00:20:40,792
Can I go with you?

179
00:20:45,275 --> 00:20:47,827
Have you been home long?

180
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:49,256
For a while.

181
00:20:49,901 --> 00:20:51,875
Why didn't you find something to eat yet?

182
00:20:51,955 --> 00:20:54,033
I was waiting for you.

183
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:57,399
Why did you wait?

184
00:20:57,479 --> 00:21:02,318
I told you that my work hours
are different from others.

185
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,939
Next time if you're hungry
go get something to eat.

186
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,649
Go put some clothes on.

187
00:21:15,728 --> 00:21:17,657
Am I making you shy?

188
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:22,441
Shy my ass, you can stay here freely...

189
00:21:22,522 --> 00:21:26,199
but that doesn't mean
you can walk around half-naked.

190
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,472
Go put on some clothes now.

191
00:21:30,108 --> 00:21:31,607
Don't you like it?

192
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,391
I think I have a great body.

193
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:40,818
It's not that I don't like it.

194
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,382
So you like it?

195
00:21:45,946 --> 00:21:50,235
Why do you have to
know if I like it or not?

196
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:55,200
So I can be the most
perfect character for you.

197
00:21:57,518 --> 00:22:01,471
You're exaggerating,
go put on some clothes.

198
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:34,673
What are you looking at?
Just choose what you want to eat.

199
00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,608
I don't know what I want to eat.

200
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:43,220
I'll choose for you.

201
00:22:44,348 --> 00:22:46,210
Judging from your abs,

202
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,291
it must be something lean.

203
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,011
You remember my body?

204
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:54,821
Sure.

205
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:02,444
I mean, I didn't meant to memorize it.

206
00:23:02,546 --> 00:23:04,609
It's just...

207
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:09,775
I remember it.

208
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,376
I'm just kidding,
but this is almost expired.

209
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,717
How do you know?

210
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:19,343
It has the yellow price tag.

211
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,141
Right.

212
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:29,924
Just eat it, it's just almost expired
but it hasn't gone bad yet.

213
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,743
Thank you so much.

214
00:23:44,227 --> 00:23:48,629
Excuse me, are you an actor?

215
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:52,459
No.

216
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:55,267
I don't think I remembered
the wrong person.

217
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:58,151
What's the name... It's Nubsib, right?

218
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,386
I think you've got the wrong person,
but people make that mistake all the time.

219
00:24:02,466 --> 00:24:07,157
I'm sorry, did you just move in?

220
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm going to get water.

221
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:13,387
Yes, I just moved in with my boyfriend.

222
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:16,893
Please excuse me.

223
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:28,346
What were you thinking saying that?

224
00:24:28,726 --> 00:24:32,217
I wanted her to really believe
that it wasn't me.

225
00:24:32,308 --> 00:24:33,788
I have to live here.

226
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,096
If people knew it was me
there will be big trouble.

227
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:42,707
What about me?
You're only staying here for one month.

228
00:24:42,787 --> 00:24:44,572
And I have to stay here.

229
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:45,897
I don't see anything wrong with that.

230
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:46,908
Sib!

231
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,981
Why are you laughing at?

232
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:51,610
Nothing, I'm just glad.

233
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:55,068
The hell with that, why are you laughing?

234
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,558
I'm really glad.

235
00:24:57,326 --> 00:25:01,028
I'm glad because the way you spoke
made me feel like we're getting close.

236
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:06,075
Like what? Calling you Sib?

237
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:11,394
Yes, I don't want you to feel
awkward when you're with me.

238
00:25:12,182 --> 00:25:13,812
I want us to be close.

239
00:25:17,087 --> 00:25:19,911
So should we just say Gu-Mueng?

240
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:23,816
If you're okay with that
then I'm down with it.

241
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,353
You started this.

242
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,081
You buffalo! Bastard!

243
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:38,302
Stuck up! Tall! Superstar! Softie!

244
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,209
Ass!

245
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:48,792
I'm sorry.

246
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,958
I'm sorry for my boyfriend.

247
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:52,435
Sib!!

248
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,416
You're doing it again.

249
00:25:55,496 --> 00:26:02,090
If you cussing at me makes us
come closer then I'm okay with it.

250
00:26:04,284 --> 00:26:07,637
Are you alright in the head?

251
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,422
Why won't you call me Phi?

252
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:13,765
I don't to call you Phi.

253
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:16,368
Are you getting on my nerves again?

254
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,060
When we're close,

255
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,100
I'll change your title.

256
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:41,106
His lip were quickly
crushed by the tall protagonist.

257
00:26:42,522 --> 00:26:45,653
He was out of breath
while his mind went blank...

258
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:49,531
but he kept his eyes closed during the
kiss out of fear of being unprofessional.

259
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:51,498
He begun to feel unsure
if what was happening...

260
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:55,738
was just something
in the scene or really happening.

261
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,198
Hey, Gene.

262
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:28,202
How does he look?
Khin, the lead of your novel.

263
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:33,922
I just wanted you to see Sib's outfit,
your lead! Do you like it?

264
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,766
Do I look like a fashionista to you?

265
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:40,802
Then you can trust me because
I guarantee that he'll be so handsome...

266
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:43,428
that everyone will fall in love with him.

267
00:27:43,508 --> 00:27:46,661
Wow, you're good at going over the top.

268
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:51,624
Well, I am looking after him!
So, what are you up to?

269
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:52,889
I'm working.

270
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,350
You're writing a novel?

271
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,873
What are you working on? Can I ask?

272
00:27:59,627 --> 00:28:02,732
Well, it's just in a film production set,

273
00:28:02,812 --> 00:28:04,695
but the outline isn't quite done yet.

274
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:08,967
That's great, you can do research
by coming to the series' set.

275
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:10,943
-Tum.
-What?

276
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:14,239
I'm changing to the next outfit,
who are you talking to?

277
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:16,269
I'm talking to Gene.

278
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,399
Gene.

279
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,553
Yeah.

280
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,882
He's a wake?

281
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:24,124
Gene, how long have you been awake?

282
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,579
For sometime.

283
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,446
Did you have toast for breakfast?

284
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:32,215
I ate whatever I could find.

285
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:38,595
There's a sandwich in the fridge,
I made it this morning.

286
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,881
Don't forget to eat
or you'll get a stomach ache.

287
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,040
Okay.

288
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,110
Are you going to stay
in and write all day?

289
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:47,662
Something like that.

290
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:49,002
I know you can do it.

291
00:28:51,783 --> 00:28:55,366
We have to go now. Bye, Gene.

292
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:56,786
Bye.

293
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:07,519
There's a sandwich in the fridge,

294
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:10,729
I made it this morning.

295
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:15,325
Do you want toast in the morning?

296
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:53,664
Sib, hold Aey like this and Aey
put your hands on his chests firmly.

297
00:29:53,744 --> 00:29:57,985
Slightly look at him and smile,
like you guys are very much in love.

298
00:29:59,494 --> 00:30:02,799
It's a photo but the feeling
has to come from within.

299
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:06,091
Okay, are you ready? Clear the set!

300
00:30:06,601 --> 00:30:12,742
Take the picture,
don't block each other's faces.

301
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:15,047
Let me check, the lighting is good.

302
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:20,020
Look in love! Yeah!
Closer and more intimate.

303
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,811
It's not okay yet! Again!

304
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:26,080
Look in love and intimate!
Don't block each other.

305
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,830
Can you get closer?

306
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:34,208
Hold on to his arms tightly and relax.

307
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:43,300
Mai, the lead has to be a ship couple,

308
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,509
but they're standing miles apart,
it doesn't really scream "in love".

309
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,934
I'll get on it.

310
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:56,375
Sib and Aey can we do it again?
Stand closer.

311
00:30:56,455 --> 00:31:02,954
Even closer, like you're becoming as
one and Sib squeeze his arms harder.

312
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:09,889
Aey push his chest like you're saying,
don't come any closer, don't touch me!

313
00:31:10,585 --> 00:31:15,187
But you actually want him to
come closer, look more in love?

314
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,909
The lighting is great, snap on.

315
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:32,464
Get in with your inner feelings, great.

316
00:31:39,328 --> 00:31:45,937
Aey, would you answer
Earn's texts? She's concerned.

317
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,221
Did she tell you to tell me that?

318
00:31:55,418 --> 00:31:59,572
Could you stop being her spy?
It's irritating.

319
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:30,027
What are you doing?

320
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:33,412
I'm looking for Nubsib's wallet,
I don't know where it is.

321
00:32:34,407 --> 00:32:36,162
Do you need something?

322
00:32:36,242 --> 00:32:41,680
Nothing, but you're looking sharp today!

323
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:44,399
Gene's lucky to have you.

324
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:48,718
What? Gene is an old friend.
You're talking nonsense.

325
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,625
You don't need to hide it, I can see it.

326
00:32:51,705 --> 00:32:54,517
See what? There's nothing.

327
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:57,455
-Hey.
-What?

328
00:32:57,535 --> 00:32:58,982
Is this brand good?

329
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,432
-This one?
-Yeah.

330
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,767
It's great, it's perfect
for sensitive skin.

331
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,554
That great, I want to try it.

332
00:33:10,326 --> 00:33:13,036
This lipstick color is cute.

333
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,701
-Hey.
-What?

334
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:18,600
Can you help me put makeup on?

335
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,529
Do you think that's a good
idea? We haven't asked...

336
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:24,250
All the makeup crew are
on set, no one's coming.

337
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:28,012
Quickly, come on.

338
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,937
Are you sure?

339
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,215
Yeah.

340
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:12,843
Done.

341
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:17,581
It's a really nice lip color.

342
00:34:25,042 --> 00:34:27,835
Your face is all oily.

343
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,618
Let me help.

344
00:34:29,698 --> 00:34:30,620
Help?

345
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,672
-I'll help you.
-It's okay.

346
00:34:32,752 --> 00:34:35,881
Just stay still, let me do it.

347
00:34:36,793 --> 00:34:38,942
Your face is oily.

348
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,114
Close your eyes.

349
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,755
Done.

350
00:35:16,872 --> 00:35:18,037
How do I look?

351
00:35:20,147 --> 00:35:23,341
You're so pretty!
You could put on a wig and be a girl.

352
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:45,663
I'm going to the toilet.

353
00:37:01,696 --> 00:37:02,862
Who dropped you off?

354
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:10,581
Someone from the shoot because
he had to come this way anyway.

355
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,783
Where are you going?

356
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm going to go find something to eat.

357
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:21,573
Find something to eat?

358
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:23,358
At a mall around here.

359
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,391
Have you eaten? Do you want to join me?

360
00:37:29,471 --> 00:37:31,412
Are you inviting me?

361
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:37,007
Yeah, are you going?
If not, I'm going to go now.

362
00:37:41,952 --> 00:37:43,851
Wait for me, Gene.

363
00:38:37,196 --> 00:38:40,613
The series is starting to shoot soon.

364
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,674
Do you remember your lines yet?

365
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,356
I've read it but I haven't practiced yet.

366
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,880
So I'm a bit stuck about the character.

367
00:38:50,543 --> 00:38:54,373
Oh, yeah. Last time you said you were
going to ask me about the character.

368
00:38:54,453 --> 00:38:57,320
You can ask me, don't need to hold back.

369
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,100
Then when we get back to the room...

370
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,611
Can you help me practice my lines?

371
00:39:06,316 --> 00:39:09,184
What? Help you practice?

372
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:11,211
Yes.

373
00:39:15,016 --> 00:39:21,726
Acting and reading the scripts
isn't really what I'm good at.

374
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:30,652
And it's weird to write it and read it.

375
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:35,010
You just read the lines to answer me,

376
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,746
no need for acting.

377
00:39:38,262 --> 00:39:39,734
Just reading it?

378
00:39:40,938 --> 00:39:43,941
Can you say the lines? No way.

379
00:39:45,763 --> 00:39:49,804
I can, you just have to read them.

380
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:04,198
Please? Can you?

381
00:40:59,682 --> 00:41:02,156
Do you know what you've done?

382
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:11,564
Gene.

383
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:19,480
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

384
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,775
Clumsy.

385
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:23,868
I'll wash it for you.

386
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,047
Never mind.

387
00:41:25,297 --> 00:41:27,908
Then what do you want me to do?

388
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:32,058
Just clean it and don't leave a mess
that will make me mad.

389
00:41:32,499 --> 00:41:34,864
But it's not...

390
00:41:38,026 --> 00:41:40,125
Can I...

391
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:46,903
Shit.

392
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:53,358
I'm sorry, Gene, are you hurt?

393
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:56,300
No.

394
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,172
It doesn't hurt.

395
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,168
Does it have to be that real?
Maybe we should just read the lines?

396
00:42:07,514 --> 00:42:10,775
But reading is not
like acting out the lines...

397
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:14,313
to make it realistic and I don't
mess it up while I'm on set.

398
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:23,186
But you're practicing really hard
so I think it's going to be realistic.

399
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,875
And you're making me
play this role, I don't want to.

400
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:33,329
I'll act it out
and you just read it, okay?

401
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:39,252
Act alone? That's weird.

402
00:42:39,736 --> 00:42:41,316
Or do you want to join?

403
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:42,678
No.

404
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:50,554
Just read it, that's enough.

405
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:12,540
You look innocent
but you're pretty stubborn.

406
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,634
Wait, what are you going to do?

407
00:43:31,473 --> 00:43:32,762
Practicing my lines.

408
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:37,267
But this is a kissing scene?
You want to act this one out?

409
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,500
Do you care about the kissing?

410
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:46,726
No, I'm okay with it
but do we really have to kiss?

411
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:55,926
On set,
I have to play it with a guy any way.

412
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,975
But I'm not an actor.

413
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:05,835
Then...

414
00:44:06,968 --> 00:44:12,115
What were you feeling
when you were writing this?

415
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,158
The reason I want to try...

416
00:44:22,277 --> 00:44:24,586
because I want to know how you feel.

417
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:34,871
If you're not comfortable with kissing,
then never mind.

418
00:44:40,551 --> 00:44:43,478
I don't want to put you
in an uncomfortable position.

419
00:44:52,779 --> 00:44:55,016
Fine, we can kiss.

420
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:04,208
I said it's fine if we kiss,
I don't see anything wrong with.

421
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:08,016
Another thing is I wrote this scene.

422
00:45:09,796 --> 00:45:13,245
Are you sure?
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.

423
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,134
Just kiss me already.

424
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:57,236
In this script you have to be startled...

425
00:45:59,186 --> 00:46:01,047
but you can keep your eyes closed.

426
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:18,713
Those soft lips
slowly moved on to my lip...

427
00:47:20,476 --> 00:47:23,044
making me feel hot,

428
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,730
warm and soft.

429
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,997
The moment it touched my lips,

430
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:36,429
I froze like my body was
making me wait...

431
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:43,904
out the shock on purpose.

432
00:47:54,798 --> 00:47:58,293
I felt a strange tingle, my mind...

433
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:07,627
went blank while my face was burning.

434
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:14,488
Sounds of moaning crept from my lips.

435
00:48:14,568 --> 00:48:18,705
Barings his tounge unto my teeth.

436
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:27,823
While delicately placing those soft lips.

437
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:31,153
Pushing out and pulling in until.

438
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:40,106
I felt my breath shorten
but I couldn't break away.

439
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,640
Scared that I would break
from the character I was playing

440
00:48:57,194 --> 00:48:58,055
Cut!

441
00:48:58,135 --> 00:48:59,833
This is a Boy Love series!

442
00:48:59,913 --> 00:49:02,137
The kiss has to be passionate and hot!

443
00:49:02,217 --> 00:49:03,916
Gene? When did you get here?

444
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:08,076
Don't worry, I'll be your guardian.

445
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:09,506
I think you're cute.

446
00:49:09,586 --> 00:49:11,405
That's dangerous, be careful!

447
00:49:11,485 --> 00:49:15,605
But from now I want hot and steamy scenes.

448
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:16,914
Gene?

449
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:17,846
A sex scene.

450
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:21,163
If I help, you might finish early.

451
00:49:21,634 --> 00:49:22,481
Are you for real?

452
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,252
You don't need to worry.

453
00:49:24,332 --> 00:49:26,058
I learned it in a Workshop.
