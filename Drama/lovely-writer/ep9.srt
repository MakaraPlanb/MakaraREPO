1
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:14,740
At that moment his hands slid
and held both of my wrists...

2
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:18,273
locking in on the white bedroom walls.

3
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:28,791
Bathroom walls...

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,882
his face slowly moved so close
that I had to turn away and shut my eyes.

5
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,659
Oh, no, I thought...

6
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:45,303
I knew that I had the strength
to push the person in front of me away...

7
00:00:45,383 --> 00:00:47,702
but why wouldn't my body move?

8
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,345
One of his hands moved
from locking my wrists...

9
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,401
to feel me under my shirt.

10
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:58,685
It made my emotions run wild
before he crushed his lips onto my lips!

11
00:00:58,765 --> 00:01:03,185
Making it hard to breathe
my mind went blank.

12
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:07,667
I felt a tingle
when his warm hands fondled me...

13
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,857
slowly moving down to the edge of my pants
pulling it down slowly...

14
00:01:11,937 --> 00:01:14,098
before revealing my cute thing,

15
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:17,358
and using his hands to swipe it,
making my knees go weak.

16
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,848
This is Sexual Harassment!

17
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,918
How is this romantic?

18
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,213
What am I going to do
with this kind of script?

19
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,543
I can't think of anything!

20
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,883
What was I going to write?

21
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,729
What the hell?

22
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,037
Gene.

23
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:56,103
Hin.

24
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,288
What's up?

25
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,377
Hey, calm down.

26
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:06,158
It's only the morning
and he's all worked up.

27
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:10,259
Didn't I tell you
to not show up this whole week?

28
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:14,110
I came all the way here
so I could concentrate on the plot!

29
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:19,115
I really have something important
to tell you!

30
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,086
But you haven't been able
to come up with a plot yet?

31
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:25,196
What could be more urgent than my work?

32
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:31,079
Didn't you receive orders from Bua
that I only have five months!

33
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:38,606
Don't get so mad...

34
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:42,655
but this is a really urgent matter,
can we go talk inside?

35
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,587
If it's not urgent I'm going to hit you.

36
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:58,576
Sure, of course,
just get your knife ready, I can wait.

37
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:20,720
If I didn't know
you were writing Boy Love novels.

38
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,086
I'd probably think you're a pervert.

39
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,615
What?

40
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,180
Pervert my ass.

41
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,999
Watch your mouth.

42
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,829
You're getting mouthy these days.

43
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,733
Wow, really getting into it.

44
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:37,280
Hey!

45
00:05:37,924 --> 00:05:39,113
Go make me coffee.

46
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:42,636
I just got here
and you're already making me do stuff?

47
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,750
Are you going to make me coffee or not?

48
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,338
Wow, he's aggressive.

49
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,313
Fine, I'll get you your coffee.

50
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:53,473
Calm down.

51
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,881
Latte, right?

52
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,077
Fine, just calm down.

53
00:06:09,101 --> 00:06:10,677
Pervert my ass.

54
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:33,849
Gene, I had a meeting
with the stakeholders...

55
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,789
and we came to the conclusion that...

56
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:46,002
You're very good at what you do.
What you write is so fun...

57
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:50,020
and we came to the conclusion that...

58
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,786
That...

59
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:02,204
Have some coffee.

60
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,151
Thank you.

61
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:09,872
It's just that "Bad Engineer"...

62
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:13,069
has been chosen to be made
into a series with a big channel...

63
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:18,484
and the stakeholders are so appreciative
and they've come to a conclusion that...

64
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:21,863
That...

65
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,503
Is just that...

66
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:27,462
Just say it!

67
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,812
We want Gene
to write us another Boy Love novel!

68
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:31,147
What?

69
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:32,539
Just what I thought.

70
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,797
What's that?

71
00:07:34,973 --> 00:07:36,082
Nothing.

72
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:37,346
I thought you said,

73
00:07:37,426 --> 00:07:40,595
I could go back
to writing Horror Fantasy novels!

74
00:07:41,207 --> 00:07:43,141
I'm not good at writing Boy Love.

75
00:07:44,956 --> 00:07:47,272
I have so many plots to show you!

76
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,307
Please, Gene?

77
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,129
I'm not good at it.

78
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:57,737
I don't even know what plot to write.

79
00:07:57,817 --> 00:07:59,622
There's so many college student
Boy Love novels.

80
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,630
I don't want to write something
similar anymore.

81
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,583
But you're getting so famous,

82
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:09,545
and do you know
how much our sales went up?

83
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,461
-I don't care.
-But our company does!

84
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,867
How about you write
one more Boy Love novel?

85
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:23,913
And the next book,
you can write a Horror Fantasy novel.

86
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:28,240
-But...
-No buts!

87
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,943
I knew that
you were going to turn me down,

88
00:08:31,023 --> 00:08:36,073
but truthfully, it's because of you
that our company has come this far.

89
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,419
You're so good,
writing you're first BL novel...

90
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:40,918
and it was chosen to become a series.

91
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:43,632
Think about it, if you write one more.

92
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,946
People who like the series
will buy the books...

93
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:51,176
and if you write one more novel
it might become a series.

94
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:52,759
It's a win-win situation!

95
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,257
Please?

96
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:57,514
Please help me and the company...

97
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:02,517
and then after this, whatever you want,
I'll give it to you...

98
00:09:02,597 --> 00:09:04,272
unlimited!

99
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:17,308
Fine.

100
00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:19,934
But give me some time
to come up with the plot.

101
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,334
Awesome!

102
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:28,486
Thank you so much, Gene.

103
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,649
It's only because it's you
that's asking me.

104
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:36,244
I know I trusted the right person.

105
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:40,124
So I'm going to go now.

106
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,225
Sure.

107
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,253
Oh, Gene?

108
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:54,095
I want NC scenes
to be extra hot and steamy!

109
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,646
Not suitable for children!

110
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,729
Gene.

111
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:11,951
Gene.

112
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,729
Gene.

113
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,384
What do you want?

114
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:21,389
It's all because of you that
I can't concentrate and think of the plot.

115
00:10:21,469 --> 00:10:23,098
I'm so sorry.

116
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:29,736
You're puffing your cheeks again.

117
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,132
Here's your coffee.
I called you so many times.

118
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,890
Puff cheeks my ass.

119
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:38,846
What's so urgent?

120
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:42,579
They're going to have a casting
for "Bad Engineer The Series".

121
00:10:44,004 --> 00:10:46,869
"Bad Engineer", your first Boy Love novel.

122
00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:49,747
I know what my novel is called.

123
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:52,335
Why are you saying the name over and over?

124
00:10:53,096 --> 00:10:56,187
What does the casting have to do with me?

125
00:10:56,615 --> 00:11:00,075
At the editor's meeting,
they said they want you to join.

126
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:01,120
No.

127
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,708
What? You have to go.

128
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,976
Have the team deal with it,
what does it have to do with me?

129
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:14,658
I want you to go...

130
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:18,642
because if you do,
you can comment on stuff,

131
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:23,174
and you know the characters best
because you're the writer.

132
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,930
Hin, anybody can do the casting.

133
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:30,125
Even people who read the novel can do it.

134
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:32,923
All the novels now are all the same.

135
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:37,204
How can the reader
know more than the author?

136
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:40,159
You know better than anyone else.

137
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:48,787
It's just that Bua want you to go
in case the team needs more information,

138
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:50,828
you can give it to them.

139
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,660
Why are they making this harder
than it should be?

140
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:56,329
As you can see,
I'm busy with manuscript...

141
00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:58,438
and another thing is...

142
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,009
I don't want to write something
like the last novel.

143
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:04,423
It's feels so forced.

144
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,799
But didn't Bua push out the deadline?

145
00:12:09,284 --> 00:12:11,292
Just let the staff do it.

146
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,017
I already sold the rights.

147
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,729
So the rights belong to the person
who bought it.

148
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,603
Please just go, Gene.

149
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:19,431
Please.

150
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,654
Do you want something?

151
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,326
Nothing.

152
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:28,421
Really, nothing.
She really ordered me, just go.

153
00:12:29,612 --> 00:12:31,649
I'll send you the location.

154
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:36,465
You promised.

155
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,841
Do I have a choice?

156
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,142
You actually don't.

157
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,140
Fine. See you.

158
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,840
Oh, I almost forgot.

159
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:56,840
These are the profiles of people
who are casting, very important.

160
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,123
I'm really leaving now, bye.

161
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:10,597
=Lovely Writer=.

162
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,121
Hello, Bua.

163
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,446
Gene hasn't arrived yet.

164
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:23,714
You have to take pictures of Gene
in the casting room with the series team,

165
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:26,985
so I can use it to promote "Bad Engineer".

166
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:29,615
So people can come and buy our novels!

167
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:33,925
Okay, when Gene arrives,
I'll take only the best photos!

168
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:37,329
Perfect compositions
the type that you can use.

169
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,059
Okay! Over the top and I love it.

170
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:41,366
Just take the photos.

171
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:42,878
Look after Gene.

172
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,370
Tell him I'm not rushing the manuscript
but the quicker the better.

173
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,897
Okay, I'll take care of it.

174
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:51,755
Hello!

175
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,634
So good at giving orders!

176
00:14:54,714 --> 00:14:56,295
Like she's giving orders to a waiter!

177
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,666
Does she think it's so easy?

178
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:08,920
And what is it with Gene?

179
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,458
He won't pick answer my calls.

180
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:14,564
Where is he?

181
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:16,724
I'm right here.

182
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,522
I didn't say anything at all.
You didn't hear anything right?

183
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:27,634
So why are you wearing glasses today?

184
00:15:27,714 --> 00:15:31,270
Because you rushed me
so I had no time to put in contact lenses.

185
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,401
So it's my fault?

186
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:36,515
Or do you want me to leave?

187
00:15:36,595 --> 00:15:38,365
Wait!

188
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:42,980
You're already here
so let's not waste time.

189
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,909
Okay, let's go to the casting room!

190
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
Hello!!

Because this is the casting

194
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,997
So many people

00:16:21,077 --> 00:16:23,586
and they are all so hot!

196

00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:33,291
Hi!

200
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:34,402
Hello.

201
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,326
Too much!

202
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:37,685
Please go ahead!

203
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,470
Let's interview them.

204
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:43,899
Everyone, this is Kaownah-Turbo.

205
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:49,353
Casting for this series together
casting for the role of Kin.

206
00:16:49,433 --> 00:16:51,100
Casting for the role of Namcha.

207
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,343
What a sweet Namcha.

208
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:55,488
One hundred percent!

209
00:16:55,568 --> 00:16:58,316
How many percent do you think
you'll get to act together?

210
00:16:58,681 --> 00:17:00,720
Oh, they're starting
into each other's eyes!

211
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,877
I'm think it's 100 percent.

212
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:06,777
Let me ask you one question.

213
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,832
A ship couple or a real couple?

214
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,949
Ship couple or real couple.

215
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:19,941
There's so many handsome guys.

216
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:23,461
That's the ship couple Kaownah-Turbo!

217
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,172
They're very famous in Twitter.

218
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,942
There's always make the news
in every event they go to!

219
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:31,082
I'm so excited to finally meet them!

220
00:17:34,873 --> 00:17:36,859
Aren't you excited?

221
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,044
Your characters
are finally coming to life.

222
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:42,840
Do you think I should fee excited...

223
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,632
that nobody does this
for the novels I write.

224
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:50,219
Never mind.

225
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,117
Where are you going?

226
00:17:55,197 --> 00:17:56,339
You know the way?

227
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,316
-Just come quickly.
-This way!

228
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,161
Mai. Mai.

229
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,442
Hello.

230
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:24,426
Hi!

231
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:26,495
This is Gene, our author.

232
00:18:26,575 --> 00:18:28,201
He just finished some work around here,

233
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:30,280
so he decided to check out the casting.

234
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,369
Oh, my! Hello, Gene!

235
00:18:36,178 --> 00:18:41,776
I'm Mai, the director,
I'm so glad to meet you today...

236
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:43,857
but it's kind of weird.

237
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:46,956
At first, I thought you'd be a female,
like all the previous writers.

238
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:52,846
When someone said your name was Gene,
I didn't think it'd be a guy.

239
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:55,915
Okay, everyone should know each other.

240
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,180
Everyone, this is Gene the writer...

241
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,847
of our series "Bad Engineer The Series".

242
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,116
Hello.

243
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:03,265
This is our crew.

244
00:19:05,517 --> 00:19:06,481
Okay.

245
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:07,789
Give him two copies...

246
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,861
of the casting documents
of all the actors today.

247
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,831
Here.

248
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,038
Thank you.

249
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:17,537
This is all the information of
people who've had acting experiences...

250
00:19:17,617 --> 00:19:19,563
and some are newcomers.

251
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:24,578
Please help us see who is suitable
for what character.

252
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:26,760
Okay.

253
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,520
But you don't have to worry,
I'm just here to observe...

254
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,508
just like the publishing house
asked me to,

255
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,814
but the main decision making
is up to the director and crew.

256
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:41,555
Why didn't you say at the beginning?

257
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:44,377
That's so nice of you.

258
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:46,516
You should have told us
that you're easy to talk to,

259
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:49,232
not like the other writers
we've worked with.

260
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,988
But I'm not going to tell you
who I'm referring to.

261
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,189
Can I take a picture of you and Gene?

262
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:58,442
It would be my pleasure.

263
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,328
Okay. Gene, come and take the photo.

264
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,635
Come on.

265
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,581
But does Gene
want to take a photo with me.

266
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,680
Yes, he does.

267
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,222
Okay, here we go. One, two, three.

268
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,044
How about a mini heart?

269
00:20:13,124 --> 00:20:15,488
Okay, one, two, three.

270
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,150
Thank you so much.

271
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,364
Thank you.

272
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,126
Gene and Hin please take a seat.

273
00:20:21,206 --> 00:20:22,596
Let's sit together.

274
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:23,910
-Okay.
-Thank you.

275
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,026
(That was good work!)

276
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,126
(Have you read the plot I sent?)

277
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:49,207
(You've sent it?)

278
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,215
(Yes.)

279
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,695
(I'll take a look.)

280
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:02,209
Number 6, Boss.

281
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:03,424
Please come in.

282
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:10,009
Please introduce yourself.

283
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,218
Hi! My name is Boss.

284
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:15,278
I'm 26
and come from Chachoengsao province.

285
00:21:16,349 --> 00:21:18,931
If you're ready please start.

286
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,070
Action!

287
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:24,271
Can I read the script?

288
00:21:25,876 --> 00:21:28,138
He didn't even bother to prepare,
what a drag.

289
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,409
Sure, but don't look at it all the time.

290
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:31,470
Thank you.

291
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,077
Okay, are you ready?

292
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:35,345
Action!

293
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:37,467
Where did you go?

294
00:21:37,903 --> 00:21:40,700
This morning, why didn't you tell me
you were getting up?

295
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,780
Where did you go?
Why did you get up first this morning?

296
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,633
Okay, hold up.

297
00:21:45,713 --> 00:21:47,632
Are you excited?

298
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:48,731
A little bit.

299
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,674
Try playing as yourself.

300
00:21:50,754 --> 00:21:51,740
As my true self?

301
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,364
Yep.

302
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:55,348
Ready? Let's try.

303
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:01,653
Where did you go?

304
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:04,792
This morning, why didn't you tell me
you were getting up?

305
00:22:05,614 --> 00:22:07,695
That's what I thought! My homegirl.

306
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,851
Very nice.

307
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:15,015
Twerk it!

308
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:16,671
Give me more.

309
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,086
Hello, my name is View. I'm 24.

310
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:26,006
Can you take off your shirt?

311
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,188
My name is Boat and I'm 23 years old.

312
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,736
I acted in the series
called "Love Me Please".

313
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:46,525
I'm here to sell sugar canes.
I played the role of Pong.

314
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,785
That's great! You have acting experience.

315
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:50,510
Okay, please show me your acting skills.

316
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,511
Before I show you my acting skills,
can I sing a song for you?

317
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:56,470
I think we'll just see your acting skills.

318
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:59,113
Maybe try it as a musical?

319
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:06,330
This morning, why didn't you tell me
you were getting up?

320
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,239
Why didn't you tell me...

321
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,787
He's got some vocals.

322
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,269
I like it.

323
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:17,268
What time is it? I'm hungry.

324
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:19,701
Number 18, Nubsib please come in.

325
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:59,797
Wow, this is guy looks like a god.

326
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,214
So handsome!

327
00:24:01,522 --> 00:24:07,230
If this guy plays Kin,
I think I could just die.

328
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:14,352
I don't think the character fits him.

329
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,604
He looks too posh to be Kin.

330
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:22,966
You don't like him? That's a bummer.

331
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,840
Hello, I am Nubsib and I'm 20 years old.

332
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,542
I'm studying
International Business Management.

333
00:24:28,917 --> 00:24:32,356
This is the second round
of casting for you, right?

334
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:34,818
From the script we gave you the other day,
I hope you prepared.

335
00:24:34,898 --> 00:24:35,742
Yes.

336
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:39,859
Okay, so if you're ready, please act.

337
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,905
Mai.

338
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,694
Can I go to the bathroom for a sec?

339
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,682
Sure, it's that way.

340
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,152
Where are you going?

341
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:33,050
This morning, why didn't you tell me
you were getting up?

342
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,475
You can't escape me...

343
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,472
because the mark I left on you...

344
00:25:43,854 --> 00:25:48,928
is a reminder that you are mine.

345
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,890
You know how much I miss you.

346
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:06,707
Come here and get back to the room!

347
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:10,391
Wait.

348
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:14,366
I think this is...

349
00:26:14,446 --> 00:26:16,628
Wonderful!

350
00:26:20,852 --> 00:26:23,684
I love Nubsib's acting!

351
00:26:23,764 --> 00:26:25,722
You're acting is just so wonderful.

352
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:29,961
That strong and harsh attitude
really got me, right, coach?

353
00:26:30,063 --> 00:26:32,908
-Yes.
-You are going to be so famous!

354
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:36,151
Stay for a while
and then we'll talk later.

355
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:37,771
Just for a little while.

356
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,416
So sorry for that.

357
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,070
Did I startle you?

358
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,891
What?

359
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:57,116
Thank you for letting me use you
as an acting partner.

360
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:12,389
He's good, write it down.

361
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,290
This one is a no for me.

362
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,299
I agree.

363
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:18,768
What do you guys think?

364
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:22,480
I think Saimhok
can play the role of Tawan.

365
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,420
I think he's very good looking.

366
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,938
His height is good and so is his acting.

367
00:27:28,018 --> 00:27:30,339
I agree
and I think he'll be a great addition.

368
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,320
Yes.

369
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,507
How about Boss? He's okay.

370
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,540
His look is good.

371
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:40,168
Okay as in not okay!

372
00:27:40,248 --> 00:27:44,378
That's my homegirl I could be
looking from Pluto and tell what's up.

373
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:46,616
Why can't he be?

374
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:49,548
We're already making a Boy Love series
so he's perfect.

375
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,095
I think it's really progressive.

376
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,299
It's progressive but I can't sell it!

377
00:27:54,821 --> 00:27:57,891
Why? I think he's handsome.

378
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,303
I think Aey is a better fit.

379
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:02,957
Cute, right?

380
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:04,546
I think Aey is a great choice.

381
00:28:04,626 --> 00:28:09,232
Acting is on point,
good looking and he's not too feminine.

382
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,111
He's perfect for the role of Namcha.

383
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,830
But he's really feminine.

384
00:28:13,114 --> 00:28:16,485
But it's just the level
that's perfect for the role.

385
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:21,315
Do think that Aey's character
is suitable for our series' lead.

386
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:24,612
But he's also gay?

387
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,254
Why aren't you guys
saying anything about it?

388
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:32,198
Let's just say we're promoting LGBTQ
and he's in the right level.

389
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,375
Choosing him
while being able to promote LGBTQ.

390
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:38,209
We're making money
while being progressive.

391
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:41,047
Wait, so what are the standards?

392
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,870
In this industry,

393
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,988
just being good looking
or being talented is not enough.

394
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:50,836
That's right, we've been working
in this industry for a long time.

395
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:54,496
If you cast badly, there will be drama!

396
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:55,801
That's right.

397
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:59,376
And Nubsib will be Kin.

398
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:00,670
Does anyone disagree?

399
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,106
Nope! Perfect fit.

400
00:29:04,186 --> 00:29:06,239
The person who disagrees can fight me.

401
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,252
He's perfect for the role!

402
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:10,145
He's hot with a god-like aura
and good acting skills!

403
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:13,420
Boy Love fans will not know what hit them!

404
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,819
What does the Producer think?

405
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:17,013
Good for the role and great acting.

406
00:29:17,093 --> 00:29:19,436
But is he...?

407
00:29:19,516 --> 00:29:20,899
He is what?

408
00:29:20,979 --> 00:29:22,126
Gay?

409
00:29:22,206 --> 00:29:24,640
What are you saying? Is it true?

410
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,983
Well, when we was reading
the lines with Gene,

411
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,426
his eyes were just so...

412
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,184
I was shipping them so hard!

413
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:34,621
Right?

414
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:37,249
I think it's getting personal.

415
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:39,044
I think we have to ask Gene.

416
00:29:39,124 --> 00:29:40,561
Did you feel anything?

417
00:29:49,891 --> 00:29:54,952
I think that...

418
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,897
I think it's because...

419
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,868
he was great at acting?

420
00:30:08,948 --> 00:30:12,310
You're sticking your nose everywhere!

421
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,860
What's your business if he's gay or not?

422
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,259
All that matters is his acting.

423
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:18,870
So nobody disagrees?

424
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:24,074
Does Gene and Hin
have to go any where after this?

425
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:26,863
If not,
we'd like you to stay and talk with us.

426
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:29,179
I have to go home
and work on my manuscript.

427
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,855
Oh, okay.

428
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:36,068
But we'll have another meeting
in two weeks.

429
00:30:36,148 --> 00:30:39,136
If you guys are free, please join us.

430
00:30:39,216 --> 00:30:40,648
Join us.

431
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:44,119
I'm free and Gene is also free.

432
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:48,706
That's perfect! Thank you so much.

433
00:30:53,222 --> 00:30:56,162
Okay, thank you.

434
00:30:56,812 --> 00:30:59,012
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go now.

435
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,775
Thank you so much for joining us today.

436
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's go.

437
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,594
Your condo or suburb house?

438
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:13,110
Condo, how will I make it to the suburbs
in this kind of traffic, it's far too.

439
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,159
I need to take a number 2 in the toilet.

440
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,993
Fine, see you in front.

441
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,439
Are you guys tired?

442
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,083
Let's call to check the que.

443
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,354
Sorry.

444
00:32:06,128 --> 00:32:07,167
Here.

445
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,143
Thanks.

446
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,396
I really want to thank you again.

447
00:32:18,124 --> 00:32:22,174
I just found out that
you're the writer of "Bad Engineer".

448
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,597
Really?

449
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,502
Yes, I just spoke to the director.

450
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,696
From now on, I'm going to need your help.

451
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:40,776
Don't over-think it.

452
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,095
You should say that to the crew.

453
00:32:43,651 --> 00:32:48,472
I'm just the writer, I won't be close by.

454
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:51,317
I don't think you'll be a bother.

455
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,703
My butt is all wet, it itches!

456
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:00,281
Nubsib!

457
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:01,591
Yes.

458
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:03,390
Are you done talking to the director?

459
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,275
Not yet, he's in an urgent call
so I came to the toilet.

460
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:11,746
I'm Hin, Gene's assistant.

461
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,655
I think from now on,
we'll so more of each other.

462
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:16,365
Okay.

463
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:17,574
Hin!

464
00:33:17,654 --> 00:33:18,670
Let's go!

465
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,264
We're leaving already? I just got here.

466
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:22,293
Good bye.

467
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:23,605
Wait!

468
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,338
See you later.

469
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:30,256
Why are we in a rush to go?
I haven't finished talking to him yet!

470
00:34:17,632 --> 00:34:18,618
Whatever.

471
00:34:18,698 --> 00:34:21,936
Don't forget about
the series meeting tomorrow.

472
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,115
I sent you the location.

473
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:25,419
You have to go, don't forget.

474
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:29,331
Okay, I know.

475
00:34:56,868 --> 00:34:58,690
The mark I left on you...

476
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:04,573
is what reminds that you're mine.

477
00:35:05,117 --> 00:35:09,125
You know just how much I missed you.

478
00:35:17,438 --> 00:35:22,118
(Love Actor)

479
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,670
I'm sorry for what just happened.

480
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,406
Did I startle you?

481
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,161
What?

482
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:36,529
Thank you for playing the part with me.

483
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:06,745
(Love Actor Count One.)

484
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,464
Gene, we're going to be late.

485
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,958
Why did you drag me out here?

486
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:30,626
I went to bed in the morning.

487
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:33,665
We already told them we were coming.

488
00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:37,208
And why are they having a meeting today?

489
00:36:37,288 --> 00:36:40,385
There are going to do the shooting
run down and the actors.

490
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,627
Who will be playing with what part?

491
00:36:43,307 --> 00:36:46,208
You know more than me!

492
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:50,982
Why don't you tell them that you're
the writer then come and tell me.

493
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:55,022
It's your novel.
You can't not go and listen.

494
00:36:55,102 --> 00:36:58,430
You're the writer
so how can you not have the spirit?

495
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,991
Hin!

496
00:37:00,778 --> 00:37:02,088
I'm not going.

497
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,955
You can't do that and do you know why?

498
00:37:07,035 --> 00:37:10,173
Because if we go together we can go far.

499
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:12,051
Believe me!

500
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:17,900
Come on, let's go.

501
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:21,650
If you received the script,
please write your name on it.

502
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:22,809
Okay.

503
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,391
I'm here.

504
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,380
-Hi.
-Hello!

505
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,455
Please have a seat. Sit sit.

506
00:37:28,535 --> 00:37:30,388
Give him the script.

507
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,031
Okay, we're all ready.

508
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:41,317
Hello! Let me introduce myself.

509
00:37:41,397 --> 00:37:43,886
Mai is the director of this series.

510
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:45,228
As for this person...

511
00:37:45,308 --> 00:37:52,263
This is Gene the writer,
his pen-name is Wizard...

512
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,338
The writer of "Bad Engineer"
that we're making into a series...

513
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:58,801
and these are the actors.

514
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:00,783
Let's start from this handsome guy.

515
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:06,252
Nubsib in the role as Kin
and Aey as Namcha,

516
00:38:06,332 --> 00:38:07,878
and what's your name?

517
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:09,140
Mhok.

518
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,411
Mhok as Tawan.

519
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,115
Next.

520
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:18,284
This is Fah, the producer of this series.

521
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:24,046
I'm going to go over today's time-line.

522
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:29,298
We will start shooting
on the 24th of September...

523
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:36,068
and there might be workshops
before we start shooting.

524
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,675
So please send us the actor's schedules...

525
00:38:38,755 --> 00:38:41,090
as for the blessing ceremony
and launch will later be announced.

526
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,370
What are you drawing?

527
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:43,780
You.

528
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,815
Really? Can I see.

529
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:46,919
Just a little bit.

530
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:47,990
Hin, let go.

531
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,957
Just a bit.

532
00:38:50,376 --> 00:38:51,705
Let go.

533
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,522
Just a little peek.

534
00:38:53,602 --> 00:38:54,964
No!

535
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:10,420
And more do more promotes in events.

536
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,916
Oh, and another thing.

537
00:39:19,298 --> 00:39:23,711
Gene. Gene. Gene.

538
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:31,238
Due to our series being
not too different from your novel,

539
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,946
I'd like to ask you to overlook
the characters for the actors.

540
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:38,475
You're the writer,

541
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:43,028
so nobody should know more than you.

542
00:39:43,108 --> 00:39:46,062
If you can consult the actors,

543
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:50,278
I think the ratings will be so good
because the actors will be off the charts!

544
00:39:52,312 --> 00:39:53,608
Okay.

545
00:39:53,688 --> 00:39:59,104
Let's start our first read,
now turn to the first page.

546
00:39:59,184 --> 00:40:02,875
Is there anything I can get you?

547
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,168
It's alright, thank you so much.

548
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:08,162
Do you want to take this for Gene too?

549
00:40:09,386 --> 00:40:11,064
Okay.

550
00:40:11,144 --> 00:40:12,912
Thank you.

551
00:40:12,992 --> 00:40:14,379
Hin!

552
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,209
Did you want anything to drink?

553
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,784
It's okay, thank you.

554
00:40:19,864 --> 00:40:21,388
Please excuse me and Hin.

555
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:22,413
Sure.

556
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:23,920
Come here!

557
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:26,867
I not done putting it all away!

558
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,906
My arms are going to fall off!

559
00:40:33,986 --> 00:40:35,135
Let it fall off!

560
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,455
I was looking for you
and you're here freeloading!

561
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:41,406
Just saying I'm here with you.

562
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:43,740
People are already giving me free stuff!

563
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,352
Are you in a mood again?

564
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:49,487
I'm in a mood because of you!

565
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,539
But they are being so generous...

566
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:56,331
putting on national television
and also taking your opinions too!

567
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,545
It's a very rare chance!

568
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,927
I know!

569
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:03,134
But you should know that I hate chaos.

570
00:41:03,214 --> 00:41:06,935
And if the series succeeds,
your pen-name will also become famous.

571
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:11,264
More people will know you,
your compensation will go up!

572
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:14,824
So you're going to make me write
only Boy Love novels?

573
00:41:14,904 --> 00:41:18,474
I almost forgot that
you wrote fantasy horror novels.

574
00:41:18,554 --> 00:41:19,819
Shut up.

575
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,860
But you're getting so much attention
from writing BL,

576
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:28,357
so you should accept the fact
that you're talented at...

577
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:31,098
Nubsib.

578
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,701
Hello!

579
00:41:36,717 --> 00:41:39,864
I have some questions
about the character of Kin.

580
00:41:39,944 --> 00:41:43,519
I don't understand some parts
so I want to ask you.

581
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:46,939
Which part?

582
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,261
I'm going to go to the toilet.

583
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,392
Not right now.

584
00:41:56,472 --> 00:42:00,167
But can I have your contact number?

585
00:42:00,262 --> 00:42:03,809
Sure, no problem! So...

586
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,028
Sib!

587
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:11,709
I was looking around for you forever.

588
00:42:11,789 --> 00:42:14,825
I was going to ask
if you're going back to the university.

589
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:16,161
Yeah.

590
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,883
Can I go with you?
I'm also going back to university.

591
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,750
Aren't you going home yet?

592
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:28,230
Mai just said you already went home,
I wanted to talk to you.

593
00:42:29,484 --> 00:42:32,490
I read your novel "The Watcher".

594
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:33,964
It was so fun!

595
00:42:34,044 --> 00:42:36,868
I'm going to go now.

596
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:40,213
Are you going to go home now?

597
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:43,074
Yes, I'm leaving soon.

598
00:42:43,154 --> 00:42:45,912
Are you two friends?

599
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:48,348
Yes! We're in the same friend group.

600
00:42:48,428 --> 00:42:50,159
So you came to cast together?

601
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,192
Oh, it wasn't like that.

602
00:42:53,272 --> 00:42:56,671
I overheard Nubsib talking to his manager
about the casting,

603
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,210
so I came to castings too.

604
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,387
It's my first series
and I'm playing with Nubsib,

605
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:04,370
so I'm very excited.

606
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,109
I think it's great that you're friends
and you're playing together.

607
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:09,773
Less pressure.

608
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,940
I'm worried I might be too shy!

609
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,144
Being shy with your friend
is better with a stranger.

610
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,336
You'll have to excuse me.

611
00:43:27,544 --> 00:43:29,615
Thank you, Gene.

612
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,403
Please stamp my parking ticket.

613
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:38,035
There's going to be workshops too,
we're not going to make it.

614
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:41,375
Are we directly going to the uni?

615
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:18,636
It's so hot.

616
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:20,475
Are you hot?

617
00:44:24,506 --> 00:44:29,404
I see on Twitter that a lot of people
are talking about our couple.

618
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,082
Have you seen it?

619
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:34,698
A lot of people are talking about us.

620
00:44:40,455 --> 00:44:41,695
Let's take a picture together.

621
00:44:47,924 --> 00:44:49,724
Let's focus on the ceremony.

622
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:15,662
Hello.

623
00:45:15,742 --> 00:45:16,765
Are you there yet?

624
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:20,034
I'm here but they are still praying.

625
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:22,041
Okay, I think I'll go in
when they finish praying.

626
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:23,156
Okay.

627
00:45:23,236 --> 00:45:25,108
Find somewhere to sit and wait.

628
00:45:25,188 --> 00:45:27,615
Okay, I'll find a seat and wait.

629
00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:31,873
To bad I couldn't make it today,
the editor is making me work today.

630
00:45:31,953 --> 00:45:33,174
I'm so bummed out.

631
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:35,657
Why did you want to go there today?

632
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:41,471
I just want to go out
and see what's happening.

633
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,387
I'm so bummed!

634
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,080
Take pictures of Nubsib for me!

635
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,587
Dream on.

636
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,105
Bye.

637
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,260
"Bad Engineer The Series"
will be so famous!

638
00:46:20,529 --> 00:46:22,733
What? Today?

639
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:28,797
I'm here to watch over Nubsib,
he's not done yet.

640
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:30,764
One cappuccino, please.

641
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:34,794
Okay, talk to you later.

642
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:50,939
Gene!

643
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,830
Gene, it's really Gene!

644
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,930
Hey, It's me, Tum.

645
00:47:03,216 --> 00:47:04,228
Tum?

646
00:47:05,888 --> 00:47:07,268
Don't say that you forgot about me.

647
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:10,873
It's not even 10 years since we graduated,
don't act all old.

648
00:47:13,214 --> 00:47:14,309
Tum?

649
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,074
You're Tum!

650
00:47:19,154 --> 00:47:20,415
Yeah, that's me.

651
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:23,100
How are you?

652
00:47:24,046 --> 00:47:27,900
You've gotten handsome
and even cuter than before!

653
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,922
Too much.

654
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:31,703
I don't really leave my room.

655
00:47:31,783 --> 00:47:32,790
You don't leave your room?

656
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,129
Don't tell me
you're living on you're parent's money.

657
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:39,849
I don't leave my room
because I have to work!

658
00:47:40,301 --> 00:47:42,397
Work? Wait.

659
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:45,614
When they say Gene the writer
of 'Engineer The Series'?

660
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:47,129
Don't tell me...

661
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:50,907
What?

662
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,483
My boy is always talking about 'Gene'

663
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,140
I didn't think that it'd be Gene,
my friend.

664
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,130
Such a small world!

665
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,099
Wait... Your boy?

666
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:04,787
The one who cast for your series!

667
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:05,847
He got a part.

668
00:48:12,867 --> 00:48:16,930
Don't tell me that your boy is...

669
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,505
Aey?

670
00:48:18,585 --> 00:48:21,179
No! Aey is under Tiffy's care!

671
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:24,655
I think you already met him, Nubsib!

672
00:48:26,376 --> 00:48:28,887
-Nubsib!
-Why are you shouting?

673
00:48:32,848 --> 00:48:36,694
You're looking after Nubsib?

674
00:48:36,796 --> 00:48:40,414
Wait!
Where is your imagination taking you?

675
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:42,192
I'm an artist manager.

676
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,962
You could've just said that at first!

677
00:48:47,042 --> 00:48:50,220
Anybody would think what I was thinking.

678
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,756
Why did you become a manager?

679
00:48:52,836 --> 00:48:54,700
I didn't want to at first,

680
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:58,965
but my sis asked me to do this
and that so I quit my job to do this.

681
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:01,706
That's good, helping out at home.

682
00:49:02,222 --> 00:49:04,551
He also seems like a good boy
who listens to you.

683
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,911
Listens to me? That boy?

684
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,674
Faking an image is really scary.

685
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:15,997
But what about you, I read the script.

686
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:18,990
It's really steamy!

687
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,943
I didn't know you wrote stuff like this.

688
00:49:21,327 --> 00:49:24,343
Why did you read it?

689
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:27,829
I'm his manager so it's normal
that I want to read the script.

690
00:49:27,909 --> 00:49:30,396
What do you think of him?
Can he act the part?

691
00:49:36,154 --> 00:49:37,376
Tum.

692
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,292
Oh, Sib.

693
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:40,872
Are they done with the ceremony?

694
00:49:40,952 --> 00:49:42,154
Yes.

695
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:48,253
Oh, Gene.

696
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:50,725
What time did you arrive?

697
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,135
For quite some time.
I just met an old friend.

698
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,998
Friend?

699
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,258
Gene, he's my university friend.

700
00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:07,189
Such a small world!

701
00:50:17,234 --> 00:50:19,460
You look very cute today, Gene.

702
00:50:31,291 --> 00:50:36,218
Let's go to the ceremony
so nobody has to call us.

703
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:12,529
Aren't you going to take pictures?

704
00:51:13,016 --> 00:51:15,961
No way, is it really that big a deal?

705
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,379
When the series airs,
it's going to be even bigger.

706
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:25,059
I'm going to the toilet.

707
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:26,156
Okay.

708
00:52:07,696 --> 00:52:08,834
You okay?

709
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:12,257
If you weren't here,
I probably would have banged my head.

710
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,757
It's okay, but you're clumsy.

711
00:52:18,004 --> 00:52:21,228
That shot right not was so Korean.

712
00:52:22,252 --> 00:52:23,711
You fell into my arms.

713
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:26,830
You're here with your boyfriend?

714
00:52:27,215 --> 00:52:30,534
Always stuck together!

715
00:52:30,636 --> 00:52:34,667
That's Gene the writer of "Bad Engineer".

716
00:52:34,747 --> 00:52:36,174
He's an old friend.

717
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:37,661
Yeah right.

718
00:52:38,093 --> 00:52:39,111
Anyway, thanks!

719
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:41,574
If I fell on my face,
it would have been so embarrassing.

720
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,694
Cute.

721
00:52:58,058 --> 00:52:59,165
Yeah.

722
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,503
(Thank you for choosing Aey as Namcha.)

723
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:33,933
(Please support the series!)

724
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:50,286
(I miss you, Aey.
Call me if you want to talk.)

725
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,854
(Thank you for always looking after me,
I'm going to do my best.)

726
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,364
See you.

727
00:55:42,444 --> 00:55:43,845
When are you going home?

728
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:45,925
After Sib gives his interview,
we'll be going home.

729
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,332
Okay, see you.

730
00:55:49,201 --> 00:55:50,488
Get home safely.

731
00:56:04,952 --> 00:56:07,211
Are you done with the interview?

732
00:56:09,841 --> 00:56:11,235
Who are you looking for?

733
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,460
No one.

734
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,218
I won't be driving you home today.

735
00:56:20,298 --> 00:56:22,815
Tam said I have to go watch Boy
at the photo-shoot.

736
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:24,189
Can you go home yourself?

737
00:56:25,745 --> 00:56:26,856
Okay.

738
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,183
Hey, Aey and Tiffy.

739
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,144
Are you going home?

740
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:36,247
I'm dropping Nubsib off at his car.
I'm not driving him home.

741
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:37,496
It's total separate ways.

742
00:56:37,576 --> 00:56:40,958
Can I go with you?

743
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:45,685
My home is
in the same direction you're going.

744
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:48,904
Sure.

745
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:50,251
That's great.

746
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:52,280
Tiffy, you don't have to take me home.

747
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,607
It's a lot cheaper
if I go home with Nubsib.

748
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:58,830
That's good! You guys should become
closer because you have to work together.

749
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,943
That's great.

750
00:57:01,023 --> 00:57:02,646
Get home safely.

751
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:04,513
Should we go?

752
00:57:12,142 --> 00:57:14,038
How are you going home?

753
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,180
I thought
you were going to go with Gene...

754
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,091
'cause I see you're always together
during the ceremony.

755
00:57:19,171 --> 00:57:21,285
I know what you're thinking.

756
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,062
I told you that we're friends.

757
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:26,183
I'm going to go to another event
and leave the car here.

758
00:57:26,263 --> 00:57:28,385
-I already called for a bike.
-Sure, lover boy.

759
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:30,438
You're just running your mouth.

760
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:32,044
How are you going?

761
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:33,207
Driving.

762
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:36,780
Do you want to go with me?
I'll drop you off.

763
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:39,762
I'm in a hurry,
I already called for a motorbike.

764
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,680
And you know what I drive?

765
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:04,445
That so freaking cool!

766
00:58:06,664 --> 00:58:08,548
Climb on my bike baby girl.

767
00:58:08,628 --> 00:58:09,861
Should I?

768
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,647
It's okay.

769
00:58:14,727 --> 00:58:16,538
My motorbike is almost here.

770
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,373
I don't want to burden you.

771
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:21,433
Fine, up to you.

772
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:22,773
Bye.

773
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:42,466
So cool.

774
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:36,589
Love Actor.

775
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,885
I like this plot, it's really new...

776
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:43,288
and it's not surrounded
by a university campus.

777
00:59:43,378 --> 00:59:50,155
The lead meets his partner onset,
a lead actor in a series.

778
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,449
I love it.

779
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:57,470
But do you think telling the story
of the boy love industry is too deep?

780
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:03,321
I don't want to change it anymore.
I think it's a very interesting topic.

781
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:07,009
Okay, I'm going to leave it up to you...

782
01:00:07,089 --> 01:00:13,497
but write a manuscript for me to read
and don't forget my steamy NC scenes!

783
01:00:13,577 --> 01:00:16,332
Hot and steamy like I requested!

784
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,614
I expect them to leave me screaming!

785
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,108
It's that...

786
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:24,238
It's just that...

787
01:00:24,858 --> 01:00:26,703
I don't want to write it.

788
01:00:26,783 --> 01:00:29,753
People will say that Boy love
is just feeding off these kinds of scenes,

789
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,567
and many people are talking about it.

790
01:00:32,648 --> 01:00:39,603
More importantly,
I'm not very good at writing those scenes.

791
01:00:44,622 --> 01:00:47,340
I'll send you some movie links.

792
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,395
I have so many in stock!

793
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:53,173
It's perfect for someone
with no experience like you.

794
01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:55,268
Oops! I'm not shaming you.

795
01:00:55,348 --> 01:00:56,679
That's enough.

796
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:01,064
Just think of it as a learning material.

797
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:03,750
Something along of an Education Center.

798
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,497
Everybody watches it.

799
01:01:05,577 --> 01:01:06,618
Those kinds of films.

800
01:01:06,698 --> 01:01:08,577
Bua, you have to go to a meeting.

801
01:01:08,657 --> 01:01:09,721
Really?

802
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:15,821
Oh, I have a meeting.
I'm going to go now and update me!

803
01:01:15,901 --> 01:01:17,689
Okay, I'm going to go home now.

804
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:20,242
Okay, please see Gene leave.

805
01:01:20,816 --> 01:01:21,786
Bye!

806
01:01:37,115 --> 01:01:38,165
Hello.

807
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,059
Hi, Gene.

808
01:01:41,116 --> 01:01:42,201
Tum!

809
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:43,985
Why are you calling me?

810
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:47,035
Where are you? I have something urgent.

811
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:48,244
Can you come to see me?

812
01:01:48,324 --> 01:01:49,657
What's so urgent?

813
01:01:50,439 --> 01:01:52,911
Can I see you at your condominium?

814
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:55,171
My condominium?

815
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:57,617
Yeah, we'll talk about it
when I get there.

816
01:01:57,697 --> 01:02:00,250
Send me the location and I'll go now.

817
01:02:01,323 --> 01:02:03,351
Sure.

818
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,208
I'm still outside...

819
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,520
so if you get there first,
just wait in the lobby.

820
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,451
I'll go now.

821
01:02:08,531 --> 01:02:10,384
Thank you, see you.

822
01:02:26,067 --> 01:02:27,587
Gene!

823
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,723
What's so urgent?

824
01:02:36,803 --> 01:02:38,537
Why do we have to talk at my condominium?

825
01:02:38,617 --> 01:02:40,925
We can't talk here,
can we talk in your room?

826
01:02:41,831 --> 01:02:43,406
Let's go, Sib.

827
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:47,998
Hello, Gene.

828
01:02:51,604 --> 01:02:55,600
Am I bothering you?
I'm sorry to put you in this position.

829
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:15,834
Wait on the sofa.

830
01:03:15,914 --> 01:03:17,175
Let me collect my stuff.

831
01:03:31,143 --> 01:03:32,254
Can I help?

832
01:03:33,046 --> 01:03:34,826
It's okay.

833
01:03:48,764 --> 01:03:49,843
Thanks.

834
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,213
What's so urgent?

835
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:29,426
Your condo has three bedrooms, right?

836
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:34,450
Yeah, why?

837
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,098
And you're living alone...

838
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,678
Can Nubsib...

839
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,738
Nubsib...

840
01:05:05,075 --> 01:05:07,020
Let Nubsib...

841
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:11,500
You look really cute today.

842
01:05:11,581 --> 01:05:15,166
I'm so sorry, did I startle you?

843
01:05:17,222 --> 01:05:18,981
Thank you for acting with me.

844
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:20,949
From now on, I might disturb you.

845
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:23,081
Where are you trying to escape?
You can't escape me.

846
01:05:23,161 --> 01:05:25,137
You're mine!

847
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:29,202
No!

848
01:05:55,524 --> 01:05:57,158
Don't you guys have other options?

849
01:05:57,238 --> 01:05:59,011
I'm at my wits end.

850
01:05:59,091 --> 01:06:00,441
Please? Only one month.

851
01:06:01,755 --> 01:06:03,089
One month is fine.

852
01:06:03,911 --> 01:06:07,020
Gene, do you want toast in the morning?

853
01:06:08,134 --> 01:06:09,421
What are you doing?

854
01:06:09,501 --> 01:06:11,154
You forgot to buckle in your seat-belt.

855
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:13,240
So I wanted to help.

856
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:16,194
Don't you like it?
I think I have a great body.

857
01:06:16,296 --> 01:06:17,147
Sib!

858
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:19,283
Can you help me practice my lines?

859
01:06:19,363 --> 01:06:20,637
Huh?
