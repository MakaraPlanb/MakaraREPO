1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,480
Type!

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,760
Don't run.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,800
I was afraid I wouldn't catch you.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,080
Are you really quitting?

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,840
I thought I made myself clear.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,120
I've got a boyfriend.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,960
And I'm not interested in you.

8
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,000
But I like you.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
Go like someone else.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't want any problems
with my boyfriend.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,280
Besides, I've already quit.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,200
We've got no reason to meet again.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,160
I hope your knee recovers soon.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,800
Fiat!

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
Are you okay?

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,880
Let me take a look.

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,280
Does it hurt?

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,920
Why can't it be me?

19
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,400
I've got no one left.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,880
I've really got no one left.

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,840
What the hell are you doing?

22
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,960
I--

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Type, you bastard!

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,200
Tharn.

25
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
What the hell are you doing?

26
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
I--

27
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Type, you bastard!

28
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,520
Tharn.

29
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
How come you're here?

30
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,080
You said you'd be back tomorrow.

31
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,720
I wanted to surprise you.

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,440
But I didn't think I'd be
the one getting the surprise.

33
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,760
If I hadn't hurried back,

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,080
I wouldn't have seen
what you were doing behind my back.

35
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,680
I didn't do anything.

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,560
Didn't do anything?

37
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,800
I saw you kissing him!

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,080
Don't tell me you've been doing something
like this the whole time I was away!

39
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Don't you trust me at all?

40
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,560
How can I trust you?

41
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,560
Look what you've done!

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
I thought you were sick!

43
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,920
I thought you needed me!

44
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,320
I rushed through my work,
barely slept, so I could come back to you!

45
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,680
Just to see you cheating on me!

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,840
If it was you,

47
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,200
how would you feel, Type?

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,120
Tharn!

49
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
I told you, I didn't do anything!

50
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,840
Type.

51
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,880
Calm down. What's going on here?

52
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,320
Calm down, we're at a hospital.

53
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,880
We just cleared up an incident.

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't create another one.

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Tharn,

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm begging you.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please, settle this at home.

58
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,320
Type can't be seen
getting into a fight here.

59
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,480
Type.

60
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll go check on him.

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,400
Listen to me.

62
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,040
I am Type's boyfriend.

63
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,920
I don't know
what your relationship with him is.

64
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
But I'm warning you.

65
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
Leave him alone.

66
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,160
What if I refuse?

67
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,760
You probably don't know
what I would do when I get angry.

68
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
Just because you're still young…

69
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
doesn't mean
I'll let you off the hook easily.

70
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I'll kill you.

71
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
Damn it!

72
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
Calm down, Type.

73
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,680
So, what's actually going on?

74
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
I don't know what happened.

75
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,120
But I think that kid
is probably the cause.

76
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,360
But whatever happened,

77
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,760
you've gotta calm down and get a grip,
got it?

78
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,360
What good will that do?

79
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,480
He doesn't trust me.

80
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,040
He thinks I'm cheating on him.

81
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
He thinks I kissed that kid.

82
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,320
He should know better than anyone
that I'd never do that.

83
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,040
But why doesn't he believe me?

84
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,320
Why does he think I'd do
anything like that behind his back?

85
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm angry he doesn't trust me.

86
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
I missed him like crazy!

87
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
I missed him to death.

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,320
I wished every day
that he'd come back to me.

89
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,720
I've been with him for seven years!

90
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,800
For seven years, I've never
had eyes for anyone else but him!

91
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,000
Damn it!

92
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,480
If I'd really wanted to cheat on him,
I wouldn't have waited for seven years.

93
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,240
Then, you must tell him.

94
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Now?

95
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,960
He won't listen.

96
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,120
But you guys need to talk, right?

97
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah.

98
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,640
But not now,
while I still feel like killing him.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Calm down.

100
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,680
Calm down.

101
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,920
We need to talk.

102
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,560
Not now.

103
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,040
But I want to talk now.

104
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,640
I didn't kiss him.

105
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,440
Then, what was it that I saw?

106
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,960
He pulled me in to kiss me.

107
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
The Type I know…

108
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,360
isn't an idiot
who'd let someone kiss him easily.

109
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
You think I kissed him willingly?

110
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,240
Just like when you were willing
to fool around with him.

111
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,680
The hell are you talking about?

112
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,360
This.

113
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
You got drunk with him.

114
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,560
Tharn.

115
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
Do I have to ask about this too?

116
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
While I was away…

117
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,720
what did you with him in our home?

118
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,520
I'm guessing you weren't playing soccer.

119
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,520
I didn't…

120
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
I get it right?

121
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,200
-You think I slept with him?
-Yeah.

122
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
I love you so much, Type.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,560
But I don't want to picture you
sleeping with another lover.

124
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
Listen to me, Tharn.

125
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,200
I didn't do a damn thing.

126
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,960
How can I believe you, Type?

127
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,720
I saw you kissing him.

128
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I have a photo of you drinking with him.

129
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
And his pen was lying in our room!

130
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,080
You expect me to believe you?

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
What?

132
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,920
So, you're breaking up with me?

133
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,960
We should take a break.

134
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,640
Techno.

135
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,680
When are you going home?

136
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,480
I've just arrived, dude.
You're already kicking me out?

137
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
Champ, here's the thing.

138
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,640
I just got off work, and at this time,
all the other restaurants are closed.

139
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,600
-Mine's closed too.
-No, you can't.

140
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Dude, your friend's starving, okay?

141
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Fine, I'll let you eat here.

142
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,040
-Yes!
-But!

143
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,200
After you eat,
you have to help me close up.

144
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,960
No way! Closing up's not my job!

145
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,280
-You're just gonna eat?
-Yeah.

146
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,440
Why don't you call Doc
and ask him to help you?

147
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
-Doc?
-Yeah.

148
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,240
What's it got to do with him?

149
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,760
Dumbass, absolutely freaking clueless.

150
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Champ, I'll be staying the night here.

151
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,400
What's wrong with him?

152
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,600
-What's gotten into him?
-How would I know?

153
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,440
What's gotten into you?

154
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,040
One wants to eat.

155
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
-The other wants to sleep.
-Yes.

156
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,560
-Is this a restaurant or a hotel?
-Hotel.

157
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,840
Go ahead, sir. Go ahead.

158
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,760
That should show him who owns this place.

159
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,480
{\an8}NUMBER FIVE

160
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,760
In summary, that Fiat kid kissed you.

161
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,040
And Tharn happened to see you two
smooching and canoodling.

162
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,960
So all hell broke loose, right?

163
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,640
Yeah.

164
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I knew it.

165
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,640
So,

166
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,480
you two are really gonna break up, huh?

167
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,120
I never said that.

168
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
I just wanna take a break
to collect my thoughts.

169
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,920
-"Let's take a break."
-I'm going to break your face.

170
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,240
Dick.

171
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,160
Type.

172
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,160
Tharn thinks you wanna break up with him.

173
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,240
I never said that.

174
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,720
But you ran away, just like that.

175
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,960
It's like you wanna break up.

176
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,360
I don't know what to say.

177
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,280
But Tharn's become an emotional wreck.

178
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,960
I think he's really hurt.

179
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,000
I should feel hurt too,
hearing him accuse me of having a lover.

180
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,720
Type, you shouted at my face.

181
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
Yeah, sorry.

182
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,640
What are you gonna do?

183
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,280
You'd better think carefully.

184
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,200
You and Tharn have been together
for so long now.

185
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,600
You can't just give up
because of this Fiat kid.

186
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
You've got to teach him a lesson, got it?

187
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,520
I vaguely remember
Doc telling me about that kid.

188
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,440
What did he say?

189
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,960
The kid likes you, right?

190
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,880
Doc said there was someone else
who liked that kid too.

191
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,920
If we make them fall for each other…

192
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,800
the problem's solved, right?

193
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,920
Genius! Damn!

194
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,880
What did you eat today to become so smart?

195
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,800
You're usually so dumb.

196
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,640
-I'm gonna kill you.
-Calm down, man.

197
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,600
You're near my feet.

198
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,920
What a perfect angle.

199
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
Look at you!

200
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,240
What are you thinking, man?

201
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
I know what I've got to do.

202
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,000
Sleep is what you've got to do!
Look at the time!

203
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,080
Enough with the drama.

204
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
You're gonna wait for Tharn
to apologize first, anyway.

205
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,760
Dumbass, you'll forgive him right away.

206
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,480
Where are you going?

207
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,160
Me? I'm gonna find some
alcohol to fill my bloodstream.

208
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,080
I've got alcohol deficiency.

209
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,800
<i>Whenever Fiat came to the hospital,</i>
<i>I always saw a kid with him.</i>

210
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,240
<i>I may be reading too much into it.</i>

211
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,440
<i>But the way he looked at Fiat</i>
<i>wasn't the way you'd look at a friend.</i>

212
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,240
<i>And the guy seemed really important</i>
<i>to Fiat, too.</i>

213
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,200
<i>But what I remember clearly</i>
<i>are the kid's eyes.</i>

214
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,560
<i>They were the eyes of someone…</i>

215
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,400
<i>with a crush.</i>

216
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,200
<i>I think the kid's name is…</i>

217
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,960
<i>Leo.</i>

218
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,480
How's your leg?

219
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,160
-Fine.
-It's gotten better?

220
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Yeah.

221
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,760
Leo.

222
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,440
Seriously.

223
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,240
What's going on between you two?

224
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,560
You're not speaking to him.

225
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,320
And he looks like he's about to cry
every time he sees you.

226
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,960
Nothing's going on.

227
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,560
Leo, I've known you for years.

228
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,400
No matter how harshly you speak to Fiat,
you still worry about him.

229
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,560
You're practically his dad.

230
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,160
Everyone on the team is so stressed now.

231
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,040
Tell them I'm sorry.

232
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,920
I think you should be honest with him.

233
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,080
About what?

234
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Whatever's on your mind.

235
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,960
I can't say it.

236
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,160
Because I don't want to lose him.

237
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,400
Damn it!

238
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
How can I say it?

239
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,960
If I said it…

240
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
I'd lose him.

241
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
I can't say it.

242
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,280
I can't lose him!

243
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,240
Can I talk to you for a second?

244
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,880
Fiat isn't a bad person.

245
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,440
He's just been through a lot.

246
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,960
Everyone's been through a lot.

247
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,760
But that's no reason to behave like this.

248
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,400
Let me ask you something.

249
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,560
If you love him,
why don't you make him yours?

250
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,040
Why do you let him
mess around with other people?

251
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,920
I can't do it.

252
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,920
You can't or you haven't tried?

253
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,400
He only sees me as a friend.

254
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,000
That's why I'm asking you.

255
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
You can't do it or you haven't tried?

256
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,080
I used to think he and I
could be more than just friends.

257
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,840
But he's never considered me
more than that.

258
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,080
I don't want to lose him.

259
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,920
I'm willing to get hurt
to stay friends with him.

260
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,400
It's better than him leaving me.

261
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,960
If that's all you can think of,
then continue hurting.

262
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,680
So, what do you expect me to do?

263
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,160
Just tell me.

264
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,720
What am I supposed to do…

265
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,000
to make him look at me…

266
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,120
the way he looks at you?

267
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,400
Do you wanna join forces?

268
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,120
You know…

269
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,560
that I…

270
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,400
have been yours for so long.

271
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,160
Then…

272
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,240
next time…

273
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,800
be considerate of my feelings.

274
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,440
Actually…

275
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,680
you don't have to force yourself.

276
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,120
Because I can wait
for the day you're ready.

277
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,560
Hold it tight.

278
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,720
You're cute.

279
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
Tharn.

280
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,400
I'm…

281
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
on cloud nine.

282
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
I'll always be by your side, Type.

283
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,160
<i>We should take a break.</i>

284
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Tharn, are you okay?

285
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
Thanya?

286
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,120
How come you're here?

287
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,920
Yesterday, Phugun heard
you and Type arguing.

288
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,160
He was worried,

289
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,040
so he called me.

290
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,440
What's the matter?

291
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm sorry for telling Thorn.

292
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,520
But I'm really worried about you.

293
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,440
So, what's the matter?

294
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,760
We had a fight.

295
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,080
He said…

296
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,800
we should take a break.

297
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
What do you mean?

298
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,600
Type promised me
he would never break up with you.

299
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,040
Type never said he wanted to break up.

300
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,680
Tharn.

301
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,280
I don't believe
Type is going to break up with you.

302
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
No way.

303
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,400
She's right.

304
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't think
Type wants to break up, either.

305
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,560
Type was worrying about you
and missing you all the time.

306
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,720
Though I haven't known him for long…

307
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,680
Type would never say that word.

308
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,520
But Type said they should take a break.

309
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,880
-To me--
-Be quiet, Thorn!

310
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,200
I'm serious, Tharn.
You must have faith in Type.

311
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,560
But right now…

312
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,400
I can't think straight anymore, Thanya.

313
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,800
I really miss him.

314
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,040
Then, go wash up.

315
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,360
You'll be able to think clearly
after you freshen up.

316
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,960
Come on.

317
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,680
That's right, Tharn.

318
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
You should wash up.

319
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Come on. Thanya and I
will help you clean up the room.

320
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
-What about me?
-You sit there quietly!

321
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
Where's Thorn?

322
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,760
I sent him away.

323
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,200
Have you eaten? Should I cook for you?

324
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,160
It's okay, Phu.

325
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
I'm not hungry.

326
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,400
You guys fought
because of the owner of this pen, right?

327
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,800
If it's the guy who came
when Type was sick,

328
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,720
I can assure you that nothing happened.

329
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,040
He got in on his own.

330
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,320
And Type was so sick
he could barely stand.

331
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,720
You have to believe me.

332
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,120
Tharn.

333
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,440
It's going to be okay.

334
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,720
I think…

335
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,960
you two should go home.

336
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,560
-But--
-Thanya.

337
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Let me have some time alone.

338
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,360
My mind is clear now.

339
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,120
So…

340
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,720
I won't do anything crazy.

341
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,120
Please, give me some time.

342
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,440
I want to be alone.

343
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,440
Okay.

344
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,680
It's okay.

345
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
Damn, so hot.

346
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,240
Today's horoscope
for people born on Friday…

347
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
If you want to get lucky…

348
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,600
step over the threshold
with your right foot.

349
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,120
Techno.

350
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,600
Shit! Just my luck.

351
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,040
-Hello.
-Techno.

352
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,800
When a problem comes up, it's always me.

353
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,240
Yes! What's up, Tharn?

354
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,440
Is Type with you?

355
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,760
What hath befallen you!

356
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Or something terrible has
happened to Type? Oh, my God!

357
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,760
Techno.

358
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,920
Tharn.

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,200
You know I can't tell you.

360
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,680
Please, don't ask me anything.

361
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,760
At least tell me this.

362
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,680
What happened…

363
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,760
while I was away?

364
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,600
I'm hungry!

365
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,880
Gotta go!

366
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,640
Need to save my skin. Get in the room!

367
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,400
It's freaking locked.
Damn, why is this happening to me?

368
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,640
Type…

369
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,480
here you are.

370
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,320
Damn, man.

371
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,200
What's wrong?

372
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,400
Just a sec, I need to compose myself.

373
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,120
I almost had a heart attack.

374
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,880
Champ, come here.
I've got something to say, hurry.

375
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,840
No, you guys talk.

376
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,720
I'm gonna get my work done.

377
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,280
-Just come. It'll be more lively, hurry.
-No, I've got so much work to do.

378
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,800
I'll be listening from here.

379
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,720
What the hell? Fine, I'll tell you now.

380
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,560
You know who I met today?

381
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,400
-Who?
-I met Tharn today.

382
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,760
Why aren't you excited?

383
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,600
Did you know that
he came to my office today?

384
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,120
I thought I was a goner.

385
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,560
It's a good thing I have such good karma.

386
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,720
I didn't tell him anything about where
you've been or what you've been doing.

387
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
Not a single thing escaped my lips.

388
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,480
I swear.

389
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,520
And the thing we've been planning?

390
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,680
I didn't say a thing.

391
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
-It's true.
-So what?

392
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,320
The thing is…

393
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,320
Tharn asked me to tell you
that he wants to talk to you now.

394
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,000
Type, he's already calmed down.

395
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,320
Want my advice?

396
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,880
You should talk to him right now. Really.

397
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,080
-So the whole thing can come to an end.
-Not now.

398
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,160
Type…

399
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,120
if you don't talk now…

400
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,840
then when?

401
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,040
I can't talk to him
until I clear everything up.

402
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,360
What's the matter with you?

403
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,600
Champ, knock some sense into your friend.

404
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,920
Type.

405
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,080
You're doing it again.

406
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,320
You did it before with Lhong.

407
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,200
And now again with that Fiat kid.

408
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,440
-You're gonna do it again?
-Yeah.

409
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,080
-Yeah.
-What?

410
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,280
I'm gonna deal with him.

411
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,240
Why are you so unreasonable?

412
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,960
Is there no other way?

413
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,640
No.

414
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,000
For me, it's got to be
an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

415
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,120
That brings back memories.

416
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,640
Champ, I'll help you wash the dishes.

417
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,640
Damn, why is he so furious?

418
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,600
Go wash the dishes.

419
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,760
Put the knife away
or he'll stab me instead of Tharn.

420
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
Is this seat taken?

421
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,160
Leave me alone.

422
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,640
You came alone?

423
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,440
You got dumped?

424
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,240
I said, leave me alone.

425
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,600
Want me to comfort you?

426
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,000
You may as well, at least,
not be alone on a day like this.

427
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,680
You sure about this?

428
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,360
We're risking prison this time.

429
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,520
If you wanna continue being a wimp,
you can keep watching scenes like this.

430
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,120
I'm sure.

431
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,360
Okay.

432
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,960
Have you ever experienced this?

433
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,120
When you need someone…

434
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,480
but no one wants you.

435
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
When I was young…

436
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,760
I acted like a scumbag.

437
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,400
Because I was afraid of losing my dad.

438
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,800
But he still left me
to live with my new mom.

439
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,480
Now that I'm grown up…

440
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I just need someone.

441
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,800
But no one wants me at all.

442
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,520
Guess I was born this way.

443
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,040
Born to be the unwanted.

444
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,920
Tonight…

445
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,800
should I stay with you?

446
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,240
Sure.

447
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,120
It's all I can do, anyway.

448
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,400
You awake?

449
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,800
Who the hell are you!

450
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Why did you tie me up? What do you want?

451
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,160
Let me go!

452
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,440
Don't you remember me?

453
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,880
Type.

454
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,920
I'm glad you still remember me…

455
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
after you caused me so much trouble.

456
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
What are you gonna do to me?

457
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,200
What should I do?

458
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,120
Should I get even?

459
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,360
Let me go!

460
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,880
You can do anything,
but don't hurt my knee!

461
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,400
Let go!

462
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,120
I'm begging you.

463
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,360
Please, let me go.

464
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,320
Please, don't do this.

465
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,000
Should I pity you?

466
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,880
I don't think so.

467
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,120
I'll do anything, please let me go.

468
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,280
I've got nothing left.

469
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,400
If I can't play basketball,
I'll really have nothing left. Please.

470
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,280
Why did you do it?

471
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,360
Let me go, please!

472
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,320
Why did you do it!

473
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,520
I just wanted someone.

474
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,600
So, why me?

475
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,040
You were worried about me!

476
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,880
You appreciated me.

477
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,680
No one appreciates me!

478
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,320
My dad, my mom, my siblings.

479
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,960
They don't worry about me at all!

480
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,680
I know you've got a boyfriend.

481
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,720
And I'm jealous of him.

482
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,160
I just want someone like you in my life!

483
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,800
Am I so wrong
for wanting someone like you?

484
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,680
Yes.

485
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,000
You've been wrong since you started
pursuing someone with a boyfriend.

486
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,600
Had he been
even a little interested in me…

487
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,640
I wouldn't have done it!

488
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,360
Acting the way you have,
who would love you?

489
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,560
You're right.

490
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,760
Who would love me?

491
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,920
No one!

492
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,920
I was born to be hated, anyway!

493
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,440
Even the one who promised
to stay by my side…

494
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,920
No matter what I do to provoke him…

495
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,800
he isn't affected at all!

496
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,680
Even if I sleep with someone else,
he doesn't feel anything.

497
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,880
Even if I couldn't play basketball
with him anymore…

498
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,760
he still wouldn't feel a thing.

499
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,800
I just want a bit of your attention.

500
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,760
But you hate me now.

501
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,000
You're done with me.

502
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,840
You don't wanna see my face anymore.

503
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,920
You don't wanna take care of me anymore.

504
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,680
I've got nothing left.

505
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,680
Next time…

506
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,600
do things differently.

507
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,760
If you love someone,

508
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,480
make sure to grab the right one.

509
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,840
Don't do things out of spite again.

510
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,440
If you love someone,
hold on and don't let go.

511
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,920
Damn.

512
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,800
Are they done?

513
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,440
Is anyone coming?

514
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,480
Hey, guys.

515
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,400
How was it?

516
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,360
Tell me, hurry.

517
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,560
I should hate that kid,

518
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,360
but I pity him.

519
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Pity him?

520
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,880
-Yeah.
-Why?

521
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,680
How did you know they liked each other?

522
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,000
I didn't.

523
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,600
What do you mean?

524
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,400
I just went with my gut.

525
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,400
That kid just wanted to win against me.

526
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,360
He didn't want me.

527
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,320
Really?

528
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,720
Wait, let me get this straight.

529
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,360
Those two made you and Tharn
have a huge-ass fight.

530
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,480
But you helped bring them together.

531
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,600
Yeah.

532
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,800
You're bluffing.

533
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,960
The Type I know
isn't that nice of a person.

534
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,720
What are you up to? Tell me.

535
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,120
-I'm not a nice person.
-Right.

536
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,120
But if they end up together,

537
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,120
they won't bother me anymore.

538
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,440
And no one will bother Tharn.

539
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
-You're right.
-Just to make sure,

540
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,520
I've got someone to keep
a watch on that Fiat kid,

541
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,280
so I can rest assured that it's over.

542
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,560
You're a genius.

543
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,280
Come on, man.

544
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,560
Don't worry.

545
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,440
They're lucky.

546
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,720
Remember what Type said?

547
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,800
His motto.

548
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,080
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

549
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,400
He stayed true to it.

550
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,320
-Damn.
-I can imagine the horror.

551
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,320
-Don't imagine the horror.
-Let's go.

552
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,880
It's me who was horrified.

553
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,920
I thought he was gonna
do the unthinkable to that kid.

554
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,120
Don't hurt me!

555
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,720
Leave me alone.

556
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,880
This would've never happened to you…

557
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,920
if you'd paid attention to someone
who really loved you.

558
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,440
Fiat.

559
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,600
Leo, my dad doesn't love me anymore.
He doesn't love me.

560
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,640
He kicked me out of the house.

561
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
Nobody wants me anymore.

562
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,560
If nobody wanted me, why was I born?

563
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,760
Don't think like that.

564
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,840
You have to love yourself first.

565
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,560
If you can't love yourself,
how can anyone else love you?

566
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,760
If I love myself, will you love me, Leo?

567
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,040
Of course.

568
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,160
Come live with me.

569
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,040
If no one loves you…

570
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,160
I will, Fiat.

571
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,040
Do you finally see…

572
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,240
the one who cherishes you?

573
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,560
Leo.

574
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,800
Where have you been?

575
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,680
I'm so scared.

576
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,080
Type's gonna wreck my knee.

577
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,360
I won't be able to play basketball
with you anymore.

578
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,960
I won't have anything left.

579
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
I'm scared.

580
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,240
Even if you couldn't
play basketball anymore…

581
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,120
I promise…

582
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,320
I'd stay by your side forever.

583
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,960
You're lying.

584
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,280
You wanted nothing to do with me.

585
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,920
You didn't wanna look at me.

586
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,720
Even when I was
with someone else to spite you…

587
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,200
you still didn't care.

588
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,480
Who says I didn't?

589
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
Do you realize…

590
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,920
I was in so much pain…

591
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,720
when I saw you with someone else.

592
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,360
It was me…

593
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,040
who thought you saw me just as a friend.

594
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,240
I love you!

595
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,160
But if I told you and you left me…

596
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,520
like my dad, my mom…

597
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,880
like everyone else who left me…

598
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,120
then I'd have no one left.

599
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,800
I will never leave you.

600
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,640
I'm sorry…

601
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,120
for being a coward.

602
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,280
I'm sorry…

603
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,440
I was scared to tell you how I felt.

604
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,440
Because I feel the same way you do.//

605
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,800
Leo.

606
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,640
Cir.

607
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,480
Cir.

608
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,560
-Let's talk.
-I've got nothing to say.

609
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,080
Phugun…

610
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,920
how am I supposed to feel…

611
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,880
when my boyfriend asks me
to hit on another guy?

612
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,560
It was for Type.

613
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,200
But I'm your boyfriend.

614
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,240
How could you let me hit on someone else?

615
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,760
I only wanted to help Type.

616
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,880
Type even said that no one
was more suited for the job than you.

617
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,520
Cir…

618
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
when you put on a straight face…

619
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,080
to hit on that guy,
you were super handsome.

620
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,440
I fell in love right away.

621
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,440
Cir.

622
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,560
Cir.

623
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,720
Hello. Testing, testing.

624
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,680
What are you doing?

625
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,160
I'm not Phugun, I'm Coco.

626
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,880
Phugun asked me to tell handsome Cir…

627
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,720
not to sulk.

628
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,080
He's sorry. Let's make up.

629
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,640
Let's make up.

630
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,160
I should make up with the guy
who told me to hit on someone else?

631
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,880
But Coco thinks it's because
Phugun trusts you.

632
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,920
You say you love Phugun,
and Phugun believes you.

633
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,800
Therefore, let's make up.

634
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,520
Please, please, please.

635
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,600
Handsome Cir, please make up with Phugun.

636
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,440
Pretty please, let's make up.

637
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,840
Let's make up.

638
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,400
Cir.

639
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,480
Let's make up.

640
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,120
Please.

641
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,560
Please, make up with me.

642
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,600
How could I…

643
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,960
ever win against you?

644
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,640
So, don't try.

645
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,280
As long as I win against you.

646
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,280
Hello.

647
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,520
