1
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,440
What are you doing?

2
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,920
You wanted to be romantic
but ended up ruining it, right?

3
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Don't you dare get upset.

4
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Today's my day off, but I had to
wake up early because of you.

5
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Because it's your day off.

6
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
So I wanted to do something for you.

7
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
By destroying the room?

8
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm not destroying the room.

9
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm making a cake.

10
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,840
Someone like you is making a cake for me?

11
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,960
Yeah, as you can see.

12
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,440
But from what I'm seeing,
you're destroying the room.

13
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,640
-And…
-And what?

14
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,960
Let's do what you do best.

15
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Since it's your day off…

16
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,680
I was planning on
letting you get some rest.

17
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
I never asked for that.

18
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,160
You're making a mess,
eating like a toddler.

19
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Wipe it off properly.

20
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,280
What a nag.

21
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,160
I've always eaten like this.

22
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,600
And I've always had to clean you up.

23
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,000
Then, do it properly.

24
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
You must have already finished
talking to your mom,

25
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
since you have time
to talk to this toddler.

26
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,680
Yeah.

27
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,880
I told her you injured your knee,
so I had to hurry back.

28
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,960
What?

29
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,440
Then, she must have scolded you
for coming back because of me.

30
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,960
My "favorite son" reputation is tarnished.

31
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,480
This is bad.

32
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,440
Guess I gotta call your mom and tell her

33
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,840
that your coming back
has got nothing to do with me.

34
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,040
There's no need to call her.

35
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,040
Your position as "favorite son"
remains intact.

36
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,960
I told her I came back because
I found out from the teammates.

37
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,040
If she was going to scold you,

38
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,960
it'd be because you didn't tell her
you were hospitalized.

39
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,120
When she found out,
she almost flew back here immediately.

40
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,200
Good thing I told her
you've gotten much better.

41
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Guess I'll have to call your mom tonight
and tell her I love her.

42
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,960
Just do whatever you want.

43
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,880
I don't know whose mom she is anymore.

44
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Almost forgot.

45
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,160
The guys on the team sent me this.

46
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,720
These are the shoes I want.

47
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,440
They're on sale now,
and the shop's not far from here.

48
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,720
Take me there, pretty please.

49
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,920
Your knee hasn't recovered,
so why do you want to make it worse?

50
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Show me the ones you want,
and I'll go take a look.

51
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,480
No, I wanna go take a look myself.

52
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,400
You're really underestimating your injury.

53
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I'm afraid you won't buy the ones I like.

54
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,400
Please, Leo. Let me go to the shop.

55
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,760
Please.

56
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
Fine.

57
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,840
Don't complain to me later.

58
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,440
I promise, I won't complain.

59
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Look into my eyes.

60
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
Pretty please, Leo.

61
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
Take me to the shop, please.

62
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
Don't you feel bad for me? Please.

63
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,800
Fine, I'll go get the car.
Come on out after you finish eating.

64
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,520
I love you more than anyone in the world.

65
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,920
The person you love the most
is whoever pampers you.

66
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm hungry.

67
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,000
Then…

68
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,320
I'll cook you something.

69
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,080
What do you want?

70
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,200
When I said I was hungry,
I was asking you to eat out with me.

71
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,480
I'm asking you out on a date.
Are you coming or not?

72
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,920
You're asking me out on a date.

73
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Of course I'm coming.

74
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,200
You should wash up.

75
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
I'll wash up in the other bathroom.

76
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Okay.

77
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,400
Make it quick.

78
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,800
Okay.

79
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,080
Or you wanna take a shower with me?

80
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,360
Don't tempt me, Type.

81
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,440
I'm really hungry.

82
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,160
You'd better hurry.

83
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm gonna take a shower now.

84
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,440
Tharn?

85
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,280
Is this where Thorn proposed to Am?

86
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
Yeah.

87
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,920
That's why I brought you here.

88
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,600
Tharn.

89
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,840
I got a text from my shop's staff.
Take a look.

90
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,000
A music teacher is asking for a discount
for guitar and bass strings.

91
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,840
So the staff is asking
how much of a discount they should give.

92
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,960
I didn't say anything.

93
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I just wanted to tell you,
so you don't have to worry.

94
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
That's up to you.

95
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,320
So, how's your website going?

96
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
My website?

97
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,760
It's been good these days.

98
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,320
More customers have turned
to online shopping.

99
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,080
So the orders have increased.

100
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,240
And I've just hired a new admin
to monitor the website.

101
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm planning to open
a brick-and-mortar store too.

102
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
I'm searching for a location now.

103
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,400
Aren't you rushing things?

104
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,320
Don't forget
you just recently created your website.

105
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
What are you gonna do
if the sales drop after this?

106
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
Worried about me?

107
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,520
I've already checked the market trends.

108
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,680
And if the sales do actually drop,

109
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,960
I'll use the brick-and-mortar store
to stock the products.

110
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,360
That way,
I can stop using Dad's warehouse.

111
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
I hate to bother him.

112
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,120
Even so, you still think too far ahead.

113
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,040
Think carefully.

114
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,760
Take it one step at a time.
Don't be reckless.

115
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm not being reckless.

116
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,800
But I'm anxious.

117
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,200
I want stability and security in life,
so I can take care of you.

118
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
And I…

119
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,160
want to take the very best care of you.

120
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm capable enough.
I can take care of myself.

121
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,280
And I can take care of you too.

122
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,360
You might not feel confident right now.

123
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,920
But in the future…

124
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,720
can you wear our wedding ring?

125
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Dream on.

126
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,640
Get the check when you finish eating.

127
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,560
We've still got
some grocery shopping to do.

128
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,800
Eat. This one's tasty.

129
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,400
Fine.

130
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,320
{\an8}SIAM PARAGON

131
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,640
Doing grocery shopping like this
reminds me of our freshman year.

132
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,600
What are you reminiscing
about the innocent past?

133
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,320
It took a lot of effort
to get you to go shopping with me.

134
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,800
And look at you now.

135
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,040
You've become the financial planner
of our household.

136
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,480
If I hadn't become one,
you would've blown all our money.

137
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,760
Not to mention you're a big spender
whenever you treat your colleagues.

138
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,080
I know you've got lots of money,
but you've got to save some too.

139
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,720
This is why I need you.

140
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,160
Asshole. Can you just stop flirting?
We've already done it countless times.

141
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm so tired, Type.

142
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,480
Let me put the groceries in the car first.

143
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,800
And I'll be back to continue
with the flirting, okay?

144
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,360
Okay, you'd better hurry.

145
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,800
Damn, get over
the honeymoon phase, already.

146
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,000
We've been together for years.

147
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,400
Take this too.

148
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,120
I'm going to the bathroom.
Meet me here when you're done.

149
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,920
Hurry up, Leo.
They'll be sold out any minute.

150
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,600
Slow down. Watch your knee.

151
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,080
But I'm afraid the shoes will be sold out.

152
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,360
Didn't you tell me
today's the last day of the sale?

153
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,840
But I also told you I could go alone.
You didn't have to come with me.

154
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,800
I was afraid you'd buy the wrong ones.

155
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,240
So hard to please.

156
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,920
What?

157
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
So what if I'm hard to please?

158
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,840
Or don't you want to pamper me anymore?

159
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,880
Type!

160
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
Are you just here for a walk?

161
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm here to do some shopping.

162
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,680
Is your knee completely healed,
since you're walking around now?

163
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,560
It's gotten much better.

164
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Thank you so much
for giving me all that advice.

165
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,640
I've thought about it so much.

166
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,080
I need to take care of my knee for myself.

167
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,800
I'm glad you've realized that.

168
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,520
Don't forget to go
to your PT appointments.

169
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,920
Okay.

170
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,560
Type, this is Leo.

171
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,920
My friend.

172
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,800
Leo, this is Type.

173
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,240
He's the one taking care
of my rehabilitation.

174
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,240
Hello.

175
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,480
Take good care of your friend.

176
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,560
At least, don't let him
walk around too much like today.

177
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,040
Come on, Type. I haven't walked that much.

178
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
I've got to go. Please excuse me.

179
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,000
Type! I'll text you later.

180
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
Only text me when it's really important.

181
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
Okay.

182
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
Type is so cute.

183
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,560
But, damn, does he ever put up walls.

184
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,720
Even when I'm this handsome.

185
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,200
Don't you think so?

186
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,680
Leo, where are you going?
I thought you were worried about my knee.

187
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,240
Who were those two guys? Do I know them?

188
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,880
A patient at the hospital.

189
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,800
I bumped into him,
so I asked how he was doing.

190
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,080
Is that so?

191
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,440
So, stop looking at them.

192
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,240
Or they'll be instantly charmed
when they look into your eyes.

193
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm too tired to get jealous.

194
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,920
Which one of us is charming?

195
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,480
Still clueless?

196
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,560
The only one who's blind enough
to fall for me is you.

197
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I hope I'm the only one.

198
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
Who else would there be?

199
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
Let's go. Aren't you gonna buy some books?

200
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,320
-Come on.
-Okay.

201
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,920
Who was that?

202
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,200
-Who do you mean?
-That guy back there.

203
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,000
Are you deaf
or do you have short-term memory loss?

204
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,960
I told you he's the guy who takes care
of my knee at the hospital.

205
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,800
I know that.

206
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,400
But based on the way you looked at him,
he's more than that.

207
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
Why?

208
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,160
What's wrong with the way I looked at him?

209
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,000
It's obvious what you're thinking.

210
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,160
Take it easy with that stuff.

211
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,760
Look at my face.

212
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,440
A guy like me always gets what he wants.

213
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,120
But there's one thing I can't get.

214
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,040
And that's a way to stop you
from bitching at me.

215
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,480
Whatever.

216
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,760
Just hurry up and help me pick.
My knee's starting to hurt.

217
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,800
I told you not to complain.

218
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,880
Come on.

219
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,520
Which ones do you want?

220
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,200
I want that pair.

221
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,400
-This one?
-No, on the lower shelf.

222
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
This one?

223
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,600
No, that one!

224
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,840
-This one?
-That's it.

225
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,080
So? What do you think?

226
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,240
Pretty lightweight.

227
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
Should be comfortable.

228
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,880
-Can you really wear this size?
-Yes.

229
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,480
Try it on.

230
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,840
How is it?

231
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,960
It's okay.

232
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,920
Comfortable?

233
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,080
Do I look cool?

234
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,120
You're unbelievable.

235
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,920
{\an8}NUMBER FIVE

236
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,680
Doc! How come you're here?

237
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,720
I…

238
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,080
How did you get here? You came alone?

239
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,840
I--

240
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,320
I didn't plan on coming to see you, Champ.

241
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,440
I…

242
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm just lost. Yes, I just got lost.

243
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,160
Okay. I haven't said anything.
What's wrong with you?

244
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,000
It's nothing. I'm totally fine.

245
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,520
I really got lost.

246
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,760
Yeah, I know.

247
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,320
I'll explain if you don't believe me.

248
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,320
I took a wrong turn and…

249
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,760
And I remembered…

250
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
that your restaurant is around here.

251
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,080
So I…

252
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,920
So I…

253
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,720
So I remembered
that your restaurant is around here.

254
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,920
And the next thing I knew…

255
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,600
The next thing I knew…

256
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
I'd driven to your restaurant.

257
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,800
Okay.

258
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,040
Look.

259
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,800
It really worked, Doc!

260
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,480
Will other hospital staff come?
Did you invite anyone?

261
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,600
Aren't you--

262
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,640
Aren't you too close, Champ?

263
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,840
Really?

264
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,240
Sorry, this is how I normally
treat my friends.

265
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,960
It's okay.

266
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,120
What? Are you blushing?

267
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,920
Still bashful as ever.

268
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
You're so darn cute.

269
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,800
Come on, since you came here on purpose--

270
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,040
I told you… I took a wrong turn.

271
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Since you took the wrong turn
to my restaurant…

272
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,040
I'll serve you some delicious food.
Let's go.

273
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Here, our signature dish.

274
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,240
Chicken breast with super herbal sauce.

275
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,000
I searched for all sorts of herbs
for this dish.

276
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,720
If I hadn't come up with this dish,
I would've been an herb merchant.

277
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,720
That's funny.

278
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,840
Who would've thought that someone like me…

279
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,000
would open a restaurant.
Even I didn't see it coming.

280
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,000
Doc?

281
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,600
Doc!

282
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,560
Are you okay? Didn't get much sleep?

283
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,000
I bet you stayed up reading again.

284
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,440
Yeah, that reminds me
of our freshman year.

285
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,960
You always turned on the light
when you read at night.

286
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,600
I couldn't sleep at all.

287
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,080
Did you know that
I almost switched rooms with Type?

288
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,080
Luckily, he ended up with Tharn first.

289
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,720
I've found someone
to switch rooms with you.

290
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,000
Who?

291
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,160
Champ, over here. Come here.

292
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,120
What's up, Techno?

293
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,240
This is the guy I told you about.

294
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,840
He's the only one who's willing
to switch rooms with you.

295
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah, I'm looking for someone
to switch rooms with.

296
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,440
It's not that my roommate is bad,
but he studies medicine.

297
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,440
He reads all night.
I can barely sleep at all.

298
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,920
So I wanna switch rooms.

299
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,320
In that case, I'll let you discuss
while I go to the Dorm Office to--

300
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,680
I changed my mind.

301
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,280
Thanks for agreeing
to switch rooms with me.

302
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,360
But I've got some unfinished business
with my roommate.

303
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,480
Sorry for wasting your time.

304
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,360
It's all right. Come see me
if you change your mind.

305
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,120
See you.

306
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,200
And who do you think
ruined my concentration?

307
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,920
Who do you mean?

308
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,960
Forget about it.

309
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,440
Khun, what are you doing?

310
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,920
Why do you look so serious?

311
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,640
I'm preparing for this afternoon's
lab quiz, Phaphaeng.

312
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,560
I'm not feeling too confident.

313
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,200
You're kidding.
How can you not be confident?

314
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,120
I'm really not.

315
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,200
Phaphaeng, lately I've been feeling
like Champ is teasing me.

316
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,240
Champ, your roommate?
Why? What did he do to you?

317
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,560
He didn't do anything.

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,760
Actually…

319
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,800
it's not entirely his fault.

320
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,200
It's mine, really.

321
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Lately, Champ has been
walking around the room shirtless.

322
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,520
I couldn't focus on my reading at all.

323
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,440
I could only start reading…

324
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,400
after Champ had fallen asleep.

325
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Go on.

326
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,400
You know how it's summer now,
right, Phaphaeng?

327
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,840
And Champ keeps walking around
the room in nothing but his boxers.

328
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:26,040
It's so awkward. I don't know what to do…

329
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,680
much less think about my readings.

330
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,720
I couldn't even keep my eyes
from staring at Champ.

331
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,520
He's making you blush, right?

332
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm not blushing.

333
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,200
My little cutie.

334
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,800
What do I do, Phaphaeng?

335
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,720
I can't focus on my reading at all.

336
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,120
It's okay.

337
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,400
Why are you smiling, Doc?

338
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,960
Nothing, I just…

339
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,480
thought of something.

340
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,120
I'm glad it's nothing.

341
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,840
Give it a try, see if it's tasty or not.

342
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
I spent a long time creating this recipe.

343
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,000
Then, I have a feeling this dish
is going to be delicious.

344
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,960
Really, you haven't tasted it,
but you're already saying it's delicious.

345
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,320
Try it before you compliment me.

346
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,600
Okay.

347
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,640
I'll dig in, then.

348
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,000
It's pretty good, Champ.

349
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,720
How come you've been so happy lately?

350
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,480
Probably because Am agreed to marry me.

351
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,400
I'm so jealous.

352
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,280
You're thinking
about your sweetheart, right?

353
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,560
Yeah, a little.

354
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
Don't know when he'll agree.

355
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,200
Like Type said, marriage isn't a game.
Give him time.

356
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,400
Thorn, I've never played games with Type.

357
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,160
I know.

358
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,600
But don't forget, Tharn.

359
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,400
Even though you don't care
what people think…

360
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,760
what Type said is true.

361
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,000
Our society doesn't accept
same-sex marriage.

362
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,640
Type's probably worried about that
and about Dad and Mom's reputations.

363
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,600
But I don't care.

364
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,280
Neither does anyone in our family.

365
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,000
But Type cares.

366
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,720
He cares about you and our family.

367
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,520
Give him time.

368
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,880
It's like

369
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,000
I don't know him at all…

370
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,960
even though I know what he thinks.

371
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,720
I can wait for him until he's ready.

372
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,760
Hang in there.

373
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,680
Excuse me, Mr. Thorn.

374
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,640
Mr. Tharn, I brought you
some coffee and snacks.

375
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,800
Thank you.

376
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,960
I didn't invite you to come in. Leave.

377
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,560
And if I don't ask for you…

378
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,720
don't come in.

379
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Thorn.

380
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,960
I saw it was almost noon,
and I thought Mr. Tharn would be hungry.

381
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,360
So I brought him some refreshments.

382
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,600
So, please excuse me.

383
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,800
But if you need something, Mr. Tharn,
you can always call me.

384
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Okay.

385
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,280
I told you to leave. Please.

386
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,840
What's making Mr. Tharathorn…

387
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,240
so irritated?

388
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,800
It's obvious. She's trying to seduce you.

389
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,480
But I already have Type.

390
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,960
And don't forget…

391
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,880
I don't like women.

392
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,280
I know,
but I have a bad feeling about her.

393
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,200
A while back, she kept pestering me
until she found out I was marrying Am.

394
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,640
Now, she probably sees you're single,
and she's trying to approach you.

395
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:34,320
If you've got a bad feeling about her,
why do you keep her on?

396
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,160
Her work performance is pretty good.

397
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,600
It would be inappropriate to dismiss her.

398
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,640
Are you done signing?

399
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,720
Every page.

400
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,920
I'll head out first.

401
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,600
I'm going to stop by somewhere
to buy dinner for Type.

402
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
You're taking such good care of him.

403
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,680
I hope he agrees to marry you soon.

404
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,920
I hope so too.

405
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,640
-I'm leaving now.
-Okay.

406
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,400
Call me if you need anything.

407
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,960
-Champ.
-Yeah?

408
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,640
I'm leaving.

409
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,360
Thanks so much for being my customer.

410
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,320
If I create any new recipes,
I'll let you have a taste.

411
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,160
Sure. In that case,
I'll visit again when I have time.

412
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,480
But if you find
any other good restaurants,

413
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
you've got to tell me.

414
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,000
I wanna try their dishes
and improve my own.

415
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Sure.

416
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600
Can I really invite you out?

417
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Of course. Why not?

418
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,000
Look, you're acting cute again.

419
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,840
Do you have to return to the hospital?

420
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,640
Yes, I have a shift later.

421
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,000
Okay, then you should hurry
or you'll be late.

422
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Sorry, old habit again.

423
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,040
-Okay, I'm leaving.
-Okay.

424
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,960
Have a safe trip and don't get lost again.

425
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,120
It'd be okay
if you do get lost and come here often.

426
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
-See you later.
-Okay.

427
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,560
TAKE A BREAK. I'M WORRIED.

428
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,600
Why'd you take a photo?

429
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm…

430
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,160
declaring my ownership of you.

431
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,800
Silly.

432
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,800
Type.

433
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,440
I…

434
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,640
worry about you.

435
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,320
Even though you're fed up at work,
you insist on toughing it out.

436
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,560
Because you want to
stay at the job for a year.

437
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,000
You already know that…

438
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
so don't get stressed out for me.

439
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,600
Let's say,
if I really can't take it anymore,

440
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
I'll quit and let you provide for me.

441
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,600
So, then…

442
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,640
quit now.

443
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,920
I can…

444
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
easily provide for you.

445
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
You're crazy.

446
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,160
Believe me, I can take it.

447
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,640
If you want to convince me…

448
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,760
stop working first.

449
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,160
And come eat dinner.

450
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,320
And…

451
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,640
The coffees…

452
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,520
I'll dump them out.

453
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,520
TECHNO: MY MAN THARN IS
TOTALLY HUSBAND MATERIAL

454
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,840
THANYA: WHO'S YOUR MAN,
TECHNO? HE'S TYPE'S MAN.

455
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
PHUGUN: THANYA LOL.

456
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,760
NANA: WANT A SHARE OF YOUR CARE.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

457
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,320
Who the hell is it this time?

458
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,440
The food's here. Thank you.

459
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Excuse me, do you offer a 10% discount?

460
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,000
Damn, she's walking away.

461
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,960
She's smiling.
Guess they really do have a discount.

462
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,920
I've got to apply for a membership.

463
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,160
Is this enough for you?
I don't think it is.

464
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,880
-Excuse me.
-Techno.

465
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,960
Five minutes ago, you told me
you were full from your mom's cooking.

466
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,480
You're still the same
after all these years,

467
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,160
still eating like a pig.

468
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,960
That's none of your business!
What about you?

469
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,320
Doesn't your hubby have a gig today?

470
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,360
So why are you here?
Don't you have to keep an eye on him?

471
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,280
-Go to hell.
-Asshole.

472
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,240
Speaking of Tharn,

473
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,560
I think he's becoming more popular
as he gets older, don't you think?

474
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,800
It's like he gets hotter
as he gets older, like a daddy.

475
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,400
Especially that day on the sofa.

476
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,000
I remember it clearly.
He's got nice moans.

477
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
-Shit! One hit on the right.
-You chatterbox.

478
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,720
I'm just kidding. What a hard slap…

479
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,960
Should I order desserts?
They help reduce stress. Okay?

480
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,840
Stop pissing me off.

481
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,040
You're right he's popular,
but I can't keep tabs on him every day.

482
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,600
Why?

483
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:56,680
Last time, Jeed got me so knocked out
I was almost late for work the next day.

484
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,040
You were knocked out
because you were drunk?

485
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,240
-Hell yeah!
-Okay.

486
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,920
I thought it was
because of something else.

487
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,200
Pervert.

488
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
What? I could hear everything
from the sofa.

489
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,520
Anyway…

490
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,960
By the way, speaking of Tharn,

491
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,600
he's really popular.

492
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,680
I saw him the other day at the mall,
walking with a woman.

493
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,080
-Shit.
-What did you say?

494
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,320
Tharn was with a woman?

495
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,920
I spilled the beans again?

496
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,600
I let it slip again. What should I do?

497
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,160
Type--

498
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,240
Tell me everything.

499
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,400
I can't. I really can't tell you.

500
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,600
I really can't.
But if I eat two brownies--

501
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,400
-I'll buy you five.
-Okay!

502
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,160
-Here's the thing. Listen carefully.
-Greedy bastard.

503
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,560
What the hell? Food comes first.
Free food is even better.

504
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,800
Here's the thing. I was gonna
watch a movie the other day.

505
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,720
There was still some time,
so I was thinking of having lunch.

506
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,800
But damn, I wanted to take a shit,
so I walked to the bathroom.

507
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,920
I suddenly saw Tharn
out of the corner of my right eye.

508
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,440
I was like, "I know that's Tharn.
Is that Tharn? I'm not sure.

509
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm sure it is".
It is hunger, so let's take a bite.

510
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,400
-Tell me first.
-You messed up my hair.

511
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,640
Fine, I'll put it down and tell you first.

512
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,040
You see, whenever I see Tharn,
I always see Type.

513
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,640
You guys are inseparable.

514
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,760
Yeah. But when I looked, I didn't see you.

515
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,640
So I was gonna say hello
and ask where you were.

516
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,400
It was like a scene
from a TV show, you know?

517
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,800
The first step was fine,
but the next step was like…

518
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,680
the director told me to stop.

519
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,080
I stopped without anything in my way.

520
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,480
Like I was stunned when the woman
came into the scene.

521
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:10,800
And that woman approached Tharn!

522
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,800
Talking to him like they were close.

523
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,120
I bet something's up! Really.

524
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,400
But the urge to shit took over,
so I took a shit first.

525
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,440
Otherwise, I would've followed him.
I missed my chance.

526
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,560
What a pity.

527
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,360
You don't need to worry.

528
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,120
I totally understand.

529
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,880
Five brownies. To go.

530
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,160
-Just order.
-Okay.

531
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,120
Excuse me! Hello. I'd like to order.

532
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,000
I'll have five brownies to go.
This guy's paying. Okay? Thank you.

533
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,880
Let's eat. It's no use worrying.
Have some tea first. Don't think too much.

534
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,480
Here you are, Mr. Thiwat.
Dr. Thiti wants to see you in his office.

535
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,080
Thank you.

536
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:52,240
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD
ON MY PHYSICAL THERAPY EVERY DAY, TYPE.

537
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:49,480
I WANT TO GET BETTER SOON
SO I CAN PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS AGAIN.

538
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,160
Are you serious with this dude?

539
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
Type.

540
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,520
Didn't you say
you wanted to watch this movie?

541
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,960
But you keep staring at your phone.

542
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,960
Fine, I'll watch it with you.

543
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,560
So, you really can't make it?
I want you to meet Mr. Tharn.

544
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,400
<i>If I hadn't gotten</i>
<i>an urgent call from work,</i>

545
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,280
<i>I wouldn't have missed it.</i>

546
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,440
<i>I want to see this Mr. Tharn you're after</i>
<i>and how hot he is.</i>

547
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,320
Super hot. Very dashing.

548
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,760
His personality, manner, and looks
are so perfect.

549
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,280
If I can date him,
everyone will be jealous of me.

550
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,880
Most importantly, I checked,
and he's 100% single.

551
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,680
I have to get this guy
since I missed my chance with Mr. Thorn.

552
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,600
<i>Because you didn't check</i>
<i>if he had a girlfriend.</i>

553
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,280
<i>And what happened? You failed!</i>

554
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,960
I know.
And when I set my sights on Mr. Tharn,

555
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,640
I felt so lucky I'd moved on
from Mr. Thorn in time.

556
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:08,320
The younger brother looks better.

557
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,920
Even though he's not the firstborn,
he still gets an equal inheritance.

558
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,640
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>
<i>It's the tenth time you've said that.</i>

559
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,280
<i>So, what's your plan today?</i>

560
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,360
I'll invite him out for lunch
and continue trying to seduce him.

561
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:29,040
<i>Good luck. I'm going back to work now.</i>
<i>My boss is getting angry.</i>

562
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,080
Okay, talk to you later.

563
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,080
{\an8}SENT LOCATION.

564
00:48:53,640 --> 00:49:00,600
{\an8}I HAPPEN TO BE NEAR YOUR PLACE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME?

565
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,960
{\an8}SURE, SEE YOU LATER.

566
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,960
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

567
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,640
{\an8}YOU'RE EVEN INVOLVING THORN
AND THANYA IN THIS?

568
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,920
{\an8}YOU SHUT UP.
AT LEAST WE HAVE MORE BACKUP NOW.

569
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,040
{\an8}IS THAT ALL I AM TO YOU?

570
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,680
{\an8}NO, YOU'RE THE SENIOR OF THE GROUP.

571
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,560
{\an8}HAS EVERYONE SEEN THARN'S IG POST?

572
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,760
{\an8}SO ROMANTIC!

573
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,640
{\an8}I THINK TECHNO JUST WANTS TO BE NOSY.

574
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,600
{\an8}NOW, NOW, THAT'S NOT NICE, PRINCESS.

575
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,680
{\an8}SO, IS IT TRUE THARN'S CHEATING ON TYPE?

576
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,000
{\an8}TYPE KNOWS. WAIT AND SEE.
