1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,080
Hello.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
This is Thanya, my sister.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
You didn't lie to me?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,200
Pops!

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,320
Get up, are you okay?

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,520
Just admit it, already.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,640
No way.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,200
How can I believe that
this white boy is Thanya's brother?

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,800
My old man's so biased.

10
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,640
Uncle, are you okay?

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,920
Let me help you.

12
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,720
It's okay, Thanya. Look.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
I'm very strong, look.
I'm extremely fit, see?

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,840
I heard you were scary,
but I don't think that's true at all.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,480
You look so kind,
so how could you be a bully, right?

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,440
You're right, I'm kindhearted
and incredibly generous.

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,360
Right, it's not true at all
that you bullied Tharn.

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,680
Someone must have lied to me.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,240
It's a lie. Who told you that?

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,160
I never bully him.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
Right, white boy?

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,280
Yes, Dad.

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,840
You never bullied me at all.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,000
Who told you to call me…

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
Dad, it is.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,840
See? I'd never bully him.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,640
Yes, I believe you.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,680
I think the sun's getting hot.
Why don't we get inside?

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,440
You're right, Thanya.
Come on, let's get inside.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,840
I'll get you some drinks.
Come on, you must be tired.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,880
Thanya, I'm a big fan of your drama.

32
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,640
Your acting's excellent,
especially that scene…

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,440
Thanya.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
Your seven-year effort to win him over

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,520
can't even compete
with your sister's seven-minute attempt.

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,360
I never could've competed, anyway.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,680
My dad is really…

38
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,280
I bet Thanya is gonna be
my dad's new favorite child.

39
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,800
Look how happily they are chatting.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,160
I think so, too.

41
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,320
If I'd known your dad liked Thanya…

42
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,240
I would've took her to see him ages ago.

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
It's still not too late.

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
What are you eating?

45
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,320
This.

46
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
What the hell?

47
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,480
It's a candy.

48
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,880
Does the sweetness come
from your lips or the candy?

49
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,720
Who're you texting?

50
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,160
Here.

51
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
"Strategies for Type's Hubby" group?

52
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,040
How come there's Techno, Champ…

53
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,600
Phugun, Cirrus…

54
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,200
and Thorn's in here too!

55
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,440
And even your sister!

56
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah.

57
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
So…

58
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,920
everyone's in the group except you.

59
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,000
You went out of your way
to kick me out of the group?

60
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,400
No.

61
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
Come here.

62
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,680
It was Techno's idea.

63
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
He said he created this group
to help me propose to you.

64
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
So, how'd that work out?

65
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,440
Techno didn't help me at all.

66
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,680
Seriously, I think he…

67
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,200
just wants to hear about our lives.

68
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,480
So, he's nosy?

69
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
Here, look.

70
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,360
For me, this group…

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
is for bragging about my wife.

72
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Which is me.

73
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,040
Do you want me to add you to the group?

74
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,440
It's fine.

75
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,560
We'll let it be your personal space.

76
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,800
In case I'm being a dick and don't want
people to know about us again…

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
you'll have a place to vent.

78
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,720
If you say so.

79
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,000
In that case,
I'll continue bragging about you.

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Suit yourself.

81
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,040
Rick.

82
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,320
Come on.

83
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,680
What the hell?

84
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,960
Shoot, Rick.

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,640
A real pro doesn't brag.

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,040
Leo?

87
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,840
What are you doing here?

88
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
I can't be here?

89
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,040
No, that's not what I meant.

90
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,280
I was going to pick you up at your class.

91
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,560
The professor dismissed the class early.

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
When are you finished practice?
I'm going to the hospital.

93
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,160
Your knee hurts?

94
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,200
No.

95
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,880
It's just a scheduled checkup.

96
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,080
So, when's practice finish?

97
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,560
-I can go by myself.
-I'm done now.

98
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
What?

99
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,400
You said we were gonna
practice till 8:00 today, Leo.

100
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,080
Go sit and wait for a moment.
I'll get changed.

101
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,360
In that case, I'll wait here.

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,360
What's on your mind?

103
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,880
Don't you feel that the team
members gave us a weird look?

104
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,840
I don't care.

105
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,560
I can't stop anyone from thinking.

106
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,400
It's enough that you and I
feel the same way.

107
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,280
You could say that.

108
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,000
Leo, what if the doctor says
I can play basketball again?

109
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
I won't let you.

110
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,960
You haven't fully recovered yet.

111
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll let you play when the doctor says
your knee's completely healed.

112
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
But I'm the captain.

113
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,680
So what?

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,640
You're just the vice-captain.

115
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,160
You've got no right to boss me around.

116
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
You sure…

117
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,000
I've got no right?

118
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Actually…

119
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,120
there's another reason
I don't want you to play…

120
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,400
besides worrying about your knee.

121
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm possessive of you.

122
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
We look like boyfriends.

123
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,360
That's because we are.

124
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,000
Are you nervous, Type?

125
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
Someone like me?

126
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,480
Yeah.

127
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,920
I can't calm my mind at all.

128
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,680
Come here.

129
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
Tharn.

130
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,760
I'm glad I've got you here…

131
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,960
with me, right now.

132
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,160
Can you lend me your shoulder?

133
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
A month, Tharn.

134
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Even if I can't give my parents grandkids…

135
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,080
I can get ordained for them.

136
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,520
You know, Type…

137
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
however long it takes…

138
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,040
I can always wait for you.

139
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,440
Thank you.

140
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,920
I shouldn't, right?

141
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Right now…

142
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
this is all I can give you.

143
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,440
Right now…

144
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
this is all I want.

145
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,360
Put it down.

146
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,280
-I'll sprinkle them.
-Add more.

147
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,200
-In every tray?
-Yes.

148
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,640
Add more flowers.

149
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,560
What's up?

150
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
Do you need my help?

151
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,240
It's okay, we're almost done.

152
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
Are you his friend?

153
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,960
Arrange the lotus carefully.

154
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,480
Why are they wilted?
Don't you have fresh ones?

155
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,960
I told you to cut them in the morning.
You cut them last night, right?

156
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,640
Where is everyone?
Why aren't they helping?

157
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
Here he comes.

158
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,280
Honey, do it.

159
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
I rejoice in your merit.

160
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,320
Tharn, come here.

161
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,640
-Hello.
-Hello.

162
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,800
Let's go.

163
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
But I don't know what to do.

164
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,400
It's not hard.

165
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,360
I think this is what Type wants.

166
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Go ahead.

167
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,840
Honestly, you always turn into a child
whenever you lose confidence.

168
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,160
Go ahead.

169
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,160
Come on, hurry up! Follow me.

170
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,000
Clip his hair.

171
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,240
Honey, the scissors.

172
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,920
Go ahead, clip it and put it in there.

173
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
Go ahead, clip it.

174
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
Pray and clip.

175
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
Put it in there.

176
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,080
Come on, everyone! Get in formation.

177
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,760
Get in formation.

178
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,480
Hurry up.

179
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
You stand here, and you here.

180
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,880
Where are the trays? Coming? Okay.

181
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
-Come on, Honey! Hurry up!
-Slow down!

182
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,920
-Look, everyone's here.
-It's my first time wearing high heels!

183
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
-Let's go greet them.
-Where are you taking me!

184
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,320
Hello!

185
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,240
Hello!

186
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,520
-Jerk.
-That's it.

187
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
-Hurry up!
-Oh, my!

188
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,360
Hello!

189
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,400
Hello, everyone!

190
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,280
-Let's go.
-Why did you make me run?

191
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,160
Really!

192
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,760
-You okay?
-What do I carry?

193
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,480
-You carry this.
-Thank you, darling.

194
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,200
-I carry this.
-I'm going to be a monk's mom!

195
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
-Are you ready!
-Don't run, okay?

196
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
-Don't run.
-I won't, I'll dance.

197
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,360
Honey, ready?

198
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,840
Very much!

199
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,520
-You sound so confident.
-So, let's do a sound check.

200
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,080
No, it's you who need a check-up.

201
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,440
By the way, why are you so greedy?
You're carrying everything.

202
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,920
The pillow, the talipot fan,
the alms bowl.

203
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,520
Are you crazy?

204
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,960
Greedy.

205
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,800
Tharn, come here.

206
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,880
Come on, come closer.

207
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,920
Speak.

208
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,480
Here, the pillow.

209
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,640
Take it.

210
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,200
So…

211
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,240
Don't say a word.

212
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,040
He hasn't said anything.

213
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,640
-It's a warning.
-Is that so?

214
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,440
So, what should I do with the pillow?

215
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,520
You probably don't know the meaning
behind carrying the pillow.

216
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Listen, in the procession,

217
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,120
they say the person carrying the pillow
can be a sibling or anyone.

218
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,840
But most people think the one carrying
the pillow has to be the lover.

219
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,240
And Type has requested
that you be the one to carry it.

220
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,080
Do you understand why
his dad let you carry it?

221
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,080
He's given in. That's a harsh nudge.

222
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,640
He's finally given in. Understand now?

223
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,720
-Thank you, Mom.
-Sure.

224
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
Thank you, Dad.

225
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Like she said.

226
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,280
Honey!

227
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
The diamond chipped.

228
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,120
-Serves you right.
-Come here!

229
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,320
When do we start?

230
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,040
Over here!

231
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,200
Over here too!

232
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,840
I haven't gotten any!

233
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,560
-After seeing that bastard Type--
-Techno!

234
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,320
You can't say that, he's a monk now.
Speak politely.

235
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,400
He's a monk? Oh, man, I forgot!

236
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,960
No one heard me. I'll say it again.

237
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,800
After seeing venerable Type,
my eyes still can't get used to the sight.

238
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,920
Usually when he sees us,
he'll run straight at us

239
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,240
and slap my head. Slap! Slap! Slap!

240
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

241
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,560
But, Techno, stop badmouthing the monk.
You'll go to hell.

242
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,120
Dude, at least
I'll see a familiar face in hell.

243
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,080
-Who?
-You, of course!

244
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,960
-I won't go there with you.
-Oh, why? Come see me there?

245
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,600
Doc, you done packing up?

246
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,000
Doc, you okay? Are you tired?
Do you feel hot?

247
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm fine, it's not that hot.

248
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Doc, excuse me. It is that hot.

249
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,400
Check the weather app on your phone.

250
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,120
Man, it's so hot that if you put
a frying pan on the ground,

251
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,360
and some stir-fry rice in it,
the rice would get cooked.

252
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,120
Ready to eat, tasty, fill you right up.

253
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,240
-You're exaggerating.
-Really?

254
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,880
It's so hot, I can't take it.
Look at my sweat.

255
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Eat this. You'll feel refreshed.

256
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,600
Okay.

257
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,400
What now?

258
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,400
Wear this,
it'll protect you from the heat.

259
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,560
Thank you.

260
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,800
Excuse me, my friends.
This is a temple, not your home.

261
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,480
Be mindful of where you are.

262
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,440
You're at a temple. Take it easy, will ya?

263
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,120
Damn, putting on hats for each other.

264
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,880
Oh, my God, what a sinner.

265
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
-So disrespectful--
-Techno.

266
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,640
What are you talking about?

267
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,440
Just wear it, Doc. Don't listen to him.

268
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,200
You usually work indoors.
You might faint from weather like this.

269
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,400
So caring. So lovey-dovey.

270
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
I wish you a long-lasting love.

271
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,480
Doc…

272
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
we're at an ordination ceremony, right?

273
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,520
Have you ever heard the saying,

274
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,520
"Get ordained before you get laid"?

275
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,840
Even if you're lovers, you've got to wait.
You know that, right?

276
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
However…

277
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,600
if you become my friend's boyfriend now…

278
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,080
he's more than ready.

279
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,720
You don't have to wait at all.

280
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,440
Why is that?

281
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,720
-Say it.
-Because I've been ordained.

282
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,640
Now I'm ready to get laid.

283
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,760
I mean, ready to marry.

284
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,920
If you date me now…

285
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,080
I'm ready to marry you.

286
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,040
My heart's all stirred up.

287
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,840
You even made me blush.

288
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
So romantic.

289
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,440
Champ, I'm so proud of you.

290
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,520
You've finally made progress with this.
Good job!

291
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,120
What? It's just a joke among friends.

292
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,120
Right?

293
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,880
-Friends?
-Yeah.

294
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,720
Don't say such hurtful words out loud.

295
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,360
Friends? Unbelievable.

296
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,000
Cheer up, Doc.

297
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,400
It's not easy to be you.

298
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,840
Hang in there.

299
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,960
It's not that hard, Techno.

300
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,160
You're smiling.

301
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,040
Seems like you enjoy it.

302
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,600
You're really something, Doc.

303
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,480
{\an8}STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

304
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,040
{\an8}HEY. ANYONE KNOW HOW THE MONK'S DOING?

305
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,960
{\an8}IN WHAT WAY?

306
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,440
{\an8}HIS MONASTIC LIFE.
HE'S BEEN ORDAINED ALMOST A WEEK NOW.

307
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,960
{\an8}THEN, YOU SHOULD ASK THARN.

308
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,760
{\an8}HE'S PROBABLY TOO BUSY TO READ.

309
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,240
{\an8}REALLY, WHY?

310
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,920
{\an8}I THINK HE'S PREPARING.

311
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,200
{\an8}PREPARING WHAT?

312
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,320
Tharn, you just got back?

313
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,440
Yeah.

314
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,240
Came to get some stuff.
I'll be staying with my parents.

315
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Why?

316
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,480
It's closer to the airport.

317
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,640
Are you flying to see Type?

318
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Yeah.

319
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,320
I said I'd wait,

320
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
but that doesn't mean…

321
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,280
I can't go see him.

322
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,360
While I'm gone, watch the room for me.

323
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,040
Roger, I promise I will do my best.

324
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,560
Very good.

325
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,440
-Tharn's really amazing, isn't he?
-Yeah.

326
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,400
If it were me,
I wouldn't be able to stand it either…

327
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,600
if I had to be apart from you
for this long.

328
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
Nonsense.

329
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
Wait for me.

330
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,560
-Don't be impatient, he'll come.
-We'll be late.

331
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,640
-Hello, Dad. Hello, Mom.
-Hello.

332
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,720
Why do you keep coming here?

333
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,320
I'm so sick of you.

334
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,600
It's normal for old men to act tough.

335
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,680
In fact, he's been waiting for you
since before the rooster even crowed.

336
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,760
Honey, don't tell him.

337
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,760
You're making me look bad.

338
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,160
What are you smiling for?

339
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,320
How long are you going to stand there?

340
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
We'll be late for the monk's meal time.

341
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,520
Thank you, Dad.

342
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,920
Hurry up!

343
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,200
-Go, take this with you too.
-Okay.

344
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,280
This one too.

345
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,600
Move on your knees.

346
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
Like this, look. Follow my lead.

347
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,360
Put it down.

348
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,120
And mind your manners.

349
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,800
Pay respect to the monk.
Come on, move back.

350
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,280
Put your palms in front of your chest
and do the <i>Benjangkapradit</i> prostration.

351
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,280
-Do you know how?
-Yes.

352
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,520
You spread out your fingers like a map.

353
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,880
Okay, first prostration.

354
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,000
Bend down.

355
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,840
Keep your elbows and knees aligned.

356
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,920
Rise.

357
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,320
Second prostration.

358
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,160
Third prostration.

359
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
Go on, make an offering.

360
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,920
Hand it to the monk.

361
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,280
Hand it to the monk,
don't just put it down.

362
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,520
Sit with your legs to the side.

363
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,640
Receive the blessing.

364
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,960
May you receive longevity, beauty,
happiness, and strength.

365
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,440
<i>Sadhu.</i>

366
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,000
<i>Sadhu.</i>

367
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,960
All done.

368
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,240
Thank you, Dad.

369
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,200
No problem.

370
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,760
-Just remember the steps.
-Yes.

371
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,360
Let's take our leave.

372
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,600
You don't have to come every week.

373
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,600
Please don't say that.

374
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,240
I wanted to come.

375
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,040
Therefore…

376
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,320
please don't stop me.

377
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
You're really stubborn.

378
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,840
Doc, have you been waiting long?

379
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,440
We had so many customers at lunchtime.

380
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,320
It's okay.

381
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,400
Actually,
you didn't have to come yourself.

382
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,280
-Just let your employee make the delivery.
-I can't, you're my important customer.

383
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,000
Tharn, Type, Techno, and you
are all my important customers.

384
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Tharn ordered food from my restaurant too.

385
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,280
But he told me to deliver it
at 5:00 in the morning.

386
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,640
But I know he was gonna
give it to the monk.

387
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,240
If he wasn't my friend, I wouldn't do it.

388
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,960
By the way, I kinda respect him.

389
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,640
He goes there on Saturday.
Returns on Sunday.

390
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,480
He even told me he'd go every week.

391
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,880
Love clearly makes people blind.

392
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,760
Being single is so much better.

393
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
Don't you think?

394
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,520
Doc?

395
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,680
Sometimes…

396
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,640
I hate you.

397
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,120
Doc!

398
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,960
Doc, why did you say that?

399
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
What did I do to upset you?

400
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,080
No.

401
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
You've done nothing wrong.

402
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,320
-Then, why'd you--
-Because you've never done anything.

403
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,920
You don't know.

404
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,160
You don't get it.

405
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Even when I clearly express myself.

406
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,520
What are you talking about?

407
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,880
I like you.

408
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
What did you say?

409
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,160
I like you.

410
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,600
I've liked you since freshman year.

411
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,440
I've liked you all these seven years.

412
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,960
I--

413
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,960
I never knew.

414
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,400
You didn't know.

415
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,440
Because you've never
been interested in me.

416
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,560
I know…

417
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,520
that it's hopeless.

418
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,960
All I can do is dream.

419
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,480
It's a pipe dream.

420
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,760
I want nothing from you.

421
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,400
You don't have to give me an answer.

422
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,880
But from now on…

423
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,520
we have no reason
to see each other anymore.

424
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,800
Doc!

425
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm fine.

426
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,200
I'm okay.

427
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,920
It's good enough…

428
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,880
that I got to confess.

429
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,440
Thank you…

430
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,840
for making this heart…

431
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,480
happy for many years.

432
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,720
Goodbye.

433
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,360
What are you doing?

434
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,640
I don't know what love is.

435
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,480
I don't even understand it.

436
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,160
But when you said goodbye to me…

437
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,320
I felt so terrible.

438
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,720
Don't say goodbye to me again.

439
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,360
But you don't like me.

440
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,160
I don't know.

441
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,360
But I won't let things between you and me…

442
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,120
end like this.

443
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,040
Just a little longer, Tharn.

444
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
You're going this week too?

445
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,200
Yeah.

446
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,520
Don't stop me, Thorn.

447
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,280
When you're completely exhausted?

448
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,640
It's my happiness.

449
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,360
Besides, the venerable Type
will leave the monkhood next week.

450
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,840
Have you prepared
the offerings for this week?

451
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,400
Mom prepared them for me.

452
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,440
I clocked out early,
so I came to get them myself.

453
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,280
You may not need them anymore.

454
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,560
Good luck, bro.

455
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,760
Type?

456
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,080
You're back?

457
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,120
What's the matter?

458
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,480
You're back!

459
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,440
You're really back, right?

460
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,960
Yeah.

461
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,520
I'm back.

462
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,960
Who did you mistake me for?

463
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,040
You came back to me, Type.

464
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,360
You came back to me.

465
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,400
Thank you…

466
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,880
for waiting for me.

467
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,160
Yeah.

468
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,160
Type, you're going to sleep like this?

469
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,160
Yeah.

470
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,400
Come here.

471
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,280
Tharn.

472
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,080
You bought a new TV?

473
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,400
Thanya bought it the other day.

474
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,960
And the lamp…

475
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,560
you moved it?

476
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,840
I didn't. It's in the same place.

477
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,640
And…

478
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,360
have you seen my black watch?

479
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,040
I couldn't find it.

480
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,240
Type,

481
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:29,360
if you're embarrassed, I'll talk to you
until you get over it, okay?

482
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,360
I--

483
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,400
To be honest…

484
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,160
I feel awkward.

485
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,720
I'm still not used to it.

486
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,560
I don't know how I should act.

487
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,600
Then…

488
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,240
do you want me to stop?

489
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,480
No.

490
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,240
Don't stop.

491
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,280
Type…

492
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
you want a drink?

493
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,960
I'll get it for you.

494
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,000
Tharn…

495
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,200
Shall we make a vow?

496
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,320
I told my parents…

497
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,240
that I might live in Bangkok for good…

498
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,400
because…

499
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,800
you live here.

500
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,160
They understood.

501
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:06,920
And told me…

502
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,440
to follow my heart.

503
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,360
That's why I've chosen to do this.

504
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,240
Because my heart…

505
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:19,920
is here…

506
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,120
with you.

507
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,280
Are you…

508
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,160
telling me…

509
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,480
Yeah.

510
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,480
Let's get married.

511
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,880
Are you serious?

512
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,720
I--

513
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,800
Thiwat Phawattakul…

514
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,400
hereby swear…

515
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,880
to have and to hold…

516
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,080
Thara Khirikun…

517
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,320
for better…

518
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,120
or for worse…

519
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,240
for richer…

520
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,640
or for poorer.

521
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,200
I will be by your side forever.

522
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,760
I--

523
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,120
Thara Khirikun…

524
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,720
hereby swear…

525
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,720
to have and to hold…

526
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,640
Thiwat Phawattakul…

527
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,120
for better…

528
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,240
or for worse…

529
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,280
for richer…

530
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,360
or for poorer.

531
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,000
You will have me by your side forever.

532
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,880
You and I…

533
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,680
let's be together.

534
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,000
Okay.

535
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Forever?

536
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,000
Forever.

537
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,280
Doc!

538
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,560
Thorn.

539
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,880
You're about to have your own family now.

540
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,120
From now on, you must be her pillar.

541
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,840
Yes.

542
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,480
You look handsome.

543
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,640
Remember the first day
you wanted her to be your bride.

544
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,160
Whatever happens,
I want you to think back to that day.

545
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,000
Got it, son?

546
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,200
I'll try to have a family
like the one you guys have.

547
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:19,720
Can you really compete with me?

548
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,440
Of course, he can.

549
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,080
-We should let him get ready.
-Okay.

550
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,560
Thank you, see you out there.

551
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,720
How do I look? Good?

552
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,720
Let me see, turn around.

553
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,400
The suit's pretty neat.

554
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,760
So is the bow tie.

555
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,120
But your face--

556
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,280
Don't worry, you look great.

557
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,640
I'm not confident at all.

558
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,440
Thorn…

559
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,440
you've been saying that for days.
Believe in yourself.

560
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,000
When it's your turn, you'll feel the same.

561
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,000
Seriously, if you weren't my big brother…

562
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,600
I would've gotten married before you.

563
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,560
Good luck, Thorn.

564
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,120
You too, bro.

565
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,800
You still nervous?

566
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,400
Relax.

567
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,320
I'll stay by your side.

568
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Thanks so much.

569
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,200
What's wrong?

570
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,200
I feel sad.

571
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,280
My brother's getting married before me.

572
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,040
But Thorn proposed before you did.

573
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,920
But you and I…

574
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,120
loved each other long before them.

575
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,080
I miss your beanie.

576
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,440
Don't tease me.

577
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,280
Because you wore it for months back then.

578
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:08,160
Don't know why you were so embarrassed.
You looked adorable.

579
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:11,720
Then, who was the crybaby…

580
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,200
who got surprised by me
and yelped like a dog?

581
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,400
But, who said that Gil had a crush on me?

582
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,480
Who would've believed
he was using your face to attract women?

583
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,560
Our wedding…

584
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,560
Don't make it this grand, okay?

585
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,400
I don't know about that.

586
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,040
Tharn.

587
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,920
Fine…

588
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,200
do whatever you want.

589
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,000
What can I do about it?
I already said yes.

590
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,000
And you already promised…

591
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,080
to be with me for the rest of our lives.

592
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,320
Yeah.

593
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:31,080
Toss the bouquet!

594
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,120
I love you.

595
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,360
I love you too.

596
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,880
<i>And this is the love story</i>
<i>of me and Tharn.</i>

597
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,120
<i>From the man I couldn't stand…</i>

598
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,440
<i>to the one…</i>

599
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,200
<i>I love with all my heart.</i>

600
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,600
{\an8}STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

601
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,640
{\an8}THARN, HOW ARE
YOUR WEDDING PREPARATIONS GOING?

602
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,200
{\an8}STILL STICKING YOUR NOSE
INTO THEIR BUSINESS, HUH?

603
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,200
{\an8}I'M NOT LIKE YOU, ALWAYS WITH KHUNPOL.

604
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,880
{\an8}THEN SPEND YOUR TIME
DOING SOMETHING ELSE, TECHNO.

605
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:12,600
{\an8}CALLING ME NOSY IS LESS HURTFUL THAN THIS.

606
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,000
{\an8}I REALLY WANNA KNOW, THARN.

607
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,080
{\an8}SHIT!

608
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,640
{\an8}TECHNO, ARE YOU READY TO DIE?

609
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,720
{\an8}YOU DARED KICK ME OUT OF THE GROUP!

610
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,480
{\an8}SEEMS LIKE…

611
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,200
{\an8}I GOTTA RUN.
