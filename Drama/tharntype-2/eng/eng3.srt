1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,800
I'll never agree to surgery
even if you doctors say I should.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,680
I won't take risks.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,680
I'll do physical therapy
and take medicine, but no surgery.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,000
And I must be able
to play basketball again.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,600
Here's the thing, sir.
Surgery is not scary at all.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,360
In your case,
it will be arthroscopic surgery.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,640
Small wounds and a quick recovery.
It'll be even more effective

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,840
if you do physical therapy afterwards.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,880
Can you guarantee that my knee will be
the same after if I have the surgery?

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Sir, getting the surgery
is better than not getting it.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,840
Because if you decide against it,

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
your torn ligament
might not heal properly.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,520
Most importantly,
you might not be able to jump again.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,320
Don't try to persuade me.

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,400
Those doctors couldn't even convince me.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,120
So why would I agree to it now?

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,080
I'm here to heal my knee
with physical therapy.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,400
And you've just got to do your job!

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay, if that's your decision.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,840
You called me, Teng?

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,520
As I told you,
I will be your physical therapist.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,400
And this is Mr. Thiwat,
a sports medicine doctor

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,720
who will monitor your physical condition.

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,320
You can call me Type.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,920
A sports medicine doctor
performs physical examinations

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
and develops exercise programs--

27
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,480
I don't wanna know
what a sports medicine doctor is.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,120
What I wanna know is when
I'll be able to play basketball again.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,280
But in your case, if you receive
both surgery and physical therapy--

30
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,560
I said I don't want surgery!
Are you people dense?

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,560
I won't change my mind,
no matter what you say.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,120
Can you guarantee that I can play
basketball again if I have the surgery?

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,880
You're aware refusing surgery would
lead to osteoarthritis and disability?

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,680
Type!

35
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,760
If that happens, so be it.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,680
I don't care what happens to me
in the future.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,040
But I must be able to play basketball.

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm the team captain.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,840
Another match is coming up soon,
and I'm not gonna miss it.

40
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,080
I've got to win for my team.

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,440
Here's the thing.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Doing physical therapy
requires quite some time.

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,040
It will cause long-term damage
if it's rushed.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,760
Are you dense?

45
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,840
I told you I don't care
what happens in the future.

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,800
I must be able to play basketball!

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
Don't you get it?

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,280
You rotten punk.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
When is your next match?

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,680
In a month and a half.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,160
Do whatever you can
to let me play basketball again.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,800
Can you do it?

53
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,960
Let's give it a shot, shall we?

54
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,080
What's with kids these days?
That rotten punk and his picky attitude.

55
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,640
Reconnecting a torn ACL
in a month and a half? Is he crazy?

56
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
Who could do that?
Does he think we're miracle workers?

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,400
This isn't jigsaw pieces
we're talking about.

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
Calm down, Teng.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,680
How can I calm down
after he argued nonstop?

60
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,200
And you, Type,
how could you tell him that?

61
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,800
He'll never be able to recover
in a month and a half.

62
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,640
With his good looks and body,
it's a shame he has such a nasty attitude.

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
-Good looks, but an annoying attitude?
-Yeah, I just wanna kick--

64
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,040
Are you crazy?

65
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm never going to kick a patient
no matter how annoyed I am.

66
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,920
I'm so angry just talking about it.

67
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
It's not that I'm not upset,
but I feel for the kid.

68
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,880
He's just scared.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Did you take the wrong medicine
this morning?

70
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
I should be asking you that.

72
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,160
You have a very short fuse,
but you acted like a saint today.

73
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,720
Or do you like that kid?

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,560
Actually, he's kinda my type too.

75
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,480
Young, handsome, athletic, crunchy firm.

76
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,120
He's a man, not crispy pork.
How's he crunchy?

77
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,360
And I don't like that kid.

78
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,240
Actually, I really wanted
to knock him upside the head.

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,280
But he's a patient.
It's our job to help him.

80
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
You're right.

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
He's pitiful.

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Besides, he's like me when I was young.

83
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Really?

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,280
What were you like? Bad boy? What?
Tell me. What were you like?

85
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,120
Forget about it. Let's get back to work.
Someone's been keeping tabs on us.

86
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Come on, tell me. Don't leave me hanging.

87
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,840
You were a bad boy, right? Right?

88
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Fiat, pass me the ball.

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Rick.

90
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Is Fiat really okay?

91
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,400
Does he look okay to you?

92
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,360
Don't know if anyone can handle him
till Leo returns at the end of the month.

93
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,880
So, why didn't Fiat join the camp
with Leo in Italy?

94
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,520
They're literally inseparable.

95
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,600
I heard his parents wouldn't let him go.

96
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,160
Just between you and me,

97
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
when Fiat was young,

98
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,840
he ran away from home
to get on his dad's nerves.

99
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,920
Since then, he's only allowed
to go as far as Leo's house.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't tell anyone.

101
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
Fiat doesn't think much of it.

102
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,800
But if Leo finds out
you tease Fiat about it,

103
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,200
he'll kill you.

104
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,640
Leo is so scary.
Who would dare mess with him?

105
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,600
But I'm kinda worried about Fiat.

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
Leo is away, and now his knee is injured.

107
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,040
I know. Wouldn't Leo return
as soon as he found out about this?

108
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,280
Whatever. Right now,
worry about yourself first.

109
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,720
Go practice. Go!

110
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
-Me?
-Yeah!

111
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,560
-Go.
-Okay.

112
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Going to bed already?

113
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,200
-I can go work outside if you want.
-It's okay. Stay here.

114
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
I can sleep.

115
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,680
Type.

116
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,960
Do you remember

117
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,560
what day it is tomorrow?

118
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,560
What day is it?

119
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,560
I remember.

120
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
I remember.

121
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Not working anymore?

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,560
I can do it tomorrow.

123
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,760
You should sleep.

124
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,120
And stop thinking about
whatever nonsense is in your head.

125
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,520
I…

126
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
can't stop thinking.

127
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,880
Tharn.

128
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,160
-I told you--
-Because in my head…

129
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,680
there's only you, Type.

130
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
I can't stop thinking about you.

131
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Smiling like that--

132
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,080
Are you embarrassed?

133
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,320
What are you talking about?

134
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,160
Embarrassed?

135
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,160
-I'm not embarrassed.
-Right?

136
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm not.

137
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Man up, Khun.

138
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
It's been seven years.

139
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,920
Here I go.

140
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,400
{\an8}HELLO, CHAMP. THIS IS KHUN.

141
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,200
{\an8}Why am I introducing myself?

142
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
{\an8}Champ knows who I am.

143
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,760
{\an8}HI THERE, CHAMP. HOW ARE YOU?

144
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,280
{\an8}Bad idea.

145
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,280
{\an8}Let's try again. Not good enough.

146
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,520
{\an8}DO YOU HAVE SOME FREE TIME, CHAMP?

147
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,200
{\an8}I sound like a pyramid scheme recruiter.

148
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,800
{\an8}What do I do?

149
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,880
I can't.

150
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,040
I can't.

151
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,840
{\an8}Or…

152
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,600
{\an8}ARE YOU FREE, CHAMP? I FOUND A GOOD
RESTAURANT. LET'S GRAB A MEAL.

153
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,920
{\an8}Is that too direct?

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,680
{\an8}Too direct. Better delete it.

155
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,160
{\an8}Delete. I should--

156
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,200
{\an8}OKAY.

157
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,040
{\an8}Really?

158
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,320
{\an8}Yes!

159
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,880
What an amazing dish, Doc!

160
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,520
If you're gonna buy us such nice meals,
you should invite us more often.

161
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm so ready. I'm telling you, dude!

162
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,800
Wait a sec.

163
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,160
What's the occasion for this meal?

164
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,520
Our reunion's not for a while, right?

165
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,400
Yes, that's right.

166
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,120
-But--
-Let's just say I'm happy that--

167
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,720
Techno could make it today.

168
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,840
Try this, Doc.

169
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,520
The other side.

170
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,760
You're still a messy eater.

171
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,840
Look at you, Doc!

172
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,320
Let's eat.

173
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,000
His shyness really gets on my nerves.

174
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,600
You're cuter in real life
than in your photos.

175
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm so happy you could come meet me today.

176
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,840
I live around here.

177
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,880
Are you in a bad mood?

178
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,520
Or you don't wanna see me?

179
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,040
You can leave. I don't mind.

180
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,440
No, it's just--

181
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,040
I'm tired of my family and college.

182
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,600
Everyone's so demanding.

183
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
Nobody listens to me.

184
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,600
If there's something on your mind,
you can always talk to me.

185
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm always here for you.

186
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,800
And if you wanna do something fun,

187
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,200
or something private, just the two of us…

188
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,480
As long as you can save me
from this boredom.

189
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
Have a safe trip home.

190
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,080
Bye.

191
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
Is there much left, Type?

192
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,240
Wouldn't have been
if someone hadn't give me more cases.

193
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,400
Dr. Thiti?

194
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,760
Do you need my help?

195
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,400
It's okay.
You've got to go meet your mom, right?

196
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
I'm almost finished anyway.

197
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,040
Sure you can handle it?

198
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Who do you think I am?

199
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,320
Okay, Mr. Expert. Then please excuse me.

200
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,960
-I'm leaving!
-Okay.

201
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
-Hang in there.
-Bye, see you later.

202
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,080
Hello.

203
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,920
<i>Type, where are you?</i>

204
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,400
At work, of course.

205
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,600
<i>Don't tell me you forgot?</i>

206
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
<i>I reminded you last night.</i>

207
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
You mean about Thorn proposing to Am?

208
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,520
<i>Yes, are you coming?</i>

209
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,680
I've got to submit my work
tomorrow morning.

210
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,640
Tharn--

211
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm sorry.

212
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,120
I don't think I can make it.

213
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,560
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

214
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,240
<i>When will you be finished?</i>
<i>Want me to pick you up?</i>

215
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's okay.

216
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,840
I don't know
what time I'm gonna be finished.

217
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
Give Thorn my best.

218
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,040
<i>Okay.</i>

219
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,760
Tharn, are you ready?
Thorn said he's almost here.

220
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,040
Of course, Princess.

221
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,760
For our brother, right?

222
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,240
That's right. Now Thorn will finally
stop being possessive of me.

223
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
Let's go.

224
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,440
This way, please.

225
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,200
What's with the special treatment today?
What's going on?

226
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,600
Nothing. What could be going on?

227
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,280
I just want to treat my girlfriend
to dinner.

228
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,800
Normally, you take me to dinner
at some famous place in Yaowarat.

229
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,160
Or we get some insanely spicy Thai food.

230
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,640
Can you remember the last time
we were in such a fine establishment?

231
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,240
Come on, I just wanted to have dinner
with my girlfriend.

232
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,240
Are you sure you're not trying
to make up for something you did.

233
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,200
Is that really how you think of me?

234
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,800
Just kidding.

235
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,480
If you're guilty of anything,
it would be following Thanya around.

236
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,160
She's all grown up,

237
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,440
but you still
follow her around everywhere.

238
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,960
Thanya is still a kid.

239
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,440
How could I not worry about her?

240
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't know who'll chase after her
when she's on movie sets.

241
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,120
I was against Thanya acting,
but Mom wouldn't listen to me.

242
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,000
If I hadn't gone to England
to get my master's degree,

243
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
I would've never let her act.

244
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,200
But you would've never met me either.

245
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
Okay, I'll allow her to continue acting.

246
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,560
But--

247
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,680
But I'll still follow her around anyway.

248
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,160
Come on, possessive big brother.

249
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,920
Let me see how special
this special dinner is going to be.

250
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,600
Our table's the only one
in the whole restaurant?

251
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,240
You're right. I'm surprised too.

252
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,440
Thorn, my mother just returned from Korea.
I'm planning on visiting her this week.

253
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,680
Are Uncle and Auntie free?

254
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,440
When will you start
calling my parents Dad and Mom?

255
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,960
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

256
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,560
So, are your parents free?

257
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,640
I'll ask them.

258
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,440
Am, look over there.

259
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,560
It's Thanya's interview.

260
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,720
<i>Thanya, tell us about</i>
<i>the drama you're shooting.</i>

261
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,280
<i>The story is very sweet.</i>

262
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,560
<i>I fell in love with it</i>
<i>the moment I read the script.</i>

263
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,800
<i>Both the male and female leads</i>
<i>are very sweet.</i>

264
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,960
So, it has a sweet male lead.
Do you have your own male lead?

265
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,320
Of course.

266
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,360
Who's the guy that's captured the heart
of the nation's sweetheart?

267
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,080
For me,
there are two male leads in my life.

268
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,320
One of them is very attached to me.

269
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,280
<i>I think it's time for him</i>
<i>to have his own female lead.</i>

270
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,280
And there's only one woman
that I approve of.

271
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,280
<i>She's the one who's always by his side.</i>

272
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,000
<i>The one who doesn't turn her back on him,</i>

273
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
even when Thorn becomes intrusive
and possessive of me.

274
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
That's why, this time, I yield to her.

275
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,280
Am, turn around
and you'll see the man I'm talking about.

276
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,360
Before I give you my answer,
you must answer something for me first.

277
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
In your life, Auntie is your number one.

278
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
Thanya is your number two.

279
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,240
Therefore, Thorn, you must promise me

280
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:25,000
that I will be your one
and only number three forever.

281
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
Then, I'll give my answer.

282
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:35,080
You won't mind
being my number three forever?

283
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,560
I've known since the day
we started dating.

284
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Let's get married.

285
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,040
Look, I'm getting married!

286
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,640
CONGRATS, BRO.

287
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,480
Congratulations, Thorn.

288
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
Tharn.

289
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,760
When did you get back?

290
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,480
Have you eaten yet?
Want me to reheat something?

291
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,400
What's

292
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
the matter?

293
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,440
Tharn, don't think too much.

294
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,840
I know what you're thinking.

295
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
You and I

296
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,800
are happy being together like this,
don't you think?

297
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,600
It's just a wedding.

298
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
Yeah.

299
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,080
I think so too.

300
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,800
Are you working?

301
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,680
Want me to get up?

302
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,320
It's okay, just sit here. Come here.

303
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,000
Hello, police?

304
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,280
Bro, hold your horses!

305
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,480
I know the people who live here.

306
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,960
There's a suspicious man
in front of my cousin's room.

307
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,200
Bro!

308
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm not suspicious!

309
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,240
-This is bad, Mr. Police. He's a thief.
-Hold on, bro.

310
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,160
Listen, bro, I really do know them.

311
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,080
I'm just kidding.

312
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,360
Do you remember me?
I was there the other day too.

313
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,200
Tharn told me
that you're his senior from school.

314
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,160
-Man, you scared me.
-Just kidding.

315
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,280
Don't do it again, okay?

316
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,880
What are you doing?

317
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,360
Get away from my boyfriend.

318
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,120
Me--

319
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,960
Me?

320
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,760
Better go back to my room. What the hell?

321
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,880
Hey, what's up?

322
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,480
<i>What do you mean, "What's up?"</i>

323
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,840
<i>When are you coming back?</i>
<i>Fiat's gone nuts.</i>

324
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,760
He's always been a nutcase.

325
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,240
<i>Yeah, but he's crazier than before.</i>

326
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,280
<i>I don't mind him lashing out at me.</i>

327
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,120
<i>But he's so eager to play</i>
<i>while his knee's still hurt.</i>

328
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,440
<i>What would he do</i>
<i>if his knee gets messed up?</i>

329
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,160
What did you say? His knee's hurt?

330
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,880
<i>Yeah!</i>

331
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,440
<i>You didn't hear</i>
<i>about how he fell and was hospitalized?</i>

332
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,040
No.

333
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,400
I didn't know. He didn't tell me.

334
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,680
<i>How's that possible?</i>
<i>You guys are so close.</i>

335
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,320
<i>Anyway, whatever.</i>
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

336
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,760
<i>Come knock some sense into him.</i>
<i>He's totally out of control.</i>

337
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,360
<i>Hello?</i>

338
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,680
<i>Leo?</i>

339
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,560
<i>Are you listening?</i>

340
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,680
<i>-Hello?</i>
-I gotta go.

341
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,600
Hello, I need a plane ticket.

342
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm going back to Thailand. Now.

343
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,400
You okay, kid?

344
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,080
What kid are you talkin' about?

345
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
Don't touch me!

346
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,680
I'm hurting like this
because of your colleague.

347
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,440
Damn it.

348
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,720
Physical therapy, my ass.

349
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,120
It's supposed to help me get better.

350
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,440
But it hurts like hell.

351
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I think you're just messing with me.

352
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
Kid, watch what you say.

353
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,640
No one's messing with you.

354
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
You're all on the same side.

355
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,800
Once you get the money,
you don't care anymore.

356
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
Nobody cares how I feel.

357
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,400
Kid, watch what you say.

358
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,720
Why do I have to be careful around you?

359
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,720
Am I wrong? Don't you work for money?

360
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,600
No one cares what I think.

361
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
The pain's freaking killing me.

362
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
Whatever. I'll just play like this.

363
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,520
You wanna wreck your knee that badly?

364
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,520
I don't care if it's wrecked.

365
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Since I'm worthless anyway.

366
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Fine.

367
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,160
Then, go wreck it.

368
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,280
And don't come crying to me.

369
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,480
Go ahead.

370
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,240
Your life, your knee.

371
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,320
I won't try to stop you anymore.

372
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,400
But why would anyone worry about you
when you don't even love yourself?

373
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,040
I don't know what you've been through.

374
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,120
But before you do anything,
you must think of your knee and yourself.

375
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,120
I will help you play basketball again.

376
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,800
But you must follow my program.

377
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,840
And attend every PT session with Teng.

378
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Okay?

379
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,880
Careful.

380
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,160
You okay?

381
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,400
Hey, better now?

382
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
You mean my knee or my mood?

383
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,280
Judging from your sharp tongue,
I guess you're feeling better.

384
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,520
Are you sure you've followed
Teng's every instruction?

385
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,600
I--

386
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,880
I jumped.

387
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,320
Come on.

388
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,640
I'm scared I won't be
able to play basketball.

389
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,640
I was just thinking about it,
and my legs moved on their own.

390
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,400
And now you're hurt.

391
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,680
Let me see.

392
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,800
You okay?

393
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,800
Type.

394
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,720
Can I have your Line ID?

395
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,320
Come on, Type.

396
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,680
That way, I'll have someone to consult
when I don't know what to do.

397
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,520
If that's how you feel,
listen to what people say from now on.

398
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,360
Don't be hardheaded
and demand immediate results.

399
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,360
No one can do that.

400
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,080
Okay.

401
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,400
Sure you're okay?

402
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,560
Yes.

403
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,520
HELLO, TYPE.

404
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,120
Why didn't you tell me?

405
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,880
Tell you what?

406
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,960
About your knee.

407
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,960
I just hurt my knee.

408
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,440
Besides, you were having fun there,
so why would I tell you?

409
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,120
Talk to me.

410
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,840
You've been making a fuss
since you got here.

411
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,280
Or are you sulking
that I didn't ask you about your trip?

412
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,400
Then--

413
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,400
How are you?

414
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,120
Are you tired from your flight?

415
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,440
Let me give you a hug!

416
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,600
Don't piss me off.

417
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm not trying to piss you off.

418
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,040
I should be asking, why did you come back?

419
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,440
Thought you'd be back
at the end of the month.

420
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,280
Then why did you do this?

421
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,640
You never contacted me.

422
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,440
So, how could I tell you?

423
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:15,680
But you know that one word from you
and I'd come back right away.

424
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,920
And why would I tell you?

425
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,560
Or…

426
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,320
do you have feelings for me?

427
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,120
Fiat.

428
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,040
Don't use that tone with me.

429
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,320
I'm not your underling,
and I'm not afraid of you.

430
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm not trying to scare you.

431
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,680
I'm worried.

432
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Because you're my friend.

433
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,840
But if my coming back upsets you,

434
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,480
or gets in the way of you fooling around,

435
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,200
then I'm sorry for coming back.

436
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,280
SIAM PARAGON

437
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,040
I bought cakes from your favorite shop.

438
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,320
I'll swing by to give them to you.

439
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,880
Okay, Princess. I'll hurry over.

440
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,520
Good afternoon. May I help you?

441
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,800
Yes.

442
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,360
-Can I take a look at these two rings?
-Yes, just a moment please.

443
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,760
Let me take them out. Here.

444
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,360
-Can I take a picture?
-Yes, feel free.

445
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,080
{\an8}WHEN WILL YOUR FRIEND SAY YES?

446
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:49,040
{\an8}DAMN, SHOWING OFF THE RINGS?

447
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,360
{\an8}WHICH MALL ARE YOU AT? I'M AT A MALL TOO.

448
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,040
Mr. Tharn! It's really you.

449
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,400
I'm Nana, remember me?
I'm Mr. Thorn's secretary.

450
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,520
Yes, I remember.

451
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,680
What a coincidence.
What are you doing here?

452
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,800
Who are you going to buy the ring for?

453
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,480
My partner.

454
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,720
I'm thinking about buying them one.

455
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,360
Mr. Tharn, the whole company
knows you're single.

456
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,280
It's for your mother or Thanya, right?

457
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,240
No, this ring really is for my partner.

458
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:36,000
Then do you need my help?

459
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,600
Shit, Tharn's cheating on Type!

460
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,480
I'm sorry.

461
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,960
I didn't mean to piss you off.

462
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,160
I was just--

463
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,200
Weren't you the one who told me
that you'd been dying to join this camp?

464
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,360
So, how could I tell you
that I hurt my knee?

465
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
You could have.

466
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,720
So that you would hurry back…

467
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,280
when that damn camp
was so important to you?

468
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,040
How could I have done that?

469
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:18,000
And do you know how angry I was
to find out about you from someone else?

470
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
I know you were worried.

471
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,800
You were worried about me, right?

472
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,440
Yeah.

473
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,880
But I also know what you felt
when you hurt your knee.

474
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:45,800
What do you mean?

475
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,040
You were scared
you couldn't play basketball anymore.

476
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,840
I'm sorry.

477
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,720
Please forgive me.

478
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,760
Have I ever gotten mad at you?

479
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,000
If I don't forgive you,

480
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,640
you'll continue whining.

481
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,520
Does this mean

482
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,280
you've forgiven me?

483
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,240
Behave yourself from now on.

484
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,080
So I won't have to get mad at you.

485
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,400
Leo.

486
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,520
What if my knee can't be healed?

487
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,680
What if I can't play basketball again?

488
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm scared.

489
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,240
I know.

490
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,560
That's why I came back.

491
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,520
I'm back by your side now.

492
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,440
Yeah.

493
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,600
You're so late.

494
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,120
I threw so many tantrums.

495
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,640
If you hadn't hurried back
to be my emotional dump truck,

496
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,720
I'd have made the whole team suffer.

497
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,880
I'd take it out on everyone
and force them to practice to death.

498
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,640
That's why I came back.

499
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,640
I'm back.

500
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,200
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

501
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,720
{\an8}WHEN WILL YOUR FRIEND SAY YES?

502
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,040
{\an8}DAMN, SHOWING OFF THE RINGS?

503
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,240
{\an8}WHICH MALL ARE YOU AT? I'M AT A MALL TOO.

504
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,440
{\an8}WHICH MALL? YOU HAVING LUNCH THERE?
COUNT ME IN.

505
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,640
{\an8}SHIT, THARN'S CHEATING!

506
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,080
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

507
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,000
{\an8}TECHNO.

508
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,880
{\an8}TECHNO!

509
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,960
{\an8}TYPE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS!
