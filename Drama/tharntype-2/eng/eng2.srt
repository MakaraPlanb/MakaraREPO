1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,200
Tharn…

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,240
you're sleeping?

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,880
Didn't you tell me
that we should talk things out?

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,360
I don't know
what the hell you're thinking.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,720
But if you don't talk to me…

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,840
I'll never know.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,000
Tharn…

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
turn around and talk to me.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
Your wife's clever,

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,880
but he's not a magical being
who can read your mind.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,120
Turn around and talk to your wife.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,080
Your wife is trying to make up with you.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,160
You should sleep, Type.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,840
It's late.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,280
Will you just get up and talk to me?

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
It's very late, Type.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,880
We both have to work tomorrow.

18
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,680
And I have nothing to say to you.

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,320
Nothing, my ass!

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,240
You think I'm that stupid?

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
You think I don't know what's up with you?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
You've been acting like this
since we left your family's house.

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,720
Just tell me what you want.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,000
Can you really give me what I want
if I do?

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,520
You know what I want, Type.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,840
But you can't give it to me.

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,840
You asshole!

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,800
This is why I don't want to talk to you.
We'll only end up fighting.

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,040
In case you forgot,
you and I are both men.

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,440
Or maybe…

31
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,320
you don't want to tell anyone
about our relationship.

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,000
You've crossed the line, Tharn.

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,840
Why would I introduce you to my parents
if I didn't wanna tell anyone?

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,760
Why would I introduce you
to all my friends?

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,680
That's why I told you to sleep.

36
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
It's late, Type.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,960
Just think I'm an unreasonable idiot.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,680
Then, tell me why
you wanna get married so much.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,600
Because I love you!

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,920
Don't you get it?

41
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,880
But there's no need to declare our love
to the whole world.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
I know, Type.

43
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,320
Besides close friends,
you don't want other people to know.

44
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Whether it's on Twitter,
Instagram, or Facebook…

45
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,680
you never tell anyone
about our relationship.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,640
I know we don't see eye to eye
on this issue.

47
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
That's why I told you to forget it.

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
As for what happened today,
I'm sorry I was being unreasonable.

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,440
Give me a little time.

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
Just a few days.

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
I'll try to understand you.

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,920
I'll forget about this…

53
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,240
and act as if nothing's happened.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,840
Is that okay with you?

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,880
Fine.

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,600
You can take as much time as you want!

57
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,760
I just want…

58
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,280
people to know about our relationship.

59
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
That's all.

60
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
You want time?

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,240
Fine, you've got it!

62
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,560
Asshole.

63
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,720
What's with all the racket!

64
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,680
What are you doing?

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
Making you breakfast.

66
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,240
How many eggs do you want?

67
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,240
You think you can make it up to me
like this?

68
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Put it down.

69
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,080
Come here.

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,040
You're a grown ass man,
but you can't even fry an egg.

71
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
Any middle schooler could do it.

72
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,800
Does it hurt a lot?

73
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,920
The skin's red.

74
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,960
Why are you smiling?

75
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
It was worth getting hurt.

76
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,200
So, do you forgive me?

77
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
You think I'd forgive you
just because you got hurt?

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,560
Even if you dipped your hand
in the hot oil,

79
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600
I'd still be mad at you.

80
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,360
What are you doing?

81
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
You think I wouldn't do it?

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,840
I'm sorry, Type.

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,560
Happy now?

84
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,080
Sit down.

85
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll do it.

86
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
Need my help?

87
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Just don't touch anything. Go.

88
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
So annoying.

89
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,480
It's burnt.

90
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,520
Wanna eat it?

91
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,520
-I made it for you.
-Seriously, who would eat this?

92
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Phugun, time to wake up.

93
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,400
Five more minutes.

94
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
You've asked for five more minutes twice.

95
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
Let me ask a third time.

96
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800
Okay…

97
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,680
but don't say I didn't warn you.

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,080
I dare you.

99
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,560
But give me five more minutes.

100
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,760
Why are you so cute?

101
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,560
Get up.

102
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
Will you get up?

103
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Fine.

104
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Not gonna get up, huh?

105
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Come here.

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,720
Cir.

107
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,000
Spend your five minutes in the bathroom.

108
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,520
Okay.

109
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,840
What are you doing, Cir?

110
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,480
Making toast.

111
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll put jam on yours.

112
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
It's dangerous, Phugun.

113
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Okay.

114
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
How will I spread the jam for you
if you keep bugging me?

115
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,480
Then, don't do it.

116
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,720
I love plain toast.

117
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
You sure?

118
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,840
I just want to hold your hand.

119
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
Then, today…

120
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,360
just eat plain toast.

121
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,480
I should stop bugging you
now that I've caught your attention.

122
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,440
I wonder where I put my phone.

123
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,240
You put it on the coffee table
in front of the TV.

124
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,320
There's something on your lips.

125
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,320
Here too.

126
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,120
All gone.

127
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,880
Cir. I'd better find my phone.

128
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,280
What was on my lips?
I haven't eaten anything.

129
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,760
Cir's been sly lately.

130
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Anyway…

131
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,680
I'm about to leave.
Be there in 30 minutes.

132
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
See you.

133
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,120
Hello, Tharn.

134
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,040
Hey, you two.

135
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,800
Where are you off to?

136
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,160
University. Phugun has classes.

137
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,880
I have classes. Cir is driving me there.

138
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,680
I said I could go by myself,
but he wouldn't let me.

139
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,520
You graduated, but you go there
more often than some of my friends.

140
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,800
What are you doing? Show some respect.

141
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,640
His older cousin's right here.

142
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,520
Let go, what are you doing?

143
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,760
Tharn, it's too late
to be possessive of me now.

144
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
Right, Cir?

145
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,720
Phu, your older cousin's right here.
Show some consideration.

146
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm telling you, if I'd been there
when you hit on each other…

147
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,120
You wouldn't have ended up
dating each other so easily.

148
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,080
Got it?

149
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,880
Excuse me, Tharn.

150
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,960
It's too late to say that now.

151
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,960
Where's Type?

152
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,320
Type?

153
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,720
He went to work early this morning.

154
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,560
-So, Tharn--
-Hello!

155
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,400
This is Khlui, your usual host.

156
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,240
What's new is I've moved in
to a new condo.

157
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,320
Today I'll give you a tour
of my new condo.

158
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,120
Stepping out of the elevator,
you'll see the spacious hallway.

159
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,320
How is it? Worth the price, right?

160
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I promise if this live stream
reaches 1,000 viewers today,

161
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,840
I'll show everyone my bedroom.

162
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
Gather round, gather round.

163
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
How is it? Isn't this beautiful?

164
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,040
Tharn!

165
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,640
Hello, Khlui.

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
How did you end up living here?
What a coincidence.

167
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,360
I should ask you that question.

168
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,280
Type and I have been living here
for a long time.

169
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,080
So, that means my wish actually came true.

170
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,000
What wish?

171
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,880
You've forgotten.

172
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,200
I made a wish
that you'd grow old together.

173
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,040
And have everlasting love.

174
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,320
What are you talking about?

175
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,480
What were you doing speaking so loudly?
What's this?

176
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,760
-What's this?
-I was being loud?

177
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
I didn't realize.

178
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,880
Sorry, next time I'll keep my voice down
a little bit.

179
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,240
There'll be a next time?

180
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,800
Of course!

181
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,360
That live stream should get me more likes.

182
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,520
Actually, your bro here

183
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,920
is the most popular
online merchant right now.

184
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,880
I sell everything.

185
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,320
With my oral skills,
I can even sell old exhaust pipes.

186
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,640
Khlui, you're awesome.

187
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,720
I haven't seen you for a while.
Now you're sucking exhaust pipes?

188
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,200
They do fit in my mouth. What the hell?

189
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,520
What about you? How's couple life?

190
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
You've been together for so long.
How many years is it?

191
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
-Seven years.
-Seven years!

192
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
So romantic.

193
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Romantic?

194
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
We're still the same. Fighting every day.

195
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,720
Really, why?

196
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,760
Excuse me.

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,320
Khlui, I have a meeting.
Talk to you later.

198
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,960
Wait!

199
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
-Hello.
-Tharn, wait!

200
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
What?

201
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,040
I haven't gotten an answer.

202
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
He's gone.

203
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,400
What the hell?

204
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,800
Since you left me hanging…

205
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,040
I've got to pry
into your love life again, right?

206
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,360
I wanna pry, but I've got to work too.

207
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,440
More hard work.

208
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,440
<i>When will you come home, Squirt?</i>

209
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,320
I just went home not too long ago.

210
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
<i>Don't give me that crap, Type.</i>

211
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,320
<i>Look, it's been four months</i>
<i>since your last visit.</i>

212
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,400
<i>Aren't you gonna show your face</i>
<i>to your parents at all?</i>

213
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,320
<i>Or did that white boy</i>
<i>say something to you?</i>

214
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,240
<i>Just you wait. Next time I see him,</i>
<i>I'll chop his head off with a machete.</i>

215
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,120
And your son will be a widower.

216
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,680
<i>What, a widower? Don't talk nonsense.</i>

217
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,120
<i>My son doesn't have a wife yet.</i>
<i>How could he be a widower?</i>

218
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,440
Just accept it, Pops.
How many years has it been, already?

219
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,120
<i>I'm standing my ground. No means no.</i>

220
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,040
Then, keep standing your ground.

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,760
I'm going back to work. Bye.

222
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
<i>Good, a man must be responsible</i>
<i>with his work.</i>

223
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,320
<i>But remember to come home too.</i>

224
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,360
Okay, Pops.

225
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,040
Damn it!

226
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,520
What's wrong with him?

227
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,920
What's wrong with Fiat?
All he does is practice, right?

228
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,280
I know,
and Leo's only been away for a week.

229
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,040
Yeah, should we ask Leo to come back
from Italy tomorrow?

230
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,040
I've been practicing so much
I don't have time to find a girlfriend.

231
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,800
How long are you gonna slack off?

232
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,720
Go get help.

233
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,720
Hurry up!

234
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,160
Fiat, are you okay?

235
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,320
Damn.

236
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Leo's gonna kill me.

237
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,480
Nurse, go get the doctor!

238
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,680
The doctor's coming. Please calm down.

239
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
The doctor's here.

240
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,640
Doctor, I can't give up basketball!

241
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,560
Okay, you must calm down first.

242
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Calm down, you're in good hands now.
Don't worry.

243
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,160
Breathe slowly. Let me examine the injury.

244
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,160
You need to slow your breathing
and calm down.

245
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,560
Lie down, okay?

246
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,040
Doctor, this patient
is pretty difficult to handle.

247
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,920
Looks like he won't cooperate.

248
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Don't worry,
let's wait for the MRI results first.

249
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,560
What if the MRI shows a tear
in the ligament?

250
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,400
Let's not worry about that now.

251
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,920
-Hey, Type! Come here.
-Hello, Khong.

252
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,760
Man, it's been a while. How are you?
I missed you.

253
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,560
Waiting for Tharn's gig?

254
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,960
Yeah. So how have you been?

255
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm fine.

256
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,240
But my wife's been ferocious
since she got pregnant.

257
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:30,600
Congratulations on your baby
and your new bar.

258
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,520
Thanks a lot.

259
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,040
So, what do you think?
Grander than the old one?

260
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,480
Much grander.

261
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,120
It should be, I spent a lot on it.

262
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm practically broke now.

263
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
-Because of the decorations?
-No.

264
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Because my pregnant wife
has a craving for online shopping.

265
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,440
What's with her cravings
and online shopping?

266
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,440
If she were pregnant for 18 months,
I'd go bankrupt.

267
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,040
-So frustrated.
-Calm down, bro.

268
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,800
Speaking of which, Jeed's waiting for you.

269
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
You should go see her.
She's been missing you for days.

270
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,720
-Okay.
-Yeah.

271
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,720
But, I'll go find my friends first.

272
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,680
-Okay.
-Talk to you later. Bye.

273
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,440
-Don't forget to meet Jeed.
-Sure.

274
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,160
-You want another glass?
-Not yet.

275
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,000
Type, there you are. Sit here.
Hurry up. We got a table up front.

276
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,120
What are you having today?

277
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
I'll drink whatever you give me.

278
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,160
Look at him. That's my cute boy.

279
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,400
I'll mix a strong drink
especially for my bro here.

280
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,480
-Okay.
-Fake.

281
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,760
Ain't I her bro too?

282
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
-Used to be.
-Okay.

283
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,480
Let's add more.

284
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,240
-Take it easy.
-This shot is free of charge.

285
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Heavy and strong.

286
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,280
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

287
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,040
Does your hospital have
kidney dialysis services?

288
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Just kidding. I meant, liver dialysis.
My mistake.

289
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,000
-You're talking rubbish again.
-Yeah.

290
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,200
Why did you just arrive now?

291
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,160
Sorry, I was busy with work.

292
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Speaking of which,
can I hang my flyers in your department?

293
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
Business talk again.

294
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
It's not like I'm hanging them everywhere.

295
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Is that so?

296
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,360
Sure, you're definitely
not hanging them everywhere.

297
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,400
You just hung them up all over my place.

298
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,160
It's just a few flyers, Jeed.

299
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,600
Bear with it for my sake.

300
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,640
By the way, what's on the menu today?

301
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,240
Now you're talking about food?

302
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,000
-I'm hungry. Aren't you?
-I'll ask my staff.

303
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,480
Don't go just yet. Let's chat first.

304
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,960
You haven't seen us
for a long time, right?

305
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,440
Yeah, I missed you guys.

306
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,720
Look at us, time sure goes by so fast.

307
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,440
Look at us. Our freshman year passed by
in the blink of an eye.

308
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,720
Next thing we knew, we'd graduated.

309
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,800
-You went to the graduation ceremony.
-Yes.

310
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
And then, Type got his master's degree.

311
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Holy shit.

312
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,880
Time flies and all of us
are freaking old now.

313
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,520
Old, my ass!

314
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,400
You looked right at me when you said that.

315
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,440
I meant, me and my friends.
You're still beautiful.

316
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,680
Don't touch me. I'm gonna go check
on my other customers. You piss me off.

317
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,520
-Okay.
-I'm leaving.

318
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,200
Techno, why did you piss her off?

319
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,720
I was just kidding.

320
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,680
Can't I even talk about age?

321
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,520
I mean, look at us.
We're all grown-ups now.

322
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,000
Take me, for example.

323
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,800
Who would've thought
I'd be a civil servant?

324
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,000
And you, Champ, what a total idiot.
Always was and will be.

325
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,160
You forgot to enroll in a class
and ended up graduating after five years.

326
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,200
You would've graduated
with med students at the eighth year.

327
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,600
Shit!

328
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,400
It only takes six years to be a doctor.

329
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,680
-Really?
-Think before you mock me.

330
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,840
-Really? Six years?
-Yeah.

331
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm so stupid.

332
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,240
But…

333
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,280
Our friend here is a restaurant owner.
He runs his own restaurant.

334
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,760
You're really passionate about food.

335
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:19,560
And you'd better stop eating for free.
I'm about to go bankrupt.

336
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,720
What the hell? And you, Type, you bastard.

337
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,040
What?

338
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,920
You always hit my head and kicked my ass
when you were pissed off.

339
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,080
-Want a piece of me?
-Relax, it's not the time yet.

340
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,960
-Bummer.
-Teach him a lesson.

341
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
You already did.

342
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,360
You ended up working in a hospital,
taking care of patients.

343
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
Seriously, how did you--

344
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,280
Should I kick your ass
and have you treated at my hospital?

345
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,720
Save your energy, man.
Calm down, I'm just kidding.

346
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,560
Wait a sec. There's another.
We have to talk about him.

347
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,840
Who?

348
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,320
Tharn, of course!

349
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,600
Tharn, Type's sweetheart.

350
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,840
He's the best of the best.

351
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,360
Apart from being a music producer,
he helps out at his daddy's company.

352
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,880
Your father-in-law.

353
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,680
He runs an online
musical instrument store.

354
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,680
And he has a part-time job,
playing music at this place.

355
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,080
How many roles does he have? So perfect.

356
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Wait, wait, wait. He's got another role.

357
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,520
What role?

358
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,440
The role you're familiar with.

359
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,000
What?

360
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,280
The role he plays
when he bangs you every night.

361
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,240
Shit!

362
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,760
You do a great job
poking your nose into my affairs.

363
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,240
Good evening, everyone.

364
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
This song…

365
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:05,560
is one I want to dedicate
to everyone who's in love.

366
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,480
<i>Waking up this morning</i>
<i>To a world that seems different</i>

367
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,640
<i>The alarm clock wakes me up</i>
<i>Like it usually does</i>

368
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,120
<i>You are peacefully sleeping</i>
<i>Not knowing what is on my mind</i>

369
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,920
<i>I'm letting you dwell on your sweet dreams</i>

370
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,160
<i>Thinking of the time</i>
<i>We stared into each other's eyes</i>

371
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,720
<i>Without uttering a word</i>

372
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,080
<i>The way you looked at me</i>
<i>Was the proof of our love</i>

373
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,560
<i>With all the good times we've shared</i>
<i>Do you feel the same way I do?</i>

374
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,040
<i>Should I keep it to myself?</i>

375
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:22,480
<i>Or should I tell you?</i>

376
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,640
<i>I want you to be my last</i>

377
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,120
<i>To be the one</i>
<i>Who shares every breath with me</i>

378
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,440
<i>I will never ever hurt you</i>

379
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>Do you hear me, my love?</i>

380
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,440
<i>Please don't let go of my hand</i>

381
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
Jeed, here's the thing.

382
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,840
Everyone in our gang is taken,
except for Champ who's still single.

383
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
-Find him someone.
-Really?

384
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,720
He's pretty clueless about love.

385
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,680
Champ.

386
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
What's up?

387
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,640
Look at his eyes.

388
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,320
What about them?

389
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,120
What the hell?

390
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,480
Look at him. Look!

391
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,280
Look. This is a man in love
who's looking at the one he loves.

392
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Yeah, his world is a rosy paradise.

393
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,640
Do you get it? It's so great.

394
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,840
So what?

395
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,360
Love doesn't make you full.

396
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,040
Having a food buddy
is better than being in love.

397
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,880
Do you agree, Jeed?

398
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,400
-No, I have a husband.
-I am in a relationship.

399
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,200
And you? What are you staring at so much?

400
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,000
My boyfriend.

401
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,600
Yeah, his boyfriend.

402
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,000
-It's his happiness.
-Yeah.

403
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,360
<i>You can rest assured</i>

404
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,560
<i>The two of us will walk side by side</i>

405
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,120
<i>As long as you love me</i>

406
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,440
<i>As long as you don't let go of my hand</i>

407
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,880
<i>Please don't let go of my hand</i>

408
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,600
Have you forgiven me?

409
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,560
You're cunning.

410
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,800
I know that you…

411
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,240
like it when I play music.

412
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,800
If I'd had time for drum practice,
I would've played those instead.

413
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,760
Because I like when you play drums?

414
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,120
You don't just like it.

415
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
You…

416
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,840
love it.

417
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,760
Do you know why I agree
to let you work so hard?

418
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,320
Because I know you love to do it.

419
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,480
And?

420
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,560
And I love you when you do what you love.

421
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,640
And do you know…

422
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,000
what I love the most?

423
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,680
Me.

424
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,360
-Holy shit.
-You okay?

425
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,560
Hold on.

426
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,680
There's only soda left.

427
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,200
Damn, I'm totally wasted today.

428
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
Champ?

429
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,280
Where the hell are Tharn and Type?

430
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I bet it's happening again.

431
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,760
Only you and me left.

432
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,040
You still haven't gotten used to it?

433
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,200
Those two disappear together every time,
leaving you and me behind.

434
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,440
Let them be.

435
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,760
They're probably "eating"
somewhere around here.

436
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,440
You want it?

437
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,600
No.

438
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,480
What about you?

439
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,720
Sure.

440
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,000
WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ALREADY LATE.

441
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,840
{\an8}JUST A SEC. MY BOSS CALLED ME IN TO WORK.

442
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,240
{\an8}OKAY. I'LL WAIT AT THE USUAL SPOT.

443
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Doc, how are you?

444
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,680
It's been a while. Remember me?

445
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,280
Champ!

446
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,800
Why are you so surprised?

447
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm sorry. Sorry.

448
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,480
I didn't expect to meet you here.

449
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,720
You're still as silly as before.

450
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,320
So, how are you? Been doing well?

451
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Yeah.

452
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,320
What were you thinking,
meddling with the children's OPD?

453
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,160
Meddling?

454
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,440
What do you mean?

455
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,360
Someone told me
you harassed a nurse there.

456
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:09,120
That depends on
what you mean by "harassed."

457
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,440
I believe talking to a patient
about fitness test results…

458
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,240
means I went there to work.

459
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,640
You're still arguing with me?
Someone confirmed it was you.

460
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
If you mean the latest patient,
I went to meet them with Ms. Teng.

461
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,840
She can confirm that I went there to work.

462
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,520
I called you here simply to give you
a warning, but you argue so much.

463
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:42,320
I guess you have too much free time
if you could do something like that.

464
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,120
They asked for my help
because I'm your superior.

465
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,920
Think about it.
If the nurse informs the board,

466
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,280
our department's reputation
will be damaged.

467
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,360
If you have common sense…

468
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,480
think about that.

469
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,080
Okay?

470
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,840
Consider it a warning.

471
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,160
Don't let it happen again.

472
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,040
Yes, I'll be careful in the future.

473
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,240
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

474
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,200
So, you run a health food restaurant?

475
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,440
Yeah, that's right.
You didn't believe I could do it, right?

476
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,200
I'm used to Techno teasing me about it.

477
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Says who? I think it suits you
since you always brought me tasty food.

478
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,040
Thanks. I don't often get to hear
someone say something like that.

479
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,960
Sorry, it's a habit.

480
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,800
You always do it to your girlfriend?

481
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,320
You think someone like me
has a girlfriend? I don't.

482
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,040
Even Techno said that with my personality,
I could never find one.

483
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,760
When I said it's a habit,
I meant with you, Doc.

484
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,960
I often rubbed your head
in freshman year, remember?

485
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
Not that you were a small guy.

486
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,880
But whenever I was with you,
you looked so tiny in my eyes.

487
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,320
Hey, Type, over here.

488
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
Damn it, that asshole boss…

489
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,680
Calm down. What happened?

490
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
It's that…

491
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,640
Nothing.

492
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,720
I just haven't had any lunch yet.

493
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,360
Good afternoon, Doctor.

494
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,040
I was planning to tell Champ that
we happen to work in the same place.

495
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,840
Type, you can speak casually. It's fine.

496
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,040
I can't, Doctor. This is our workplace.

497
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,600
Someone might report me
if I use vulgar language.

498
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
Let's wait till we're outside.

499
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,840
Type, you should've told me earlier
that you and Doc work in the same place.

500
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,280
I haven't seen him since freshman year.

501
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,840
Yeah. So, what did you call me here for?

502
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Right, it's about this,
the food from my restaurant.

503
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,040
Give them to people in your department
and help me hand out the flyers.

504
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,160
I guarantee
people will like how it tastes.

505
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,800
Even you could easily run a lap
after eating it.

506
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,920
It can't be ordinary food
if it can make me run a lap.

507
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,200
Come on, trust me.
I'm a real expert at eating.

508
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,760
I won't mess up
like when I enrolled in electives.

509
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,960
Come to think of it…

510
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,640
Here, Doc.

511
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,520
Remember to eat. Don't only focus on work.

512
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,800
Thank you.

513
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,360
So…

514
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,680
do you guys still play football?

515
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,280
Not much. I just do the boxing now.

516
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,520
Yeah, we can't run
like we used to anymore.

517
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,920
Speaking of which, that reminds me.

518
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,160
Last week, a college basketball player
was admitted here for an ACL tear.

519
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,880
An ACL tear? Will he be referred for PT?

520
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,240
He'll be sent for rehab first.

521
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,120
What are you talking about?

522
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,520
Techno, start the game.

523
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Easy, man. Don't rush me.
I need to find the right angle.

524
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
Hurry up.

525
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,000
No. Just a sec.

526
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,040
Check out my stance. So freaking cool.

527
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,800
Shit!

528
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,040
-Will you just play?
-Okay!

529
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,240
Move if you're not gonna play.
You're wasting time.

530
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,920
Damn it.

531
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,760
Damn, you potted one.

532
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,720
Damn, so cool.
Here, you've got my respect.

533
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,800
Take it easy, will you? Wait.

534
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,480
You've got work tomorrow.
Take it easy. Put it down.

535
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,240
You drank it all.
What's the matter with him?

536
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
Did he fight with Tharn?

537
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
-No!
-You've got sharp ears.

538
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,880
-It's about his work.
-Really?

539
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,960
When Doc was around,
he hid his feelings so well.

540
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,520
But when we were alone,
he couldn't stop going on about it.

541
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,960
How could I not?

542
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,800
The whole hospital knows
that the bastard is a cradle robber.

543
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,160
And I've got nothing to do
with that nurse.

544
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,360
She's the one who made a move on me.
I already rejected her.

545
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,760
But that shit face keeps picking on me.

546
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,640
I didn't do anything.

547
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,200
He couldn't control his woman,
and he took it out on me.

548
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,880
-Son of a bitch!
-Your boss?

549
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,800
-You!
-Okay!

550
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,960
-Shit!
-It's not time to joke around.

551
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,640
I just wanted to cheer you up.

552
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,920
-Give me that.
-That's mine!

553
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,640
What am I gonna drink now?

554
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,960
-What a jerk.
-Will you play now?

555
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,800
{\an8}THIS IS KHUNPOL.

556
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,480
{\an8}-What are you bitching about?
-Nothing.

557
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,160
{\an8}I'm finding an angle.
You know, a potting angle.

558
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,800
{\an8}DOC, SORRY.
I FORGOT TO TEXT YOU AFTER ADDING YOU.

559
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,960
{\an8}IT'S OKAY. YOU'RE PROBABLY BUSY.

560
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,240
{\an8}JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU
THIS IS MY LINE ID.

561
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,200
{\an8}SEE YOU LATER.

562
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,440
{\an8}GOOD NIGHT.

563
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
{\an8}Hurry up.

564
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,880
Still as cute as ever.
He hasn't changed at all.

565
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,880
Is he really a doctor?

566
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,040
So curious.

567
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,800
Who are you texting?

568
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,600
Doc.

569
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,960
The one I told you about. He texted me.

570
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,840
What doc?

571
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,160
Khunpol.

572
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,640
Remember? From freshman year.

573
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,120
-Dr. Khunpol, your roommate.
-That's right.

574
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,840
-The one we wanted to switch rooms with.
-Correct.

575
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,360
And he's cute too.

576
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,880
He likes you?

577
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
You're crazy.

578
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,240
-Take it and drink.
-Okay.

579
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Type, take it easy.

580
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,760
Yeah, I'm not gonna carry you home
if you're drunk.

581
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,480
You're as heavy as lead.

582
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,160
Go order more. You talk too much.

583
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,800
I've got no more money to split the bill.

584
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,320
-It's my treat.
-Just a sec. Excuse me.

585
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,760
Excuse me.

586
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,440
Champ, your turn.

587
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,040
Tharn!

588
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,760
-Type!
-Take him. He's heavy.

589
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,720
Holy shit.
Your wife's acting like he's so small.

590
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,080
Damn, he's heavy as hell!
My shoulder almost dislocated.

591
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,000
Here, your darling's bag.

592
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,880
What did you guys do? Why is he so drunk?

593
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,160
You're asking me?

594
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,120
Like I could give you the answer. Shit!

595
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,840
Tharn, that should be my question.
Did you guys fight or something?

596
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,360
Nothing comes to mind?

597
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,840
When we went out drinking,

598
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,360
we only talked about what happened
with his work and his asshole boss.

599
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,480
Then what?

600
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,880
Then what?

601
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:32,360
Tharn, how many years
have we been friends?

602
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:39,360
You know that every time he gets drunk,
you're the cause.

603
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,720
Am I right?

604
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,120
-Yeah.
-He finally admits it.

605
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,840
So, what's the problem this time?

606
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,160
-It's nothing, really.
-It's just…

607
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,600
-You couldn't get it up!
-Keep your voice down!

608
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,720
Thorn is getting married.

609
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,160
Really? Congratulations!

610
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,520
I'm so ready.

611
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,920
But Thorn didn't invite me.

612
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,120
I guess he hates you.

613
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,840
Really?
Can I come to eat free food, then, please?

614
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,480
Fine, I'll tell him.

615
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,160
Wait, I think that's off-topic.

616
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,480
What's it got to do with Thorn's wedding?

617
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,880
I want to marry him.

618
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,480
What? You knocked him up,
and now you want a shotgun wedding?

619
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,160
You knocked him up or what?
Am I right? Am I wrong?

620
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,720
No!

621
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,760
Right, I forgot.
I'm relieved he's not pregnant.

622
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,200
Anyway, thanks.
I'm gonna bring him inside.

623
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,400
Hold on a sec.

624
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,080
What is it?

625
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,520
I think you need help this time.

626
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,920
Help with what?

627
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,200
Just a sec.

628
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,120
Help with what?

629
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,280
Let me find the Line group.

630
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,000
-What are you doing?
-Be patient, you'll find out soon.

631
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,960
I'm going to kick him out.

632
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,720
-What are you doing, Techno?
-Just a sec.

633
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,840
You always carry him to bed just fine,
and now you're complaining he's heavy?

634
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,440
I haven't complained yet.

635
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,160
What?

636
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,560
Isn't this a cool group?
Strategies For Type's Hubby.

637
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,200
Your wish to get married
will definitely come true.

638
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,640
-Thanks, I guess.
-Yeah.

639
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,480
Thanks for bringing him home too.
Have a safe trip home. Let's go, Type.

640
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,120
Type.

641
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,360
If something was bothering you…

642
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,560
why didn't you tell me?

643
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,520
Even though those guys are your friends…

644
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,320
I still feel jealous.

645
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,240
Hold me.

646
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,360
It's because you're like this…

647
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,240
that I want you…

648
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,280
all to myself.

649
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,000
Why can't I hear anything?

650
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,360
Are they fighting?

651
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,840
What the hell?

652
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:37,880
This good stuff almost slipped off.

653
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,760
I'll never agree to surgery
even if you doctors say I should.

654
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,840
I won't take any risks.

655
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,600
I'll do the physical therapy
and take medication, but no surgery.

656
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,960
I have to be able
to play basketball again.

657
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,560
Here's the thing, sir.
Surgery is not scary at all.

658
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,200
In your case,
it will be arthroscopic surgery.

659
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,600
Small wounds and fast recovery.
It'll be even more effective

660
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,920
if you do physical therapy afterwards.

661
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,640
Can you guarantee…

662
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,840
my knee will be the same after
if I have the surgery.

663
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,280
Sir, getting the surgery
is better than not getting it.

664
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,920
Because if you decide against it,
your torn ligament might not heal.

665
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,760
Most importantly,
you might not be able to jump again.

666
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,240
Don't try to persuade me.

667
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,360
Those doctors couldn't even convince me.

668
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,080
So why would I give in now?

669
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,040
I'm here to heal my knee
with physical therapy.

670
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,280
And you just need to do your job!

671
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,080
Okay, if that's your decision.

672
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,800
You called me, Teng?

673
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,760
{\an8}HEY.

674
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,320
{\an8}YOU KICKED TYPE OUT OF THE GROUP?

675
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,840
{\an8}LOL

676
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,760
{\an8}JUST WAIT AND SEE.

677
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,320
{\an8}TECHNO CHANGED THE GROUP'S NAME TO
"STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY".

678
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,560
{\an8}IF TYPE FINDS OUT, HE'LL KILL YA.

679
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,800
{\an8}IF YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING, I WON'T,
SO HOW WILL HE KNOW?

680
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,960
{\an8}COME ON, TO HELP THARN PROPOSE TO TYPE,
WE NEED A PLAN.

681
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,560
{\an8}RIGHT, THARN?

682
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,920
{\an8}WHATEVER.
