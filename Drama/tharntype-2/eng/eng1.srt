1
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,280
Aren't you really gonna give in to me?

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,080
I can't give in with something like this.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,480
Just give in, already.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,320
If that's how you feel,
try winning against me.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,680
What do we play,
"whoever kisses first loses"?

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,400
I've been with you for seven years.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,560
I even let you decorate
the room the way you wanted.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,000
I won't lose to you.

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,320
All right, I give in.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,600
I've been with you for seven years.
I'll always lose to you.

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,240
I know you wanna lose to me.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Only because I want to drive you
to work tomorrow.

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
And since I've already lost…

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,600
can you…

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,920
give in to me, too?

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,320
We'll be late again tomorrow.

17
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Please?

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,440
Can we do it on the weekend instead?

19
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,840
Okay, darling.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,560
In that case, let's go to sleep.

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,960
Shit, I'm late!

22
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,880
Tharn, wake up.

23
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Tharn, we're late.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
It's already 7:00.

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
Tharn, get up.

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
I'm gonna be late for work.

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,000
Tharn, here are your clothes.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Tharn, you ass. You're still not ready?

29
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
I'm going to shower now.

30
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,600
If I'm late,

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
you're dead.

32
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Tharn, you done yet?

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,000
Hurry up, Tharn.

34
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,320
-Did you forget something again?
-I did.

35
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm late.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
I forgot to kiss my wife's cheek.

37
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
Tharn.

38
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,880
Come on, I'm late.

39
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,360
<i>Tharn is still the same.</i>

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
<i>What's changed is,</i>

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,280
<i>even though I'm working now,</i>
<i>he's always clinging to me.</i>

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,960
<i>If I need a ride, I just tell him.</i>

43
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
<i>One call and he's there in a flash.</i>

44
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>What am I doing now?</i>

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,440
<i>I've been a sports medic for half a year.</i>

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,040
<i>I'll give you more details later.</i>

47
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
Heard you were almost late this morning.

48
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,680
Yeah, just barely made it.

49
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080
So, why do you look grumpy?
You got here in time.

50
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Someone gave me hell
about not having an alarm clock at home.

51
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,240
Who?

52
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,160
Dr. Thiti.

53
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,520
Again?

54
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,240
The boss is picking on you again.

55
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,160
Is it…

56
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,760
because you flirted
with that pediatric nurse the other day?

57
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,640
What's that got to do with this?
I didn't flirt with her.

58
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,640
They say the nurse is his mistress.

59
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
I never did anything with her.

60
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,920
Besides, I told you I'm taken.

61
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah, but you see,

62
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
you've never gone public.

63
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,080
People probably think you're lying.

64
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,720
I've never seen
any of your couple photos either.

65
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Don't trick me into saying it.
I won't do it.

66
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,320
I'll get back to work.

67
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,760
Type, my handsome boy.

68
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Don't get mad at me. I just want to pry.

69
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
I just want to know.

70
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,760
We've known each other half a year.
Please, tell me.

71
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,440
Doc?

72
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,560
Type.

73
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,640
I'm spent.

74
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Type

75
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,160
were you late this morning?

76
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,040
Almost.

77
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,200
Then, you weren't late.

78
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,200
You set the alarm wrong.

79
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,480
No, I didn't.

80
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,520
Then, why did it go off at that time?

81
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,240
I accidentally turned it off.

82
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
What an ass.

83
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
Calm down.

84
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
Come here.

85
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,720
What's gotten into you,
giving me a massage?

86
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,480
I guess…

87
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,240
I just want to please my wife.

88
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Are you…

89
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,480
really exhausted?

90
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,960
My boss picked on me again today.

91
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,600
Don't know what I did to deserve it.

92
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,520
Worthwhile job, but a terrible boss.

93
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,280
Come on.

94
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,280
That's how work life is, right?

95
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,840
I'm not like you.

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,200
You're lucky your boss is nice.

97
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,640
That's true.

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm very lucky.

99
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,320
Because I…

100
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
have you.

101
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
So damn cheesy.

102
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,840
It's been seven years, not seven days.
Enough with the flirting.

103
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,560
I'm…

104
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,520
not only good at flirting.

105
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,800
I can make you feel good, Type.

106
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,720
Go ahead. You've promised now.

107
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,480
What's on your mind?

108
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Work.

109
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,280
When you're with me…

110
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,520
don't think about anything other than me.

111
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
Yeah, I know.

112
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
You don't know.

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,520
I told you, don't think about other stuff
when you're with me.

114
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,800
Tharn…

115
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,800
what do you want
for our seventh anniversary?

116
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,120
Seventh anniversary?

117
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,840
I…

118
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
want you and me…

119
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,040
to stay in love for another 70 years.

120
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,680
We'll be really freakin' old.

121
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
Then, let's grow old together.

122
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,840
Okay.

123
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Hey.

124
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Why are you happy
this early in the morning?

125
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,880
Last night…

126
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,040
something good happened.

127
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,080
With what? Work? Money?

128
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,840
Or your boyfriend?

129
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,920
-You want to know?
-Yeah.

130
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
I'm not telling you.

131
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,040
It's time you introduce him
to your colleagues, Tharn.

132
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,040
I've been working with you for a year.
Introduce me to your boyfriend.

133
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,280
I'm not gonna do that.

134
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm possessive.

135
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,040
Man, I'm so jealous of couples.

136
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,640
Here.

137
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,600
Your work.

138
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,880
Why did I have to drag myself over here
to give it to you?

139
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Thanks.

140
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,080
Yeah, I gotta go.

141
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Hello. Thorn.

142
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,680
<i>Hello, Tharn.</i>

143
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
<i>Are you free this Sunday?</i>

144
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
This Sunday?

145
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
I'm not sure.

146
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,280
<i>Free up your schedule and come home.</i>

147
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Why?

148
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,800
Did I forget something?

149
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,560
<i>Just do it. I've got good news.</i>

150
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,560
<i>It's not optional. You must come.</i>
<i>Okay? I'm hanging up.</i>

151
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,840
What's gotten into him?

152
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,240
{\an8}WHEN ARE YOU COMING HOME?

153
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
{\an8}LATE. I'LL STOP BY AT KHONG'S BAR.

154
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,480
{\an8}TAKE A CAB IF YOU'RE GONNA GET DRUNK.

155
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,520
OKAY, DARLING.

156
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
<i>He said he couldn't be with me.</i>

157
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
<i>-He couldn't hurt his partner.</i>
-What's this series?

158
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,040
It's so heartbreaking.

159
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
And why is everyone so obsessed
with getting the male lead?

160
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,760
Hey, you're back early today.

161
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,600
Traffic was light.

162
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,560
Today,

163
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,440
Jeed asked about you.

164
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,040
Tell her I'll stop by if I've got time.

165
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,280
I'll tell her.

166
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,880
Tharn, did you drink or bathe in booze?

167
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,800
You smell like
you fell into a barrel of alcohol.

168
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,200
Super stinky.

169
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,440
Aren't you going to ask
about what Jeed said to me?

170
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,560
She probably asked where I was, as usual.

171
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,680
She asked me

172
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,640
why my dear wife didn't come with me.

173
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,160
Quit it. Go get drunk somewhere else.

174
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,320
Can't you see I'm ironing clothes?

175
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,040
If they get wrinkled, I'll kill you.

176
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,080
But this shirt…

177
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,880
is mine, isn't it?

178
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,640
That's right. I'm ironing your clothes.

179
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,520
Why are you ironing them?

180
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,880
I've already ironed them.
Am I not allowed?

181
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,760
Next time, don't do it.
Why are you doing it?

182
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
You know I use a laundry service.

183
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,600
It's cheap. Stop ironing. Come on, stop.

184
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,120
You're saying this to me…

185
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,880
after I've been ironing
these damn clothes for an hour?

186
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,840
You wanna do it yourself?

187
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Go on, do it.

188
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,320
And I won't give a shit about you anymore.

189
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
Type…

190
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,520
What the hell, Techno?

191
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,080
Some chick's attracted to your man.
What's that got to do with me?

192
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,280
And if he really cheats on you…

193
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,240
you just gotta chop it off
and flush it down the toilet.

194
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I'm hanging up. I'm gonna sleep.

195
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,080
Techno?

196
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
Who the hell do you think it was?

197
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,560
Tharn…

198
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,760
I'm warning you.

199
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,560
I'm in a bad mood right now.

200
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,080
If you come close to me again,
I can't guarantee your safety.

201
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,440
Type…

202
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
You know…

203
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
that I don't want you to get tired, right?

204
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,840
Earlier…

205
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,840
I might have said it the wrong way.

206
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
I don't want you to get tired.

207
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,600
You're exhausted enough just from work.

208
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,880
Don't strain yourself at home.

209
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm sorry.

210
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,600
Sorry for speaking to you that way.

211
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,880
Are you making me feel guilty
for acting like an idiot?

212
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm…

213
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
not.

214
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,800
I was mad
because I wanted to do it for you.

215
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,320
We bought this place
with your dad's money.

216
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,840
And you're the one who pays

217
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,720
the electricity and water bills
and the maintenance fee.

218
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,520
So I just wanted to do something for you.

219
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
Because I always iron my clothes anyway.

220
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,440
Don't think too much.

221
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm happy to do it for you, Type.

222
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
You know my money is your money.

223
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,920
Forget it.

224
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,640
I'm going to sleep.

225
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Tharn…

226
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,560
I'm not in the mood.

227
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,120
I'm not going to do that kind of stuff.

228
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,680
Just a hug. Let me hug you.

229
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,160
Tharn…

230
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Please forgive me.

231
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,520
Forgive me, please.

232
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,920
Please.

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,320
Please forgive me.

234
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,320
Fine.

235
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,120
You've forgiven me, right?

236
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
Yeah.

237
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
I forgive you.

238
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,160
And remember this.

239
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,280
If I wanna iron your clothes,

240
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,760
I'm gonna do it.

241
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,200
And if I don't wanna, I won't.

242
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
And you.

243
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,760
If you don't wanna get hurt,
don't climb into the bed again.

244
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
Thanks for giving me a ride.

245
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,480
Still sulking?

246
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,960
Only 'cause you wouldn't listen
to what I said.

247
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,360
Honestly, you're sulking
like a woman on her period.

248
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,480
I'm gonna do whatever I want, anyway.

249
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,800
And everything I do, I do it for you.

250
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
Type.

251
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,600
I'll pick you up this evening.

252
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,160
Just moved in?

253
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,720
I live here too, on the 11th floor.

254
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,120
Which floor are you on?

255
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,640
Since we live in the same building,
it's worth getting to know each other.

256
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,920
That way,
we can help each other in the future.

257
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,280
Do you need my help? That looks heavy.

258
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,520
Cir! Cir, wait for me.

259
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,760
Phugun.

260
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,440
Why are you carrying a heavy box?
Let me do it.

261
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,640
I can carry it just fine.
There's just a bunch of dolls inside.

262
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,480
Pile it on here.

263
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,440
It's okay. I can carry it.

264
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,360
I said pile it on.

265
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,000
-It's okay.
-Pile it on.

266
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,480
Fine.

267
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,440
Well done. Good boy.

268
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,480
Don't flatter me.

269
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,440
You'll call me a naughty boy
if I don't do as you say.

270
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,840
So…

271
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,160
Who's this woman? You know her?

272
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,080
No.

273
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,080
Not a friend?

274
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,520
Not interested.

275
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,640
Cir.

276
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,080
Don't say that.
She'll think you're arrogant.

277
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,280
Let her. Why should I care?

278
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,920
All I care about is you.

279
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,120
You're doing this again, Cir?

280
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
I'm not the only person in the world.

281
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,360
In my world, there's only you.

282
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,360
Phu?

283
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Tharn, hello.

284
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,840
You're moving in today?

285
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,440
I'm sorry, I forgot.

286
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,240
It's okay, Tharn. No big deal.

287
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,840
And this guy here is Cir.

288
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,880
-Cir is--
-Phu's boyfriend.

289
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,200
And did you tell him…

290
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,920
who I am?

291
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
He did.

292
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,480
And I'm telling you who I am.

293
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,880
Your boyfriend is pretty possessive.

294
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,840
To put your mind at ease,

295
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,760
I already have a boyfriend.

296
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
And this, I'll help you carry it.

297
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm free today.
Need help with anything else?

298
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,000
No.

299
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,000
-Embarrassed?
-What are you talking about?

300
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,760
Never knew this stoic boy
could feel embarrassed.

301
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,000
Quit it.

302
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,920
Okay, I'll stop teasing.

303
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,960
If my boyfriend comes home early,
I'll introduce him to you.

304
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,080
Okay?

305
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,560
Okay.

306
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Cir. Come on, let's go inside.

307
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,040
Want milk?

308
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,040
No.

309
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,600
I want water.

310
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,760
With lots of ice.

311
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,120
Lots of ice, huh?

312
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Of course, Mr. Type.

313
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,160
I'm going to give you lots of ice.

314
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,640
Your boss didn't ask you to work today?

315
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,000
Don't jinx it,

316
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,360
or he'll call me in.

317
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,160
I rarely get to spend Sundays with you.

318
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,800
I know.

319
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,960
I don't know why he hates me so much.

320
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,760
I don't think he hates you.

321
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,120
He just hates your big mouth.

322
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,920
Don't tease me, Tharn.

323
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,760
I'm way more polite
than I was when I was a freshman.

324
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
I bet he'd die of shock
if he met my freshman self.

325
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,920
If he dies of shock,
you're the one who'll get fired.

326
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,640
Type?

327
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,240
If something is bothering you…

328
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,000
you can tell me.

329
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,080
Why should I tell you?

330
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,520
Then, what's your boyfriend for…

331
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,480
if you don't tell him what's on your mind?

332
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,240
Jerk.

333
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,520
Fine.

334
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
Remember Champ's roommate
from our freshman year?

335
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,400
No.

336
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,400
The one who studied medicine.

337
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,640
I met him by chance
at the hospital the other day.

338
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,040
His name is Dr. Khunpol, I guess.

339
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,240
Champ used to call him Khun.

340
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,120
And?

341
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,560
I've told you everything.

342
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
I'm washing the dishes.

343
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,520
Tharn, you're getting in the way.

344
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,480
Just keep washing.

345
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,960
Tharn.

346
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,360
Let me help.

347
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,640
Stop pretending.

348
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,280
Someone like you
wouldn't think of helping me wash dishes.

349
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,000
But today…

350
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,600
is our day off.

351
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,160
Tharn, stop it.

352
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,040
Please. Please, Type.

353
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,640
Please.

354
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,480
You know that I'm…

355
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,480
a sucker for tank tops.

356
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,200
Yet you still wear it to seduce me.

357
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,720
I'm not seducing you.

358
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,480
You're gonna do it here?

359
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,440
Let's ignore it.

360
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,920
Tharn.

361
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I said ignore it, Type.

362
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,160
I think you should pick up.

363
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,360
This better be important,
or I'll chew you out!

364
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,480
THANYA

365
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,880
Chew her out, then.

366
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,960
Yes, Princess?

367
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,240
What is it?

368
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Why did you call me
so early in the morning?

369
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
I thought you were brave.

370
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,760
<i>You forgot that you have to</i>
<i>come home today, right?</i>

371
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,960
<i>Thorn said he'd give you 30 minutes.</i>

372
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,680
<i>You guys have to come as fast as you can.</i>

373
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,160
All right, Princess.

374
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,040
I'll hurry over.

375
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,160
What's wrong?

376
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,200
What's wrong?

377
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,360
Let's get changed.

378
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Let's go.

379
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,040
I thought you wanted
to chew your sister out.

380
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,440
All I see is a man who was speeding
to get here in 30 minutes.

381
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,240
You're all talk, Tharn.

382
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,520
She's my sister.

383
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,800
And stop laughing, will you?

384
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,080
Because the handsome Tharn
is afraid of his tiny little sister.

385
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,160
Chopper.

386
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,480
Did you miss me?

387
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,560
Tharn. Type. Hello. You're late.

388
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,280
-Hey.
-We're late because of Tharn.

389
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,480
Who's afraid of her, exactly?

390
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,440
Hi, Princess.

391
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,200
Hurry up, Type. Everyone's waiting.

392
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,840
Okay, Princess.

393
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,160
San…

394
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,160
you really want to get on my nerves?

395
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,000
I said I didn't want this color
for my sofa.

396
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,720
I want a dark color.

397
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,440
Your dad hired me,
so I have to do what he says.

398
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,000
When you hire me, I'll do what you want.

399
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
Look who's here.

400
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,160
That should be my line. Why are you here?

401
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,840
This is my house.

402
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,680
Hey, San.

403
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,840
Calm down, this is the house I designed.

404
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,440
I need to inspect it before the handover.

405
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Just admit you're here for free meals.

406
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,520
You've been doing handovers
quite often lately.

407
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,120
I found out my dearest brother
was coming, so I stopped by.

408
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,840
San, don't give me a hard time.
Look at Type's face.

409
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,160
Let me go.

410
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,120
You're an old geezer now,

411
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,040
but you're still
always looking for trouble.

412
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,640
Yeah, the older you get,
the more foulmouthed you are.

413
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm your friend.

414
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,520
Have you ever asked
if I really want to be your friend?

415
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,960
Guys, stop fighting.

416
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,920
By the way, why did you call us over?

417
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,400
I was waiting for everyone to be here,
so I could tell you all at the same time.

418
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
Here's the thing, everyone.

419
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,920
I'm going to propose to Am.

420
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,080
You call this urgent?

421
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Thorn, you told Thanya to call us over
just because you're getting married?

422
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,200
He's right, honey.
It's not that big a deal.

423
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,400
I even canceled
my appointment with my friends.

424
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,440
I had to cancel my golf game too.

425
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,800
Why is no one excited?

426
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,680
I'm getting married!

427
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,960
Congratulations.
I wish you immense happiness.

428
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,880
So sincere.

429
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,880
My friend's getting married!

430
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,280
Why do you suddenly want to marry Am?

431
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,680
That's my Princess.

432
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,800
The thing is I suddenly woke up
with the feeling that…

433
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,680
I want to wake up beside her every day.

434
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,040
The next thing I knew, I had secretly
measured her ring size and bought a ring.

435
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,440
When are you going to propose?
I'll prepare the dowry.

436
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,600
I can give your inheritance to Am, right?

437
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,160
This Friday, Dad.

438
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,320
As for my inheritance,
you can sign it over to Am.

439
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,880
I'm serious about her.

440
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,640
I hope Am doesn't throw your ring away.

441
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,760
Fork you.

442
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,480
Thorn is getting married.

443
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,400
So when will it be Tharn and Type's turn?

444
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,360
Thanya, let's not focus
on your middle brother now.

445
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,600
Support your big brother first,
or you'll hurt his feelings.

446
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,640
I don't think so.

447
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
I couldn't hurt Thorn's feelings, right?

448
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,640
That's right.

449
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,640
I can't wait till Friday.

450
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,720
This is the fourth time you've said that.

451
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,320
That's because I'm happy.

452
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,400
Don't be too happy.

453
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
You still don't know if Am will say yes.

454
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,280
Don't be jealous of me, bro.

455
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,080
Since you're getting married,
do something about your sister complex.

456
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,320
Thanya told me you followed her
to movie sets.

457
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,680
And scrutinized all her movie scripts.

458
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:35,560
I'm a man. I know what men think.
So how can I not worry about her?

459
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,920
Sure, if you say so.

460
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,160
Enough about my relationship.

461
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,520
When are you two getting married?

462
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,840
Did you forget…

463
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,640
that we're a gay couple?

464
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,320
Can't gay people get married?

465
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,560
There are certain limits to it.

466
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,480
What limits?

467
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,680
I'm not worried about my family.

468
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,840
Since there's a white guy who proposed
to my friend in the neighborhood.

469
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,040
But in your family's case, it's different.

470
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,640
Your family has a reputation to uphold.

471
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,680
There are lots of people
at your Dad's company.

472
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,760
And there are your acquaintances,
your friends,

473
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,080
and your bride's family.

474
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,600
Not to mention Thanya's fans.

475
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,440
If they found out that
Tharn was married to a man,

476
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,600
what would they think?

477
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,840
Listen to me, Type.

478
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,240
My family doesn't care what people think.

479
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,080
I'm fine with the way things are.

480
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,400
It's better this way.

481
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,440
If something happens,
we'll just have to break up.

482
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,120
And people wouldn't gossip about us.

483
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,360
You're as stubborn as always.

484
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,760
That's how I am,

485
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,000
and Tharn knows it.

486
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
Cheer up.

487
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:42,600
Guys.

488
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,480
Gather around.

489
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,960
Let's hear your plan, Fiat.

490
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,720
Take the lead.

491
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,960
I'll run down and wait over there.

492
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,040
-Pass the ball to me as fast as you can.
-Okay.

493
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,640
We'd better score fast
before they catch up.

494
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,800
Otherwise,

495
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,400
we're screwed.

496
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,800
Come on, let's crush them.

497
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,280
Let's go!

498
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,240
You're leaving?

499
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,760
-See you later.
-See you later.

500
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,120
See you later.

501
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,960
Fiat, stop practicing.

502
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,080
We won. It's time to celebrate.

503
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,040
Wanna come?

504
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,080
You go ahead.
I'm gonna practice a bit more.

505
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,200
Damn, you've got so much energy.

506
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,800
How long are you gonna practice?

507
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,400
I'm free today,
so I'll just keep practicing.

508
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,680
Don't overdo it.

509
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,200
If Leo finds out you won't take a break,
he'll come after us again.

510
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
Are you gonna go celebrate or what?

511
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,120
Because if not, come practice with me.

512
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,360
Dream on. The match was exhausting enough.

513
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,880
We're not hyperactive like you.

514
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,880
Exactly my thoughts.

515
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,400
Then, you'd better leave now.

516
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,880
Or I'll use my position as the captain

517
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,600
to order you, you, and you
to practice with me.

518
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,000
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

519
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,960
It's 11:00 already?

520
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,600
We always get home late
when we visit your family.

521
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,280
And we meet your ex there every time.

522
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:52,280
And my bickering with San will never end.

523
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,840
What's the matter?

524
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,720
I'm fine.

525
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,840
Tharn.

526
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,080
I've been with you for seven years.

527
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,960
So how could I not know what
you mean when you say "I'm fine"?

528
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,600
Can we get married, Type?

529
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,560
Not this again.

530
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,680
We've been together
longer than Thorn and Am.

531
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,480
What's that got to do with this?
Don't be ridiculous.

532
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,640
I'm not being ridiculous, Type.

533
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,640
I just want to move forward with you.

534
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,000
The fact that we live together
is not moving forward enough for you?

535
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,080
-I--
-Tharn.

536
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,120
Enough.

537
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,880
If we keep talking about this,

538
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,000
we'll end up fighting.

539
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,800
We can keep living like this.

540
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,400
