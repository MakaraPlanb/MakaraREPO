1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,280
Tharn, what time are the musicians
coming to record the demo today?

2
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,080
Tharn.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,240
Tharn!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,120
Hey.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,880
Tharn.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,480
I asked you what time the musicians
are coming to record the demo today.

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,440
-Musicians?
-Yeah.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,840
At 2:30.
But only the keyboardist is coming.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,800
It's a good idea to finish
a guide track for the vocalist first.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,360
We can record the full band later
if it gets approved.

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,440
And what's wrong with you?

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,800
No, nothing's wrong.

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,760
Glad you're okay.

14
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,520
Gil.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,040
Do you think it's wrong of me…

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,960
to want to possess someone so badly…

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,440
that I want to let the whole world know
that he only belongs to me?

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,720
What are you babbling about?

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,440
It's not wrong because it means
they're important to you.

20
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,960
Stop sulking, stop babbling,
and finish your job.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,160
It's almost lunchtime, and I'm hungry.
What should we eat?

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Anything's fine.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,600
You choose.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,880
Yeah, sure, Mr. Thara.
You're not picky at all.

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know what's going on with you,
but cheer up, man.

26
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,880
-Gotta go.
-Thanks.

27
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,800
I don't think this case is difficult,
but it'll need continuous follow-ups.

28
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
Okay, then, I'm counting on you.

29
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,520
Mr. Thiwat.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,080
Yes?

31
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,520
The boss ordered you to compile
and hand in last month's cases.

32
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,840
But that's not my responsibility.

33
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,680
That's not my problem.
I'm just relaying his order.

34
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Please, excuse me.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,600
What terrible sin did you commit?

36
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
I really don't know.

37
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Cheer up.

38
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
Thanks.

39
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm going home to wash up.
See you tonight.

40
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
<i>Hello, what's up?</i>

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Off work yet?

42
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,680
<i>No, some work suddenly came up</i>
<i>this afternoon.</i>

43
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,320
So, when will you be finished?

44
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,920
<i>I don't know.</i>

45
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,920
Then… are you working tomorrow?

46
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Want me to buy food for you?

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,120
<i>It's fine. Hurry home and rest</i>
<i>if you're done work.</i>

48
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
It's okay, Type.

49
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,560
I'll swing by to bring you some food.

50
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,880
<i>It's too much trouble. Just go home.</i>
<i>Going back and forth will tire you out.</i>

51
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,600
Fine, then, I'll just go home first.

52
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,760
Tell me when you finish work.
I'll pick you up.

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,560
<i>It's okay, I can go home on my own.</i>

54
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,280
I'll pick you up, it's no bother at all.

55
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,840
<i>It's a hassle.</i>
<i>I'll go home on my own after work.</i>

56
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,240
Okay.

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Are you…

58
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
coming to watch my gig tonight?

59
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,480
<i>I don't think so.</i>
<i>Tons of paperwork to deal with.</i>

60
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,320
<i>Don't get upset.</i>

61
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,280
<i>-I'll see you at home.</i>
-Okay.

62
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,640
Tell me when you get home.

63
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,680
<i>Okay. I'm gonna get back to work.</i>

64
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Okay.

65
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,280
Yes, come in.

66
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,360
Doc? You're still here?

67
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,480
My shift just ended.

68
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,880
I saw the light on,
so I came to check on you.

69
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,080
Figured you hadn't left yet.

70
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,040
Yeah.

71
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,680
Work suddenly came up.
I wanna finish it by tonight.

72
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,600
Urgent case?

73
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,640
Last month's case reports.

74
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,400
Only your patients?

75
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,080
If that was the case,
I would've finished it ages ago.

76
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,440
It's for the whole department.

77
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,400
Assigned this afternoon.
Deadline, tomorrow morning.

78
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Guess I've got a bull's-eye on my head.

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
Why do you have to do it alone?

80
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
It's not your job at all.

81
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,880
Never mind, I'll finish it soon.

82
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,200
Fine.

83
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,800
So, when can you go home?

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't know. I'll leave when I finish it.

85
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,840
By the way, do you need anything?

86
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,960
I was going to ask you
to come out for dinner.

87
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,880
Gonna have to pass.
This should take a while.

88
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,720
Champ? In that case, you should hurry.

89
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,880
-But--
-It's okay, there's not that much to do.

90
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Champ will get hangry if you're late.

91
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,400
But if Champ finds out that
you're doing other people's jobs…

92
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,360
he won't let it go either.

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
You know Champ pretty well.

94
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,120
I know…

95
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,080
that Champ really loves his friends.

96
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,120
-And if Champ finds out--
-Then, just don't tell him.

97
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,600
You're making me feel guilty
for taking up you and Champ's time.

98
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,960
But--

99
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm fine.

100
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,160
You'd better go.

101
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,480
Okay.

102
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,880
I'm leaving, then.

103
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,120
Good luck.

104
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
TENYA

105
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,120
Doc?

106
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,080
You're distracted again. What's wrong?

107
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,360
Nothing, I just have some things
on my mind.

108
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
Is it work?

109
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,680
Not exactly.

110
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,160
Whatever it is, eat first, think later.

111
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,680
Okay?

112
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm not like you, eating all the time.

113
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,200
You've got to eat a lot.
You're way too small.

114
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,320
Who says I'm small? I'm not small.
I'm as tall as you.

115
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,920
I guess you're right.

116
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,800
You're as tall as me.

117
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,600
But I don't know why
you seem so small to me.

118
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,320
There is a certain phrase
that my sister often says.

119
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,640
It's…

120
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,960
"so small that I wanna roll it
into a ball and swallow it."

121
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,600
Have you heard that?

122
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,960
What does it mean?

123
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,920
I don't get it, either.

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
When my sister watches a movie,
she usually uses words like…

125
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,000
"totes adorbs" or something like that.

126
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,200
When she sees a cute guy, she says…

127
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,080
"I wanna roll him
into a ball and swallow him."

128
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Like that.

129
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,800
-Really?
-I don't quite get it, either.

130
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,960
And then?

131
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,680
You're really paying attention.

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,000
It's rare that you talk about your family.

133
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,840
Guess I'm practically mute
whenever I'm with Techno.

134
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,160
But the thing about rolling something
into a ball and swallowing it…

135
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,360
I didn't quite get it…

136
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,680
until…

137
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,120
Until?

138
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,200
Until I met you.

139
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's eat before I actually roll you
into a ball and swallow you up.

140
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
I'm happy to see you smile.

141
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,680
You've been wearing
that serious face all day.

142
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,400
You can always talk to me.

143
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,680
You know that, right?

144
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,520
Actually…

145
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm not worried about my work.

146
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,960
But I'm worried about Type.

147
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Type?

148
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,920
What about him?

149
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,920
There seems to be someone in the hospital
who doesn't like him.

150
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,120
I need to deliver these documents
to my superior or I'll get in trouble.

151
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,520
Patient files?

152
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,680
No, my department's operational plan.

153
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,720
Hold on.

154
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,360
But that isn't your responsibility.

155
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,400
Yeah, I know that.

156
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,160
But he's the boss.
I have to do what he says.

157
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,880
<i>When I left, Type was still doing the work</i>
<i>his boss had given him.</i>

158
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,520
<i>It's not even his responsibility.</i>

159
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,400
I don't know if Type has offended someone.

160
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,760
But it wasn't the first time
I saw it happen.

161
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,080
I've seen it several times now.

162
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,280
Type is straightforward
to the point of being blunt.

163
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,760
That can either make people
very fond of him

164
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,680
or hate him to the core.

165
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,800
But I know him well.

166
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,200
He can manage. He's invincible.

167
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,040
Don't think about it too much.

168
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Okay.

169
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
You really…

170
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
care about all of your friends.

171
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,200
I care about you too.

172
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,080
Really?

173
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,440
So,

174
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,080
what kind of a person am I,
in your opinion?

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,960
You're sweet and kind.

176
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,360
Everyone likes you.

177
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,200
See? You're being cute again.

178
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,680
Says who? I'm not trying to be cute.

179
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,680
That's good.

180
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,680
Let's eat.

181
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Before I roll you into a ball
and swallow you for real.

182
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,160
-The food's pretty good.
-Yeah.

183
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,360
Okay, I'm leaving.

184
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,400
Drive safely. Tell me when you get home.

185
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,240
Okay, have a safe trip home too.

186
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
Okay, see you later.

187
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,560
Uncle…

188
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,200
I need a favor from you.

189
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,800
Damn,

190
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,400
it's already this late?

191
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,800
{\an8}SWEET SMILE. PLAYS GUITAR.
ANYONE WOULD FALL FOR HIM.

192
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,640
{\an8}WHEN WILL YOU STOP FILMING ME?

193
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,640
{\an8}I didn't go with you.
You must've been very happy.

194
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
Damn.

195
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,520
Where have you been?

196
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,720
That's a lot of stuff there.

197
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
I went snack shopping for Phugun.

198
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
He sure loves snacks, huh?

199
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,560
Yeah.

200
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,040
Then I'll buy some for him later.

201
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,000
-It's okay.
-Why?

202
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,040
I can take care of him.

203
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,720
Did you just get home?

204
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
You got back pretty late.

205
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah…

206
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,320
I've been busy lately.

207
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,960
Don't worry.

208
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,040
I don't have time to play with Phu
to make someone jealous.

209
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
See you, cousin-in-law.

210
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,200
Tharn, it's cramped.

211
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,080
Tharn.

212
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,200
When should I pick you up?

213
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,560
Type, when should I pick you up?

214
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
It's okay, I can go home on my own.

215
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,560
I gave you a ride,
so I have to pick you up.

216
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
I told you not to give me a ride,
didn't I?

217
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,320
You were silent all this time
because you were sulking about it, right?

218
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm not sulking.

219
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
How can I not pick you up
when you're like this?

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,480
You worked too hard last night,
you know that?

221
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,960
I played at Khong's bar,
but I still got home before you.

222
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,600
Isn't that a good thing?

223
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,280
You might wanna hang out
with someone else.

224
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,960
Who do you mean?

225
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,080
Which one should I pick,
number three or this one?

226
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,360
I like number eight too.

227
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,320
I like number five.

228
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,560
-Number five?
-Yes.

229
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,080
Okay, then, number five it is.

230
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,440
Thorn, why aren't you asking
for Am's opinion?

231
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,280
I already talked to her,
and she let me make the decision.

232
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,200
Because she knew
that I'd eventually let you choose.

233
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,760
Am always indulges you.

234
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,120
She's not at all afraid
that you're gonna get spoiled.

235
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,680
Here you are. I've been looking for you.

236
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,080
You're finally here, Tharn.

237
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,240
Where's Type?

238
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
Busy with work.

239
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,400
Thanya.

240
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,360
-I bought you a cake.
-Thank you.

241
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,120
She's shooting a drama.
She needs to watch her weight.

242
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,320
Just one piece won't hurt.

243
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,840
-I'm going to put it away.
-Okay.

244
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,360
You look upset.
Did you have a fight with Type?

245
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,680
I don't know if you'd call it a fight.

246
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,520
We've been disagreeing
whenever we talk about anything.

247
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,640
We argue more than we talk.

248
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,320
Have you done something wrong?

249
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,240
Thanya, you always side with Type.

250
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,840
Have you forgotten
that Tharn is your brother?

251
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,040
I haven't, but Type
isn't an unreasonable person.

252
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,920
What, are you saying I'm unreasonable?

253
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,120
No, what I mean is,
Type isn't sulky like you.

254
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,440
You're gonna blame me
for being sulky, no matter what, right?

255
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,680
But you're right, I'm really sulky
when it comes to Type.

256
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,560
You're only like that with him.

257
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,000
The same goes for Thorn.

258
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,880
No matter how much he pampers me,
he only loves Am.

259
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,400
But you are our most precious
little sister, Thanya.

260
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,760
{\an8}HAVING LUNCH AT HOME.
MOM AND THANYA MISS YOU.

261
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
{\an8}Hey, what's wrong?

262
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,920
{\an8}You've been staring at your phone all day.

263
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,960
What do you mean? It's only noon.

264
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,720
Fine, half a day.

265
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,880
But if that person doesn't contact you,
you'll be gloomy all day.

266
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,200
Let me see your gloomy face.

267
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,680
Sorry, but that person just texted me.

268
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,920
Then, eat your lunch if you're happy.
We have so much work to do.

269
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,680
Teng, can I ask you something?

270
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,360
What?

271
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:31,160
If you did something wrong and wanted to
make up for it without losing face…

272
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,720
what would you do?

273
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,000
The one who texted you?

274
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,840
Just answer the question.

275
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,000
If it was me, I would…

276
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,560
I don't wanna know anymore.

277
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,520
Just kidding.

278
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,000
What, can't I be coy if you're not gonna
go public with that person?

279
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,040
Okay, I'll be serious.

280
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,440
If it was me, I would buy them flowers.

281
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,720
Flowers?

282
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,560
Flowers work on every occasion.

283
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,680
Thiwat speaking.

284
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Okay, I'm coming.

285
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,160
That's one long sigh.

286
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,840
Boss called?

287
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,720
Close, it's his secretary.

288
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,160
Boss wants to meet me in the afternoon.

289
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,880
What a drag.

290
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
What can I do for you, sir?

291
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,920
{\an8}BOOK THREE (FIVE)

292
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,920
Since you're so competent,

293
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,880
help me with the department's
procurement documents.

294
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,400
But I don't think
that's my responsibility.

295
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,800
You're right.

296
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,560
But I happen to be your superior.
Am I correct, Mr. Thiwat?

297
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Yes, sir.

298
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,160
Therefore, when I, your superior,
give you an order, you must obey it.

299
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
Or do you want a warning notice?

300
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,000
-Are you forcing--
-And I have the authority

301
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,160
to sign your resignation letter too.

302
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
You have two options.

303
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
Follow my order.

304
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,280
Or let me exercise my authority.

305
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,440
If that's all, then, please excuse me.

306
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,440
I want it done in three days.

307
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,440
Type.

308
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Where are you going?

309
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,000
Wait for me.

310
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,040
Type.

311
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,280
Type.

312
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
Type.

313
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,720
Type, you got off work?

314
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,080
I've been waiting for you.
But it's okay, I don't mind waiting.

315
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,960
Can you stop following me?

316
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,400
-Let's have dinner together.
-No.

317
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,240
-Coffee's fine too.
-I said no!

318
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,280
But I really wanna talk to you.

319
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,920
Type!

320
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,720
Fiat!

321
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
Are you okay?

322
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm sorry for chasing you earlier.

323
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,040
No, it's okay.

324
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,200
If you wanna get better soon,
don't do it again.

325
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,600
I'm really sorry.

326
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,920
You're kind, do you realize that?

327
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm not kind.

328
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,920
I'm sorry about earlier too.

329
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,240
I was upset about something.

330
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,800
What is it?

331
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,520
Forget it.

332
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,120
It's nothing.

333
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,840
I don't wanna complain to a kid.

334
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,760
But this kid is always ready
to listen to you.

335
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,320
Someone told me if you keep
your problems to yourself,

336
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,640
you could get sick from stress.

337
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,640
Don't make a big deal
out of what I'm about to say.

338
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,440
Okay.

339
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,840
Recently, I've realized
the reality of something.

340
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,640
What is it?

341
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,120
Studying and working
are as different as night and day.

342
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,680
When I studied, everything was fun.

343
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,040
No matter how hard courses were,

344
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,880
the worst that could happen
was failing one.

345
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,280
But when it comes to work,
it's just like they say.

346
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,760
Dealing with people
is more tiring than working.

347
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,280
When people insulted me,
all I had to do was strike back.

348
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,760
But when "superior" and "position"
come into the picture…

349
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,080
even if I meet people
who haven't matured with age…

350
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,800
I can't do anything.

351
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,960
Then…

352
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,200
what do you do?

353
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,440
Endure it.

354
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,960
What if you can't take it anymore?

355
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,280
I'm lucky that day hasn't come yet.

356
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,960
But patience has its limits.

357
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Never mind.

358
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,920
Don't take it too seriously.

359
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,760
Can I ask you something?

360
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,480
How far are you from reaching your limit?

361
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,720
I'm close.

362
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,920
What are you doing?

363
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,840
Nothing, I wanna show
the coffee to my friends.

364
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,760
What are you sulking about?

365
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,080
And what kind of an apology is this?

366
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,640
You think this is the only part
of the apology?

367
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,160
I'm sorry.

368
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,640
This is for me?

369
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,320
Who else would it be for?

370
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,160
I've apologized.

371
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,160
Honestly…

372
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,200
you had me at "sorry."

373
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
I don't want to lose you.

374
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,280
When you finish work…

375
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,760
hurry to bed.

376
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,120
I'll text you.

377
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,120
Type is cute, isn't he?

378
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,000
Where are you?

379
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,280
<i>I'm gonna see Type. Why?</i>

380
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,400
Come back right now.

381
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,280
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

382
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,920
I said come to my house right now.
We need to talk.

383
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,840
<i>Come on, can't I go see Type first?</i>

384
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,440
<i>He's been kind enough to let me see him.</i>

385
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
But I said I needed to talk to you.

386
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,920
Come to my house right now!

387
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,320
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

388
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,480
<i>Why are you raising your voice at me?</i>

389
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,440
<i>Fine, I'll go to your house.</i>

390
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,480
Why did you call me here?

391
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,760
I finally got Type to talk to me.

392
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,320
You always ruin my happiness.

393
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,040
Why are you showing me this?

394
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,280
He's got a boyfriend.

395
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,840
So what?

396
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,720
He's got his own man.

397
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,720
You shouldn't mess with him.

398
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
I've never interfered with you
when you fooled around.

399
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,840
But this is wrong.

400
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
How am I wrong?

401
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,080
They're not married.

402
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,400
I've still got a chance.

403
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,360
I've been your friend for ten years.

404
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,480
I've never known you to be so desperate.

405
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,200
-Leo.
-Am I wrong?

406
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,480
I'm telling you he's got a boyfriend.

407
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,920
You should get the message.

408
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,040
He's got a boyfriend. So what?

409
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,520
-I don't care.
-Fiat!

410
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,640
Don't raise your voice at me.

411
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
This time, I'm serious.

412
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,800
You know he's got a boyfriend.

413
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,240
Why won't you just give up?

414
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,120
Because I want him.

415
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,600
Even if he's got a boyfriend
or children, I don't care.

416
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,080
Stop acting like an attention-seeking kid.

417
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,240
That's my problem.
It's none of your business.

418
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,840
I'm warning you, leave him alone.

419
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,080
I won't.

420
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,080
-Then, get out of my house.
-No.

421
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
So, leave him alone.

422
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm telling you I won't stay away
from Type. Never.

423
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Don't you get it?

424
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,520
Then, get out of my house.

425
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,640
-I won't--
-Get out!

426
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,400
I said get out!

427
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,640
-You're kicking me out?
-Yeah!

428
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,160
Fine!

429
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,080
I'm leaving!

430
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,040
Don't you know I'm doing this…

431
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,720
because of you!

432
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,920
So, why did you chase me away?

433
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,760
You're all I have.

434
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,560
Why are you doing this to me?

435
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,200
What about me?

436
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,240
Don't you ever think about how I feel?

437
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,440
Fiat.

438
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,040
Are you okay?

439
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,360
Leave me alone.

440
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm sorry.

441
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,080
Get up. Let's get inside.

442
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,400
You kicked me out, so why do you care?

443
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,280
Fiat.

444
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,320
Let's get inside.

445
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,040
No.

446
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,960
Stay still.

447
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,160
It hurts.

448
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,480
I'm sorry.

449
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,480
I'm going home.

450
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,440
How can you go home
when your knee hurts like this?

451
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,720
Stay the night here.

452
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,600
You're gonna yell at me again.

453
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,640
I won't.

454
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm going home.

455
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,160
I'm sorry…

456
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,680
for chasing you out like that.

457
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,280
I was angry that you didn't listen to me.

458
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,600
Please forgive me.

459
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,920
Don't chase me away again.

460
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,600
I won't do it again.

461
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,000
Why did you pull away?
I brushed my teeth and used mouthwash.

462
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,720
If you don't believe me, I can prove it.

463
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,920
This is how you prove it.

464
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,360
Fine, I believe you.

465
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,560
Are you going to stay up all night?

466
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,480
Yeah, you sleep first.

467
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,400
Type, I think you should rest.

468
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,800
Just do it tomorrow, please.

469
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,120
No, if I sleep now,
I won't wake up to do it tomorrow.

470
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Then I'll set the alarm for you,
and you can go to bed now, okay?

471
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,520
You've got some nerve.

472
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,600
You still turn off my alarm
even to this day.

473
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,600
I won't do it tomorrow.
Please go to sleep.

474
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,760
I don't believe you.

475
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,520
I'm serious, Type.

476
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,080
I think you should sleep. Get some rest.

477
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,640
I know I need to rest.

478
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,560
I love your after-shower scent.

479
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Why?

480
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,560
You mean, I normally stink?

481
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,520
No.

482
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,200
Your scent makes me feel at ease.

483
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,720
You should sleep.

484
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,040
I thought you said you'd rest.

485
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,400
I rested.

486
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,520
The hug earlier.

487
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,920
Come on, Type.

488
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,560
Please, I want you to sleep.

489
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:09,080
Or is there anything I can do for you?

490
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,240
You've helped me enough
by staying here with me.

491
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,280
Fine.

492
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,840
But I want to do more than that.

493
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,320
It reminds me of that day.

494
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,480
When I was kicked out of my house.

495
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,680
When you were crying in front of my house?

496
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,440
Yeah.

497
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,800
You still think about that?

498
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,080
I'll never forget it.

499
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,720
I remember that day clearly.

500
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:42,440
The day my dad kicked me out of the house.

501
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,320
Just because I didn't accept the woman
he was going to marry.

502
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,360
Why?

503
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,920
I was just afraid I'd lose him.

504
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
He was all I had.

505
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,960
But he kicked me out,

506
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,160
yelled at me.

507
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,840
Said I wasn't his son.

508
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,360
Damn it.

509
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,760
If you hadn't been there for me that day…

510
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,040
If your family hadn't let me stay here…

511
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,280
I really don't know how
I would have lived without you.

512
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,760
But today you kicked me out.

513
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,920
Just like my dad did.

514
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,920
I'm sorry.

515
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,760
I was just angry.

516
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,640
But I never meant to kick you out.

517
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,240
Anyone else can chase me away,
and I won't care.

518
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,040
But don't you chase me away.

519
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,840
I don't care if the whole world hates me…

520
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,640
or throws me away like trash.

521
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,360
But you must stay by my side.

522
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,600
Don't chase me away.

523
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,760
Don't leave me.

524
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,280
He hasn't come home yet?

525
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,960
What are you trying to do?

526
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,240
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

527
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,520
{\an8}IT'S COMPLETE.

528
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,640
{\an8}BECAUSE YOU RECRUITED
THE WHOLE FAMILY TO HELP YOU.

529
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,120
{\an8}THAT'S RIGHT. I ALMOST BUMPED
INTO TYPE WHEN I CAME DOWN.

530
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,440
{\an8}LUCKILY, I HID HER IN TIME.

531
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
{\an8}THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

532
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,480
{\an8}DON'T THANK ME, I DIDN'T HELP.
RIGHT, CHAMP?

533
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,680
