1
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,480
Type!

2
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,400
Type!

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,960
{\an8}ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

4
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,200
{\an8}POPS HURT HIS LEG.
MUST RETURN TO PHA-NGAN ASAP.

5
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,520
There you are.

6
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
Type!

7
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,800
Type!

8
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,440
Type!

9
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,600
Have you gone deaf, kiddo?

10
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
Pops.

11
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,440
Watch your step, don't trip.

12
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,520
Kiddo.

13
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
What's wrong? Why the long face?
What's upsetting you?

14
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
How could I not be upset?
Just look at you.

15
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,880
Your injury isn't that serious.

16
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,480
What, you wanted it to be more serious?

17
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,760
That's not what I mean.

18
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,960
But when you called me,
I was scared to death.

19
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,080
I haven't scolded you,
so you'd better reflect on your actions.

20
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,520
How dare you tell me
to reflect on my actions!

21
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,880
Pops, be careful!

22
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,200
You'll get a punctured lung
and another wound.

23
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,320
What?

24
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
A small mistake and you'll mock me
till my grandson is ordained?

25
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,400
Come on, Pops.

26
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,000
You should go sit inside.

27
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,360
You'll burden other people
if the wound on your leg festers.

28
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,560
No, why would I burden others
when my son's home?

29
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,680
If something happens, you'll be the one
to take me to the clinic.

30
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
Come on, Pops. Let's sit.

31
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm still in great shape. Come on.

32
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,360
You sure you're okay?

33
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,240
Good thing I already quit my job.

34
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
If I hadn't quit,
even if you'd chopped your leg off,

35
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,520
I don't know if that shitty boss
would have let me take leave.

36
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,880
That's perfect. You can finally come home.

37
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,520
Pops… after the long holiday…

38
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,680
No.

39
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,080
After your leg's healed, I'll leave.

40
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,240
Because of that stupid white boy? Tell me!

41
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,240
I think you should return home.

42
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,080
If jobs in Bangkok are so bad,
come help me.

43
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,040
And if that stinking white boy misses you,

44
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,400
he'll come see you.

45
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,320
As if he'd come.

46
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,720
That's even better.
Just break up with him.

47
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm so sick of him.

48
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm tired of you telling me
to break up with him three times a day.

49
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,720
I won't frickin' do it.

50
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,040
How dare you use
the f-word with your Pops!

51
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,240
Mom! Look at your husband!

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,120
He's as stubborn as a mule!
Come bring him inside!

53
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,200
Why, you little squirt!
What are you yelling for?

54
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,960
Mom, hurry up!

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,120
Damn it!

56
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
I'm leaving!

57
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,760
Maybe it's better to break up now?

58
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,200
Shit.

59
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,680
Guess it's noodles again.

60
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,120
Type.

61
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,800
I…

62
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,040
want you to make up with me.

63
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,720
You know it too…

64
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,640
You're the one who let him in.

65
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Shit.

66
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,680
Shit!

67
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,400
You can't even make an instant noodle.

68
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,640
Stupid idiot.

69
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,640
Why, Type?

70
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,160
Why wouldn't I…

71
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,680
be able to live without you?

72
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
You want to know, right?

73
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,360
Yeah.

74
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
I can't live without you.

75
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm pathetic.

76
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Are you happy now?

77
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,720
So that's why you're here…

78
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,480
moping like a man
who's been dumped by his wife?

79
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,320
Even if it's you,
I'll still get angry, you know?

80
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,000
Come on, I'm just kidding.

81
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,720
Type said that he'd
never break up with you.

82
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,080
But now…

83
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,720
he's gone back to his parents.

84
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,880
He has to take care of his parents.

85
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,520
You said it yourself
that his father hurt his leg.

86
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,720
So it's not right for you to sulk.

87
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,120
I'm not sulking, Dad.

88
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,760
What a liar.

89
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,560
Whose sister are you, really?

90
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,760
I'm your sister and Type's.

91
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,120
Therefore,
you guys must hurry and make up.

92
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,040
So you can become
my lovely brothers again.

93
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,280
Thanya, don't you have to be on set today?

94
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,920
You're going to be late.

95
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
You should go, Princess.

96
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,720
Thorn's probably
getting the car ready now.

97
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,600
-Don't think too much, Tharn.
-Okay.

98
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,440
Type really loves you.

99
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
I have to go.

100
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
Bye, honey. Good luck.

101
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
Did you have a fight with Type?

102
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,160
Don't look at him.

103
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,560
Even if your dad didn't tell me,
I'd still know.

104
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,200
Tharn, I don't know what's going on
between you and Type.

105
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,840
But I'll speak as someone who's been
married for more than 30 years.

106
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,040
What your mom's trying to explain is…

107
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,440
every relationship needs communication.

108
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,160
A lack of communication…

109
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,600
can even break apart
the most loving relationships.

110
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Understand, son?

111
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,000
Type…

112
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,360
I saw him with another man.

113
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,800
Did you ask him who that man was?

114
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
He said he was a patient.

115
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,640
I guess you don't believe him.

116
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,160
Tharn, you're not wrong
to have doubts about him.

117
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,840
I misunderstood
your dad many times myself.

118
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,080
I even caused a ruckus too.

119
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,280
But in the end, he proved
that I was the only one for him.

120
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,400
So, you're telling me…

121
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
to make up with Type?

122
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,720
You're probably too stubborn
to listen to anyone now.

123
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,440
But I'm going to tell you something
that you need to keep in mind.

124
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,200
Pride never makes anything better.

125
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,200
And both you and Type
are still young and full of pride.

126
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,200
And you know what?

127
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:21,360
I have a feeling
you're not the only one who's hurt.

128
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,520
Yes, I can confirm that
from my own personal experience.

129
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,840
How about I cook your favorite
dishes for dinner? Sound good?

130
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,320
Yes.

131
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,440
Okay, then, I'll go prepare dinner.

132
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
I'll help you.

133
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,800
We'll see how long
you last in the kitchen.

134
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,560
My good intentions
are more important than my skill.

135
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

136
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,720
Type.

137
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,720
If I apologize to you…

138
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,160
you'll come back, right?

139
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
It's still bothering you?

140
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,800
I don't know.

141
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm feel both scared…

142
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,440
and guilty.

143
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,120
Can you tell me about it?

144
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,840
I don't know how I'll face Type
if I see him again.

145
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,120
Then, go apologize to him with me.

146
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,760
I can't do it.

147
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,480
I promise I'll stay by your side.

148
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,920
Okay.

149
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,680
But you've got to come with me.

150
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,000
Type.

151
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,280
You and I…

152
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,640
have never been apart this long.

153
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
-What's for lunch today?
-All kinds of things.

154
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,800
-Look at that car. Wanna drive?
-Nope.

155
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,760
Let's go to the room
and put the stuff away first.

156
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,360
-I want to eat this one.
-Which one?

157
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,560
This one.

158
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,760
It's okay, I'm here with you.

159
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,160
Wait.

160
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,240
Can I talk to you?

161
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,280
It won't take long.

162
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,520
But I have nothing to say to you.

163
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,040
I want to apologize.

164
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,440
For everything.

165
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,720
We're not the ones
you should apologize to.

166
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,640
We know.

167
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,800
Fiat wants to apologize to him too.

168
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,320
What's going on, Phu?

169
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,400
It's a long story, Tharn.

170
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Tharn, let's talk inside.

171
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Please.

172
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,320
Please.

173
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,680
Fine.

174
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,320
If you have something to say…

175
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,040
say it.

176
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,120
You see--

177
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,920
I really want to apologize to you.

178
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,360
For causing you so much trouble.

179
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,000
You fought with Type because of me.

180
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,600
I've never felt good…

181
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,040
about what I did.

182
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
I really want to apologize to you.

183
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,240
I'm sorry I acted without thinking.

184
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,440
I've realized my mistakes.

185
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,000
And…

186
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,520
Please tell Type I'm sorry.

187
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,600
I don't know if he'll forgive me.

188
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm really sorry.

189
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,680
Phu…

190
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Here.

191
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,480
I'll…

192
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,280
tell Type…

193
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,640
you're sorry.

194
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Thank you.

195
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,840
Watch out! Behind you!

196
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,640
That was close.

197
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,720
Type, where are you going?

198
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
Come, let's have a chat.

199
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,280
About what?

200
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,480
Just sit down.

201
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,320
Remember the girl from that family
who studied in Chiang Mai?

202
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,280
Which family? There are quite a few.

203
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,960
The one with the daughter
with the pretty face and nice shape.

204
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,480
No, don't remember.

205
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,080
What the heck? You've got a worse memory
than your old man.

206
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,520
The girl with the nice shape
and plump hips.

207
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
So what if I can't remember her?

208
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,640
You want a mistress at such an old age?

209
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,920
You goddamned…

210
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,920
Don't you get it?

211
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,600
No, and I'm not planning to.

212
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,720
Wait!

213
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,160
Where are you going?

214
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Out, of course. I'm meeting with Khom.

215
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,760
That's good.

216
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,680
Go say hi to her on your way out.

217
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,720
Why should I? I don't even remember her.

218
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,360
She won't remember me either.

219
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,480
Says who?

220
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
She brought us snacks today.

221
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,640
When she saw you, she said
she hadn't seen you for so long.

222
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,400
And her eyes…

223
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,200
got all lovey-dovey.

224
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
I told you she remembered you.

225
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,920
Why don't you go say hello to her?

226
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,440
She's a real beauty.

227
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,280
Even more beautiful than your mom
when she was young.

228
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,640
What exactly do you want? Just say it.

229
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,920
A daughter-in-law.

230
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,080
You must woo her
and make her my daughter-in-law.

231
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,800
Listen to me, Pops.

232
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,120
Even if you bring me the greatest beauty
or the bustiest woman…

233
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,000
I'm not interested.

234
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,040
Because your son's taken.

235
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,400
And most importantly,

236
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,160
your son's partner is a man.

237
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,240
And don't push me to break up with him
because I'll never do it.

238
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,680
We're still together.

239
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,080
We're just taking a break.

240
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,600
How rude.

241
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,880
You ungrateful son, how rude of you.

242
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,080
How dare you say this to me!

243
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,240
Mom, Pops said he wanted the girl
next door to be his mistress.

244
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,200
Said she's way more beautiful
than a wrinkled hag like you.

245
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,480
You! You potty mouth! I never said that!

246
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,760
-Come here, kiddo!
-Bye, Pops.

247
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,040
Get back here, damn it!

248
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,040
How could he say that?

249
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,640
Hey.

250
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,160
Take it easy.

251
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,400
Why chug the whole can
when you just got here?

252
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,800
Something's bothering you?

253
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,240
I got into a fight with my dad.

254
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
A fight?

255
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,120
About what?

256
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,920
Uncle usually pampers you.

257
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,120
He wants me to have a wife.

258
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,640
But you…

259
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,280
already have a boyfriend.

260
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,160
Take it easy there.

261
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,280
The boyfriend I had a fight with recently…

262
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,760
Don't tell me you ran back here
because you fought with him?

263
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,360
You think I'm a wimp?

264
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,640
I came back because
my old man hurt his leg.

265
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,280
It just happened to be at the same time
as our problems.

266
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,800
Being apart after fighting…

267
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,400
is definitely no good.

268
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,560
Yeah, I know.

269
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,160
Easy fix, then…

270
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,680
make up with him.

271
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,200
It's not my fault this time.

272
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Type, no one's right or wrong
in a relationship.

273
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,320
He accused me of cheating.

274
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
What else?

275
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,880
So, I told him we should take a break
if he didn't trust me.

276
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,680
Type…

277
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,240
you shouldn't have said that.

278
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,280
You know what?

279
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,320
You're punishing him…

280
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,160
just like you're torturing yourself now.

281
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,160
'Cause Tharn's being unreasonable.

282
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,040
No one's reasonable all the time
in a relationship.

283
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,080
You're one to talk.

284
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,960
Can you say you've
never been unreasonable?

285
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,080
You don't know what Tharn's like.

286
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,000
When it comes to me,
he overthinks everything.

287
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,400
He keeps talking about marriage.

288
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
How could two men get married?

289
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,720
He always gets jealous and possessive.

290
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,200
Soon he'll probably get jealous
of the toilet seat I sit on.

291
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
You know what?

292
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,600
From everything you've said…

293
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,680
you know what really stood out?

294
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,480
You're bragging about how much
your boyfriend loves you.

295
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,400
Enough, I won't argue with you anymore.

296
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,400
Just give me a break.

297
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,680
All right. Just kidding.

298
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,120
Here.

299
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,160
What's this?

300
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,560
An uncle next door wants me
to give this to your parents.

301
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,920
His son's going to be ordained.

302
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,440
Khom.

303
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,080
Have you ever been ordained as a monk?

304
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,320
Yes.

305
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,640
You?

306
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,680
I was only ordained as a novice.

307
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,960
Then…

308
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,640
do it.

309
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,280
Since you're already back.

310
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,320
You might be able to apply
Buddha's teachings to your love life.

311
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,360
Type?

312
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,200
Are you serious?

313
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,080
What did you say?

314
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,040
So loud.

315
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,120
Pops, first the wounded leg,
and now you're deaf too?

316
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,560
Right.

317
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,720
You said you wanted to be ordained.

318
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,200
Yeah, you heard right.

319
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
I'm getting ordained.

320
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
What? Why so suddenly?

321
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,360
You don't want me to?

322
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,600
-Then, I won't.
-Hold on, son.

323
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,400
This is your decision.

324
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,840
But if you're getting ordained,
and your heart's against it,

325
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,120
you won't earn any merit.

326
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,080
Hear me out, Mom.

327
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,040
Okay.

328
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,080
If I can't give you grandkids…

329
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,760
I can at least become a monk
for you and Pops.

330
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,920
And I really wanna do it.

331
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
So, I think I'll go talk
to the head monk tomorrow.

332
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,160
If that's your decision, I won't stop you.

333
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,640
But right now, you need to wash up first.

334
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,920
You want to be ordained
after you've violated the fifth precept?

335
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
You stink of booze, I ought to spank you.

336
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,480
How could you drink so much?

337
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,680
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,400
-Go. Watch your step.
-I'm going.

339
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,800
Getting ordained.

340
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,680
Honey!

341
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
-What?
-He's getting ordained!

342
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,640
I know, I heard him too.

343
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,400
Is he getting ordained
before he gets married?

344
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,440
Don't jinx it.

345
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,120
The person he's marrying…

346
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,000
I don't wanna know.

347
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
Enough with the marriage stuff.

348
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,680
I'm gonna watch the drama.

349
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,640
Here comes my favorite actress.
Isn't she beautiful?

350
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,160
She's still young,
but she's already got the lead role.

351
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
You like her?

352
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,760
If Squirt got a girlfriend
who looked like her,

353
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,280
I wouldn't mind at all.

354
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Honey!

355
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,400
Stay out of our son's business!

356
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
Type.

357
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,560
Tharn.

358
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,960
I miss you.

359
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,600
<i>I really miss you.</i>

360
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,760
<i>Tharn?</i>

361
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I gotta go.

362
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,080
Get lost, Tharn!

363
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,480
We haven't talked to each other
for almost a month!

364
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,160
And all you said was, "I gotta go"?

365
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,880
Who do you think you are?

366
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
Have you got a death wish?

367
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,800
You want me to beat you up?

368
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Asshole!

369
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,600
Go to hell, for all I care!

370
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,920
I won't care about you anymore!

371
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,200
I don't give a damn what happens to you!

372
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,400
You've got nothing to do with me anymore!

373
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
Who the hell do you think you are?

374
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,480
How could you do this to me?

375
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,200
Is it really over?

376
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,560
Just like that?

377
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,600
Are you gonna leave me, just like that?

378
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,200
It's only been seven years.

379
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,240
I thought you'd never love anyone but me.

380
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,160
I thought you couldn't live without me.

381
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,080
It was just seven years.

382
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,760
Why, seven years ago…

383
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,040
Why did you make me love you?

384
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,000
Is this how it's gonna end?

385
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,400
Just like that?

386
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,800
Tharn…

387
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,160
It's okay, Type.

388
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,760
It's better this way.

389
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,080
You can get ordained
without any lingering feelings.

390
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,800
It's okay, Type.

391
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,720
It's no big deal.

392
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,040
You're gonna be okay.

393
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,240
Honey, I'm just rehearsing.

394
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,640
Tomorrow, I'll be dancing like…

395
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,280
Silly!

396
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,480
Type, come here, son.

397
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,080
Your old man's so excited
you're getting ordained.

398
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,840
How could I not get excited?
It's our only son's ordination ceremony.

399
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,400
Tomorrow, I'll send out invitations
and tell the whole island to come.

400
00:44:58,760 --> 00:44:59,840
Crazy.

401
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,960
What's wrong with him?

402
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,480
Just do your work!

403
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,880
He's sleepy.

404
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,120
Honey, stand at the front tomorrow, okay?

405
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,000
-Yes, I'm gonna dance.
-Dance at the front.

406
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,240
Yes!

407
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
You're so silly!

408
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,160
Doing the <i>Matrix</i> pose?

409
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,440
You crazy old man!

410
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,560
Pops,

411
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,760
can you please stop walking?

412
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,640
Last time you walked too much,
your leg got infected.

413
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,840
What's it gonna be this time?

414
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,320
Can you stay put for a day…

415
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,360
No, for a week?

416
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,920
How can I stay put?

417
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,080
I can't stand that person.

418
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,760
You can't stand who?

419
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
Mom?

420
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,640
She'll swat you like a fly.

421
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,440
Squirt, don't pretend you don't know.

422
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,600
Several weeks without his presence.

423
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,840
And here I thought I wouldn't
see him again this year.

424
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,760
But I was wrong!

425
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,280
What are you trying to say? Just say it.

426
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,160
Explain in a language
that normal people understand.

427
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,920
I can't! Darn it.

428
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,800
Pops!

429
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,760
Damn it!

430
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
This damn leg!

431
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
I'm gonna remove all these doors!

432
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,560
What's gotten into him?

433
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,800
-Type.
-Tharn?

434
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:59,720
I missed you so much, Type.

435
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,040
I missed you every day.

436
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,640
I missed you all the time.

437
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,920
Don't leave me again.

438
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,200
Choose, you want a punch or a kick?

439
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,720
Can I choose…

440
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,640
a kiss?

441
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,480
How about a kiss with my foot?

442
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,960
So…

443
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,080
how have you been?

444
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm fine now.

445
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:05,200
But if you'd showed up yesterday,
Thorn would've had to collect your body.

446
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,240
I'm sorry.

447
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,960
What are you sorry for?

448
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,320
Everything.

449
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,280
Don't half-ass it.

450
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,480
Explain what you've done wrong in detail.

451
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,360
Actually…

452
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,680
I didn't think I'd done anything wrong.

453
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,000
But now that I've seen your face again,
I'm willing to admit to anything.

454
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,840
I'm sorry for saying hurtful things.

455
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,000
I really hate it
when you say those things to me.

456
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,720
I'm sorry.

457
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,680
And I need you to remember this.

458
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,360
I'd never do anything behind your back.

459
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:19,920
If I had wanted to, I'd have done it
after I broke up with you.

460
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,400
I'm also…

461
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,040
sorry for letting my guard down.

462
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,040
To be honest…

463
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,760
there are many things I don't like
about your ridiculous jealousy.

464
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,600
Too many to count, actually.

465
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:48,440
These past years, you've been
showing more of your true colors.

466
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:55,280
And I'm sure there are many things
about me that you can't stand either.

467
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,000
But from now on…

468
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,240
I want us to communicate.

469
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,320
I'll try to be more patient…

470
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,160
and more mature.

471
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,560
And I won't let this shit happen again.

472
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,520
Because…

473
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,080
I don't wanna be apart from you anymore.

474
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,960
What you said earlier
about being more mature…

475
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,800
-Can you really do it?
-You jerk!

476
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,680
All right, can you forget about it?

477
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,520
Sure.

478
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,120
So…

479
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,240
can I kiss you now?

480
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,960
I've been waiting for you to do it.

481
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,880
What the hell are you doing!

482
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,080
Time's up.

483
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,440
But if you say the magic word,
I'll take a day off today.

484
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,600
I love you.

485
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,320
Let's go.

486
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,000
Why are you smiling?

487
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,320
Hurry up and do what you've got to do.

488
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,200
No.

489
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,400
Today…

490
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,400
I want to be gentle with you.

491
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,440
Let me be gentle with you, Type.

492
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,360
I'm not used to it.

493
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,240
Just once in a while.

494
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,520
Okay.

495
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,600
Phu.

496
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,640
You wanted to come here
just to eat snacks?

497
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,280
Yeah, the snacks at Khong's bar are tasty.

498
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,240
Here.

499
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,920
See? It's tasty.

500
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,160
Look who's here.

501
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,680
-Hello, Khong.
-Hello, Tharn's cousin.

502
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:55,680
I guess it's thanks to Tharn and Type

503
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,400
that you guys have become
my regular customers.

504
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,000
-You can say that.
-That's good.

505
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,240
By the way, the food here's really great.

506
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,200
That's to be expected.
Just look at this place.

507
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,000
The food's bound to be tasty.

508
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,600
But excuse me, can you not
order only food next time?

509
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,720
It isn't profitable for me.

510
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,520
Order a lot of booze
so that I'll earn more cash.

511
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,840
Sure, treat us today,
and we'll order booze next time.

512
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,640
Just this? Okay!

513
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,160
I'm rich, I'll treat you!

514
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,960
Jeed!

515
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,000
Don't tell Jeed I'm treating you.

516
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,960
I didn't say anything. I'm leaving.

517
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,520
-He's gone in a flash.
-Hello.

518
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,640
What's your name?

519
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,880
Jeed, Khong's cheating on you!

520
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,160
Shit!

521
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,160
We shouldn't prank him
when he's treating us.

522
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,560
I don't care.

523
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,120
Are you okay?

524
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,400
You're so quiet.
What are you thinking about?

525
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,400
Nothing.

526
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,240
I'm just thinking
that you're so handsome today.

527
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,680
What a sweet-talker.

528
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,920
'Cause I'm your boyfriend.

529
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,320
What?

530
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,320
What's this?

531
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:40,960
Where's the fierce looking,
straight-faced Cir?

532
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,880
He's been dead since he met Phugun.

533
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,120
So, what were you thinking about?

534
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,880
Do you think
Tharn and Type have made up yet?

535
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,000
Do you believe in Tharn?

536
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,200
Yeah.

537
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,520
I do too.

538
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,680
I think Tharn can handle it.

539
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,680
Because they love each other very much.

540
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,760
Yeah.

541
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,000
I think so too.

542
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,400
Then, we don't need to worry about them.

543
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,360
No, we don't need to worry
about them anymore.

544
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:46,960
Besides, I'm more worried
about my boyfriend.

545
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,640
It's late, already 10:00.

546
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,600
Let's go home.

547
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,920
We haven't finished the food.
What's the rush?

548
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,800
Let's leave after we finish the food.

549
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:18,120
What are you doing? We're in public.

550
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,280
-'Cause you're so cute.
-People might see.

551
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,400
Are you blushing?

552
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,600
-No, who says I'm blushing?
-You're blushing.

553
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,800
-You're blushing?
-People saw us.

554
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:28,920
My home…

555
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,640
is you.

556
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,640
I'm sorry.

557
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,400
And thank you so much.

558
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,280
For calling me.

559
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,360
It'd be nice if you've chosen to
stay in Bangkok because of me.

560
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,280
But wherever you are…

561
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,680
I'll always be with you.

562
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,600
I've been looking for you.

563
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
I was just taking a walk.

564
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,840
You were sound asleep,
so I didn't wake you up.

565
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,840
Wake me up next time.

566
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,400
I want to walk with you.

567
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,760
Are you that clingy with me?

568
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,720
Yeah.

569
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,480
I want to be with you all the time.

570
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:11,920
Type?

571
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,840
When I said I wanted to
be with you all the time…

572
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:33,320
I really meant it.

573
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,120
I want to be the one by your side.

574
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,200
I want to be with you
when you smile, when you cry.

575
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,000
I want to take care of you…

576
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,320
and be taken care of by you.

577
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,880
I want to be the one.

578
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,560
If I ask you now…

579
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,600
will you say yes?

580
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,640
Tharn…

581
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,440
<i>I will always be right here</i>

582
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,360
<i>I promise you I will not go anywhere</i>

583
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,920
<i>And I will give my all to prove to you</i>

584
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,440
<i>As long as you</i>

585
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,400
<i>Don't let go of my hand</i>

586
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
<i>For better or worse</i>

587
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,120
<i>I will stand by your side</i>

588
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,320
Will you marry me?

589
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,480
I want to take care of you.

590
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,360
I can't accept it now.

591
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,040
Tharn.

592
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,360
Tharn.

593
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,520
Tharn.

594
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,120
Tharn, wait.

595
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,120
There's a reason I can't accept it.

596
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,400
I'm getting ordained.

597
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:02,040
-Getting ordained?
-I told my parents…

598
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,600
that I may not be able
to give them grandkids…

599
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,600
but I can get ordained for them.

600
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,520
That's why…

601
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,880
I can't accept the ring from you now.

602
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,880
After I leave the monkhood…

603
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:30,760
propose to me again.

604
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,120
I'll accept the ring from you.

605
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:40,800
So…

606
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,400
does this mean…

607
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,920
Let me get ordained first,
then I'll marry you.

608
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,880
And there's something I need to tell you.

609
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,960
I've chosen to stay in Bangkok…

610
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,640
because of you.

611
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,360
Because my home…

612
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,960
is also you.

613
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,760
Isn't that what you said?

614
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:44,520
I love you, Type.

615
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,840
I love you too.

616
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,520
Champ.

617
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,960
Doc.

618
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,760
Have you finished work? I can wait.

619
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,760
It's okay.

620
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:45,720
I'm free now.

621
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,320
I was afraid you'd wait long,
so I hurried over here.

622
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,760
Here's the new dish
that I said I'd let you try.

623
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,680
Thank you.

624
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,160
Then I'll text you my review
after I taste it.

625
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,840
You should call instead,
in case I don't see my messages.

626
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,200
Sure.

627
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:21,320
Then…

628
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,680
I guess we'll be seeing less
of each other.

629
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:26,960
Why? What's wrong?

630
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,840
'Cause Type doesn't work here anymore.

631
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,000
Is that what you're worried about?

632
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:40,280
Are you crazy?
What's it got to do with Type?

633
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,600
I'll keep coming to see you as usual.

634
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,880
You're my restaurant guru,
so why wouldn't I come see you?

635
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,560
You really are a dummy.

636
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,400
What was that for?

637
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,720
I'd better go, I'm not telling you.

638
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,680
Doc, tell me first!

639
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,600
Not telling.

640
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
It's a secret.

641
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,640
Her acting is really good.

642
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,320
Pops…

643
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:22,960
where's Mom?

644
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,320
She left this morning.

645
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:31,520
A certain son wouldn't help with work.

646
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:34,240
Don't know where the hell
he's been all day long.

647
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,440
Seriously, Pops?

648
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,720
Your son's been
with this guy for years now.

649
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,800
When will you get used to it?

650
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,240
Never.

651
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,960
Kiddo, look at that.

652
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:56,680
On the TV screen.

653
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,480
I want a girl like this
to by my daughter-in-law.

654
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:06,080
I don't want this stinking white boy.

655
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,800
Tharn, enlighten my dad.

656
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:16,880
Go on.

657
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,680
What? Got a problem?

658
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,600
That girl…

659
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,920
Is she…

660
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,960
Thanya Thuwadara?

661
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,600
Yeah, that's her. You know her?

662
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,720
Thanya…

663
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,920
is my little sister.

664
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,920
She's Tharn's sister by blood.

665
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,280
You wanna see photos as proof?

666
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,920
Want to take a look?

667
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,720
-Your sister?
-Yes.

668
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:59,080
How's that, Pops? Are you happy now?

669
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,160
Your son…

670
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,880
found a boyfriend
who looks exactly like her.

671
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:06,640
See for yourself.

672
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,920
So, then, I'll bring Thanya
to visit you sometime.

673
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,960
I don't believe you!

674
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
Nutjob!

675
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,760
Someone like you?

676
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,640
-Whose father is he?
-Yours.

677
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,160
Your dad has good taste.

678
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,400
She looks exactly like you.

679
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:44,400
'Cause she's my sister.

680
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,280
Stop laughing at your dad.
I feel bad for him.

681
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:52,520
Scold me when you can
hold back your own laughter.

682
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,880
Come on, let's sit.

683
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,640
Who would've thought
your dad would like Thanya?

684
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:09,520
Good thing she and I have dad's genes.

685
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,200
Yeah.

686
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:13,240
Enough about your sister.

687
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,480
I'm not letting you stay here for free.

688
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:19,960
We're super busy.

689
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,480
Think you can handle it, Mr. Thara?

690
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,800
Apart from cooking…

691
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,800
I can do everything for you.

692
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,560
Good.

693
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:33,920
Then, tonight…

694
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,240
I'll do whatever you want.

695
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,560
I want to let you know…

696
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,560
Wherever you are…

697
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,440
I'll always be with you.

698
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,920
Okay.

699
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,160
I only found out now
that my dad likes Thanya.

700
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:11,480
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

701
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,200
{\an8}OH, MY! INVITING YOUR BOYFRIEND
TO THE GROUP?

702
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:20,720
{\an8}I'M NOT HIS BOYFRIEND.

703
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,320
{\an8}HE'S DENYING IT. WHAT SAY YOU, CHAMP?

704
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,000
{\an8}SHUT UP, TECHNO.

705
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,440
{\an8}I MADE UP WITH TYPE.

706
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,360
{\an8}YEAH? HOW DID IT GO?

707
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,640
{\an8}TYPE'S GETTING ORDAINED.

708
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,680
{\an8}NO WAY!
