1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,040
This table, how much was it?

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,760
The food.

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
And the lights too.

4
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,720
How much did you spend on all of this?

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,960
I overdid it again, right?

6
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
But I never said I didn't like it.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,880
Does this mean…

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,520
you like it?

9
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,480
I don't like it
when you waste money like this.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
But I appreciate what you're trying to do.

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
You did this for me, right?

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,280
I want you to relax.

13
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,920
I wanted to take you to the countryside.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,120
But we've barely had any time
to ourselves.

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
So…

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,680
a change of scenery.

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,840
So, I've got to let it slide, right?

18
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,760
Would you?

19
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,480
Seeing that you love me so much…

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
I give in.

21
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Tharn?

22
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,760
How long do you think
you'll be romantic with me?

23
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
As long as I can.

24
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you sure you won't get tired of me?

25
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,480
I definitely won't get tired of you, Type.

26
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,960
What, are you blushing, smiling like this?

27
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Yeah…

28
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,520
how could I not?

29
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,920
Thank you.

30
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,080
Let me stay like this for a while.
Let me recharge.

31
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
There's something I want
to thank you for as well.

32
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,160
Thank you, Type…

33
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,920
for coming into my life.

34
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,960
Bastard.

35
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
Why are you awake so early?

36
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,760
We don't have morning classes.

37
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
What's wrong with you this time?

38
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Shouldn't you pick up?

39
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,840
He only calls for a few reasons.
Probably wants to hang out.

40
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,400
It might be something else.

41
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Then, it's about soccer news.

42
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,200
It's better if I don't pick up.

43
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,680
Today's my day off. I'm gonna laze around.

44
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Why are you smiling?

45
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,080
It's our day off.

46
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,240
And?

47
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,560
And…

48
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,560
you're home.

49
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,680
Of course.

50
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,560
So…

51
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,000
shall we do something?

52
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,120
Just pick up.

53
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
Type, pick up.

54
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
This better be important!

55
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,560
What do you want so early?

56
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,280
<i>Are you crazy? It's already 11:00.</i>
<i>You call this early?</i>

57
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,560
Yeah, this is considered early in my book.

58
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,760
So, what do you want?

59
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,640
<i>Nothing much, dude.</i>

60
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>We haven't met up for so long,</i>
<i>so I wanna visit you.</i>

61
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,040
Don't come, you're not welcome.

62
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,360
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>Sorry, but I'm already downstairs.</i>

63
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,640
<i>Champ's with me too.</i>

64
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,080
If you can come, then you can leave.

65
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
Don't come. I'm hanging up.
I'm going back to sleep.

66
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,040
<i>Not leaving. Come get us right now.</i>
<i>Champ bought tons of food.</i>

67
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,200
-I said no! Gotta go!
<i>-Hold on, Type!</i>

68
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,720
What are you doing?

69
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,680
You know what I'm doing.

70
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
He hung up?

71
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
Yeah, damn.

72
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,160
I called ten times,
but he wouldn't pick up.

73
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,080
What do we do?

74
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,240
-Leave. Let's go.
-Wait a sec.

75
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,480
We can't give up so easily.

76
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,480
What else can we do?

77
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,840
We can't reach him,
and we don't have a key card.

78
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,680
All we can do is go home. Let's go.

79
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,480
-There's got to be a way, trust me.
-Okay.

80
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
Hey, excuse me!

81
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,840
Please come here. Yes, you.
Hold this for me.

82
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Excuse me.

83
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,520
You're Tharn's cousin, right?

84
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
-Yes.
-You moved in next door?

85
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,160
-Yes.
-Right?

86
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,600
And who are you guys?

87
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,880
My name's Techno. I'm Type's friend.

88
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,240
And this is Champ.

89
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,680
We're in the same circle of friends. Okay?

90
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,320
We're here to visit Type today,
but he won't come get us.

91
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,760
So what?

92
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,360
Can the two of us tag along?

93
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
-Please.
-How can we trust you?

94
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,160
Here. I can prove it.
I called Type many times.

95
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
Here, look. See?

96
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
Can you see?

97
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,560
Easy, Cir.

98
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,080
Damn, stop eating.

99
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
Please excuse us.

100
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,640
Wait a moment, please slow down.

101
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Just a moment.

102
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,080
How about this?

103
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,200
Please let us tag along for a second.

104
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,400
And we'll stop bothering you
once Type comes to get us.

105
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,400
Okay? Please. Okay?

106
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,760
All right, then. Okay? Come on, Cir.

107
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Fine.

108
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,640
Thank you, bro.

109
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,760
-Let's go, Champ.
-Sure.

110
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,600
-I'm gonna deal with those lovebirds--
-You coming?

111
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,880
Yes, coming!

112
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,240
-Damn, he's aggressive!
-Wanna eat?

113
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,440
At a time like this? Come on!

114
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,280
-Surprise!
-Surprise, my ass!

115
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,960
Ringing like that,
why don't you just take the bell home?

116
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
Maybe I could just borrow it
for a few days.

117
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,360
Why are you two with them?

118
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Techno said he's your friend,
so I brought them with us.

119
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,040
Aren't I clever?

120
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,200
Don't be too trusting,
especially with people like them.

121
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,760
Hold on a sec.

122
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,640
What's wrong with people like us?

123
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,200
Our faces scream "nice guy".
One smile and people come right up to us.

124
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,400
But your face…

125
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,640
You can scare people off
with just a frown.

126
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,160
Looks like you forgot
what my beatings feel like.

127
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,720
Type, don't worry about me.
I have Cir by my side.

128
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,560
He can take care of me, right?

129
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,680
It's my job.

130
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,560
Fine, come in if you want.

131
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,280
-Of course!
-You've already come this far.

132
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,840
-Come.
-What's going on!

133
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,800
-You stepped on my foot!
-Sorry, I didn't mean to.

134
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,080
You two can eat with us.

135
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,560
So, tell me,
what's the occasion for this party?

136
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,520
I just wanted to meet up with my friends.

137
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,080
Because my friend and I
barely see each other.

138
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,680
Because my friend
is so clingy with his hubby.

139
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,360
You mean, Champ?

140
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,040
I mean, you, damn it!
Hold on. Speaking of Champ,

141
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,960
we're also here to celebrate
that his restaurant hasn't gone bankrupt

142
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,640
after being open for a month.

143
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,640
And what's that got to do
with you, Techno?

144
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,920
It's got nothing to do with me.
I'm just looking for more reasons.

145
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,680
Champ, Techno is cursing your restaurant
to go bankrupt.

146
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,480
Tharn, wait a sec. Did I think too loud?

147
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,800
You couldn't be more obvious.

148
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,880
No, you're cursing my restaurant?

149
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,640
Sorry, I didn't mean to.
I was thinking too loud.

150
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,960
What a bunch of idiots.

151
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,280
What?

152
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
Don't mind them, Phugun.
Just ignore these clowns.

153
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,640
But I'm having fun.
You guys seem very close.

154
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,920
I'm his best friend.

155
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,680
You could say I've been present
for every millisecond of Type's life.

156
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,360
-I'm gonna take this if you don't shut up.
-That's my chicken! Damn it, Champ!

157
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,400
-Leave some for your friends.
-There's plenty left.

158
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,280
I bought it,
and I don't make as much money as you do.

159
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,320
-'Cause you talk too much. Just dig in.
-The hell?

160
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,160
Don't steal another piece.

161
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,720
Phu, we met them in our freshman year.

162
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,920
But Type and Techno have been friends
since high school, right?

163
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,200
-Right.
-So how did you meet them, Champ?

164
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,320
I lived on campus.

165
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,160
One day, Type wanted to switch rooms,
so Techno came to ask me if I would.

166
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Good thing we didn't do it.

167
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,360
This is nice. You guys have been friends
for a long time and are very close.

168
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
Yeah.

169
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,120
By the way, you've been dating
for seven years, right?

170
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,920
Yeah, it's been seven years.

171
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,120
But I still love Type
the way I did in our first year.

172
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Here comes the first blow.

173
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Have you ever heard
of the "seven-year itch" curse?

174
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,240
Are you worried?

175
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,280
No.

176
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,400
It's not scary at all.

177
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,520
-You're not afraid?
-No.

178
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,480
But I am.

179
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,520
I'm afraid…

180
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,880
that you'll stop loving me.

181
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,040
-What's wrong?
-I wanna barf…

182
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,920
but I don't wanna waste the chicken I ate.

183
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,920
You can still be lovey-dovey
after seven years?

184
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,680
By the way, have you guys
experienced any bad luck?

185
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,680
In my case,
the worst I've encountered is my boss.

186
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,000
Hold on, what's that got to do
with the seven-year itch?

187
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,560
I said I wasn't afraid of it.

188
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,080
No matter what happens…

189
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,560
I'll be holding Type's hand…

190
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,240
and we'll make it through anything.

191
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,080
Champ, call Doc.
I need a blood sugar test.

192
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,760
Inject insulin into my belly right now.

193
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,640
What'd you say?

194
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,920
Easy, dude. Put that down first.
It's sharp, be careful. Let's eat.

195
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,920
Want to talk to me?

196
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,320
You can tell?

197
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,080
Yeah.

198
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,320
I see you and Type
being so loving with each other.

199
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah.

200
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,200
I… love Type very much.

201
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
And he really loves me too.

202
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,440
He just doesn't admit it.

203
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,280
I love Phugun too.

204
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to be with him for a long time.

205
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,840
Just like you guys.

206
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,480
Don't follow in our footsteps.

207
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,400
Type is pretty unique.

208
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,560
Actually…

209
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,800
he doesn't want to tell anyone
that we're in a relationship.

210
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,200
Really?

211
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,920
Yeah.

212
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,440
I think I'd better give them a hand.

213
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay.

214
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,240
Dumbass! Uno!

215
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,040
Let me see. You've got five,
but you didn't play it.

216
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,920
-Dude, your hands are full.
-'Cause I saw a yellow card.

217
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,600
No, I only have one card left.

218
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,720
One card?

219
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,200
I'm the winner. Come on, it's just a game.

220
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,760
Who do I choose?

221
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,920
Maybe…

222
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,320
I choose you, Type.

223
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,040
-Come on.
-Just give your order.

224
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,560
I order you to…

225
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,520
kiss Tharn on the mouth.

226
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Hold on, Daddy. Sit still for a sec.

227
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,000
I like it.

228
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,520
Hold still, handsome.
He ordered me to do it.

229
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Fine, I'll hold still.

230
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Who is it, Type?

231
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
It's my coworker.

232
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,920
-I'll take the call outside.
-Okay, just go.

233
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,560
Bummer, what terrible timing
to make a call.

234
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Deal the cards. I'll get you this time.

235
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,360
Bring it on!

236
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,920
Do you even know what "winning" is?

237
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,760
-Wanna take it outside?
-Take it easy, ex-boxer.

238
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,400
Don't worry too much.

239
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,560
Phugun.

240
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,120
Gonna bully me again?

241
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Don't think like that.
What do you take me for?

242
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,320
Can I have your Line ID?

243
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Yeah, give me your Line ID. Hurry!

244
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,000
-Just give it to me.
-Okay.

245
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Hurry up.

246
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,360
-But…
-What?

247
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,480
Don't text me too often.

248
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,480
Why?

249
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Someone will get jealous.

250
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,640
Okay, whatever.

251
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,080
-Just kidding.
-It's fine, just send me his contact info.

252
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,920
What's up, dude? Everything's fine.
Nothing fishy at all. So, what's up?

253
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,320
We're dealing the cards.
Nothing suspicious at all.

254
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,960
Shuffling!

255
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,720
-I need to go to the hospital.
-Who's sick?

256
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,320
-My boss called me in.
-On your day off?

257
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
I don't know what's going on either.

258
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,760
Let me give you a ride.

259
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
Phu, let's go.

260
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,280
In that case,
we should return to our room.

261
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,240
-Come on, Cir.
-I gotta go too.

262
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,640
I'm leaving too.
Gotta go to my restaurant.

263
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,640
-See you.
-What do you mean "see you"?

264
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
We came together. Wait a minute!

265
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,680
Take me with you. We came together.

266
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,800
Don't leave me, man.

267
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,000
You're finally here, Thiwat.

268
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,360
I thought I'd have to wait all day.

269
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I was stuck in traffic.

270
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,360
So, why did you call me in, sir?

271
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,760
It's about your vacation leave request.

272
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,800
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't approve it?

273
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,960
Yes, I'm aware.

274
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,360
But I found someone to trade shifts with.

275
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,320
You really persevere. Unbelievable.

276
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,200
But no matter
who you've traded shifts with,

277
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,440
I won't approve it.

278
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
Because I told you we're short-staffed.

279
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,240
-So, you won't let me take leave, correct?
-Right.

280
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,640
Because I'm your superior.

281
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,400
In that case, I need to thank you.

282
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,680
Thank you for letting me know
that older people…

283
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,960
aren't necessarily more mature.

284
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,280
Thiwat!

285
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
You've gone too far.

286
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,320
Watch what you say.
Don't give me any attitude.

287
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,200
Yes, I'm aware that you're my superior.

288
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,720
Will that be all, sir?

289
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,680
If so, please excuse me…

290
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Boss.

291
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,320
Thiwat.

292
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,720
Thiwat!

293
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,480
Type!

294
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,280
Big problem!

295
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,840
What's going on?

296
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
You've gotten a warning notice
from the boss.

297
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,600
I knew it would come to this.

298
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,120
It's like I said, he's really immature.

299
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,680
He must have lost it.

300
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,280
Nobody has ever insulted him
to his face before.

301
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,840
I'm glad he knows I insulted him.

302
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,800
I've just about had enough of him too.

303
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,240
Should I just punch him?

304
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,240
-And sign a resignation letter in advance.
-Calm down!

305
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,520
You said you'd work here for a year.

306
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,320
Listen, go straight home after work.
Don't ambush him, okay?

307
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Okay.

308
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,560
Okay.

309
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
Hello, Champ.

310
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,000
I sent the restaurant's location
to your Line chat room.

311
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
<i>I saw it. I'm calling to ask</i>
<i>when you're getting off work.</i>

312
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,160
Today? I'm not sure. Maybe around 5:00.

313
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,600
<i>Want me to pick you up?</i>

314
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,600
It's okay, I brought my car today.
I'll see you at the restaurant.

315
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,920
<i>Okay, text me when you're leaving.</i>

316
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,680
<i>Judging from the map,</i>
<i>I should get there before you.</i>

317
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,200
Okay, see you at the restaurant.

318
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,280
Listen, Dr. Thiti called Type over
yesterday about his leave request.

319
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,960
But they got into an argument.

320
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,320
Type insisted on taking leave.
He even looked for a replacement.

321
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,640
-Really?
-Yeah.

322
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,120
But they're short-staffed,
so Dr. Thiti didn't approve it.

323
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,160
So Type insulted him, said he was immature

324
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
and lacked compassion
for his subordinates.

325
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
My goodness.

326
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,360
Never knew he'd dare insult his boss.

327
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
I would've returned the favor
if it were me.

328
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Never thought he'd be so daring.

329
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,000
He looks calm and collected,
but his words are too harsh.

330
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,400
By the way, I heard Dr. Thiti
gave him a warning notice, right?

331
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,400
That's right.
If I were Dr. Thiti, I would've felt bad.

332
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,760
He wanted a civilized conversation,
but instead he got insulted.

333
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,720
Yeah.

334
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,440
Excuse me.

335
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,600
Doctor, you want to gossip with us?

336
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,560
What's it about?

337
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,760
Just between us,
it's about the sports medicine department.

338
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,920
Hear about Type,
the sports medicine doctor?

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,520
Your Type?

340
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,600
That's the guy.

341
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,680
I heard he fought with Dr. Thiti again.

342
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,600
He's handsome, but he's been so naughty.

343
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,600
He steals other people's girlfriends.

344
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,120
He's a snitch.

345
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
And now he's demanding more days off…

346
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,160
even though he knows how hectic
the hospital is during long holidays.

347
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,600
Do you genuinely like him?

348
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,080
Of course I like him,
but he's terribly demanding.

349
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,880
If you have any questions,
you can talk to me.

350
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,720
Let's go.

351
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
Come on!

352
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,680
Again?

353
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,880
How many times do I have
to go through this shit?

354
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,800
{\an8}MR. THARA'S SO FOCUSED ON HIS WORK.

355
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,600
{\an8}STOP FILMING ME.

356
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,320
{\an8}Shit.

357
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,920
Gil, seriously, stop posting
my clips on IG stories.

358
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,600
My face is all over your IG,
you know that?

359
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Just stop posting.

360
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,280
What's wrong with you?

361
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,880
-Calm down.
-How can I calm down?

362
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm not in a good mood like you,

363
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,280
talking on the phone
and laughing all day long.

364
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,080
Do you know what I went through today?

365
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,880
The whole hospital thinks I'm an asshole

366
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,720
because of that damned boss!

367
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,080
He told everyone I insulted him.

368
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
Son of a bitch!

369
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,840
Why didn't he tell them about
what he forced me to do every day?

370
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,720
And why didn't you tell me
about all of this?

371
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,600
What do you want me to say?

372
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,440
Seeing you so happy,
I don't want to ruin it.

373
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,560
What do you mean, happy?

374
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,160
What you've seen is me working.

375
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,680
And I didn't mess around with anyone.

376
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,840
Work?

377
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,400
Yeah, work.
So why are you taking it out on me?

378
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,240
I'm gonna sleep somewhere else.

379
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,120
I won't let you.

380
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
I'm going.

381
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,520
Type, what's the matter?

382
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,920
Can I crash at your place tonight?

383
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,160
-What about Tharn--
-I can sleep on the couch.

384
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,400
Please, Phu.

385
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,440
The thing is…

386
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,560
I think you'd better settle things
with Tharn first.

387
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,760
Can you not mention his name right now?

388
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
I'm begging you.

389
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,120
All right, come on in, Type.

390
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,240
Type…

391
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,160
what are you doing here?

392
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,480
This reminds me of our college years.

393
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,640
When you fought with Tharn
and stormed into my room.

394
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yeah…

395
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,120
it's been a long time.

396
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,800
There.

397
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,600
Tharn's here to bring you back.

398
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,240
Khlui, don't open the door for him.

399
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,960
Why can't I?

400
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,480
With how things are between you guys…

401
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,800
if Seo was here too,
our gang would be complete.

402
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
Speaking of which…

403
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,520
I miss Seo.

404
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,120
Seo!

405
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,640
What are you saying? I don't understand.

406
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,360
I didn't get to debut.

407
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,760
I've got nothing left.

408
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,080
My whole life's efforts have been in vain.

409
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,680
Calm down, stop crying.

410
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,720
It was my dream!

411
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,200
I worked hard my whole life,
so why did it end up like this?

412
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,760
I just wanted to follow my dream.
I never hurt anyone!

413
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,880
That's how real life is.
It's not rosy like in novels.

414
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,080
He's right. You've got to get over it.

415
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,480
I know it's not like the novels.

416
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,600
I was mentally prepared,
but it still hurts.

417
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,840
I practiced and trained my ass off.

418
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I even practiced in my dreams.

419
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,600
But I still failed in the end.

420
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,120
But you've still got Khlui by your side.

421
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,760
That's right, I'm right beside you.

422
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,800
Don't cry.

423
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,200
I should go back to my room.

424
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Cheer up, Seo.

425
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,560
Type, hold on!

426
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,880
Where are you going? Help me first.

427
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,320
-Good luck, Khlui.
-Type!

428
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,200
Khlui, don't leave me too.

429
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,360
I wanna be nosy,
but I've got to console my friend…

430
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,760
Come here!

431
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,080
Go on, cry your heart out.

432
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,360
<i>He only told me about his shitty boss.</i>

433
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,440
-But he was really pissed, Techno.
<i>-Really?</i>

434
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,320
<i>Tharn, I don't know either,</i>

435
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,880
<i>but I guess</i>
<i>he's got it really rough this time.</i>

436
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,160
<i>Otherwise, someone like him</i>
<i>wouldn't have exploded so easily.</i>

437
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,120
If you don't know, then no one else will.

438
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,480
So…

439
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,000
I'll wait till he calms down
and ask him myself.

440
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,920
<i>Hold on. What you said before…</i>

441
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,480
<i>it sounded like a backhanded</i>
<i>compliment saying I'm nosy.</i>

442
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,480
<i>Must be my imagination.</i>

443
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,000
<i>I've got an idea. Why don't we ask Champ?</i>

444
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,920
<i>He's been super chummy</i>
<i>with Dr. Khunpol lately.</i>

445
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,000
<i>He might know something.</i>

446
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,400
It's okay, you don't have to.

447
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,520
<i>I'll call Champ, so just hang on a sec.</i>

448
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,240
<i>I'm back.</i>

449
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,520
<i>Hello, Tharn.</i>

450
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,920
<i>Techno told me everything.</i>

451
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,280
<i>Type hasn't said anything to me.</i>

452
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,920
<i>But I'm with Doc now.</i>

453
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,720
<i>He's got something to tell you.</i>

454
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,360
<i>Hello, Tharn. This is Khunpol.</i>

455
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,000
<i>I'm Champ's friend,</i>
<i>and I work at the hospital with Type.</i>

456
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,760
<i>I heard the nurses talking this afternoon.</i>

457
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
HOW ARE YOU, TYPE?

458
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
THE PROBLEM YOU TOLD ME ABOUT…
HAVE YOU SOLVED IT?

459
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,960
I know everything.

460
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,240
About what?

461
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,360
What happened at the hospital.

462
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,280
How did you find out?

463
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,760
Champ…

464
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
let me talk to Dr. Khunpol.

465
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720
And Doc said…

466
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,160
that you were…

467
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,440
being bullied by your boss.

468
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,720
And that you also got a warning notice.

469
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,440
And that…

470
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,080
the hospital staff
are gossiping about you.

471
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,120
That's exactly right.

472
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Actually…

473
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,520
about the warning notice…

474
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,600
I already knew…

475
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,080
that I was gonna get it.

476
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,120
But I never thought that the scumbag…

477
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,680
would start false rumors to slander me…

478
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,760
and spread them through the hospital.

479
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,040
You know I hate
being the center of attention.

480
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,800
But today…

481
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,520
at the hospital…

482
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,960
people kept staring at me…

483
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,560
gossiping about me.

484
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,960
It really sucks.

485
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,880
Type…

486
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,280
What?

487
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,800
Why don't you quit?

488
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
I can still take it.

489
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,040
I'm just upset about today.

490
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,960
I'm asking you one more time.

491
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,360
Why don't you quit?

492
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,280
You don't need to stay for a year.

493
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,720
If you quit…

494
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,080
you can still find a job
that you want to do.

495
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,480
I can take care of you, Type.

496
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,880
Fine, don't quit.

497
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,800
I know…

498
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,520
that my little Type…

499
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,520
is the best.

500
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,720
This too shall pass.

501
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,960
Can you hold me?

502
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,920
I'm holding you right now.

503
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,200
I want you to hold me tight.

504
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,360
Then…

505
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,440
I'll keep holding you like this…

506
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,880
all night long.

507
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,840
Type…

508
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,280
when I said you should quit…

509
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,560
I meant it.

510
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,400
I can work and provide for you.

511
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,560
Yeah.

512
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,960
I know.

513
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,080
But I don't wanna run
from my problems anymore.

514
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,880
All this time…

515
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,720
I've been running away.

516
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,280
When I was young…

517
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,400
I fled to Bangkok…

518
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,400
because of that incident.

519
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,240
In our freshman year…

520
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,320
I had a problem with you…

521
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,960
and I wanted to run away from you.

522
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,080
I tried putting everything on you.

523
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,000
But now…

524
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,280
I'm not that same old Thiwat anymore.

525
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,160
I must take responsibility for my words.

526
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,680
I said one year,
and I'm gonna keep my word.

527
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,280
I've only got to endure…

528
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,120
for a few more months.

529
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,920
Type…

530
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,000
don't forget.

531
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
You have me.

532
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,520
I can still endure…

533
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,080
because I've got you.

534
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,920
Let's forget about it.

535
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,680
Let's eat.

536
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,000
I don't wanna be late.

537
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,880
Come on.

538
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,720
Type…

539
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,560
I have to go out of town for work.

540
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,120
For the new song?

541
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,200
Yeah.

542
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,680
I need to research regional music.

543
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,760
In case I can use it in my work.

544
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,520
When are you gonna leave?

545
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,640
Today.

546
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,000
I'll go home, pack my bag,
and leave right away.

547
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,200
Why don't you let me know
when you get there?

548
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,560
Type…

549
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,960
You know there's been a lot going on,

550
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,680
so I didn't have a chance to tell you.

551
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,240
Forget about it.

552
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,240
You've still got to work.

553
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,280
Yeah.

554
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,840
So, how long will you be gone?

555
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,960
Two weeks.

556
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,000
Type…

557
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,120
If I finish early…

558
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,280
I'll come back to you right away.

559
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,440
Okay?

560
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,880
Thanks for giving me a ride.

561
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,040
Have a safe trip.

562
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,080
Gotta go.

563
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,720
-See you, Type.
-Yeah.

564
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,320
Here.

565
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,320
I'll entrust this to you
in case of emergency.

566
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,120
Don't worry.

567
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,680
Phugun told me.

568
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,960
Okay, then, I should be going,
or I'll get there late.

569
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,080
Tharn, text Phugun when you get there.

570
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,320
He tends to worry a lot.

571
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,840
-Sure, thanks.
-Yeah.

572
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,120
Thiwat.

573
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,640
What the hell is this?

574
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
What do you mean?

575
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,040
Even a baby could do better
than your sloppy work.

576
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,680
Look, has no one ever told you to take
your professional reputation seriously

577
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,400
and not behave disgracefully?

578
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,720
What are you talking about?

579
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:11,400
About you kissing your man passionately
in front of the hospital.

580
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,800
I don't care what you do
in your free time.

581
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,960
But this is a hospital.

582
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,680
It's a workplace.

583
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,880
A sacred place.

584
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,240
It's okay if you're brainless.

585
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,600
But you should at least think
of our department's reputation.

586
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,400
I'm sorry.

587
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,160
It won't happen again.

588
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,880
You don't have much time left, anyway.

589
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,600
And go tell your man…

590
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,840
that even though he's a complete moron
who was never taught proper manners,

591
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,120
he must be mindful of this place.

592
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,960
As for you,

593
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,760
go get a health checkup.

594
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,520
I'm afraid your patients
might doubt your credibility.

595
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,800
Most importantly…

596
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,160
please get your lover tested as well.

597
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,080
Get a thorough checkup.

598
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:19,000
Because I'm afraid he might
have caught many diseases.

599
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,280
Type! Calm down!

600
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,840
You can look down on me!

601
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,040
But do not insult Tharn!

602
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,840
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

603
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,920
{\an8}YOU GUYS, DID YOU KNOW?

604
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,840
{\an8}HOLY GUACAMOLE!

605
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,360

606

{\an8}ABSOLUTELY TACTLESS.
KISSING AT A HOSPITAL?

607
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,920
{\an8}HAVE THEY NO SHAME?

608
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,680
{\an8}DO YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?

609
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,520
{\an8}IT'S TYPE, SPORTS MED DEPARTMENT.
