1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,920
Thiwat.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,680
What the hell is this?

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
What do you mean?

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,760
Even a baby could do better
than your sloppy work.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,040
Look, has no one ever told you to take
your professional reputation seriously

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
and not behave disgracefully?

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,520
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,360
About you kissing your man passionately
in front of the hospital.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,160
I don't care what you do
in your free time.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,600
But this is a hospital.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a workplace.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,240
A sacred place.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
It's okay if you're brainless.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,960
But you should at least think
of our department's reputation.

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,520
It won't happen again.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,120
You don't have much time left, anyway.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,120
And go tell your man…

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,160
that even though he's a complete moron
who was never taught proper manners,

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
he must be mindful of this place.

21
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
As for you, go get a health checkup.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,880
I'm afraid your patients
might doubt your credibility.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,160
Most importantly…

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,520
please get your lover tested.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,440
Get a thorough checkup.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,080
Because I'm afraid he might have…

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,240
caught many diseases.

28
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,400
Type! Calm down!

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,920
You can look down on me!

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,400
But do not insult Tharn!

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,480
You punched me?

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm gonna fire you!

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
Don't come any closer!

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,360
I'll get you for this!

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,680
Bring it on!

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,560
I don't wanna have a boss like you either!

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,640
And don't waste your energy firing me.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,000
I quit.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,120
Fine, as you wish!

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,040
Type! Calm down!

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
I've had enough!

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,520
You can insult me.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
But never insult my man!

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,880
Since my boss is a son of a bitch
who can't tell right from wrong…

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,200
I'd rather be unemployed.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,800
Remember what you did.

47
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,880
This is far from over!

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,160
I'll get you for this!

49
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
-Go ahead.
-Type!

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,440
What are you doing? I'll call the cops!
I'm gonna fire you!

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,760
And you won't be able to work
in this field anymore!

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,280
No one is going to hire you!

53
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,720
Please, stop.

54
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,440
Mr. Thiti, Mr. Thiwat,
the director has called for you.

55
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,120
Director…

56
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,240
I will not accept workplace violence.

57
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,520
Look at what he did.

58
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
He punched me in front
of the whole hospital.

59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,240
You must give him the maximum penalty.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Look at him.

61
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,200
After everything I said,
he won't even apologize.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,520
I warned him many times,
but he never listened.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,800
His work is sloppy…

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
but he still wants to take a vacation.

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,680
Because of his poor behavior, I gave him
a warning notice, but he's still defiant.

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,480
And look what he did to me!

67
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
Dr. Thiti, I've been informed
of what happened.

68
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,640
But I must listen
to both sides of the story.

69
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you have to say?

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,520
Nothing, sir.

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,120
I did punch Dr. Thiti.

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,560
See?

73
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,440
I recommend dismissal.

74
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,640
As far as the penalty's concerned,
we must wait for the board's decision.

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,440
But since violence was evidently used
and there are actual eyewitnesses…

76
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,960
the board will likely agree with you.

77
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,680
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
No, sir.

79
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Very well.

80
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
This is actually perfect timing
because I need to talk to both of you.

81
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Would you care to explain
the document in this file?

82
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
BOOK THREE (FIVE)

83
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,800
This document…

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,160
It's the budget document
that might not be quite ready.

85
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
Did you write it yourself?

86
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,280
Yes. But like I told you,
it's not quite complete.

87
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
So, let me take it back and revise it.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,480
Are you sure you didn't make
someone else write it?

89
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes, Director.

90
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,960
How could I let anyone else
handle such an important document?

91
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
Then, take a look at this.

92
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
BOOK THREE - BOOK THREE

93
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
What's this?

94
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Why do you have a document
identical to mine?

95
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,200
That should be my question.

96
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,600
You said you wrote it yourself.

97
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,520
So, why are there two identical documents
if you didn't make someone else write it?

98
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Dr. Khunpol, please help me explain.

99
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,680
Before I explain the document,

100
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,520
there's something you should be aware of.

101
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,680
I know that Mr. Thiwat was ordered

102
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,120
to perform tasks
outside of his job description.

103
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Many times.

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,120
-It's not true, I didn't do it.
-When I found out

105
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,400
that Mr. Thiwat had to write
the procurement document,

106
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
I informed the Director.

107
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,520
I switched this document
with the one that Mr. Thiwat wrote.

108
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
And sent the identical copy
to the Director beforehand.

109
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:53,000
Writing procurement documents
isn't Mr. Thiwat's responsibility.

110
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,680
Therefore, these two documents
are clear evidence that Dr. Thiti…

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,160
isn't the one who wrote them.

112
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,960
You two are plotting against me, right?

113
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,400
You forged a document
and switched it with mine.

114
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,120
Then, how could you blame Mr. Thiwat
for being sloppy with the document…

115
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,600
if you didn't order him to write it?

116
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,360
I already knew…

117
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
that you'd blame him.

118
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,960
But I never imagined that you'd do it
in front of the whole hospital.

119
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,720
So, explain this to me.

120
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,520
Why do your subordinates
file so many complaints

121
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
about your misconduct?

122
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,080
Abuse of authority, for example,

123
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
and the use of inappropriate language,

124
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,240
which affects work performance
and emotional well-being.

125
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,560
And worst of all, sexual harassment.

126
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,320
Wait. Hold on, Director,
there must be some misunderstanding.

127
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,080
This must be a smear campaign.

128
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,080
Doctor…

129
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,080
you're trying to slander me, right?

130
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,480
I get it now.

131
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,200
Because you're close to Thiwat, right?

132
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,840
You teamed up and forged
the document to defame me, right?

133
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,080
Dr. Thiti!

134
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,320
I told you I love my family, didn't I?

135
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,120
And if someone speaks like this
to my family, I won't put up with them.

136
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,040
Doc and Director…

137
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,880
Dr. Khunpol is my youngest nephew.

138
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,960
MMY HOSPITAL

139
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,960
Please handle this for me.

140
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,280
Doc.

141
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,280
Type, you guys have finished talking?

142
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,480
Just now.

143
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
I learned about how you've helped me.

144
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,440
Let's sit down.

145
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
So…

146
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,520
what exactly happened?

147
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,120
I haven't done anything.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,040
Besides switching documents
and asking your uncle to help me…

149
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,400
what other rules did you break for me?

150
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,640
I really can't hide anything from you.

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,560
Please tell me,
so I'll know how to repay you.

152
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,440
I don't like owing favors.

153
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Then…

154
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,680
you'll have to repay Tharn.

155
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,000
What's it got to do with Tharn?

156
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,920
Besides switching documents,

157
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,800
I asked my uncle to have you work
under another supervisor.

158
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,200
But as you know,
the problem was Dr. Thiti.

159
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,960
I couldn't just ignore what I saw.

160
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,200
And the rest is history.

161
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,520
So, what's it got to do with Tharn?

162
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Everything.

163
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,320
Tharn asked me to do it.

164
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,240
Tharn.

165
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
You haven't met Doc, right?

166
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,400
-Doc, this is Tharn, Type's boy--
-Doc.

167
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,920
That day when you told me
Type was being bullied.

168
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>I heard the nurses talking</i>
<i>in the afternoon.</i>

169
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,640
Can you give me
a full account of what happened?

170
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,320
-Tharn, I haven't finished speaking.
-Champ…

171
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,480
not now.

172
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,640
Okay, I know you're stressed about this.

173
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,240
Doc, tell him what Type's been through.

174
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,000
As I said on the phone…

175
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,240
Type's been getting picked on
for a while now.

176
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Everything he's done has been criticized.

177
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
He isn't allowed to rest or take leave.

178
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,560
And the hospital staff
have been gossiping about him.

179
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
And most importantly…

180
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
he's been assigned tasks
that aren't his responsibility.

181
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,360
Then…

182
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
is there…

183
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
any way I can help him, Doc?

184
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,080
How are you gonna help him?
Disguise yourself as a nurse?

185
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Champ…

186
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,640
I just wanted to lighten the mood.

187
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,440
You know that Type can look after himself.

188
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,320
This is Type we're talking about,
after all.

189
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,120
That's what I'm worried about.

190
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
He may…

191
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,080
seem like a tough guy…

192
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,800
but he thinks way too much.

193
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,280
He's only tough on the outside.

194
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,800
Do you remember our freshman year?

195
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,440
He was misunderstood
by practically the whole university.

196
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,760
He was really hurt.

197
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,080
I don't want him
to get hurt like that again.

198
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
So, Doc…

199
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,840
can you help?

200
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,480
I--

201
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,800
How can I help him?

202
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I've been trying to find evidence.

203
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,080
I have an idea, Doc.

204
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,520
Will you please help me?

205
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,680
Yes.

206
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,560
Type is my friend too.

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,640
So…

208
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,600
if you're going to repay anyone,
it would have to be Tharn.

209
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,240
But you're the one
who carried out the plan.

210
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,920
So it's right to repay you.

211
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,160
Tharn really loves you.

212
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,480
I think so too.

213
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,120
But don't you worry, Doc.
I'll definitely thank Tharn.

214
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,280
Anyway, I must thank you too, Doc.

215
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,240
If you want to thank me,

216
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
can you start
by not speaking to me so formally?

217
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Yeah…

218
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,600
since I'm gonna quit anyway.

219
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,920
Then…

220
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,040
Doc, you asshole.

221
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,680
Okay, no offense taken.

222
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,480
And don't worry
about getting any police reports.

223
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,360
The Director's promised me
this matter will end here.

224
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,400
As for Dr. Thiti,

225
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,320
we'll have to wait and see
what his punishment will be.

226
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,520
I--

227
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,640
Never mind.

228
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,520
I don't give a damn what happens to him.

229
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm satisfied
I got to punch him in the face.

230
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Yes, that was a powerful punch.

231
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,400
You must be really tired after today.

232
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
Go home and get some rest.

233
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,840
I'll call you if something comes up.

234
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,360
Thanks so much, Doc.

235
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,440
When I said I didn't like owing favors…

236
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,120
I really meant it.

237
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,440
So if Champ's gonna be so clueless…

238
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,760
I'll help you.

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,800
Last piece of advice I wanna give you.

240
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
Be brave.

241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,840
I'm leaving. See you.

242
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,000
{\an8}THARN, ABOUT THE THING WITH TYPE'S BOSS…
DOC SAID NOT TO WORRY.

243
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,200
{\an8}IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

244
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,760
{\an8}HOW?

245
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,960
{\an8}YOU FREE? I'LL TELL DOC
TO CALL YOU IN THE EVENING.

246
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,040
OKAY.

247
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,680
Tharn, the boss is asking for you.

248
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
What does he want?

249
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,960
How would I know? He's calling me in too.

250
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I thought we'd get to rest
after we arrived.

251
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,920
But damn, he wants me to work right away.

252
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,400
You know people here are workaholics.

253
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,360
Yeah. And you, hurry up. Don't dillydally.

254
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,120
-I don't wanna hear an old man complain.
-Okay.

255
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm going to tell the boss
that you bad-mouth him.

256
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,760
-Yeah, I bad-mouth him. Hurry up.
-Let's go.

257
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
TYPE

258
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,520
BE BACK IN TWO WEEKS.
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. I'M WORRIED.

259
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,760
TYPE
MISSED CALL

260
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,320
TYPE
CALLING…

261
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
<i>Hello?</i>

262
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,080
Type, you're sleeping?

263
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
<i>Yeah, what time is it?</i>

264
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,280
It's only 11:00.

265
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,560
<i>But 11:00 is really late.</i>

266
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
Yeah.

267
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,880
You're right.

268
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,160
I miss you.

269
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
<i>Miss you.</i>

270
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,080
I'm glad you miss me too.

271
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,480
I miss you so much, Type.

272
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
<i>You just left this morning.</i>

273
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,680
Yeah, it's because
I just left this morning.

274
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,040
I really miss you.

275
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Just like you do.

276
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
<i>I was talking in my sleep.</i>

277
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
Can I feel hurt by that?

278
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,040
<i>You're ridiculous.</i>

279
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I am?

280
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
<i>Downright ridiculous.</i>

281
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
<i>I miss you too.</i>

282
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Me too.

283
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,560
<i>Yeah.</i>

284
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,520
You're sleepy?

285
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,120
<i>Yeah.</i>

286
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,560
<i>The ordeal with my boss is over,</i>
<i>so I'm relieved.</i>

287
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,440
<i>Don't know why I've been so sleepy.</i>

288
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,440
<i>-And…</i>
-And?

289
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,280
<i>Thanks.</i>

290
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
Sure.

291
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
You should go to sleep.

292
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,920
You've barely slept these past months.

293
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
And…

294
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,120
Rest up.

295
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,280
When I get back, let's discuss
what we're going to do next.

296
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,680
<i>-Tharn…</i>
-Tharn!

297
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,560
-Tharn!
-What the hell, Gil?

298
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,400
Let's go to sleep.

299
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,920
Come on, let's go.

300
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,440
Type, I gotta go.

301
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,760
And…

302
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,600
Good night.

303
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,080
-The hell? Why are you drunk?
-What?

304
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,600
Who's drunk? You're mistaken.

305
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,520
A few shots of rice whiskey
can't do nothin' to me.

306
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,040
If you say so.

307
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,480
You said you went out for dinner.

308
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,360
But now you're drunk as a skunk.

309
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,240
It's not every day
that the boss treats me.

310
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,560
Why didn't you come with us?

311
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,440
We're in the north, so how could you
miss the Khantoke dinner?

312
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,520
I think you enjoyed the rice whiskey
more than the Khantoke.

313
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,880
Working's out of the question.
Let's go back.

314
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
-Come on, let's go.
-You go first.

315
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,560
<i>Tharn!</i>

316
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,440
{\an8}MR. THARA'S SO FOCUSED ON HIS WORK.
STOP FILMING ME.

317
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,000
{\an8}Shit.

318
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,840
So much for getting any sleep.

319
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,480
Shit.

320
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,200
You didn't have to come with me.

321
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,360
It's too late.

322
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,560
How will you leave if I leave now?
I drove you here.

323
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,280
By taxi, of course.

324
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
Careful with your knee.

325
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,640
You really wanna end up
in the surgery room, right?

326
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,520
Leo.

327
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,760
You don't have an appointment today.

328
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,760
Hello, Teng.

329
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,360
Is Type here?

330
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,480
He's not in today.

331
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,560
Then, it was a wasted trip.

332
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,240
I even bought lots of snacks.

333
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,200
But it's okay, I'll give them to you.

334
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,760
-Thanks.
-Sure.

335
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,840
Will Type be in tomorrow?

336
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,680
No, he quit.

337
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,440
What?

338
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,600
He quit yesterday.

339
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,480
Why didn't I hear about it?

340
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,280
Type never told me.

341
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,640
As if he had time to tell you.

342
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,920
Anyway, Type's already quit.

343
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,480
Someone will take over from him.

344
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
So, keep your appointment.

345
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,160
As for this, thanks so much.
I'm going back to work.

346
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,480
Fiat.

347
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,760
Give it back.

348
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,960
That's enough.

349
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,840
I said, give it back.

350
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,080
Enough.

351
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,120
-Give it back!
-You should stop.

352
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,800
He's got a boyfriend.

353
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,040
-I said, give it back!
-Fiat.

354
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Give it back.

355
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,920
Why?

356
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,840
'Cause it's happening again.

357
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,520
It's happening to me again.

358
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,640
Every time I really want someone…

359
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,320
I never get them.

360
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,440
Not every time.

361
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
Every time.

362
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,560
When I wanted my dad back,

363
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,800
he abandoned me.

364
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,880
My feelings for Type are real…

365
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,320
but I've still been abandoned.

366
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,720
Am I that obnoxious?

367
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,200
But I never hated you.

368
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,680
Because you're my friend, just a friend.

369
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
No matter how well you take care of me…

370
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
it's not the same.

371
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
Right.

372
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,720
I'm just a friend to you.

373
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,840
So, help me.

374
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,720
Please?

375
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
I've been helping you this whole time.

376
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,800
Thank you, Leo.

377
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,360
Thank you.

378
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,440
What is it?

379
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,120
That guy's address.

380
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
How did you get it?

381
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,480
Doesn't matter.

382
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,080
Stop crying.

383
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,080
I don't wanna console you.

384
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,720
What? I'm not crying.

385
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,880
Yeah.

386
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,840
If you say so.

387
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,880
Get up if you're happy.

388
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
I'm hungry…

389
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,840
and I have afternoon classes.

390
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,000
Leo…

391
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,320
What do you want this time?

392
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,600
My knee hurts.

393
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
Please.

394
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,800
You know me best.

395
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,720
Thank you.

396
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,080
Don't thank me.

397
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,360
Don't.

398
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,960
I'd do anything for you.

399
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Here you go.

400
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,280
Mom.

401
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,120
I think it's too much.
I can't finish it all.

402
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,920
Nonsense,
I don't think it's enough at all.

403
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,120
Oh, dear, there's one more dish.
Wait a moment.

404
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,360
Mom.

405
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,040
I almost forgot.

406
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,520
Stir-fried spicy fish.
Your favorite, right?

407
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,600
What did Tharn tell you?

408
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,760
Not much, but we have a general idea
of what you went through.

409
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,880
Actually, you guys don't have
to worry about me.

410
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,760
I only quit my job.

411
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,400
It might look trivial to someone else,
but I believe it's a big deal for you.

412
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,920
How can I not worry about you?

413
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,920
I can handle it.
Please, don't worry about me.

414
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,920
You're really the same, you and Tharn.

415
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,400
You always say, "Don't worry."

416
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,080
You're my son.

417
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,000
No matter how much you grow up,
I will always worry about you.

418
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,960
Why the long face, Type?

419
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,200
Listen, you're like another son to me.

420
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,040
Let me worry about you.

421
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,360
That's right.

422
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Type, everyone in our family
will always support you.

423
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,360
Come here if you ever need to relax.

424
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,840
And if you're ready…

425
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,800
I think Tharn is also ready
to take things to the next level.

426
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,600
Dad and Mom are dying to have another son.

427
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,080
Thanya, don't pressure him.

428
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,920
Type, eat up, okay?
You've lost so much weight.

429
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,880
The middle son is worried.

430
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,360
Okay.

431
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,360
You're like my sister too, Thanya.

432
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,800
And, Mom…

433
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,680
I love you as if you were my real mother.

434
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,080
Thank you, son.

435
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,600
Hello, Type.

436
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,200
How did you find this place?

437
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,040
It's a secret.

438
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,560
Then, leave.

439
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,840
Please, hold on.

440
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,320
Why did you quit?

441
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Why do I need to tell you?

442
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
Because you're the one who treats me.

443
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,560
You're wrong, that's Doc and Teng.

444
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,120
You can ask Teng for advice.
I've entrusted everything to her.

445
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,920
But I don't trust anyone but you.

446
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,280
You know how I was
when I thought I couldn't play basketball.

447
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,800
Yes, I used to be an asshole.

448
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,360
But it was because I knew
no one cared about my knee.

449
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,640
Only you really paid attention to my knee.

450
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,320
But there's nothing I can do now.
I've already quit.

451
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,560
Then, can we go upstairs to talk?

452
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,560
No, my partner doesn't like
people coming into our room.

453
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,480
I really wanna talk to you.

454
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,640
Please.

455
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
Please, Type. Please.

456
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,600
Then, let's go somewhere else.

457
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,960
We've got a customer. Take care of them.

458
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,360
-Type?
-Hello, Jeed.

459
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,320
You're still managing the bar
while you're pregnant?

460
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,320
That's right. Can't you see that
my customers are young chicks?

461
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,400
If I don't stay alert,
Khong will definitely stray.

462
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,040
I won't have it.

463
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,760
Hello.

464
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,960
Hello.

465
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,840
Please, enjoy yourself.

466
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,640
Let me talk to Type for a second.

467
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,640
-Okay.
-Go wait inside.

468
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,640
-Come sit here!
-What's gotten into you?

469
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,280
What's gotten into you?

470
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,160
Does Tharn know you're bringing
a boy toy to my bar?

471
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,440
Jeed, watch what you're saying.

472
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,600
I know what I'm saying.

473
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,320
Look at him, so good-looking.

474
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,080
And the way he looks at you, Type.

475
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,800
Like he wants to eat you up.

476
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,720
If I had a boy toy,
I wouldn't bring him here.

477
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
Everyone knows you're on Tharn's side.

478
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,080
Poor boy, are your feelings hurt?

479
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,680
I'm on both of your sides.

480
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,080
You're a big boy, so don't sulk.

481
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,080
I've known you since you were a kid.

482
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,560
And now…

483
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
Jeed.

484
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
How you've grown.

485
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,360
Just kidding.

486
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,120
Okay, I'll believe there's
nothing between you guys.

487
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,720
Today, I'll believe you.

488
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,960
You've got to believe me every day,
no matter what.

489
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,680
So…

490
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,600
How's my nephew?

491
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,240
He's healthy.

492
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,160
Can I touch it?

493
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,920
Type.

494
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,320
I'm your sister.

495
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,360
Why are you crossing the line?
You're making me blush.

496
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,520
-Khong, where are you?
-It's not what you think.

497
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,760
I just wanna touch your belly.

498
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,640
-You mean, the baby?
-Yes.

499
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,920
Fine, go ahead.

500
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,840
You scared me. Hold on a sec!

501
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,800
Before you touch my belly,
I want a gift for my baby.

502
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,040
I'm not choosy, so I'm fine
with either gold or an envelope of money.

503
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,760
Okay.

504
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,000
Okay, it's a deal. You can touch now.

505
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,720
-Don't get so antsy, hurry up.
-I'm nervous.

506
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,880
How is it? Feel the kick?

507
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
-The baby's kicking.
-That's right.

508
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,480
He likes you. Look, he won't stop kicking.

509
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,680
-Look, look.
-Cute.

510
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
-So is his mother, right?
-Cute like his mother.

511
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,200
I'll stop nagging now.

512
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,960
You're close to the owner?

513
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,520
I've come here since freshman year.

514
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,360
Before they moved and expanded the place.

515
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,160
That explains it.

516
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Let's get to the point.

517
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,640
You should drink first. We'll talk after.

518
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,960
I'll be honest…

519
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,680
I've got a partner.

520
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,680
I know that.

521
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,640
-So stop chasing after--
-It's a man, right?

522
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,120
You don't have to answer me.

523
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,480
But I just wanna let you know.

524
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,000
I like men too.

525
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,760
Why are you telling me this?

526
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,960
I just want to let you know…

527
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,640
that I've rarely met people
with the same preference.

528
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,480
No, to be accurate…

529
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,040
I've rarely met people with
the same preference who are kind like you.

530
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm not kind.

531
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,320
Of course you are.

532
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,080
You're kindhearted, Type.

533
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:32,240
But won't a kind person like you keep
his promise about taking care of my knee?

534
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,920
But I've quit.

535
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,960
But that doesn't mean
you have to cut me out of your life.

536
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,400
Can I at least be your brother?

537
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,920
I don't think so.

538
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,040
Or you could just give me advice.

539
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,640
Only if it's not too often.

540
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,320
Thank you.

541
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,000
Stubborn.

542
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,600
I get that a lot.

543
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,400
Actually, I'm pretty jealous of you.

544
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,720
What's there to be jealous of?

545
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,840
To be honest…

546
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,840
I've never had a boyfriend.

547
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,080
For people like us,

548
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,280
isn't it all about sex?

549
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,200
It's hard to find a boyfriend
who truly loves you.

550
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,680
Your boyfriend…

551
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,040
has he ever cheated on you?

552
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,680
No.

553
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,400
That's what I thought.

554
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,040
Cheers.

555
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,640
HAS TYPE GONE HOME YET?

556
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,560
HE LEFT HOURS AGO. WHY?

557
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,720
I CAN'T GET HOLD OF HIM.

558
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,040
{\an8}HE LOOKED TIRED. MAYBE HE'S SLEEPING.

559
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,840
{\an8}TIRED?

560
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,960
{\an8}MOM SAID IT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

561
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:37,240
{\an8}HE JUST QUIT HIS JOB.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

562
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,320
{\an8}THANKS. I'LL BRING YOU SOUVENIRS
WHEN I GET BACK.

563
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,040
CUTE WHEN DRUNK.

564
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,520
{\an8}NUMBER FIVE

565
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,880
{\an8}Here, my restaurant's new dish.

566
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,360
Got the idea from the place
you took me to last time.

567
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,880
You copied their recipe?

568
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,840
It's called inspiration.

569
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,840
You said you wanted a dish
with edible flowers.

570
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,200
So I came up with this one.

571
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,480
Come to think of it,
it's not because of that place.

572
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,080
I think it's because of you.

573
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,520
-Because of me?
-Yeah.

574
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,120
So I'm gonna name this dish…

575
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,080
"Khunpol's flowers."

576
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,640
What do you think?

577
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,600
No good?

578
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,520
Such a tease.

579
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,560
What did you say?

580
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,080
Nothing, nothing. I just think…

581
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,520
You don't think much, do you?

582
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,160
You mean the dish's name?

583
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,520
If Techno and Type were here,
they'd probably say I was brainless.

584
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,960
I'm not saying you're brainless.

585
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,760
You're the only one
who thinks I'm not brainless.

586
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,720
Right?

587
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,520
Speaking of Type,

588
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,880
I met the kid who hurt his knee today.

589
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,320
Remember? The one I told you about.

590
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,960
What's that got to do with this?
I was talking about us.

591
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,760
I think that kid likes Type.

592
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,560
That kid?

593
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,680
He likes Type?

594
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,240
A crude guy like Type?

595
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,440
Yeah, it's true.

596
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,680
His eyes, his body language…

597
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,320
It's obvious.

598
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,240
If you say so, but I kinda
don't get those kinds of things.

599
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,880
Really? Then, how about this?

600
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,440
Should we tell Tharn?

601
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,480
Don't, it might go badly.

602
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,200
Type can handle it, I guess.

603
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:43,200
Let's just say the dish's name
will be "Khunpol's flower", okay?

604
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,480
Because this dish is for you.

605
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,680
Type told me to be frank.

606
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,080
-So I'm going to be frank with you.
-Sure.

607
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,080
-Dummy.
-What?

608
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,400
-Why are you calling me a dummy?
-'Cause you really are one.

609
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,480
-How am I one?
-Isn't it obvious? Dummy.

610
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,680
Don't call me that.

611
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,000
Type.

612
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
You okay?

613
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,200
Type.

614
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,000
How the hell am I okay?

615
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,080
When will you come back?

616
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,560
Type.

617
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
Wake up.

618
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,480
Wake up.

619
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,640
Tharn.

620
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,800
Don't leave me again.

621
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,080
Please stay by my side.

622
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,480
{\an8}FIAT

623
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,920
{\an8}FIAT.

624
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,920
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU?

625
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,440
{\an8}FIAT, ANSWER ME.

626
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,120
{\an8}CAN YOU ANSWER ME?

627
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,760
{\an8}PLEASE, ANSWER ME.
