1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,080
Type.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,520
You okay?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,600
Type.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,560
How the hell am I okay?

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,200
When will you come back?

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,800
Type.

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,000
Wake up.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,920
Wake up.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,760
Tharn.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't leave me again.

11
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,600
Tharn.

12
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Don't leave me again.

13
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,960
Let's go home.

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
You're very drunk.

16
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,840
Let's go.

17
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,240
Watch your step.

18
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,880
Type…

19
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
are you okay?

20
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Leo?

21
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,600
Go home!

22
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,680
No!

23
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,240
Let go!

24
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
I said, go home!

25
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
You're very drunk tonight.

26
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm going with Type!

27
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,040
This is my chance. I won't let it slip by.

28
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm not coming with you!

29
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,040
If you don't keep quiet
and come back with me…

30
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,480
I won't be nice to you anymore.

31
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
So, what if I don't?

32
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,080
Fine!

33
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,640
What? Leo!

34
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,200
I've been angry enough for one day.

35
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,160
You don't want to see me get any angrier.

36
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Put me down.

37
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,600
It hurts!

38
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,760
What the hell are you doing!

39
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,440
If you've got something to say, say it!

40
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,760
What are you doing?

41
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,400
That's my question, what were you doing?

42
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,040
What was I doing? I didn't do anything.

43
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,080
So, what was that I saw before?

44
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,760
You're not making any sense.
I'm going home.

45
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,080
Who said you could go?

46
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,520
You must've gone crazy!

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,360
You're the crazy one!

48
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,560
Leo…

49
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,680
What's gotten into you?

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,680
I'm scared.

51
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,840
Because you…

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,080
Forget it.

53
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,920
Sleep.

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,200
We'll talk tomorrow.

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm going home.

56
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,480
I won't let you.

57
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,080
And I'm still angry with you.

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
If you don't want me to get angrier…

59
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,400
sleep.

60
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,400
I haven't showered.

61
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,320
It's fine, don't.

62
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't wanna drag a drunkard
out of the bathroom.

63
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
Leo…

64
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
If you don't shut up,

65
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,680
I'll gag you.

66
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,240
Leo…

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
I'm warning you.

68
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,080
If you don't shut up…

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
Don't be mad at me.

70
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,960
Sleep.

71
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
My head hurts.

72
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,480
-Shit!
-What, my baby's popping out?

73
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,840
-What the hell, Type?
-Khong!

74
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Why are you here?

75
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
This is my house!

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,040
Were you too drunk to remember anything?

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,520
Don't tell me…

78
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
you and I…

79
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,760
Who knows? If I didn't have Jeed…

80
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,880
Are you out of your mind!
What are you thinking?

81
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
-What's all the ruckus?
-Honey.

82
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,720
-Be careful.
-How do you feel, Type? You okay?

83
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,200
Jeed, how did I get here?

84
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
You really don't remember anything,
do you?

85
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,240
All I know is I was drunk last night.

86
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
At least you remember you were drunk.

87
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,520
But next time, please remember that
this pregnant woman dragged you here.

88
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,360
If my baby pops out, you're dead!

89
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,680
What baby popping out? Foul mouth!

90
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,200
-Don't overreact!
-I'm sorry, honey.

91
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,680
I only lifted him up.

92
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,240
You're the one who dragged him back here.

93
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,040
You'd have chewed me out
if I didn't do it.

94
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,160
Of course I would!

95
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
How could I leave him
lying in front of the bar?

96
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
-Heartless!
-Calm down, don't be furious.

97
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,800
It'll affect the baby.
Please sit down, gently.

98
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,240
So, last night, I was drunk at your bar.

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
And you brought me back here.

100
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,800
-Right?
-Yeah!

101
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Seriously, Type, are you okay?

102
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,800
You usually don't drink so much
if Tharn isn't with you.

103
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
It's nothing…

104
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,240
It's just…

105
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
Just forget it.

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,320
If you say so. I'm glad it's nothing.

107
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,720
-Ask him some more.
-Look at his face.

108
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,640
He's stressed.

109
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,360
It's nothing, Type.

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,040
But let me warn you.
Be more careful next time.

111
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,000
We may run things at the bar,
but we can't help you every time.

112
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,400
Help with what?
The kid you brought last night?

113
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
Jeed!

114
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,880
-What?
-Still asking?

115
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
How about this?

116
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Since you don't look so good,
why don't you rest some more?

117
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,320
-You can leave when you feel better.
-Good, good, good.

118
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,280
Come here, you're going back to sleep?

119
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,840
-Get up!
-Okay, coming.

120
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Khong, you're so nosy about Type.
You kept asking him questions.

121
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,440
Aren't you the nosy one?

122
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
Just kidding.

123
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,440
-Honey.
-Come here!

124
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm coming.

125
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Leo?

126
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
Where are you?

127
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,040
Leo?

128
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,320
Here to whine right away
after you wake up?

129
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm not whining.

130
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,520
Didn't you say we've got something
to talk about in the morning?

131
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,720
It's already noon.

132
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,560
Don't be annoying.

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
What do you want?

134
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
I should be asking you that.

135
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,240
What the hell was wrong
with you last night?

136
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,960
Why did you drag me back?
And why are you mad at me?

137
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

138
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,680
How can you say
you didn't do anything wrong?

139
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,440
When will you realize
that what you've done is wrong?

140
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
What have I done?

141
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,440
You want me to say it out loud?

142
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,640
I've never gotten involved
when you mess around or sleep with anyone.

143
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,360
But it's different this time.

144
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,720
I warned you,
you're messing with a taken man.

145
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,800
And you know very well
that he's got a boyfriend.

146
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,520
What have you done?

147
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,480
I can't stand watching my friend
acting like this anymore.

148
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,800
You need to stop, Fiat.

149
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,360
What if I don't?

150
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,200
What if I want Type to be my husband?

151
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,240
-What would you do?
-Fiat.

152
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,920
What?

153
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,240
Can you be my husband instead?

154
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
You can't.

155
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,720
I can be your husband.
But can you stop sleeping around?

156
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,120
That day…

157
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,800
I shouldn't have promised…

158
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,200
to stay by your side forever.

159
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,240
I really shouldn't have.

160
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,080
Why don't you notice
the man who's by your side?

161
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Damn it!

162
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,960
Tharn, why don't you just pick up?

163
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,520
I miss you like crazy.

164
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,160
Hello, Type.

165
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,880
What do you want? I'm not feeling well.

166
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Let's talk later.

167
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,760
<i>Wait…</i>

168
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,040
Wait, Type.

169
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,000
Tharn.

170
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm tired.

171
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
I've got a headache.

172
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
I miss you.

173
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,200
Why have they been so quiet lately?

174
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,840
I can't hear anyone.

175
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,240
Or…

176
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,320
is this the wrong spot?

177
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,760
What are you doing?

178
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
Why are you surprised?

179
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,640
Have you never seen a brokenhearted man…

180
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,880
whose dreams are shattered?

181
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,320
Okay, calm down.

182
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,440
Calm down!

183
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,000
Stop crying. I can't spy on them.

184
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,200
You've got to console me, I'm crying.

185
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,160
Fine, I'm consoling you. Damn!

186
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,040
I'm doing it now.

187
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
Console me now.

188
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,080
-Damn, I'm doing it.
-Console me first.

189
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,160
The hell's wrong with you?

190
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,880
-Console me.
-I'm doing it now.

191
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,400
Tharn.

192
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Tharn.

193
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,120
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

194
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,960
I knocked and called you,
but you didn't hear me.

195
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
'Cause I'm working.

196
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,240
What do you want?

197
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,880
I know you're working
and you want to hurry back to Bangkok.

198
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,320
But what the hell?
You turned off your phone to avoid me?

199
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,040
-What do you mean?
-I couldn't reach you.

200
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
I guess the battery's dead.

201
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm sorry. So, what do you want?

202
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,120
Nothing.

203
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,680
So…

204
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
how's the song for your wife going?

205
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,320
What?

206
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,720
I've been eating and sleeping
near you for more than a week.

207
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,480
And I know you spend your nights
writing a song for him.

208
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,840
I want to marry him as soon as I can.

209
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,280
But he hasn't said yes.

210
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,400
What? Showing off your wife again?

211
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,640
No, he called me.

212
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,320
I'll call him back.

213
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,040
<i>Hello?</i>

214
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,440
Type…

215
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,640
you just woke up?

216
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,480
Your voice sounds weird.

217
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>Why didn't you answer my call?</i>

218
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,720
Your voice is hoarse, Type.

219
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
Are you sick?

220
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,360
<i>No. Can't I ask for some love?</i>

221
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,680
You can ask for it anytime.

222
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,440
But you have to answer me first…

223
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
are you okay?

224
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,240
<i>I've got a headache.</i>

225
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
And what else?

226
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,000
<i>The pain's driving me crazy.</i>

227
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,360
<i>Looks like I've got a fever too.</i>

228
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,520
So…

229
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,200
You haven't gone to see a doctor?

230
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,960
<i>No, but don't worry,</i>

231
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,160
<i>I'll get better</i>
<i>after I take some medicine.</i>

232
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,200
No, Type. You need to go to the doctor.

233
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,720
I've decided to return to Bangkok now.

234
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
<i>Don't.</i>

235
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,840
<i>I've just got a headache and a fever.</i>

236
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
<i>You think I can't take care of myself?</i>

237
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,520
If I leave now, I think I'll get there
by tomorrow morning.

238
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,560
In the meantime,
I'll ask Phu to take care of you, okay?

239
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,080
<i>Don't.</i>

240
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,720
<i>I called you because…</i>

241
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,840
<i>I missed you.</i>

242
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,360
But you're sick, Type.

243
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,720
<i>Then, finish your job</i>
<i>and hurry back to me.</i>

244
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,640
I want to go back to you now.

245
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,800
I miss you.

246
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
<i>Yeah.</i>

247
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,480
Hey, dude.

248
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,080
Please, tell me what's going on.

249
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,840
I'm going back to Bangkok.

250
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,080
What the hell?

251
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,800
You can't leave now.

252
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,600
Your work's almost done. Finish it first.

253
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,160
Why can't I leave?

254
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
Because I know you're a responsible guy.

255
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,440
Finish your work first.

256
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,800
You think your boyfriend will
be happy if you go back now?

257
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,800
Calm down.

258
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,840
From what I heard,
he told you not to back, didn't he?

259
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,280
Phu.

260
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,600
I have a favor to ask.

261
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
What the hell?

262
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,640
I'm coming! Stop ringing the bell!
I've got a headache!

263
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,520
Hi, Type.

264
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
Why are you here?

265
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,080
I heard someone around here was sick.

266
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,720
So I bought him a hot rice porridge.

267
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I didn't ask you to, so leave.
I'm going back to sleep.

268
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,800
I don't mean to disturb you, Type.

269
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,200
I've really just come to visit you.

270
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Type!

271
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,480
Are you okay?

272
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,680
God, you're sweaty.

273
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,280
Did you take any medicine?

274
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,600
I'm fine. Sorry.

275
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,560
You don't have to apologize.

276
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,280
Where's your bedroom?

277
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,720
I think you need to rest.

278
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,800
Be careful with your knee.

279
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,840
My knee's gotten much better.

280
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm just supporting you. I'm fine.

281
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
My room's over here.

282
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Careful.

283
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,240
Let me use your kitchen.
I'll serve you the porridge.

284
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
You can have some before the medicine.

285
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,280
I'm sorry.

286
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,080
But I like Type too.

287
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Even when you're sick…

288
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,840
you're still worried about my knee.

289
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,920
So, is it wrong for me…

290
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,880
to like you?

291
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,040
Type, are you home?

292
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,240
Who are you?

293
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,640
How did you get in here?

294
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,440
I have the keycard.

295
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,960
And who are you? How did you get in here?

296
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,360
Where did you get the keycard?

297
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,480
I'm Type's little brother.

298
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,480
So, who are you?

299
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,400
Related by blood?

300
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
I'm not his brother by blood.

301
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,440
And when will I know who you are?

302
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,160
So, you're that kind of brother.

303
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,440
That kind?

304
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,360
I didn't think Type
would be into that kind of thing.

305
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,520
What kind do you mean?

306
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,880
-And where's Type?
-He's sleeping.

307
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,080
I can't go check on him
because he's sleeping?

308
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,800
If you're in your right mind,
then you should know…

309
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,840
that you shouldn't disturb a patient.

310
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,560
Then, you're out of your mind
for bothering Type.

311
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,560
So, that's why
you're not answering any of my questions.

312
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,760
You're actually out of your mind.

313
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,120
Why should I answer you?

314
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,120
Since we're here for the same reason.

315
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,480
Let's be honest with each other.

316
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,440
You came because Type's
boyfriend isn't here, right?

317
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,480
Yes, I came because
his boyfriend isn't here.

318
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,480
I never thought Type
would be into this kind of thing.

319
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,240
But when his boyfriend's away,
he calls another guy to come over.

320
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,760
And after seeing something like this…

321
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,800
it'll be a piece of cake.

322
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,600
I don't know what you're talking about.

323
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,360
But I think you should leave.

324
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,160
I have to take care of the patient.

325
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,360
I got here first.

326
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,200
But I was chosen to come.
I, at least, have the keycard.

327
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,880
So, who are you?

328
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
If you're an intruder,
I'm going to call the cops.

329
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,920
So? Who are you?

330
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,480
You may have been called over today.

331
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,320
But next time, don't expect it to be you.

332
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,600
At least…

333
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,240
I don't think you're better than me
at all.

334
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,360
What does he mean? I don't get it.

335
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,920
Wait a sec.

336
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,360
Was he taunting me?

337
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,360
Cir.

338
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,960
You're back?

339
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,680
How's Type?

340
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,520
Cir, comfort me.

341
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,640
What's wrong, Phu?

342
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,040
Please, comfort me.

343
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,320
There, there, good boy. Come here.

344
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,960
Slowly.

345
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,480
I was taunted by someone.

346
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
And I…

347
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,600
realized it too late again.

348
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,880
How should I comfort you?

349
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,840
Don't know, but you must comfort me.

350
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,160
He even said he couldn't believe
Type fell for a face like mine.

351
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,160
Who said that?

352
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,080
You're angry?

353
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,120
Phu…

354
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,440
Do you think I'm cute?

355
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,320
Yes.

356
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,720
Then, I feel better now.

357
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,480
Because you said I'm cute.

358
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,160
Just like that?

359
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,360
Yes, I feel better now.

360
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,880
You sure do recover fast.

361
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,880
Feeling better?

362
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,880
{\an8}<i>I saw you sleeping,</i>
<i>so I didn't wake you up.</i>

363
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,560
<i>There's rice porridge in the fridge.</i>

364
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,400
<i>Take the medicine</i>
<i>when you wake up. Phugun.</i>

365
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,600
THARN

366
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,080
Hello.

367
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
<i>How are you?</i>

368
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,280
I feel much better.

369
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,160
Tharn…

370
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,480
how did Phu get our room key?

371
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,640
<i>I gave it to him before I came here.</i>

372
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,560
<i>So he could check on you</i>
<i>in case something happened.</i>

373
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,680
So, you're keeping tabs on me
while you're away?

374
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,400
<i>No, you were having a hard time</i>
<i>with your boss, so I was worried.</i>

375
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm just teasing you. I'm not angry.

376
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,960
As for Phu, I'll thank him later.

377
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,320
He came over yesterday,
but it's all a blur to me.

378
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,480
<i>Aren't you going to ask me</i>
<i>when I'm coming back?</i>

379
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,280
When are you coming back?

380
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,280
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

381
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,280
Really?

382
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,600
<i>Really. I'm happy you sound excited.</i>

383
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,480
<i>-You miss me?</i>
-Yeah.

384
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,680
I missed you so much that I recovered.
Happy now?

385
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,080
So…

386
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,800
What time will you be back?

387
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
<i>In time to have dinner with you.</i>

388
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,600
Then I've got to hurry up and go shopping.

389
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,280
Because there's nothing left to eat here.

390
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,840
This is good,
I can stop by at the hospital too.

391
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,120
<i>Why would you go there?</i>

392
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,840
To get my stuff.

393
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,200
<i>Call me if it's too much to handle.</i>

394
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,080
Yeah, I'll be fine.

395
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,160
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

396
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,280
Suit yourself.

397
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm gonna hang up now.

398
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,480
I need to shower.

399
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,200
I've been smelly for days.

400
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,960
{\an8}PHU, THANKS SO MUCH FOR
TAKING CARE OF TYPE FOR ME.

401
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,000
{\an8}YOU'RE WELCOME, THARN.
I'LL CHECK ON TYPE AGAIN AFTER CLASS.

402
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,880
{\an8}THERE'S NO NEED TO.

403
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,600
{\an8}WHY IS THAT?

404
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,920
{\an8}I'M IN BANGKOK RIGHT NOW.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM MYSELF.

405
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,960
Which style are you looking for, sir?

406
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,680
I'm looking for plain wedding rings.

407
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,840
Sure, here are the ones I recommend.

408
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,320
This one is a flat-shaped
diamond solitaire ring.

409
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,000
It's not too fancy or too plain.
The style is classy.

410
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,800
-And this one is court shaped.
-Okay.

411
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,920
It's also a diamond solitaire,
with a prong setting.

412
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
It's comfortable to wear.

413
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,880
-Can I try it on?
-Sure.

414
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,840
Go ahead, try it on.

415
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,880
Do you like it?

416
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,760
Just because you quit
doesn't mean you can disappear on me.

417
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,640
Come visit sometimes.

418
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,280
If I show up here again,
it means I got sick.

419
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,080
That's not what I meant.

420
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,680
I'm just kidding.

421
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,040
If you ever miss me, just give me a call.

422
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,600
So, you mean, I have to call you first.

423
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,880
You don't plan
on contacting me at all, do you?

424
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,000
I'm afraid someone will get jealous
if I call other people too often.

425
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,920
Showing off the hubby, so obvious.

426
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,480
'Cause he deserves to be shown off.

427
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,840
I'm not talking to you anymore.
I have to work.

428
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,440
I've been busy,
especially since someone suddenly quit.

429
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,920
Okay, then, I'll call you later.

430
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,000
-You better keep your word.
-I will.

431
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,800
-Bye.
-See you.

432
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,680
Doc, just in time. I wanna talk to you.

433
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,360
Sure, just give me five minutes.

434
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,960
Thank you for helping me.

435
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,640
I haven't done anything
that requires a thank you.

436
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,320
You helped a lot
by covering up the punching incident.

437
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,160
Teng also mentioned something.

438
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,920
Was the investigation committee
looking into him, too?

439
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,040
If you're not the one behind it,
then who could it be?

440
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,000
Don't say that I'm the one behind it.

441
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Actually, the Director
wanted to deal with this matter.

442
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,400
I've got to thank you, anyway.

443
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,200
I really have to accept
your thanks, don't I?

444
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
Just accept it.

445
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,400
I feel extremely lucky
to be Champ's friend.

446
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,120
What's it got to do with Champ?

447
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,720
Didn't you go all out for me
because I'm Champ's friend?

448
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,400
No, not at all.

449
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,160
Here.

450
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,840
Take it.

451
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,720
Thanks.

452
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,720
Easy, right?

453
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,960
Champ's like this water bottle.

454
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,880
You're trying to tell me…

455
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,680
If you want him to know how you feel,
you've got to say it.

456
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,600
Just ask him directly
if he's gonna accept your love.

457
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,800
See? Easy,
just like how I gave you the bottle.

458
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,480
If you keep beating around the bush,
he'll never know.

459
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,120
But it doesn't mean
Champ would accept it as easily…

460
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,920
as me and the bottle.

461
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,120
Have you tried yet?

462
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,960
How will you know if you don't try?

463
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,080
Yeah.

464
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,840
Anyway, thanks.

465
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,640
I wish you luck.

466
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,880
I wish you luck, too.

467
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,520
Doc, if Champ rejects you,
you must tell me right away.

468
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:12,680
I'm gonna smack him on the head
if he ignores a nice guy like you.

469
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,600
Okay.

470
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,200
In that case, I hope you don't need
to smack Champ's head.

471
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,440
What's wrong, Fiat?

472
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,200
I can't find my pen.

473
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,520
It's just a pen, you can buy a new one.

474
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:52,480
It's not the same.

475
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,720
Okay, then, look closely.
It's probably in there.

476
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,560
Find it?

477
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,520
Leo!

478
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,320
Over here.

479
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,200
Did he not see us?

480
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,160
He's ignoring me.

481
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,320
Will you marry me?

482
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,240
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

483
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,840
HEY, ANY UPDATE ON DR. THITI?
I SAW TYPE GETTING HIS THINGS TODAY.

484
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,800
{\an8}HE'S DONE FOR.

485
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,240
{\an8}HE WAS UNDER INTENSE INVESTIGATION.

486
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,400
{\an8}AND HE HATES TYPE BECAUSE…

487
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,360
{\an8}TYPE REJECTED HIS LOVER
FROM THE PEDIATRICS DEPARTMENT.

488
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,280
{\an8}OH, MY GOD, BUT HE BULLIED TYPE SO MUCH.

489
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,320
{\an8}POOR GUY, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE LISTENED
TO ONLY ONE SIDE OF THE STORY.

490
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,280
{\an8}THEN, PLEASE DON'T DO IT AGAIN.

491
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,320
{\an8}DON'T ASSUME THINGS
WITHOUT KNOWING THE FACTS.

492
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,320
{\an8}I HOPE NOTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN.

493
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,320
{\an8}KHUNPOL LEAVES GROUP.

494
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,840
{\an8}DR. KHUNPOL'S LEFT?

495
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,560
{\an8}YEP.

496
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,000
{\an8}DID YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE'S
BEEN PICKING HIM UP AFTER WORK?

497
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,600
{\an8}I HATE GOSSIP, BUT THIS I HAVE TO HEAR.
