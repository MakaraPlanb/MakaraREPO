1
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,440
What are you doing standing there?

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,760
You scared me.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,600
What about you? What did you do?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,240
What did I do?

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,080
This.

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
How did you know?

7
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,840
You obviously messaged her.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,880
How could I not know?

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,840
So… what did you do… to Ms. Nana?

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,560
Are you angry?

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
Tell me…

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,040
what you did first.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,680
So that I can decide…

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,240
if I should be angry.

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,280
So, what business do you have
with my boyfriend?

16
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,120
What boyfriend? Who are you talking about?

17
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,400
I forgot to introduce myself.

18
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,720
My name is Type.

19
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
I'm Tharn's boyfriend.

20
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What kind of joke is this? It's not funny.

21
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,160
Did Mr. Tharn send you to prank me?
He's gone too far, though.

22
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,640
Do I look like I'm pranking you?

23
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Excuse me, this isn't funny anymore.

24
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
Whether you believe it or not
is up to you.

25
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,960
But I think you'd better
give up now, Ms. Nana.

26
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,240
Because Tharn doesn't like…

27
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
your type.

28
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,200
Where's Mr. Tharn? I'm going to call him.

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,960
I'm warning you for your own sake.

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,680
Because you'll never get
what you're hoping for.

31
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,960
It's not too late to change your mind now.

32
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,640
Because Tharn…

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,120
likes men.

34
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,800
And not just any type of man.

35
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,280
He only likes a man like me.

36
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,120
If you'll excuse me.

37
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,480
I've been out for too long.
Tharn's probably missing me.

38
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,280
As for you, Ms. Nana.
Have a safe trip home.

39
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,640
It's not safe for a fragile woman
to come looking for a man.

40
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
Just a friendly warning.

41
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,600
Have you been driven mad by anger?
Why are you laughing?

42
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
Seriously…

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,640
I knew what you'd do.

44
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,200
What did you think I'd do?

45
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,400
You're jealous.

46
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
What are you playing at?

47
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,040
It's cute when my wife gets jealous.

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
At first…

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,080
I was going to deal with her myself.

50
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
But you're cute when you're furious,
so I let you handle it.

51
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,480
And you didn't let me down at all.

52
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,760
What a jerk.

53
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,280
Or…

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,200
You wanted me to handle it?

55
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,600
In your dreams.

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
You're too softhearted.

57
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,040
If I'd let you deal with her,
you would've been too indecisive.

58
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,960
And she wouldn't have given up on you.

59
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Why would I go soft on someone else?

60
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,600
You're the only one I go soft on.

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,440
Come here.

62
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,920
-What?
-Come on.

63
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,680
Smile.

64
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,840
-For what?
-Come on.

65
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,880
-Smile.
-No.

66
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,760
One, two, three!

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,120
I'M SORRY MY BOYFRIEND
REPLIED ON MY BEHALF.

68
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,040
Good.

69
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Does this mean…

70
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,200
I did good?

71
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,080
Yeah.

72
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,120
Since I did good…

73
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,400
where's my reward?

74
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,160
Let go. Let me go right now.

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
Let me go!

76
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,240
In your dreams. You got me all worked up.

77
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
Come on, Type.

78
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,040
MY WIFE IS CUTE, BRO.

79
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,040
WHAT?

80
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,120
IT'S RARE TO SEE HIM GET JEALOUS.

81
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,400
Hey, I was just gone
for a minute to grab some food.

82
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,720
How come you've suddenly lost your mind?

83
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,920
Shut up, you slut.

84
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,280
Thorn, we've been friends for years.

85
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Don't you remember my name is Saran?

86
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
I don't give a damn.

87
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Besides, when are you going home?

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,720
You've been at my house all day long,
wasting electricity.

89
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,560
I don't give a damn.

90
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,280
Son of a bitch.
Should I get rid of you with bug spray?

91
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm a human, not an ant.

92
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,840
I meant, cockroach.

93
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
Fine, I'm a cockroach.
They're hard to kill.

94
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Seriously, why are you
so thick-skinned, San?

95
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,400
Because I've got a cranky friend like you
who always complains whenever we meet.

96
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,800
So I've got to be thick-skinned,
or else I couldn't survive.

97
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,800
So, why were you laughing?

98
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,800
Tell me.

99
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,400
I'm paying attention.

100
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
In my experience,
that's called "being nosy".

101
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,960
Fine, I'm being nosy
because I know who you texted.

102
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,680
I wouldn't care if it wasn't someone
in the Khirikan family.

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Tharn texted me that Type got jealous.

104
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,000
But I think my brother got too excited.

105
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,840
How is it?

106
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,080
Does your heart ache hearing about this?

107
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
Nope.

108
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Because I've got someone of my own.

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,600
Tharn's a brother I cherish.
Good memories from the past, nothing more.

110
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,840
I'm happy that you've given up on him.

111
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,960
And I'm even happier
that you're serious about someone.

112
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,200
Now I can stop worrying about you bugging
my brother and sister-in-law again.

113
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,240
Come on, don't worry.
I won't bug them anymore.

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,400
They've been in love for seven years.
That's a long time already.

115
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
Come on, let's continue the game.
Quick, grab your phone. Come on.

116
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
Where were we?

117
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,440
What are you doing?

118
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,120
Working.

119
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,000
Hello.

120
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,600
<i>Hello, Type.</i>
<i>Have you seen that woman's IG post?</i>

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
-What woman?
<i>-The one who was after Tharn.</i>

122
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,400
What about her?

123
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,200
<i>Stop asking. Go check it out. Hurry.</i>

124
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,040
Okay.

125
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,440
THANK YOU FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.
I'VE LEARNED A LOT HERE.

126
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,000
THANK YOU, WONDERFUL COLLEAGUES
AND PERFECT BOSS. THANK YOU.

127
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,520
I'LL VISIT YOU GUYS SOMETIME. LOVE.

128
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,400
WHY DID YOU QUIT?

129
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,200
HOW COULD I STAY?
COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONE.

130
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,880
YOUNGER ONE IGNORES ME. SO EMBARRASSED.

131
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,880
THANK YOU FOR BEING SO UNDERSTANDING.

132
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,720
-Techno.
-Go away. This is important.

133
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,480
-Techno.
-Hey, Tharn! What's up, dude?

134
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
It's been a while.

135
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,400
-How are you?
-I'm doing well.

136
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,320
I'm thinking of buying rings today.

137
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,200
I'll pick out a few of them for myself
as accessories.

138
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,400
God damn it!
You act like nothing happened.

139
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,360
What's wrong?

140
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,960
Who was that woman?

141
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,480
If Type finds out you're cheating,
you'll be dead meat.

142
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
You know that, right?

143
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
-Know what?
-It won't be a pretty sight.

144
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,200
And you know what? If he finds out…

145
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,480
he'll cut it off and feed it to the ducks.

146
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,000
Come on.

147
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,120
Let's just say I didn't do anything…

148
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,400
that would cut Type off
from his daily needs.

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,440
Damn, his daily needs.

150
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,320
Seriously, dude.
Were you born a cocky bastard?

151
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,520
-Tell me what happened?
-Nothing happened.

152
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,720
But it's a good thing you came here.

153
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,720
-I need your help.
-I've got no money.

154
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
It's not about money.

155
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,640
-Help make my boyfriend jealous.
-Are you crazy?

156
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm not.

157
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,000
Why would you get yourself into trouble?

158
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,280
-Please, Techno.
-No, I won't do it.

159
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,640
I'll buy you a meal.

160
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,520
Tell me the first plan. I'm all ears.

161
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,760
I've been on your side this whole time.

162
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,640
Trust me, I won't fail you.

163
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,680
You'll be so impressed.

164
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
What are you looking at?

165
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,360
There's something on your face.

166
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,360
-My face?
-Yeah, there.

167
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,000
It's gone.

168
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,000
There you are, Type.

169
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,400
I've been waiting for you.

170
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,520
I bought some snacks for you.

171
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
I can't accept them.

172
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,960
Please, take them.
I really wanna apologize to you.

173
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,520
Please.

174
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,520
If you don't take them,
I've got to throw them away.

175
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Look.

176
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,560
I bought a lot for the doctors and nurses.

177
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,160
Okay.

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,280
Thank you very much.

179
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,760
But you don't need to do this again.

180
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,200
You see, I--

181
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,160
don't want to trouble you.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,920
Copy that.

183
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,280
Mr. Thiwat, the boss is asking for you.

184
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,520
What's the matter?

185
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
I don't know. What have you done?

186
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,840
I've got to go.

187
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,000
Okay.

188
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,600
Don't forget your PT appointment
next week.

189
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,440
-Okay.
-See you.

190
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,320
I refused your leave request.

191
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,960
You know many people take leave
during the long holiday.

192
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,920
And our department is short-staffed,
so you'll have to come in to work.

193
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,560
But I've referred all my work plans
to Ms. Teng.

194
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,640
Besides, I applied for leave
a long time ago.

195
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm telling you I won't grant it.

196
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,480
Why, sir?

197
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,640
We're short-staffed.

198
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,560
Or do you insist on taking leave…

199
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,640
while other people
devote their time to work?

200
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,680
Are you trying to force me, sir?

201
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,760
Thiwat, you'd better watch what you say.

202
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,800
Don't forget that I am your superior.

203
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Yes, sir.

204
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,920
{\an8}SIAM PARAGON

205
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,320
Did the doctor say
when Fiat will recover, Leo?

206
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,800
He's right here. Why don't you ask him?

207
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,600
Just look at him.

208
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,600
Your friend's living in his own world.

209
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,920
He doesn't care what's happening
around him at all.

210
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,800
Then, wait till he gets out of his world
and ask again.

211
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:30,840
Or send him a telepathic message.
He might answer.

212
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,200
Here comes the deadpan humor.
Mr. Leo's always got it ready.

213
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,760
The doctor says he's getting better.

214
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,160
If he isn't stubborn,
he'll recover within a few months.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,520
So that's why he's got
so much energy for texting.

216
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,560
Should I pretend that my knee hurts?

217
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
Let's ask for some attention.

218
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,400
Why are you mumbling to yourself?

219
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Butt out.

220
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
Eat.

221
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,560
Eat.

222
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,480
Let… go.

223
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,320
Fiat.

224
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,680
Okay, fine.

225
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,320
Why the hell are you smiling?

226
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,600
Are you gonna eat?

227
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,120
Why do you care?

228
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,360
Just eat.

229
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Fiat, we don't wanna care,
but it's clear as day.

230
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,600
Who are you texting, smiling like that?

231
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,960
Here you go, eat.
Just eat. Here's a wiener for you.

232
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,920
As for other wieners,
you guys can eat after we leave.

233
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,560
Damn! Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

234
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,440
That's enough. Stop joking. Eat.

235
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,600
Leo, you're no fun.

236
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,600
Why do you play around when you're eating?

237
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,040
Why so serious, dude?

238
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,880
Fine, let's eat. I'll quit playing around.

239
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,440
The meats are burnt.

240
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,520
Take it. Here, take it.

241
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,000
Eat up.

242
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,920
Fiat, you dick.

243
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,840
What did you give me?
Can't you see it's still raw?

244
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,800
Want me to get diarrhea? Asshole.

245
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,320
Eat it yourself. Take it.

246
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,240
Just eat, will ya?

247
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,000
-See you later. Bye.
-See you. Bye.

248
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,600
Leo, thanks so much.

249
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,160
What for?

250
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,040
The liver.

251
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,520
You know I don't like pork liver.

252
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,520
I didn't know. I just wanted to eat.

253
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,800
-You knew.
-I didn't.

254
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,160
It's just the way you are.
You always take the best care of me.

255
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,840
Fiat, the doctor told you not to jump.

256
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,080
You always end up
taking care of me, anyway.

257
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,600
Walk properly
or you'll bump into things again.

258
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,840
Fine, I'll obey you for one day.

259
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,920
That's how it is, Pops.

260
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,320
So I'm calling to tell you
I won't be able to go home.

261
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,440
<i>What's up with your boss?</i>

262
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,000
<i>You asked for leave.</i>
<i>You should've gotten it.</i>

263
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,040
They're really short-handed,
so I've got to go to work.

264
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,680
Or do you want your son to be selfish

265
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,160
and go home to relax
while other people do the work?

266
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,120
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

267
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,600
<i>Other people have to understand</i>
<i>your situation too.</i>

268
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,400
<i>Your hometown is remote.</i>

269
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,240
<i>Your mom and I can only see your face</i>
<i>two times a year.</i>

270
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,520
<i>Always hanging around that white boy.</i>
<i>You've forgotten your parents.</i>

271
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,480
Don't whine, Pops.

272
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,240
It's got nothing to do with Tharn.

273
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,240
I couldn't take leave
because of my boss, not him.

274
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,320
<i>Don't know. Don't care.</i>

275
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,600
<i>If you don't come home</i>
<i>on the long holiday, I'll be angry.</i>

276
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,440
-Pops.
<i>-Why are you nagging your son?</i>

277
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,680
<i>I told you he's busy. Stop being childish.</i>

278
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,800
<i>Man, your mom always makes a fuss.</i>

279
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,520
<i>Fine, I'll stop complaining.</i>

280
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,360
But I must see your face this holiday.
Remember that, kiddo!

281
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,040
Still at it? You're still threatening him?

282
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Look, I'm gonna whack you with the hanger.
He can't come back. Just accept it.

283
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,560
Gotta go!

284
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,480
-Honey.
-What?

285
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,000
It was just an empty threat.
Why are you making a fuss?

286
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,920
Come on, I just miss him.

287
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,240
Then, tell him nicely.
Don't sulk about it.

288
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,960
-You hear me!
-Stop!

289
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,600
I'm watching a drama.

290
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
Crazy.

291
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,800
Go iron the clothes.

292
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,560
Thanya.

293
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,320
So beautiful.

294
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
Type, you're back?

295
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,640
Yeah.

296
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,000
What are you doing here?

297
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,840
I'm waiting for Cir.
He's not back yet from buying snacks.

298
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
And he didn't take his phone.

299
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
So, where's Tharn?

300
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,480
He went to his office today.
He'll probably be back soon.

301
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,560
You don't look so good. Are you okay?

302
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,800
I'm fine. Just work stuff. No big deal.

303
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,680
Seems like a big enough deal.

304
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,920
I'll make you a drink.

305
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,000
Don't. I'm fine.

306
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,360
I've got to make dinner for Tharn.

307
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,560
Then, I'll tell Tharn you're not well.

308
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,840
Come to my room first.

309
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,480
If anything happens to you,
Tharn will beat me.

310
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,360
Please. I'll make you a hot drink. Please.

311
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,880
Come sit in my room first.

312
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,960
Please, Type.

313
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,440
Okay.

314
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Honestly, when I look at you,
I know exactly whose cousin you are.

315
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,400
Hot cocoa, coming right up.

316
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,880
You'll feel better
after you drink it, Type.

317
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,600
Whenever I have a headache,
Cir always makes me one.

318
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,720
This is his apology drink sometimes
when I'm sulking.

319
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,480
So our room is full of cocoa.

320
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,880
That's also Coco.

321
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,280
And this.

322
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,040
I'm Coco too.

323
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,280
You should drink it while it's still hot.

324
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
You seem stressed.

325
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,360
You can talk to me.
I promise I won't tell anyone.

326
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Do you know…

327
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,600
there's something about you
that makes people around you feel at ease?

328
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,000
Promise me that if I tell you,
you won't tell Tharn.

329
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,320
I don't wanna stress him out.

330
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,320
Okay, I promise. Scout's honor.

331
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,040
Scouts hold up three fingers.

332
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,360
Right.

333
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,640
Anyway…

334
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,760
my boss…

335
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,080
he wouldn't let me take leave
over the long holiday.

336
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,200
He said we're short-staffed.

337
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,400
But he's allowed other employees
to take leave whenever they ask.

338
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,200
I don't know why he hates me so much.

339
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,480
Why do you think?

340
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,360
I don't know.

341
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,520
I don't know what I've done
to make him discriminate against me.

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,480
If I hadn't planned to stay for a year
for my resume…

343
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,520
I would've punched him in the face
and quit already.

344
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,720
But I've already stuck it out
for half a year.

345
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
So I'll tough it out
for another half a year.

346
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,000
But the thing is,

347
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,320
I wanted to bring Tharn
home over the holiday.

348
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,080
I want him to be around my dad more.

349
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,840
In case my dad finally decides
to accept him as his son-in-law.

350
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,320
Your dad doesn't like Tharn?

351
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,200
It's not that he doesn't like him.

352
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,240
He's become childish as he's gotten older.

353
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,600
He wanted his son to bring home
a daughter-in-law.

354
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,000
But his son ended up bringing home
a son-in-law.

355
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,120
So…

356
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,920
yeah.

357
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm in a similar situation.
Cir's mom really dislikes me.

358
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,280
The more Cir defies her because of me,

359
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,160
the more upset she gets with me.

360
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,920
But Cir told me to ignore her,
so I ignore her.

361
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,880
Actually, my dad doesn't hate Tharn.

362
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,920
My mom said he's just putting on airs.

363
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,360
Thank you so much, Phu.

364
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,320
I feel much better now.

365
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,520
Since your boyfriend's returned,
I'll go back to my room.

366
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,680
And…

367
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,000
thanks for the hot cocoa.

368
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,720
My pleasure.

369
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,000
If something's troubling you again,
you can come talk to me.

370
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,960
But it'd be better if you talked to Tharn.

371
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,040
-I'll get going, then.
-Okay.

372
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,600
Cir, Type is really cute.
I enjoyed talking with him.

373
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,280
So…

374
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,000
why was he in our room?

375
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,640
I was looking for you.

376
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,520
You'd been gone a while,
and you didn't take your phone with you.

377
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,600
Your favorite candies are sold out.

378
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,120
So I went to look for them
at another store.

379
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,720
Cir, you shouldn't have looked for them
if they were sold out.

380
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,560
I would've understood.

381
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,040
Are you tired?

382
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,720
Not at all.

383
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,360
-Really?
-Yeah.

384
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,360
I should give you a rub.

385
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,840
Rub, rub.

386
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,080
It's okay, I'm not tired.

387
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,960
Let me give you a rub.

388
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,360
Earlier…

389
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,480
what did you talk about with Type?

390
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,160
Ask Coco.

391
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,600
Stop it.

392
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,120
Instead of talking to Coco…

393
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,480
wouldn't it be better to ask my boyfriend?

394
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,400
But your boyfriend can't tell you.

395
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,640
Because he promised Type
that he wouldn't tell anyone.

396
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,480
Please don't get mad at me.

397
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,680
Please.

398
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,840
I'm not angry.

399
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,120
And I don't wanna know.

400
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,120
I just care about you.

401
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,120
I'm gonna wash up.

402
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,160
Whose sulky boyfriend is he?

403
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,720
Cir.

404
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,760
Apply the cream for me.

405
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,480
-Why?
-There's a spot I can't reach.

406
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
Please.

407
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,920
Isn't this a face cream?

408
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,320
My hand hurts from rubbing you.

409
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,800
Please, apply the cream for me.

410
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Please.

411
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,040
Fine.

412
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,560
Where do you want me to put it?

413
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,520
Anywhere you want.

414
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
My face.

415
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
My neck.

416
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,120
Or my chest.

417
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,000
Put it anywhere you want.

418
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
Phugun.

419
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,120
Go on.

420
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,280
Cir.

421
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,000
You can get jealous.

422
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,200
I can?

423
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
Of course, we're boyfriends.

424
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
You can get jealous,

425
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,080
possessive,

426
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,240
or say you don't want me
to get close to other guys.

427
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,960
You can do anything you want.

428
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,800
Just like…

429
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,720
you can touch me anywhere.

430
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,760
Because you're my boyfriend.

431
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,400
Really?

432
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,000
Yes.

433
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,080
You…

434
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,440
can do anything.

435
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Anywhere?

436
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,360
Yes.

437
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,120
Anywhere.

438
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,400
Type.

439
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,760
Are you okay?

440
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,080
Why are you acting weird?

441
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,560
That's supposed to be my question.
Are you okay?

442
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,960
Me?

443
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,000
Yeah!

444
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,280
Phugun texted me.

445
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,440
He said you don't look so good.

446
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,800
So, what happened to you?

447
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,760
Did he tell you what happened to me?

448
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,960
No.

449
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,280
He said…

450
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,120
I should ask you myself…

451
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,120
if I wanted to know.

452
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
So, are you okay?

453
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,120
Yes.

454
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,160
Let me stay like this for a moment.

455
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,200
And I'll be fine.

456
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,280
Stay for as long as you want.

457
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,920
I'm not going anywhere.

458
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,640
I'll always be by your side, Type.

459
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,000
Yeah.

460
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,840
{\an8}NUMBER FIVE

461
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,520
Excuse me…

462
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
-Cake.
-Cake.

463
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,440
You're still forgetful.

464
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,960
-Who asks to have a twin?
-I can hear you.

465
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,160
Did it slip out?

466
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,160
-So, how are you? It's been a while.
-Yeah.

467
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,440
Did you miss me?

468
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,720
Definitely, I can tell.

469
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,840
-You're still upbeat, Techno.
-Yes.

470
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,720
Where have you been these days?

471
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,920
I've been busy with work.

472
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,320
It's the end of the month.
Lots of papers to deal with.

473
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,320
I'm so exhausted and very hungry.

474
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,160
So I'm thinking of eating free food here.

475
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Ever the freeloader.

476
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,680
Why don't you just slap me
in the face instead?

477
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,160
-That was a joke.
-A harsh one.

478
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,080
By the way…

479
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,920
-where's Champ?
-He's over there.

480
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,520
-Over there?
-Yes.

481
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,000
Okay, then I'll go see him.
He usually hangs out around here.

482
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,240
Wait a minute!

483
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,840
-The usual.
-The usual.

484
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,920
Okay. She really knows me well.

485
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,080
Who's that?

486
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,240
Champ…

487
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,880
the seniors invited me out to a restaurant
after my shift the other day.

488
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,640
They said that the seafood there
was very fresh.

489
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,960
I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere,

490
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,480
so I decided to join them.

491
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,040
So, what was the most delicious dish
in your opinion?

492
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,080
What was the most delicious dish?

493
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,240
I think…

494
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,960
I know, fried fish with chili sauce.

495
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,800
After the first bite,
I suddenly thought of you.

496
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,720
You thought of me?

497
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,200
It's not what you think, Champ.

498
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,640
That's not what I meant.
What I'm trying to say is…

499
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,760
When I took the first bite,
it reminded me of you.

500
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,000
Didn't you ask me to tell you
when I found a good restaurant?

501
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,400
Then, take me there next time.

502
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,800
Yeah.

503
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,280
Sure.

504
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,560
On second thought, let's not.

505
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,520
Why?

506
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,360
Do you not want to go with me?

507
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,560
It's okay.
I'll just send you the location, then.

508
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,080
What I'm trying to say is,
let me take you there.

509
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Because you already work so hard.

510
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,360
I'll pick you up
when you get off work early.

511
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,800
Okay?

512
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,200
Yeah.

513
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,240
Okay.

514
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,240
You're cute when you smile.

515
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,120
You should smile more.

516
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,960
I like it.

517
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,560
I've got a juicy update for you.

518
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,240
Trust me, you're gonna be…

519
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,000
This is gonna be fun. Just you wait.

520
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,320
Type said you've been busy lately.

521
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,600
Are you tired?

522
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,760
Yeah.

523
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,360
A little.

524
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,080
I've been dealing
with a lot of patients lately,

525
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,680
so I have a lot on my mind.

526
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,640
Don't pinch your nose.

527
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,960
It'll get red.

528
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,360
Bring me a spoon and fork.

529
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,760
What a clumsy doctor.

530
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,600
I'm sorry. That was clumsy of me.

531
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,560
Don't look so glum.

532
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,680
I'm not angry.

533
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,160
A cup of hot coffee, please.

534
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,560
Doc.

535
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,360
Type.

536
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,120
Haven't seen you in days.

537
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,920
There are quite a few patients lately,
so I rarely make it down here.

538
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,000
Isn't it because you always sneak out
to meet someone?

539
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,360
No, I really do have patients to treat.

540
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,440
I'm not criticizing you.

541
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,080
I'm just teasing you.

542
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,960
I met Techno and he said he saw you
at Champ's restaurant yesterday.

543
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,840
Yes… I went to see Champ yesterday.

544
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,840
You like Champ?

545
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,760
Am I…

546
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,400
that obvious, Type?

547
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,680
I think you're very obvious,

548
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,440
but my circle of friends
are pretty stupid.

549
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,400
Especially Champ.

550
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,080
If you're not direct, he'll be clueless
right up till his next life.

551
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,280
I'm rooting for you, Doc.

552
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,280
My friend's dumb.

553
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,880
If you'll excuse me, I need to deliver
these documents to my superior.

554
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,800
Or I'll get in trouble.

555
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,760
Patient files?

556
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,920
No, my department's operational plan.

557
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:15,960
Hold on.

558
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,560
But… that isn't your responsibility.

559
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,680
Yeah…

560
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,640
I know that.

561
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,480
But he's the boss.
I have to do what he says.

562
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,000
I've got to go.
He'll be all over me if I'm late.

563
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,880
As for Champ, be brave, Doc.
I'm rooting for you.

564
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,840
If you'll excuse me. See you later.

565
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,320
Hello, Uncle.

566
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,840
I want to ask you something.

567
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,560
Do you have a minute?

568
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:24,480
Type, when Fiat brought apology snacks
the other day, I couldn't believe it.

569
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,400
But he's pretty adorable, if you ask me.

570
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,640
He'd better not act up again,
or he'll give us all a headache.

571
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,680
Yeah, here's hoping.

572
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,320
Thiwat.

573
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,400
What? Seeing my face makes you sigh?

574
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,200
Don't forget that I'm your superior.

575
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,920
Show me some respect.

576
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,360
My apologies.

577
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,160
Did you want to talk to me?

578
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,080
I should be asking you
if you have a problem with me.

579
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,120
Me, sir?

580
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,640
I don't want to bring up the past.

581
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:12,240
You think I don't notice your expression
every time I reprimand you?

582
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,240
Stay calm, Type.

583
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,960
Boss, please calm down.

584
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,360
If there's a problem,
let's discuss it in the office.

585
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,320
No need. I just want to chat with him.

586
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,600
Then, how may I be of service?

587
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,160
Who would dare order you around?

588
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,760
Take yesterday, for example.

589
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,480
I asked you to handle some documents,
but you complained to other people.

590
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,480
Is handling a few documents
such a difficult task?

591
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,800
If it's too much work,
let me know next time.

592
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,920
That way, I won't have to interrupt
your precious personal time.

593
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,000
What do you mean, sir?

594
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,800
Ask your coworker.

595
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:03,160
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

596
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,280
Then, who did you complain to?

597
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,840
It must be a misunderstanding.
It's probably nothing.

598
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,680
If there's nothing else, please excuse us.

599
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,120
It's rush hour soon. Let's go, Type.

600
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,960
You're back?

601
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,720
What do you think? Can't you see I'm here?

602
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,680
Type, what's wrong?

603
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,320
I'm pissed at my boss.

604
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,640
Damn it, what did I do
to make him hold such a grudge?

605
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,360
I must've stepped on his tail
in a past life.

606
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,520
That's why he refuses to leave me alone.

607
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,560
I've worked my ass off,
but he said I complained to other people.

608
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,320
Who could I complain to?

609
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,720
I'm too damn exhausted working for him.

610
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:13,720
You should calm down first, Type.

611
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,560
Calm down, my ass!

612
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,320
I've endured so much.
I can't take it anymore.

613
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
You're not me. You wouldn't understand.

614
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,320
Can I help you with anything?

615
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,520
You can't help me at all.

616
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,040
Can you punch him for me?
Don't make me laugh.

617
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,720
-Type.
-Don't touch me.

618
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,480
I'm pissed off, don't you get it?

619
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,880
And don't say I'm hot-headed.

620
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,560
Yeah, I'm hot-headed. So what?

621
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,600
You're not me. What would you know?

622
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,880
I've got to go through so much in a day.

623
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,800
I've put up with this bastard
for half a year.

624
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,960
Damn it.

625
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,000
He can go to hell.

626
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,760
That piece of shit.

627
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,240
What are they fighting about?

628
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,120
Seo hasn't returned from Korea yet.
There's no one to be nosy with me.

629
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,680
I made you coffee.

630
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,440
To help you feel better.

631
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,440
I'm sorry.

632
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,600
It's okay.

633
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,600
You already know, Type…

634
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,280
that I'll always be by your side.

635
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,160
I'm sorry.

636
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,040
STRATEGIES FOR TYPE'S HUBBY

637
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,720
YOU'RE A BASTARD, TECHNO.

638
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,320
{\an8}THE HELL? WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

639
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,000
{\an8}THARN TOLD ME. YOU TOOK BRIBE A FROM HIM.

640
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,600
{\an8}TO MAKE OUR FRIEND JEALOUS.

641
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,560
{\an8}WOULDN'T YOU TAKE IT?

642
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
{\an8}FREE STUFF.

643
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,120
{\an8}HELL YEAH!

644
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,400
{\an8}WHERE'S THARN? HE HASN'T FILLED ME IN.

645
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,600
{\an8}HELP ME LOOK AFTER TYPE. HE'S EXHAUSTED.

646
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,000
{\an8}AW.

647
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,280
{\an8}OH!

648
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,040
{\an8}OH!

649
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,480
{\an8}WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, TECHNO?

650
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,920
{\an8}WHEN YOU SAID EXHAUSTED, I ASSUMED…

651
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,440
{\an8}WHAT?

652
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,400
{\an8}SWORD FIGHTING.

653
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,440
{\an8}NO, I'M BEING SERIOUS.

654
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,960
{\an8}I'M SORRY.
