1
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:16,005
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,340
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:22,085
(A new leap for the people,)

4
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:23,780
(The hopeful Dream Home Village becomes a reality.)

5
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:27,215
The Social Responsibility Foundation is accepting donations...

6
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,581
for their Dream Home Village project.

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:35,921
But I received a tip that the money is being used elsewhere.

8
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,760
These are the people running the project.

9
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:43,231
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

10
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,441
Where the donations are being used,

11
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:57,386
and what the real purpose of this project is.

12
00:00:57,386 --> 00:00:58,911
To anyone who gives us a tip,

13
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:01,820
I will compensate you with my own money.

14
00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,580
That's my promise to you.

15
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:04,790
Thank you.

16
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,161
Kang Yo Han, that punk.

17
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:20,170
Did he just put a bounty on the head of state?

18
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,101
My own TV station broadcasted my face...

19
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,271
because of something like this?

20
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:26,345
Chairman Park, that's not the issue here.

21
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:29,145
He just declared war against his country.

22
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:31,785
This is a rebellion. It's civil war!

23
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:33,384
He slandered his head of state?

24
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:35,955
Did we take the working class' hard-earned money?

25
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,694
That doesn't make sense.

26
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:39,855
In order to save the poor,

27
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:42,296
I donated my precious money.

28
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:44,896
And this is what I get for being nice?

29
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,131
What's with Kang Yo Han? Is he a communist?

30
00:01:47,165 --> 00:01:49,066
What's Mr. Seo doing?

31
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,736
He just sent his secretary here.

32
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:53,601
What is he going to do about this?

33
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,441
With all due respect,

34
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,310
I think you're too infuriated.

35
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:01,510
It's a groundless accusation, right?

36
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,381
Am I wrong?

37
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,050
Of course, it's groundless.

38
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:11,920
There's a bite in your words.

39
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,290
Watch it.

40
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:16,694
How could he think we would do that?

41
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:19,631
Right. We wouldn't dare to touch that money.

42
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:34,441
You kidnapped Jang Ki Young, didn't you?

43
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,480
I had to talk to him.

44
00:02:36,586 --> 00:02:39,014
"We should put up a show in front of the whole nation."

45
00:02:39,015 --> 00:02:41,980
"Or you'll be in trouble, too." Is this what you told him?

46
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:43,851
You should talk nicely.

47
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,591
I explained it differently but it was the gist.

48
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:50,091
Differently?

49
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:54,061
Did you really help him because you felt so sorry for him?

50
00:02:54,306 --> 00:02:56,066
You told him you'd pay him afterward...

51
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,070
if he testifies as you wanted, didn't you?

52
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:02,040
It's possible I felt bad for him from the beginning.

53
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:03,971
So don't jump to a quick conclusion.

54
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:09,441
Then you weren't the one who attacked Soo Hyun.

55
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,711
Can you believe it now...

56
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,610
that I'm not that kind of person.

57
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,751
I think you are that kind of person.

58
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:21,194
- But I guess you didn't have to. - I didn't have to?

59
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:23,465
You figured out Cha Kyung Hee got the account details.

60
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,461
So you kidnapped Jang Ki Young in a hurry.

61
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:29,360
And it didn't matter if Soo Hyun takes the bankbook or not.

62
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,501
That's why you didn't touch her.

63
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:35,501
You're such a smart guy...

64
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:38,211
so why were you so furious that day?

65
00:03:39,645 --> 00:03:41,485
I only took Elijah out for a moment.

66
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,145
And you went furious too.

67
00:03:43,145 --> 00:03:45,181
So I don't think it's your place to judge me.

68
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:52,520
Then who attacked Soo Hyun?

69
00:03:53,656 --> 00:03:57,520
At the least, it wouldn't be someone who favors me.

70
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:09,901
What do you think Chief Kang is up to?

71
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,715
Isn't the foundation one of the good guys?

72
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,711
They help the poor and do volunteer work.

73
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:24,750
Judge Oh, there's something I forgot to tell you.

74
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:26,550
What?

75
00:04:27,395 --> 00:04:29,821
How could you not take me with you?

76
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:33,161
A secret party with the key members of the foundation?

77
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,360
You two went to a party like that without me?

78
00:04:36,436 --> 00:04:39,930
Chief Kang even got me a nice dress for that charity event.

79
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,370
I'm really sorry.

80
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:45,075
Is that the only thing you're mad about among all the other things?

81
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,545
Of course, interfering with the trial...

82
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:48,715
is very inappropriate.

83
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,610
Should we just release it to the press?

84
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:52,155
There's a reporter I know well.

85
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,155
A reporter?

86
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:55,851
Yes, she works for a fashion magazine called "Bling Bling".

87
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:00,321
No, never mind.

88
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,990
Okay. Let's calm down and think about this.

89
00:05:06,095 --> 00:05:09,666
So you're saying the president and the rich people were there...

90
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,904
trying to interfere with Lee Young Min's trial, right?

91
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:14,170
And it seemed they were sharing information for profit.

92
00:05:14,306 --> 00:05:15,500
Yes.

93
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:20,011
- I'm sorry I didn't tell... - What about Chief Kang?

94
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:22,740
- What? - What did he say to them?

95
00:05:23,145 --> 00:05:25,511
Do you think he's with them?

96
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:28,050
Why aren't you saying anything about Chief Kang?

97
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:32,594
I can't be sure.

98
00:05:32,595 --> 00:05:34,591
He didn't say anything at the party.

99
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:37,521
But considering how he declared war against them...

100
00:05:38,265 --> 00:05:39,430
I don't know...

101
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:42,031
if he's really cool or if he's trying to look cool.

102
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:44,365
It's true that he gave money to the witness.

103
00:05:44,366 --> 00:05:45,606
How can a judge do that?

104
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,940
He was just putting on a show in front of the reporters.

105
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,101
Then he suddenly asked people to vote on whether they trust him.

106
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:53,911
It feels like he's deceiving people.

107
00:05:57,215 --> 00:06:00,250
I was a really big fan of his.

108
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,721
He was confident and righteous.

109
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,120
And he seemed so shinny to me.

110
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,920
But I'm not sure he still does.

111
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:17,761
You should be ambitious.

112
00:06:17,936 --> 00:06:20,331
On the live court show that I watched,

113
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:22,806
you were the biggest star.

114
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:25,110
Twinkle, twinkle.

115
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:42,821
If you want a bright star shining in the sky...

116
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:47,860
If you desperately...

117
00:06:47,936 --> 00:06:49,331
want it,

118
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:55,341
you should change yourself first.

119
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:01,440
In order to reach the star,

120
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:05,610
become a bigger...

121
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:07,911
person.

122
00:07:42,726 --> 00:07:44,221
I'm perfect.

123
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,521
- Sun Ah. - Yes.

124
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,190
Your skin is gorgeous today.

125
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:54,366
A compliment coming from you? What a surprise?

126
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:56,201
Is it because you have a guilty conscience?

127
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:59,000
It's because I'm jealous.

128
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:02,300
By the way, what should I do with this?

129
00:08:02,676 --> 00:08:04,440
It's the bankbook I took from Yoon Soo Hyun.

130
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:06,911
Oh, the bankbook?

131
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,040
Get rid of it.

132
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:12,180
Gosh, you're such a nasty witch.

133
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:14,316
Why would you make me take it if you don't need it?

134
00:08:14,316 --> 00:08:15,851
Who says I don't need it?

135
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:18,990
I needed it to create a story.

136
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:20,420
A story?

137
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:23,761
Enough of that.

138
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:27,831
What comes next is more important.

139
00:08:28,106 --> 00:08:30,635
Watch every move of the old guys from the foundation.

140
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,971
Not Kang Yo Han?

141
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:36,446
Unexpectedly, the wolf broke into the ranch...

142
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:39,671
in a very violent way.

143
00:08:40,315 --> 00:08:43,581
The sheep will get scared and go violent too.

144
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:44,951
Okay.

145
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:46,551
Oh, by the way.

146
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,785
I think you'll be giving the Healing Mentor Lecture...

147
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:50,181
that will be posted on the website.

148
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:53,091
Me?

149
00:08:53,096 --> 00:08:56,595
Kang Yo Han put Mr. Seo's face on the screen...

150
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:59,791
saying he embezzled the donations for the people.

151
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:03,461
If he gives the lecture, it'll only draw the reporters' attention.

152
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:07,971
Gosh, I feel awkward to give a cheesy lecture.

153
00:09:10,376 --> 00:09:11,671
Jae Hee.

154
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:13,510
Yes?

155
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:19,711
If you were a little faster, we would've taken Jang Ki Young.

156
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:22,250
Right?

157
00:09:24,226 --> 00:09:25,390
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:28,860
I didn't know the judge was going to take him.

159
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,910
Do it right.

160
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:50,110
You can, can't you?

161
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:54,510
Yes.

162
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,380
I won't make a mistake.

163
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:02,791
We are almost done.

164
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:04,831
You know that, right?

165
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:17,471
If I see you dozing off while Mr. Seo gives the lecture,

166
00:10:17,506 --> 00:10:18,941
you'll be in trouble.

167
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,246
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,515
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of you girls.

169
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,081
Hello, Director.

170
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,855
Are you from the foundation?

171
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:29,280
Why is Mr. Seo so late?

172
00:10:30,055 --> 00:10:33,591
Hello, I came here on behalf of Mr. Seo today.

173
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,760
She is Jung Sun Ah, the executive director of the foundation.

174
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:37,860
Oh, she is?

175
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:39,390
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

176
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:44,366
You're so pretty.

177
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,601
How old are you?

178
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm 18 years old.

179
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,471
She is pretty, isn't she?

180
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:52,971
Go up now.

181
00:10:53,175 --> 00:10:54,615
Come on. Go.

182
00:10:54,616 --> 00:10:56,110
Excuse me, ma'am.

183
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,486
They're all orphans or teenage runaways.

184
00:11:01,486 --> 00:11:03,250
So they're troubled kids.

185
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:07,051
Be careful when you get closer. They might steal your valuables.

186
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,461
They're troubled kids?

187
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,390
Excuse me?

188
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,730
You must go through a lot.

189
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:23,971
Not really. Shall we go upstairs?

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

191
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:31,610
(Sun)

192
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:43,961
Gosh, I have no idea.

193
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:52,030
(Sun Ah)

194
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,005
That's my name.

195
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:56,171
"Sun" means "good", and "Ah" means a "child".

196
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:59,311
I'm a grown-up, but I still have to be a good child.

197
00:12:01,275 --> 00:12:03,980
My mom must've hoped...

198
00:12:04,185 --> 00:12:07,280
that I'd grow up to be an ordinary, good person.

199
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,691
Then why did she do that to me?

200
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,591
If that was her wish, why did she beat me up...

201
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,431
every time she was drunk?

202
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,030
I'm sorry, guys.

203
00:12:27,506 --> 00:12:31,006
Seeing you guys brings back memories.

204
00:12:31,006 --> 00:12:32,270
But I should stop being silly.

205
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,541
My mom did that too.

206
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:35,980
She did?

207
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:40,384
Usually, she was nice like an angel.

208
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,880
But she changed completely when she was drunk.

209
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:44,721
She'd start crying and...

210
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,160
It must've been tough for her.

211
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:51,191
She must've been going through a lot.

212
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:55,660
I didn't understand back then, I do now.

213
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,434
Her husband abandoned his wife and children.

214
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:02,770
She had to work her bottom off to make ends meet.

215
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:06,571
Still, she shouldn't have done that.

216
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:10,941
She shouldn't have treated her child that way no matter what.

217
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:14,054
I believed my mom hated me...

218
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,821
because I was a bad kid.

219
00:13:17,486 --> 00:13:19,024
I swore, got in fights,

220
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,024
and got in trouble for stealing.

221
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:23,591
But I had no choice back then.

222
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:26,794
Everyone around me insulted,

223
00:13:26,795 --> 00:13:29,260
teased, and beat me.

224
00:13:31,405 --> 00:13:35,101
And I was always hungry.

225
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,941
But the thing is,

226
00:13:39,815 --> 00:13:41,671
when I was 12,

227
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,780
I started working for a wealthy family.

228
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:51,051
The boys in that house were so adorable and nice.

229
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,855
They smelled good and never swore.

230
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,760
They glowed from head to toe.

231
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:01,030
If I'd been as good as them,

232
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:03,660
would my mom not have beaten me?

233
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,431
Would she have loved me?

234
00:14:13,346 --> 00:14:15,780
Well, anyway,

235
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:22,351
what can you do to be a good child then?

236
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:27,990
You have to become rich.

237
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,764
You can only be nice if you can make ends meet.

238
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,294
The world is a jungle.

239
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:35,505
When you have to prey on others to survive,

240
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,500
how can you possibly be nice?

241
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:42,101
First, survive by all means.

242
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:43,605
If others hit you, bite them.

243
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,341
If you need something, steal it.

244
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:47,770
In addition,

245
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:51,740
the world is a tougher place for lonely girls like you.

246
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:55,384
Beasts are everywhere.

247
00:14:55,385 --> 00:14:57,424
No matter how educated and respected they are,

248
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:59,721
all men are the same.

249
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:06,564
When those scumbags come on to you,

250
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:07,990
what are you supposed to do?

251
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:10,900
Report to the police.

252
00:15:11,265 --> 00:15:14,601
Wrong answer. Take advantage of it.

253
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:21,245
The law is never on our side.

254
00:15:21,246 --> 00:15:22,841
So secure evidence by all means.

255
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:24,711
Record it if you can.

256
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:30,650
And then...

257
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,821
torment him until the day he dies.

258
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:38,561
Threaten to destroy everything he has...

259
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:42,260
until he becomes as tame as a dog.

260
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:49,740
Do you understand?

261
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:51,071
- Yes. - Yes.

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

263
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:57,240
Yes, go ahead.

264
00:15:57,515 --> 00:16:01,410
You've become such a great person.

265
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:06,221
Does your mom love you now?

266
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:11,424
She passed away when I was 12.

267
00:16:11,425 --> 00:16:13,095
She got completely drunk...

268
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:15,201
and fell down some stairs in the neighborhood.

269
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,260
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:21,230
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

271
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:27,471
Your lecture was so refreshing and realistic.

272
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:30,240
It really touched me, Ms. Jung.

273
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:35,081
I haven't given many lectures.

274
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:36,554
I'm sure it showed.

275
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:40,355
Not at all. You were amazing.

276
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:45,291
Speaking of which, please give another touching lecture soon.

277
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:46,490
Sure.

278
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:51,335
I'd love the opportunity.

279
00:16:51,336 --> 00:16:53,130
Of course.

280
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:33,210
How did you find me?

281
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,541
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

282
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,281
I know you already found it. Why are you even asking?

283
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:49,225
I get to decide where I go and who I meet.

284
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:51,165
Who gives you the right?

285
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm your guardian whether you like it or not.

286
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:56,860
A guardian? You treat me like some animal you keep.

287
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,304
Haven't you learned a lesson yet?

288
00:17:59,305 --> 00:18:02,001
No one approaches a person without a motive.

289
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,175
Aren't you tired yet?

290
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,014
You always act like you're the smartest one,

291
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,314
but you follow anyone who shows the slightest kindness...

292
00:18:08,315 --> 00:18:10,584
and end up being used and even kidnapped. You're such a fool.

293
00:18:10,585 --> 00:18:11,680
Stop it.

294
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:23,291
Is it her fault to feel lonely?

295
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,531
You shouldn't talk to her like that.

296
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:30,301
Are you teaching me how to talk?

297
00:18:30,406 --> 00:18:32,074
She's under my protection.

298
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:35,200
Exactly. You're the only one she has.

299
00:18:39,476 --> 00:18:41,811
Can you be a little more honest?

300
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:49,251
This is funny.

301
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,395
How long have you even been here?

302
00:18:54,396 --> 00:18:55,660
Stop talking like you know everything.

303
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,331
I apologize if I was out of line.

304
00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:05,231
Let's go.

305
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:28,551
Secretary.

306
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:29,991
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:41,435
How am I supposed to talk to a teenage girl?

308
00:19:41,436 --> 00:19:42,541
Let me see.

309
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:46,574
Experts say you should listen from the other person's perspective.

310
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:49,814
Also, use positive language to improve the self-esteem of...

311
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:50,910
Forget it.

312
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:56,981
Just order some books on the subject for me.

313
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,321
Yes, sir.

314
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:23,385
You asked me why I was a restaurant owner's son for 16 years,

315
00:20:23,386 --> 00:20:24,481
remember?

316
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,620
That's when my parents...

317
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:31,720
passed away.

318
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:34,021
When I was 16.

319
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:37,021
Oh, is that right?

320
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:42,261
Why? Did they have an accident?

321
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,774
They got conned by a horrible con artist...

322
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,370
and lost everything they had.

323
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,400
My father took his own life.

324
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:54,670
My mom collapsed from the shock and eventually...

325
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:57,011
I see.

326
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:01,481
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

327
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,481
I don't know what to say in a situation like this.

328
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:07,321
It's okay. It's been a long time.

329
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:12,261
But it's not something you can forget easily.

330
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,031
You're right.

331
00:21:21,335 --> 00:21:22,541
It was very hard, wasn't it?

332
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,001
It was the same for me.

333
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:26,215
I hated being home alone.

334
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:28,670
So I slept anywhere and hung out with anyone.

335
00:21:29,085 --> 00:21:30,281
I was lonely.

336
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:31,841
Like some stray dog.

337
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:40,491
You're strong, Elijah.

338
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:45,390
- I am? - Of course.

339
00:21:45,396 --> 00:21:47,860
You endured everything alone in this big house.

340
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:51,900
You're an incredible person.

341
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:55,805
What are you saying?

342
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,874
It doesn't suit you to say such cringy things.

343
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:59,811
Aren't you usually cynical?

344
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,440
Was it obvious?

345
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:05,910
It's not easy to say things I don't mean.

346
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,081
Do you want to die?

347
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,851
You pack a hard punch.

348
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,291
I wonder who you take after.

349
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,720
Good night.

352
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,435
I have to smile while I speak.

353
00:22:57,641 --> 00:22:59,206
I'm going to smile while I talk to her.

354
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,375
Smile.

355
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,675
What is this? It was you?

356
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,645
What's with that face?

357
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,486

- How was your day? - What?

361
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:36,006
So did you have a good day?

362
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,905
Or did you have a bad day?

363
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:42,976
Is there anything you want to discuss with me?

364
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,925
Well... So...

365
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:56,556
What is it?

366
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,000
Who is the evil jerk who conned...

367
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,466
Ga On's parents?

368
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,766
You want to talk about Ga On again?

369
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,605
Right. I have to smile while I talk.

370
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,411
He scammed poor people out...

371
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,605
of hundreds of millions of dollars through a pyramid scheme.

372
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,951
There were over ten victims who committed suicide from it.

373
00:24:16,951 --> 00:24:18,875
- Really? - Yes.

374
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,645
I see.

375
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,456
Right, so...

376
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:28,026
My gosh. Secretary!

377
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,155
Secretary. Are you playing with me right now?

378
00:24:30,961 --> 00:24:32,701
All I need to do is follow what the book says?

379
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:36,165
Sir. Stress is bad for your health.

380
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,441
In the kitchen...

381
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:40,935
- What are you talking about? - Make sure you take one pill a day.

382
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:43,776
You must take care of yourself at your age.

383
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,375
Forget it. Get lost.

384
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,685
(Multivitamins)

385
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:10,500
(Blue House)

386
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,395
I will get started now.

387
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:14,711
Regarding the unexpected remark...

388
00:25:14,711 --> 00:25:17,611
that Judge Kang Yo Han made during the last live court show,

389
00:25:17,611 --> 00:25:19,981
we are carefully looking into it from all perspectives...

390
00:25:19,981 --> 00:25:21,706
It's fake news!

391
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:27,121
Hello. I, Heo Joong Se,

392
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:30,020
overcame all sorts of slanderous tricks to get to this position.

393
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,930
Now, a judge is spreading false rumors about me.

394
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:35,895
How can our country run like this?

395
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,171
Can Kang Yo Han, a man who spreads wild rumors during difficult times,

396
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:43,595
truly call himself a citizen of our great nation, Korea?

397
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:46,706
To be honest,

398
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:50,935
I have been receiving a lot of reports about Judge Kang.

399
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,010
I was told that Judge Kang...

400
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,509
is conspiring with a foreign nation to put our society in disarray.

401
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,420
That he's not a pure-blooded Korean.

402
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,520
In other words, he's different from us.

403
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,290
On top of that, I received reports...

404
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,016
that Judge Kang has been receiving funds from foreign countries.

405
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,730
For the sake of national security, if anyone gives us...

406
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,060
any information about Judge Kang Yo Han,

407
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,461
depending on the quality of the tip,

408
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:14,496
we will provide you with a significant reward.

409
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:17,865
We'll be sure to reward you heavily.

410
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,270
Will the reward come out of your own pocket?

411
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,066
- That is all. - Please answer our questions.

412
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:24,236
He's going to go that far to get information on Judge Kang?

413
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:27,706
We will organize the contents of his speech and announce it later.

414
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:32,915
Are you sure you're not going too far?

415
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,885
It's not like politics is a comedy.

416
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,519
People will have something to say about it.

417
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,615
The more comedic it is, the better.

418
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:41,030
- What? - If they get used to...

419
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,461
the comedy and competition,

420
00:26:42,461 --> 00:26:44,496
they won't see the complicated things in front of them.

421
00:26:45,431 --> 00:26:48,695
Remember how I said that I would reward depending on quality?

422
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,835
That's creating competition.

423
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,105
I'm just adding entertainment to it and moving forward.

424
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,345
My gosh. Who can stop you?

425
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,776
I'm going to get them, so they can't come to their senses.

426
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,976
Will it be okay?

427
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:07,145
What?

428
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:10,160
Ten years ago, he was a famous actor who was known for his blunt remarks,

429
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,391
but now he's the president.

430
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,631
Yes, that's right.

431
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,756
Now it's the president, Minister of Justice, media, and conglomerates.

432
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,756
That's pretty much all of Korea.

433
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,195
Right. You just picked a fight with the country.

434
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,526
Are you okay with that?

435
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:25,335
Do you know how they ended up gaining their power?

436
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,935
Through hypocrisy.

437
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:31,181
(Your help will create a happy Korea.)

438
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:34,506
When in trouble, people are moved by the smallest kindness.

439
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,445
After the pandemic, the foundation began expanding its charity.

440
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,685
But they didn't spend the most money on disaster relief.

441
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,655
What did they spend it on?

442
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,685
Advertisement.

443
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:51,726
They used all sorts of media outlets to advertise and exaggerate.

444
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,365
Noblesse oblige.

445
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,466
They created an image of the wealthy taking social responsibility.

446
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,711
They used that as a weapon to take over the administration.

447
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,635
What do you think they can do now?

448
00:28:02,141 --> 00:28:03,405
Collect their capital.

449
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:04,835
No, it goes beyond that.

450
00:28:05,641 --> 00:28:08,706
The Dream Home Village that they've been working extensively on...

451
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:12,246
is just a means of creating a large asylum using citizens' donations...

452
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:15,250
to put the homeless, the poor, and those with social discontent...

453
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,355
all in one place and get them out of sight. After that...

454
00:28:20,661 --> 00:28:23,425
they will start a widespread redevelopment of the city.

455
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,566
I bet they purchased the land for it for cheap under a borrowed land.

456
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,365
Did you get your hands on definitive evidence?

457
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,310
You know that isn't easy.

458
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,711
Those people would easily blow up my judge's chambers without hesitation.

459
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,580
And yet you blew up the issue in front of the entire nation?

460
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,645
- It's fun. - What?

461
00:28:42,981 --> 00:28:45,216
It should at least be fun...

462
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,845
if I'm standing at the edge.

463
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,361
Is this fun for you?

464
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,756
(It will be realized now.)

465
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,526
Don't you think it's irresponsible?

466
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:58,625
What about Elijah?

467
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,595
Did you even think about her?

468
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:07,435
Always.

469
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:10,435
Constantly.

470
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:19,891
Give me all the information you have on the foundation.

471
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,185
Are you going to help me?

472
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:24,556
Just promise me one thing.

473
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,860
What is it?

474
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,726
Subornation of perjury, abduction, blackmail,

475
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:31,496
and making of a fool of good citizens with your lies.

476
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:34,895
I can't become a shady law-breaker.

477
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,635
Not in front of my parents who died because of a conman,

478
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:42,105
nor in front of Soo Hyun.

479
00:29:44,881 --> 00:29:45,951
A judge...

480
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,306
(It will be realized now. A just Korea.)

481
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:52,076
has the most power when they do what the law says, sir.

482
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:57,115
"You can't become a shady law-breaker."

483
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,556
"A judge has the most power when they do..."

484
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,855
"what the law says."

485
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,125
Okay then.

486
00:30:07,401 --> 00:30:09,365
(It will be realized now. A just Korea)

487
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,306
You gained the public's interest by raising doubt,

488
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,635
so what's your next plan?

489
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,840
Division.

490
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,576
(Minbo Group)

491
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,486
There's nothing we can do if those who have power stick together.

492
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,415
We need to shake them up.

493
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:37,895
Can't we start with something like this?

494
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,839
(Minbo Group)

495
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,206
(Lowest income, extra work, Minbo Group is evil)

496
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:10,155
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

497
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,796
Okay, I understand. Bye.

498
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:20,405
What floor is the chairman's office?

499
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:23,036
Judge Kang?

500
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,175
It's the 20th floor.

501
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,185
(Lowest income, extra work. They kill you.)

502
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:34,585
This is the first floor.

503
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,786
Judge Kang Yo Han suddenly...

504
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,829
Sir. The chairman is in a meeting.

505
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,569
- I'll wait. - Oh, will you?

506
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,536
Then come this way.

507
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,905
- You can return to your work. - Thank you.

508
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:27,536
Seven minutes and 30 seconds.

509
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:36,380
You're leaving, sir?

510
00:32:36,381 --> 00:32:38,345
- I got what I needed. - I see.

511
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,056
(Minbo, 297-6 Namsandae-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul)

512
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:56,496
Goodbye.

513
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,876
You told me to call if something happened.

514
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,126
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

515
00:33:30,671 --> 00:33:33,036
Five, four,

516
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,376
three, two, one.

517
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,306
And a half, and a quarter.

518
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:44,380
(HMBN Chairman Park Du Man)

519
00:33:44,381 --> 00:33:45,815
Hello, sir.

520
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:51,856
Come on, talk to me, Judge Kang.

521
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,126
Is there something I don't know?

522
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,525
You know I'm always on your side, right?

523
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,766
That thing about buying witnesses.

524
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,505
It was Cha Kyung Hee's idea.

525
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,615
Can you handle this?

526
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,146
You made an enemy out of the foundation.

527
00:34:24,591 --> 00:34:25,990
Do you have any questions for me?

528
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,086
I can tell you everything I know.

529
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:37,936
You're sucking your fingers.

530
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,635
You're hungry, aren't you?

531
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:45,576
I was inconsiderate. Get something nice to eat.

532
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,405
Get out!

533
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,076
Eat something expensive!

534
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,246
We all work for a living, don't we?

535
00:34:54,491 --> 00:34:56,086
You can go ahead.

536
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,385
It's me.

537
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:05,126
My chairman is with someone.

538
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,595
So,

539
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,940
everything you talked about with Park Du Man.

540
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,440
Everything he said is best to assume is a lie.

541
00:35:13,441 --> 00:35:16,340
Whatever he gave you, it's fake.

542
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:18,206
He opens his mouth to lie.

543
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:20,050
Anything he says is a lie.

544
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,380
Since he was a kid...

545
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:24,719
All day long, he'd think of ways to beat me.

546
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,449
This happened in middle school.

547
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,820
When he was in middle school, he told people he was in college.

548
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:31,416
Think about it.

549
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,385
Why would I have to spend the foundation's money?

550
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:39,326
If anyone in the world did that, it would be Min Yong Shik.

551
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:41,999
Do you know how he nabbed his wife?

552
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,639
Ms. Pi.

553
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,139
He took her to a club, got her drunk, and then...

554
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,706
Minbo Group right now...

555
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,306
has a huge financial problem.

556
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:03,360
I'll get you the foundation's financial documents.

557
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,889
I have it prepared already.

558
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,590
You don't have to worry. Everything is ready.

559
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:10,630
I'll give it all to you.

560
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:14,565
Whatever Min Yong Shik gave you, you need to know they're fake.

561
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,226
Don't fall for it.

562
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,135
- Should I not? - No.

563
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:26,210
Eat up. Let's talk as we eat.

564
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:28,106
Try this. The food here's good.

568
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,780
Judge Kang, can you come with us?

569
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:38,675
The VIP wishes to see you.

570
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,385
I'm surprised, Mr. President.

571
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:19,416
About what?

572
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,186
I didn't think you'd invite me in that manner.

573
00:38:23,361 --> 00:38:24,695
It was scary.

574
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,030
They acted like they could've buried me.

575
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:28,900
Why would you say that?

576
00:38:28,901 --> 00:38:32,599
You put my photo up for the world to see...

577
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,369
and ruined my reputation.

578
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,106
It would be too hard to do something to you.

579
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,005
But the thing is,

580
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:43,445
that is why...

581
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:47,949
people would think there's no way I'd touch you.

582
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,519
Would the head of state...

583
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,960
take action during an uproar?

584
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,559
Wouldn't that be fun?

585
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,695
While people wonder, time will pass.

586
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,329
If I were to release a few celebrity scandals,

587
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,840
people will forget about it in no time.

588
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,396
Like goldfish.

589
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,306
It's a reasonable scenario.

590
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,519
You're nervous.

591
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,115
The great Judge Kang Yo Han.

592
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:23,556
You look good in a suit.

593
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,420
You seem to be busy these days,

594
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,730
meeting this fool and that.

595
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,856
I am. Just like right now.

596
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:37,436
This fool and that fool.

597
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,965
What on earth did they give you?

598
00:39:44,481 --> 00:39:46,606
The scenario I just mentioned.

599
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:48,150
Doesn't it sound fun?

600
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:52,445
I could make that scenario happen right this moment.

601
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:57,356
If that's the case...

602
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:02,786

603
00:40:03,531 --> 00:40:05,595
Oh? What...

604
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,595
Greetings, subscribers of Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing.

605
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,670
It's a pleasure to meet you. Today, Mr. President invited me.

606
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:15,036
- Thank you, Mr. President. - Is this live?

607
00:40:15,341 --> 00:40:18,539
Wow, so many people joined and we just got started.

608
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,005
We're getting lots of comments too.

609
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,845
Yes, I am Kang Yo Han the judge.

610
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:27,090
Thank you, Mr. President, for changing your mind.

611
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,286
You promise to take a close look into the foundation's corruption?

612
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:33,360
He invited me to the Blue House...

613
00:40:33,361 --> 00:40:36,155
and suggested we give a joint statement.

614
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,396
- I appreciate it, Mr. President. - Well, Judge Kang...

615
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:43,100
Mr. President and I will find out...

616
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,095
how every dollar of your donations is being used.

617
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:48,010
That's it for today.

Wave at the camera.

624
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:03,115
Put on a smile.

625
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,615

Wow, is your analysis already over?

628
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,735
- Impressive. - It looked complicated at first,

629
00:41:24,781 --> 00:41:27,045
- but I've found a weak spot. - A weak spot?

630
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,450
PR. They've been doing too much PR.

631
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,781
They've been pouring out articles saying the foundation has donated...

632
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,215
10, 20 million dollars to the Dream Home project,

633
00:41:35,591 --> 00:41:36,885
but the amount is just too big.

634
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,390
The project should be able to be covered...

635
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:42,286
solely by the donations from the public so far.

636
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,131
They've been advertising about their donations...

637
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:46,425
while the project is covered by donations from the public?

638
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,896
It's just my suspicion.

639
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:51,496
We'll need the foundation's financial data to be sure.

640
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,836
The data from Park Du Man and Min Yong Shik...

641
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:55,565
are fake, aren't they?

642
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:57,540
Yes, they both fabricated the data...

643
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,275
so it'd look like the other embezzled money.

644
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,746
I didn't expect those sly dogs to give up data easily anyway.

645
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:04,445
Did we get any tip-offs?

646
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:06,051
Nothing useful.

647
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:09,115
They were all pranks or lies from people who are after the reward.

648
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,556
We should still pay them.

649
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:13,215
- Pardon? - I mean the reward.

650
00:42:13,361 --> 00:42:15,485
Why should we?

651
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,795
What's important is the number, not the content.

652
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,396
Put up the number of tip-offs all over the Internet.

653
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,695

657
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,416
You sound like an experienced con artist.

658
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,715
It slipped my mind.

659
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,755
You've been personally affected by a con artist.

660
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:56,896
But isn't this a little different?

661
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:01,135

He's here!

Don't do it.

688
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,516
Don't ruin your life over a crook like him.

689
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,155
He's not worth it, Ga On.

690
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,606
- Thank you. - Thank you.

691
00:47:31,941 --> 00:47:34,910
I'm being discharged soon. You don't have to come every day.

692
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,545
It's a hassle.

693
00:47:36,611 --> 00:47:40,786
Weren't you complaining all morning that he wasn't here?

694
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,990
Shouldn't you protect a patient's privacy?

695
00:47:44,991 --> 00:47:46,385
Maybe it was someone else.

696
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,985
You did that?

697
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:56,095
Anyway, what on earth is Kang Yo Han up to?

698
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:58,496
This looks like a total fraud to me.

699
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,806
What?

700
00:48:02,941 --> 00:48:04,235
You should rest up.

701
00:48:04,241 --> 00:48:05,281
Your recovery is more important.

702
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:07,976
How can I rest up? I've got so much digging to do.

703
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,380
The false testimony,

704
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:11,115
the church fire,

705
00:48:11,281 --> 00:48:13,775
and Elijah. Is she doing okay?

706
00:48:16,821 --> 00:48:18,416
It must've been too much to deal with...

707
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,456
at such a young age.

708
00:48:22,761 --> 00:48:24,956
Did she remind you of me when I was little?

709
00:48:27,171 --> 00:48:28,626
You're shameless.

710
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,571
How could you compare yourself to that adorable girl?

711
00:48:30,571 --> 00:48:33,100
Can't you look at yourself more objectively?

712
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,206
Yes, ma'am.

713
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:36,235
You're obviously fine. I'll get going.

714
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:40,336
I can't stand you, but you're still my guest.

715
00:48:40,341 --> 00:48:41,706
Do you want some apples?

716
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,675
I can't believe you, Soo Hyun.

717
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:49,315
Show me how well you can peel an apple.

718
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:54,385
All right. Let's see here.

719
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,896
What's wrong?

720
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:27,586
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

721
00:49:30,761 --> 00:49:31,996
I'll do it.

722
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:34,266
If you peel it, there won't be anything left to eat.

723
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,036
Gosh, you're one cold punk.

724
00:49:56,245 --> 00:49:57,884
Judge Kang Yo Han has received...

725
00:49:57,885 --> 00:50:00,213
over 20 tips regarding the corruption...

726
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:02,753
of Social Responsibility Foundation.

727
00:50:02,754 --> 00:50:05,924
Other than stating that they are all false,

728
00:50:05,925 --> 00:50:08,893
the foundation has not released any other official statements.

729
00:50:08,894 --> 00:50:11,663
Over 100,000 petitions to reveal the truth have been submitted...

730
00:50:11,664 --> 00:50:13,320
to the Blue House National Petition.

731
00:50:14,334 --> 00:50:16,159
Don't get distracted and get back to work.

732
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,969
I heard you can say anything, and they'll give you money.

733
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:28,744
I heard it's a lot of money too.

734
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:29,869
It's true.

735
00:50:30,684 --> 00:50:32,940
I have a lot of expenses next month, should I try it too?

736
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,380
No way. What if you get caught?

737
00:50:37,584 --> 00:50:41,520
They actively support Kang Yo Han? Those jerks in the opposition party.

738
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,963
"The live court show was a means to distract the citizens."

739
00:50:44,964 --> 00:50:47,023
"It could violate human rights."

740
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:49,963
That's what they said as they tried to act so high and mighty.

741
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,059
That's what politics is like.

742
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:53,900
The enemy of your enemies is an ally.

743
00:50:53,934 --> 00:50:55,099
More importantly,

744
00:50:56,075 --> 00:51:00,139
what did you two give Kang Yo Han?

745
00:51:02,414 --> 00:51:04,284
It's nothing. It really isn't.

746
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:06,639
I gave him something to mess with him and confuse him.

747
00:51:06,785 --> 00:51:08,284
While you're at it, were you hoping it messed with me too?

748
00:51:08,285 --> 00:51:10,550
Gosh, what do you take me for?

749
00:51:10,854 --> 00:51:12,385
In any case, Kang Yo Han...

750
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:14,020
will just dig himself into a deeper hole by looking into it.

751
00:51:14,354 --> 00:51:16,494
What about you, Chairman Min? What did you give him?

752
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:18,424
Are you planning on getting into the broadcasting business with me gone?

753
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:19,759
That's a good idea.

754
00:51:20,464 --> 00:51:23,063
- You punk. What are you saying? - Let go.

755
00:51:23,064 --> 00:51:24,500
Who do you think...

756
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:28,170
would like what's going on here?

757
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,773
The walls of a castle are broken from the inside out.

758
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:35,873
Fix it before it gets too late.

759
00:51:35,874 --> 00:51:39,279
Kang Yo Han will keep going without giving you a chance to breathe.

760
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:48,290
(Sir, Judge Kang is holding a press conference and airing it live.)

761
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:50,590

We keep getting tips.

765
00:52:03,374 --> 00:52:05,540
Many people are being courageous and stepping up...

766
00:52:05,544 --> 00:52:07,444
to help reveal the truth.

767
00:52:07,445 --> 00:52:09,444
Thanks to the courageous informants,

768
00:52:09,445 --> 00:52:11,380
the behavior of the foundation is changing too.

769
00:52:11,644 --> 00:52:13,884
Did you all watch the president's YouTube video?

770
00:52:13,885 --> 00:52:15,554
Korea's Total Change.

771
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:18,520
- Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing. - How refreshing!

772
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:23,889
There's something that's even more surprising.

773
00:52:28,195 --> 00:52:31,103
Two executive directors of the foundation gave me something...

774
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,529
and said it was their financial records.

775
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,574
- What is that? - What did he give him?

776
00:52:36,575 --> 00:52:38,300
- What's in the envelopes? - What could it be?

777
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:03,159
- What is that? - He gave him something too?

778
00:53:12,845 --> 00:53:14,070
It's very interesting.

779
00:53:14,475 --> 00:53:16,969
They gave a subcontract to a company run by a family member,

780
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:19,509
and they bought a site for a future business venture in advance.

781
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:24,150
As it happens, the documents they gave me had opposing information,

782
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:26,219
so I need to look into it further.

783
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:29,454
However, this isn't the only problem. Let's have a look.

785
00:53:31,995 --> 00:53:33,864

(Status of Donations)

787
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:42,770
Where is all of the money that the directors have donated...

788
00:53:43,004 --> 00:53:44,400

(Status of Donations)

790
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:52,384
According to Judge Kim Ga On,

791
00:53:52,385 --> 00:53:55,849
who has gone through all of the foundation's financial records,

792
00:53:56,385 --> 00:53:57,825
the amount that they claimed to have donated,

793
00:53:57,825 --> 00:53:59,779
and the amount that was received by the foundation...

794
00:53:59,825 --> 00:54:01,190
don't add up.

795
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,559
Did you really get your hands on the foundation's financial records?

796
00:54:12,234 --> 00:54:13,329
Yes.

797
00:54:13,865 --> 00:54:16,369
A courageous person on the inside sent it to us.

798
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:18,944
If the amounts don't add up,

799
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,639
does that mean someone embezzled that money?

800
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:22,014
If they didn't embezzle it,

801
00:54:22,015 --> 00:54:23,809
then they never donated anything from the beginning.

803
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:33,619
Did Judge Kim Ga On participate in revealing this as well?

804
00:54:37,794 --> 00:54:38,989
Yes, that's right.

805

(I am against it.)

807
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:49,099
Judge Kim Ga On is known as an uptight man of principle.

808
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:52,770
But I'm sure you were unaware of this.

809
00:54:53,544 --> 00:54:54,770
Oh, my.

814
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:29,639
Judge Kim overcame such hardship.

00:55:29,914 --> 00:55:32,643
That's why he couldn't stand by and watch...

After we take all measures to protect the people who sent us tips,

818
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:48,590
we will reveal all of the contents of the reports we received.

819
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:51,563
It'll take place in one week right here.

820
00:55:51,564 --> 00:55:52,659
Thank you,

821
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:04,543
Do you have an informant from the foundation?

822
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:05,983
Do you know the informant?

823
00:56:05,984 --> 00:56:08,154
Judge Kim. Is that article really about your parents?

824
00:56:08,155 --> 00:56:10,014
- Could you tell us more? - Is it true?

825
00:56:10,015 --> 00:56:12,083
- Would you like to add anything? - Please give us a statement.

826
00:56:12,084 --> 00:56:13,179

827
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:17,563

829
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:21,889
- Judge Kim. - Excuse me.

830
00:56:21,894 --> 00:56:25,534

Was this your plan all along?

834
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:40,340
Was I just a tool for your scheme?

835
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,413
How are you any different from them?

836
00:56:42,414 --> 00:56:45,119
Is it okay to use whatever you want to achieve your goal?

00:56:45,524 --> 00:56:48,224
"You can't become a shady law-breaker."

Don't you think you're being a bit naive?

00:56:55,934 --> 00:56:57,659
This is a war.

841
00:56:58,934 --> 00:57:00,929
What are you going to reveal next week?

842
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:03,869
The financial records you perjured? The tips that don't exist?

843
00:57:04,175 --> 00:57:06,239
Even if it takes time and is hard,

844
00:57:06,575 --> 00:57:09,440
we should punish them properly according to the law.

845
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:12,480
Really? I guess you were satisfied.

846
00:57:12,914 --> 00:57:16,483
I guess you were really moved by the strict punishment...

847
00:57:16,484 --> 00:57:18,650
the fraud who killed your parents received.

848
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:20,924
- Shut your mouth. - Just like you said,

849
00:57:20,925 --> 00:57:23,424
they followed all the principles and processes...

850
00:57:23,425 --> 00:57:26,224
and endured the tricks laid out by the expensive lawyers.

851
00:57:26,225 --> 00:57:28,264
They endured the trial as it got drawn out,

852
00:57:28,265 --> 00:57:30,393
and the sentence he received was 17 years in prison.

853
00:57:30,394 --> 00:57:33,663
Is that it? Is that what justice is to you?

854
00:57:33,664 --> 00:57:35,500
Don't talk like that!

855
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,540
Ordinary citizens like my parents...

856
00:57:43,214 --> 00:57:46,139
were a part of the jury and they contemplated it for a long time.

857
00:57:47,044 --> 00:57:48,913
Despite all the tricks,

858
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:51,619
they came to a conclusion in accordance with the law.

859
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:53,619
That's the system.

860
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:57,020
Even if we hate it, that's the system.

861
00:57:59,495 --> 00:58:02,290
Is that what you had to believe in order to live?

862
00:58:04,734 --> 00:58:06,404
Is that what Yoon Soo Hyun and Min Jung Ho...

863
00:58:06,405 --> 00:58:09,900
the two people you have left in your life told you?

864
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:14,204
Did you suppress your desire to stab and kill him and end your life...

865
00:58:14,205 --> 00:58:16,509
by holding onto that belief?

866
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:21,179
Is that it? Is it?

867
00:58:23,814 --> 00:58:25,219
Don't come to your own conclusions.

868
00:58:27,385 --> 00:58:28,489
Who do you think you are?

869
00:58:32,595 --> 00:58:34,020
Who do you think you are?

870
00:58:48,115 --> 00:58:50,070
There's something I want to show you.

871
00:58:56,584 --> 00:59:00,480
What... What happened? What is going on?

872
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:02,190
That's impossible.

873
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,520
It's impossible to take out the financial records.

874
00:59:05,095 --> 00:59:07,759
Chairman Min. Can you take responsibility for this?

875
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:10,489
What if all of this is true?

876
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:13,034
He said he'd reveal it in a week.

877
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:16,070
The entire nation will be watching. What are you going to do?

878
00:59:16,305 --> 00:59:18,800
The viewership ratings will be off the charts.

879
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:22,139
That's enough!

880
00:59:22,144 --> 00:59:23,710
My gosh, you punk!

881
00:59:25,414 --> 00:59:27,340
I'm pretty good at playing cards,

882
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:29,413
and I can tell Kang Yo Han is bluffing.

883
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:31,520
He doesn't have anything, so he's coming out stronger.

884
00:59:33,885 --> 00:59:35,949
Excuse me.

885
00:59:37,495 --> 00:59:38,995
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

886
00:59:38,995 --> 00:59:43,130
Kang Yo Han is capable of making cards if he doesn't have any.

887
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:45,300
Without batting an eyelid.

888
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:47,064
Then we must cut off his hands!

889
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:49,603
It's a huge game and the whole nation's watching.

890
00:59:49,604 --> 00:59:52,270
You three voluntarily upped the stakes.

891
00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:55,610
To reveal that Kang Yo Han is bluffing,

892
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:58,079
you must show your hands.

893
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:00,480
Are you okay with that?

894
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:04,250
Your trumped up donations aren't the only problem.

895
01:00:04,254 --> 01:00:07,353
Every detail on how the Dream Home project funds were spent.

896
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,020
Future spending plans and...

897
01:00:11,825 --> 01:00:14,630
the project's real purpose.

898
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:16,659
Ms. Jung.

899
01:00:17,394 --> 01:00:18,599
I apologize.

900
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,570
I spoke out of line.

901
01:00:22,004 --> 01:00:25,469
So what? What are you saying?

902
01:00:25,604 --> 01:00:27,239
What will you do about this?

903
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:30,369
We have...

904
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:34,409
Mr. Seo, don't we?

905
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:54,900
(Fasting and Praying for Korea, Do Not Enter)

906
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:11,420
Thanks to Kang Yo Han,

907
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:16,090
will I get the chance to get back up?

908
01:02:11,945 --> 01:02:13,110
He's here.

909
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:18,179
- Mr. Seo. - Mr. Seo.

910
01:02:21,495 --> 01:02:25,320
There's no way to meet you when you're in prayer.

911
01:02:25,425 --> 01:02:27,989
It can't have been easy to join us.

912
01:02:28,195 --> 01:02:30,829
You all look dreadful.

913
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:33,529
Why?

914
01:02:34,305 --> 01:02:38,040
Is this issue getting you worked up?

915
01:02:39,075 --> 01:02:41,909
Yes. It's such a mess.

916
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:44,739
We must sort it out before it's too late.

917
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,309
I have employees who are getting ideas.

918
01:02:49,055 --> 01:02:50,909
I will deal with it.

919
01:02:54,524 --> 01:02:56,725
If you were to help us,

920
01:02:56,725 --> 01:02:58,724
we'd have nothing to worry about.

921
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:00,995
That's right. Mr. Seo, in our country,

922
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:05,099
you are the only person who can sort this out.

923
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:07,500
Yes. You're the only one.

924
01:03:07,564 --> 01:03:10,529
The last remaining true teacher.

925
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:12,374
An elder of society.

926
01:03:12,374 --> 01:03:13,969
You're going too far.

927
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,570
Anyway,

928
01:03:16,015 --> 01:03:18,139
if I were to speak,

929
01:03:18,245 --> 01:03:22,885
the public will awaken from Kang Yo Han's trickery...

930
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:24,309
and come around.

931
01:03:24,885 --> 01:03:28,520
There is no reason to react to every small allegation.

932
01:03:28,524 --> 01:03:30,055
You are right.

933
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:32,695
Once we gain control of the media,

934
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:35,964
we can turn the flow and ride it out.

935
01:03:35,964 --> 01:03:37,294
I'm so impressed.

936
01:03:37,294 --> 01:03:38,834
You hit the nail on the head.

937
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:40,730
Still, we need...

938
01:03:41,434 --> 01:03:43,469
something to toss them.

939
01:03:48,175 --> 01:03:49,874
Something to toss?

940
01:03:49,874 --> 01:03:52,885
The people need something like a bone...

941
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:54,440
to keep them quiet.

942
01:03:54,584 --> 01:03:57,880
Something to bite and chew on.

943
01:03:59,325 --> 01:04:01,750
If you were to name someone,

944
01:04:01,854 --> 01:04:03,124
who would it be?

945
01:04:03,124 --> 01:04:04,389
Come on now.

946
01:04:04,524 --> 01:04:07,790
Don't we all know someone ideal?

947
01:04:08,635 --> 01:04:12,400
While I remained in my room praying for our country,

948
01:04:13,635 --> 01:04:17,599
someone has been handling all the foundation's business.

949
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:20,139
Do you mean Ms. Jung?

950
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:25,945
Ms. Jung does her job so carefully and thoroughly.

951
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:27,309
Doesn't she?

952
01:04:27,314 --> 01:04:29,110
She's still a mere slave.

953
01:04:29,484 --> 01:04:32,679
Didn't we groom her up to use her at a time like this?

954
01:04:35,825 --> 01:04:38,290
How do you think we should...

955
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:40,420
put her to good use, then?

956
01:04:40,595 --> 01:04:44,559
She's not the type to stay quiet if we frame her for something.

957
01:04:45,004 --> 01:04:46,500
First,

958
01:04:47,004 --> 01:04:51,270
we must make sure that she doesn't talk.

959
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:53,570
- Right? - Of course.

960
01:04:55,015 --> 01:04:56,270
Forever.

961
01:04:57,314 --> 01:04:59,639
Silence her so she'll take the fall.

962
01:05:00,245 --> 01:05:01,440
Do you understand?

963
01:05:07,254 --> 01:05:08,590
I understand.

964
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:10,590
Forever.

965
01:05:35,754 --> 01:05:39,550
(True correction, a bright future)

966
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:42,489
What are you doing?

967
01:05:42,495 --> 01:05:43,690
Get out.

968
01:05:51,195 --> 01:05:52,699
(Corrections)

969
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:29,569
We're huge fans, Judge Kang.

970
01:06:31,644 --> 01:06:32,644

971
01:06:32,644 --> 01:06:33,745
- We are... - We are...

972

power!

973
01:06:34,844 --> 01:06:36,109
- power! - power!

974
01:06:39,545 --> 01:06:41,079
You have our respect.

975
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:51,024
- We are... - We are...

976
01:06:51,024 --> 01:06:53,189
- power! - power!

978
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,290
- power! - power!

01:06:57,335 --> 01:06:59,199
- We are... - We are...

980
01:06:59,205 --> 01:07:00,304
power!

981

(Advanced correction brings on the future)

982
01:07:02,075 --> 01:07:06,369

(Advanced correction brings on the future)

Inmate number 70618,

986
01:07:23,724 --> 01:07:26,260
Doh Young Choon. Visiting Room Seven.

987
01:07:33,604 --> 01:07:35,630
Do you want me to lose my mind?

988
01:07:36,474 --> 01:07:38,939
Do you want to see me strangle him?

989
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:43,340
You scumbag.

990
01:07:56,825 --> 01:07:59,394
Inmate number 70618,

991
01:07:59,394 --> 01:08:00,760
Doh Young Choon.

992
01:08:35,665 --> 01:08:36,790
No.

993
01:08:37,234 --> 01:08:38,699
He's not Doh Young Choon.

994
01:08:39,104 --> 01:08:41,199
He's someone else. Something's wrong.

995
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:44,600
Inmate number 70618, he is Doh Young Choon.

996
01:08:45,405 --> 01:08:46,600
He's not.

997
01:08:47,174 --> 01:08:48,769
He's not Doh Young Choon.

998
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:50,540
This is impossible.

999
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:52,884
It's someone else.

1000
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:56,250
He got additional charges for economic crimes...

1001
01:08:56,354 --> 01:08:57,750
and was sentenced to 17 years.

1002
01:08:57,854 --> 01:09:00,050
Name, Doh Young Choon.

1003
01:09:02,495 --> 01:09:05,159
(Doh Young Choon, factory worker, high school dropout)

1004
01:09:09,894 --> 01:09:12,859
I don't know what your story is,

1005
01:09:12,934 --> 01:09:16,199
but his inmate and ID number, date of imprisonment,

1006
01:09:16,234 --> 01:09:17,630
they all match up.

1007
01:09:24,215 --> 01:09:25,409
Never once,

1008
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:30,310
not even for a single day have I forgotten his face.

1009
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:37,250
It's not him. It's another person.

1010
01:09:38,255 --> 01:09:40,359
Sir, why are you in there?

1011
01:09:41,165 --> 01:09:42,260
Sir.

1012
01:09:42,465 --> 01:09:44,790
Why are you in there? Come out.

1013
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:46,130
Sir!

1014
01:10:11,155 --> 01:10:12,260
Let's go.

(Establishment of order, promotion of morality)

1016
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,473
The only thing that can be thoroughly manipulated...

1017
01:11:02,474 --> 01:11:04,170
is the system itself.

1018
01:11:04,745 --> 01:11:06,040
This is the system.

1019
01:11:07,085 --> 01:11:09,409
A system has no chance against power.

1020
01:11:10,514 --> 01:11:14,479
Power can control a system however it likes.

1021
01:11:27,405 --> 01:11:31,100
(Morality)

1022
01:13:20,585 --> 01:13:23,050
- Oh... - Have you been somewhere?

1023
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,550
No.

1024
01:13:25,825 --> 01:13:28,180
I just stepped out for some air.

1025
01:13:28,854 --> 01:13:30,149
That's not good.

1026
01:13:30,724 --> 01:13:34,119
The air is too cold for an old man like you.

1027
01:13:34,564 --> 01:13:36,294
Your knees must be freezing.

1028
01:13:36,295 --> 01:13:38,760
No, I'm fine.

1029
01:13:54,884 --> 01:13:56,680
You've aged.

1030
01:13:59,955 --> 01:14:01,149
Is it because of me?

1031
01:14:02,295 --> 01:14:04,423
Because I have something on you...

1032
01:14:04,424 --> 01:14:06,159
and have been bullying you?

1033
01:14:06,325 --> 01:14:09,060
No, not at all.

1034
01:14:09,965 --> 01:14:11,960
It's all my fault.

1035
01:14:13,734 --> 01:14:16,399
I'm not in the position to blame anyone.

1036
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:19,769
Are you sure?

1037
01:14:23,014 --> 01:14:25,714
Wow, I'm impressed.

1038
01:14:25,715 --> 01:14:27,939
I'd blame me.

1039
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:31,579
I guess all the meditating paid off.

1040
01:14:36,524 --> 01:14:37,689
Remember?

1041
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:42,290
When I first came here to work for you,

1042
01:14:43,295 --> 01:14:46,100
I was still pretty young.

1043
01:14:47,304 --> 01:14:48,399
Yes,

1044
01:14:49,405 --> 01:14:50,600
you were.

1045
01:14:52,304 --> 01:14:53,739
Why did you do that?

1046
01:14:56,274 --> 01:14:57,939
Why?

1047
01:14:59,945 --> 01:15:02,079
I was just a little girl who had nowhere else to go.

1048
01:15:19,835 --> 01:15:22,829
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

1049
01:15:23,174 --> 01:15:25,500
I never got the chance to cry once.

1050
01:15:36,255 --> 01:15:37,350
Stand up.

1051
01:16:08,785 --> 01:16:10,779
Let's put an end to this.

1052
01:16:12,825 --> 01:16:14,319
I forgive you.

1053
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:17,189
Pardon?

1054
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:21,994
I do. You're an important person.

1055
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:24,090
It's your responsibility to save this country.

1056
01:16:25,234 --> 01:16:27,399
Everything's already been discussed.

1057
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:45,210
It's okay. Everything will be all right.

1058
01:16:47,224 --> 01:16:51,590
You'll die an honorable death as the respected Chairman Seo.

1059
01:16:52,594 --> 01:16:53,920
It's more than you deserve.

1060
01:16:54,825 --> 01:16:57,060
It's a lot more...

1061
01:16:58,165 --> 01:17:01,600
than a pig like you deserves.

1062
01:17:40,245 --> 01:17:44,044
Chairman Seo Jeong Hak of Social Responsibility Foundation passed on.

1063
01:17:44,045 --> 01:17:45,944
It's been reported that he took his own life...

1064
01:17:45,945 --> 01:17:48,244
as a way to take responsibility...

1065
01:17:48,245 --> 01:17:50,380
for the recent donation embezzlement allegations.

1066
01:17:50,384 --> 01:17:52,683
All the employees involved in the embezzlement...

1067
01:17:52,684 --> 01:17:54,983
have destroyed all evidence and fled.

1068
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:57,454
It seems that the deceased was devastated by this...

1069
01:17:57,455 --> 01:17:59,494
and decided to bear his cross.

1070
01:17:59,495 --> 01:18:01,664
Overcoming many hardships, he devoted his life...

1071
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:04,964
to helping those in need and promoting the national spirit.

1072
01:18:04,965 --> 01:18:07,933
His death has left the entire country in grief.

(The Devil Judge)

1081
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:26,500
I lived on so I could go back there.

1082
01:20:27,575 --> 01:20:31,014
As the master of the world you kicked me out of.

1083
01:20:31,014 --> 01:20:33,215
A monster who releases their brakes...

1084
01:20:33,215 --> 01:20:34,983
never stops when it's best.

1085
01:20:34,984 --> 01:20:36,210
What are you doing?

1086
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:38,314
The show must go on.

1087
01:20:38,314 --> 01:20:40,624
The public's support is our only weapon.

1088
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,155
What is Kang Yo Han's intention?

1089
01:20:42,155 --> 01:20:45,590
You want me to see you enjoy life so I will lose my mind!

1090
01:20:45,594 --> 01:20:48,159
I told you before. Any elements of risk...

1091
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:50,829
You are a lot like me in this aspect.

1092
01:20:51,094 --> 01:20:52,529
Is that why you like me?
