It's PR. They advertised it way too much.

They kept advertising that

00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,620

10 or 20 billion won for the project.

660

They kept taking the credit
by publishing stories.

661
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,590
But it's way too much money.

662
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:04,130
Given the scale of the project,
the donations from the public

663
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,000
should be enough to kickstart it.

664
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,870
When they are using the donations
from the people,

665
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:10,140

the credit for the donations?

666
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,600
It's just a suspicion for now.

667

01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,319
No, he's not.

1050
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:12,490
He's not Do Young-chun.

1051
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,260
No way.

1052
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,630
He's a completely different man.

1053
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:19,960
Special economic crimes,
violation on additional punishment,

1054
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,470

[Do Young-chun]

1057
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,580
I don't know what this is about,

1058
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,920
but his prisoner number, ID number,
and date of admission into prison

1059
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,350
all match.

1060
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:49,130
I didn't forget his face,

1061
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:54,030
not even for a single day.

1062
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,970
No. He's a different man.

1063
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:04,070
Sir, what are you doing there?

1064
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:05,980
Sir.

1065
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,510
What are you doing there? Come on out.

1066
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:09,850
Hey!

1067
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:35,970
Let's go.

1068

[Establish order, develop morality]

1070
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,220
If anything can fabricate the whole thing,

1071
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,890
it would be the entire system.

1072
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,760
This is the system.

1073
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:33,130
And the system is helpless against power,

1074
01:11:34,330 --> 01:11:38,200
which has absolute control
over the system.

You've been out.

1079

No.

1080
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:51,900
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

1081
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,870
Oh, no.

1082
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,840
Isn't fresh air too cold
for your old body?

1083
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:00,040
It hurts your joints too.

1084
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,480
No, I'm okay.

1085
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,400
You're pretty old.

1086
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:24,870
Is it because of me?

1087
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,170
Because I've been disturbing you

1088
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,870
with the thing I have on you?

1089
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,780
No, ma'am.

1090
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:35,680
It's my fault. I deserve it.

1091
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:40,120
I can't blame anyone.

1092
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,490
Are you sure?

1093
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,460
Gosh. You're amazing.

1094
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:51,660
If I were you, I would've resented me.

1095
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:55,300
Those who do mindfulness exercises
are different indeed.

1096
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:01,400
Remember?

1097
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:06,010
When I first came here
to take care of you,

1098
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:09,810
I was pretty young.

1099
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,120
Right.

1100
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,320
You were young.

1101
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,450
Why did you do that?

1102
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:21,660
Why did you do that

1103
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,800
to the poor young girl
who had nowhere to go?

1104
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:46,550
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

1105
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:49,220
I didn't get to cry.

1106
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,060
Stand up.

1107
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,500
Let's stop this.

1108
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:38,030
I forgive you.

1109
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:40,900
What?

1110
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,740
Because you're an important person.

1111
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:47,810
You're the person to fix this country.

1112
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:51,110
I'm done talking now.

1113
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,930
Don't worry.
Everything is going to be all right.

1114

You're dying an honorable death
as Mr. Seo.

And you don't deserve it.

1116

You don't deserve it at all.

1117
