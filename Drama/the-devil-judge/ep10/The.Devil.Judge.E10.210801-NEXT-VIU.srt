(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,392
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:21,093
(Episode 10)

4
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,262
My money.

5
00:00:29,038 --> 00:00:31,172
My money. It's mine.

6
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:35,543
- Chief. Chief! - There are people inside!

7
00:00:37,247 --> 00:00:39,216
- There are people inside! - Stop it!

8
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,716
- Let us out! - No!

9
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:41,812
Chief!

10
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,952
- Kang Yo Han! - Don't do it!

11
00:00:44,058 --> 00:00:45,223
Stop it!

12
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:48,022
I'm only trying to give him an opportunity.

13
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:51,566
- Don't do it. - Save them.

14
00:00:51,567 --> 00:00:52,966
- Don't do it. - Don't do it!

15
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,062
No!

16
00:00:57,637 --> 00:00:58,732
Hey.

17
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:01,702
Don't do it.

18
00:01:13,318 --> 00:01:16,612
Honey! Get us out of here!

19
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,252
Save us! Help!

20
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:24,452
Let me go. Let go!

21
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,163
Calm down and look at him.

22
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:31,603
My money!

23
00:01:32,937 --> 00:01:34,032
My money.

24
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:40,903
My money!

25
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:45,516
- My money! - Honey! Save us!

26
00:01:45,517 --> 00:01:46,782
My money!

27
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,353
No!

28
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:56,523
What is this? It's all fake!

29
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,092
It's not my money.

30
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,722
It's not my money.

31
00:02:01,228 --> 00:02:03,362
It's not mine!

32
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,803
- I must save them! - Relax.

33
00:02:10,437 --> 00:02:12,002
Relax and watch.

34
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:24,282
This is... What happened is... So... This is...

35
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,053
He lied to his family too.

36
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:28,122
That he'd lost all the money.

37
00:02:29,127 --> 00:02:30,222
Seo Jin.

38
00:02:31,127 --> 00:02:34,222
Seo Jin. Daddy didn't have a choice.

39
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:37,632
Honey, I'll explain everything. I'll...

40
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:41,102
Darn you!

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,972
Don't go! Stay!

42
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:48,002
Don't go!

43
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:56,382
Here. Get your revenge if you want.

44
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:57,852
Don't hesitate.

45
00:03:04,558 --> 00:03:06,023
Don't hurt me.

46
00:03:07,328 --> 00:03:10,767
I'm sorry. Let me live. I'm sorry for what I did.

47
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,733
Please don't kill me.

48
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,983
I'm really sorry.

49
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:39,292
My money.

50
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:41,933
My money! My money...

51
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,042
He's our only bait to get Cha Kyung Hee.

52
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,872
Let's not waste him.

53
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:39,153
Are you having fun?

54
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:41,123
Not really.

55
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:42,956
I don't know what else to do with cards.

56
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,592
- You don't know? - No.

57
00:04:44,858 --> 00:04:47,492
- Haven't you played cards? - Who would I play with?

58
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,932
Well, with your family I guess.

59
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:53,362
Or with your friends.

60
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,278
I'm sorry. I'm saying useless things again.

61
00:04:57,278 --> 00:04:58,903
Are you trying to meddle in my life again?

62
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:00,773
Don't make an assumption about me.

63
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:03,342
I don't like hanging out with people.

64
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:08,242
Anyway.

65
00:05:10,058 --> 00:05:11,313
I want to thank you...

66
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,722
for catching Doh Young Choon.

67
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,453
You don't have to.

68
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:18,393
We've only built the second floor so far.

69
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:19,862
The second floor?

70
00:05:19,897 --> 00:05:23,092
Through Cha Kyung Hee's secretary, we caught Doh Young Choon.

71
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:25,608
Now we should work on the third floor.

72
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:28,633
When we're done with Cha Kyung Hee, will we deal with Heo Joong Se?

73
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,203
Who's at the end?

74
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:34,003
I don't know how tall the building will be.

75
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:36,118
But what I'm more interested in is...

76
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,583
bringing down the building at once.

77
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,052
You thought I'd bring it down, didn't you?

78
00:05:44,957 --> 00:05:46,387
So did you look into Juk Chang?

79
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,987
It seemed you were digging up his back.

80
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:49,098
Yes.

81
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,893
Juk Chang and his gang started assaulting people on the street...

82
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,197
when Heo Joong Se started instigating his followers...

83
00:05:54,197 --> 00:05:56,497
to take to the streets.

84
00:05:56,497 --> 00:05:58,608
We can't just depend on the police.

85
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:02,637
We should take the initiative to make this country safe.

86
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:05,373
Tonight, we will become the real heroes.

87
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,443
What else did you find out?

88
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:12,213
- Well, Secretary? - Yes, sir.

89
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:15,417
Can you turn on episode 86 of Heo Joong Se's show?

90
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:16,988
The second week in September four years ago.

91
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:18,213
Yes, sir.

92
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,253
You two are close friends now.

93
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:26,028
Korea's Total Change. I'm Heo Joong Se.

94
00:06:26,028 --> 00:06:28,668
- How refreshing! - How refreshing!

95
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,693
Hello, I'm Do Yeon Jung.

96
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:33,503
Hi! I'm Heo Joong Se.

97
00:06:33,507 --> 00:06:35,207
Kids I love and respect.

98
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:38,237
Do you know why you're unemployed losers?

99
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:41,278
Do you know why you've never gone out...

100
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:42,947
with a pretty lady like my wife...

101
00:06:42,947 --> 00:06:44,977
and lead a low life?

102
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,647
I'll tell you the reason.

103
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,383
It's because of the higher-ups. The privileged ones.

104
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,753
It's because they abandoned you.

105
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,992
There's a cheap labor force that would do anything for them.

106
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,827
They are cheap foreigners.

107
00:06:57,827 --> 00:07:00,868
The privileged people are replacing you guys...

108
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,763
with these cheap foreigners.

109
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,368
Do you understand me?

110
00:07:04,368 --> 00:07:05,963
- Do you? - I understand.

111
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:09,707
I mentioned Seo Jeong Hak many times.

112
00:07:09,707 --> 00:07:11,802
It's only 19 dollars. 19 dollars.

113
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:13,003
You have to read this.

114
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:16,117
People with pure Korean blood will disappear in this country.

115
00:07:16,118 --> 00:07:18,618
People of mixed race will dominate.

116
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:20,747
Soon we won't have any genuine Koreans left...

117
00:07:20,747 --> 00:07:22,017
in this country.

118
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:24,682
So you have to come to your senses.

119
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:26,883
You should protest holding a bamboo spear or something.

120
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:30,058
You should protect this nation!

121
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:33,263
Young people should organize a patriotic society.

122
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,267
Show them you can form an army...

123
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:36,868
- and you can... - Honey.

124
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:39,267
I think that's enough.

125
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:43,432
Everyone, you should always listen to a pretty lady like her.

126
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:49,918
I guess you admit that she is a pretty lady.

127
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:51,347
Was that why you were laughing?

128
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:53,488
You like to play the field, right? What a loser.

129
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:56,087
Can you turn and shoot him?

130
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,017
Shoot the loser's face.

131
00:07:58,017 --> 00:07:59,253
Stop.

132
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,422
He worked for him as a video editor.

133
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:03,558
He was the president of Heo Joong Se's fan club at first...

134
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,292
and was selected as his staff member.

135
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,323
He also helps his presidential election campaign.

136
00:08:08,368 --> 00:08:09,792
It's very interesting.

137
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:13,333
He wants young people to organize a patriotic society.

138
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,373
Heo Joong Se had an absurd dream from the beginning.

139
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:22,013
Should we put him on trial?

140
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,443
Obviously, I think we should.

141
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:26,612
If we let him go wild like this, he'll cause so much trouble.

142
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:28,513
They're like the president's soldiers.

143
00:08:58,717 --> 00:08:59,912
Cheers.

144
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:06,983
I think it's hilarious how you made Kang Yo Han pose for the shoot.

145
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:09,552
You held him back for a while, Ms. Jung.

146
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:12,922
Well, I should call you Chairwoman Jung now.

147
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,932
Don't worry about him. I'll hold him back tight.

148
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:23,237
That guy nosed around to dig dirt on the Dream Home project.

149
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:24,932
And that wasted so much of our time.

150
00:09:25,378 --> 00:09:26,648
Wasting time means wasting money. Darn it.

151
00:09:26,648 --> 00:09:29,643
So let's not walk on eggshells now and push ahead.

152
00:09:29,648 --> 00:09:32,686
Let's gather the poor and the people protesting against us in Seoul.

153
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,513
Then we can put them in jail and plan a reality show.

154
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,082
The title of the show could be "Clean Korea".

155
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,582
We should also put illegal migrants in jail.

156
00:09:42,398 --> 00:09:44,623
Your approval rating will go up.

157
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:46,367
Just wait for now.

158
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,736
There are people who are waiting to stab me in the back.

159
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:52,302
The police and the prosecution. I can't trust them with my plans.

160
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,672
I should empower the organization that is more loyal to me...

161
00:09:56,937 --> 00:09:58,973
and have them take care of things.

162
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,903
I'm nearly ready.

166
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:44,153
How is the fact-checking going on Jung Sun Ah's story?

167
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:47,727
It's quite difficult because they happened a long time ago.

168
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,393
Stop working on everything else.

169
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:51,223
Put everyone on it.

170
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:53,067
Why can't you work faster?

171
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,192
Yes, ma'am.

172
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:57,532
The team leader is concerned about one thing.

173
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:58,633
What is it?

174
00:10:58,837 --> 00:11:02,133
The number of unprovoked attacks increased recently.

175
00:11:02,437 --> 00:11:05,307
They're mostly targeting foreign workers and women.

176
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,973
So? What do you want me to do about it?

177
00:11:08,148 --> 00:11:09,217
People are asking...

178
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:12,182
why the Ministry of Justice isn't doing anything about it.

179
00:11:13,248 --> 00:11:15,082
Did people die or something?

180
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:16,753
Not really but...

181
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,452
They're attacking people on the street in broad daylight.

182
00:11:20,628 --> 00:11:24,322
This phenomenon goes exactly against the slogan, "Safe Korea".

183
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,836
But that's Heo Joong Se's slogan.

184
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:31,593
It's his presidential election pledge.

185
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,562
Why do I have to be concerned about it?

186
00:11:35,678 --> 00:11:36,903
I apologize, ma'am.

187
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,743
Heo Joong Se, that jerk...

188
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:44,147
is instigating silly kids to create a climate of fear.

189
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,912
Maybe he thinks it's going to empower him.

190
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:49,052
But he's wrong.

191
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:53,082
If we just let them be, someone will cross the line.

192
00:11:54,058 --> 00:11:56,123
Maybe they'll kill someone.

193
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,822
And when the people get sick and tired of them,

194
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:01,223
we'll take matters into our hands.

195
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:07,302
I'm the Minister of Justice, Cha Kyung Hee.

196
00:12:08,268 --> 00:12:10,802
As a presidential candidate,

197
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,808
I dream of a unified country...

198
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:16,013
by embracing everyone in Korea.

199
00:12:16,947 --> 00:12:18,243
Certainly, ma'am.

200
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,513
So you deal with Jung Sun Ah.

201
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:26,883
We should stop her before she gets more powerful.

202
00:12:27,987 --> 00:12:30,493
It's strange that Seo Jeong Hak suddenly died.

203
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:33,123
There's a bigger picture.

204
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,763
The picture that Jung Sun Ah drew.

205
00:12:36,498 --> 00:12:38,133
I understand, ma'am.

206
00:12:38,298 --> 00:12:39,702
And one more thing.

207
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,462
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,572
You're checking on him regularly, right?

209
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,103
Who are you talking about, ma'am?

210
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:49,672
Doh Young Choon.

211
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:54,243
Yes, I am checking on him regularly, ma'am.

212
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,052
He must have money hidden somewhere.

213
00:12:58,058 --> 00:12:59,822
That sneaky little jerk.

214
00:13:00,827 --> 00:13:03,253
He'd do anything for money.

215
00:13:05,867 --> 00:13:07,023
Why are you standing there?

216
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:10,093
- You may leave. - Yes, ma'am.

217
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:23,143
You're the most talked-about person these days.

218
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:26,843
We have Judge Oh Jin Joo of the live court show with us.

219
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,018
Hello, Your Honor.

220
00:13:28,018 --> 00:13:29,452
Hello.

221
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,158
I saw pictures from your photo shoot.

222
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,986
And you looked amazing.

223
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,027
- Thank you. - People are raving about it.

224
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:39,127
They say you should quit your job and become an actress.

225
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:40,922
Not everyone can become an actress.

226
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:44,133
Everyone, I was born to be a civil servant.

227
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:45,603
Plus, I get to work until an older age.

228
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:47,633
You're so funny.

229
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,836
How do you handle it though?

230
00:13:50,837 --> 00:13:53,503
The entire nation is watching you.

231
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,903
It must be pretty tiring.

232
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:58,177
No, I don't have the time to feel tired.

233
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:00,316
So many people are supporting me.

234
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:01,787
- Really? - Yes.

235
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:05,186
They send a ton of letters to my office.

236
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:06,682
- Do you want to have a look? - Sure.

237
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,353
You're keeping all of them?

238
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:14,427
Knowing that there are people who trust and support me...

239
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,932
really motivates me and makes me happy.

240
00:14:16,967 --> 00:14:21,202
I hope Judge Oh's sincerity gets through to our viewers.

241
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:24,273
You're the best.

242
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:31,812
Gosh. It's finally over.

243
00:14:32,317 --> 00:14:34,383
You did an amazing job, Judge Oh.

244
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:36,983
I'm always amazing.

245
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:39,226
Why didn't you join the interview?

246
00:14:39,227 --> 00:14:40,986
I felt awkward doing it alone.

247
00:14:40,987 --> 00:14:43,897
I'm camera-shy.

248
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,167
That's not okay. We live in a media age.

249
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,326
We need to communicate with the public.

250
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:51,292
This would've been the perfect time to hold our next trial.

251
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,662
I wonder what Chief Kang is up to.

252
00:14:55,508 --> 00:14:57,202
I have something to show you.

253
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:58,773
What is it?

254
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:05,513
- Stop! - No!

255
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,257
Stop it!

256
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,826
- Hey! - Are they crazy?

257
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,853
My goodness. Oh, no.

258
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:17,998
What were the police doing?

259
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:20,726
(The Jukchang troops are cleaning up Busan.)

260
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:24,767
Nice! Way to go, Busan.

261
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:27,202
- Hold on. - Are you guys going to help me?

262
00:15:27,737 --> 00:15:29,373
We are...

263
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,672
power.

264
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:39,013
How about...

265
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:42,212
we put him on trial?

266
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:43,712
On our live court show?

267
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:48,527
Judge Oh has agreed. The problem is...

268
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,557
How are we going to arrest and put him on trial...

269
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,962
when the police are protecting him?

270
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:57,493
Exactly. For him to be tried, he needs to be prosecuted first.

271
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,532
But he's practically being protected by the president.

272
00:16:01,808 --> 00:16:03,172
How are we going to...

273
00:16:03,707 --> 00:16:04,802
But you know,

274
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:07,802
there's someone who would love to help us out.

275
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,373
Who do you mean?

276
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:12,942
Someone who would hate to see...

277
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:14,743
things go Heo Joong Se's way.

278
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:16,712
Cha Kyung Hee?

279
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:21,153
I doubt she'll agree to help you.

280
00:16:21,388 --> 00:16:23,153
Of course, she won't listen to me.

281
00:16:23,398 --> 00:16:25,726
That's why Lawyer Ko is leaking information to her...

282
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:27,223
through his connections in the prosecution.

283
00:16:27,467 --> 00:16:30,363
That Juk Chang and his gang works for Heo Joong Se.

284
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:34,032
Once we arrest the guy, he can be prosecuted, I guess.

285
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,233
But she'll still feel uncomfortable putting him on trial.

286
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,503
I do know one officer...

287
00:16:40,077 --> 00:16:41,973
who might be up to the task.

288
00:16:42,648 --> 00:16:43,743
An officer?

289
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:46,613
Do you mean Soo Hyun?

290
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:49,316
Since the commissioner has the guy's back,

291
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,682
she'll have to do the job by herself.

292
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,523
That's impossible.

293
00:16:53,888 --> 00:16:55,552
I'm sure she's already on the move.

294
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:04,436
Okay. Busan is done now.

295
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,162
After Busan, we'll go to Daegu...

296
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:08,903
What next?

297
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:10,972
Daejeon it is.

298
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:14,543
All patriots in Daejeon, show me what you've got.

299
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:16,512
You want to beat these guys, don't you?

300
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,616
Show me how patriotic you all are.

301
00:17:19,617 --> 00:17:21,086
What are you thinking about?

302
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,356
- Gosh, you startled me. - Let's do this.

303
00:17:23,357 --> 00:17:25,313
Don't sneak up on me like that.

304
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:26,752
You want to get him?

305
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,623
Well...

306
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,063
Yes, I do.

307
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,462
Since he got caught last time,

308
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:40,363
he's been hiding, just broadcasting alone.

309
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,533
I see.

310
00:17:43,077 --> 00:17:44,636
Then track him down.

311
00:17:44,637 --> 00:17:45,873
Do you need my help?

312
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,303
You?

313
00:17:48,677 --> 00:17:49,772
Let me see.

314
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,873
Give that to me.

315
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:54,113
Are you sure?

316
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:57,482
Here.

317
00:17:58,688 --> 00:17:59,783
Well...

318
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:02,327
Let's see here.

319
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:05,593
I doubt it's going to be this easy,

320
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,293
but first...

321
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,732
I knew it. The security is pretty tight.

322
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,202
That's impressive.

323
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:18,533
I can see you're a computer major.

324
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,772
(Thug)

325
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,113
Excuse me.

326
00:18:33,728 --> 00:18:36,353
- Hi, Soo Hyun. - Hi, Ga On.

327
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,722
You haven't been home in a while.

328
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:41,192
Well, I've been busy.

329
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,866
Anyway, are you okay?

330
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,967
Juk Chang posted a video of you pointing a gun at him,

331
00:18:44,968 --> 00:18:46,606
and it could give people the wrong idea.

332
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:49,732
You have no idea. I had to hand in my gun for that.

333
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,977
The jerk really needs to be caught,

334
00:18:51,978 --> 00:18:53,547
but the higher-ups won't cooperate.

335
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,672
I can't get any help from the Cyber Bureau.

336
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,017
At least I should try to stop him.

337
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:01,212
Otherwise, no one knows how far the jerk will go.

338
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,293
Are you already on it?

339
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,293
Oh, I'm just playing some games.

340
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:20,103
- Games? - Yes.

341
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,076
Do you think you hack...

342
00:19:23,077 --> 00:19:25,732
by pounding away at the keyboard?

343
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,103
Is that what you imagine?

344
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,512
You're clueless.

345
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:34,547
I'm running a program in the background.

346
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,813
Just give it some time.

347
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:38,712
It'll take a while.

348
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:42,323
A day, a week, or longer.

349
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,692
Thanks, Elijah.

350
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:55,732
Wait.

351
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,873
What is it?

352
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:01,803
He just clicked the link I included in my comment.

353
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:05,873
I didn't expect him to fall for such a simple trick.

354
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:07,682
What link is it?

355
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,583
It's a link to some pictures of female singers.

356
00:20:11,258 --> 00:20:12,353
Female singers?

357
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,482
Hi, Ga On.

358
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:21,267
What? You've tracked down Juk Chang? Where is he?

359
00:20:21,268 --> 00:20:22,566
I'll head over there right now.

360
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,563
Soo Hyun, calm down.

361
00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:27,366
It's dangerous. Request an official investigation.

362
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,676
No one will help me.

363
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:32,237
Also, catching one moron is no big deal.

364
00:20:32,238 --> 00:20:34,146
You don't even have a gun. It's too dangerous.

365
00:20:34,147 --> 00:20:36,772
Don't worry. Just send me the address.

366
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:38,672
I'm serious.

367
00:20:39,147 --> 00:20:40,287

368
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,383

369
00:20:51,097 --> 00:20:54,626
(Jung Sun Ah, who is suspected of having murdered Seo Jeong Hak...)

370
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,533
The story is there.

371
00:20:58,637 --> 00:21:00,202
But there's not enough evidence.

372
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,947
To bring her down at once,

373
00:21:05,948 --> 00:21:08,942
I at least need more circumstantial evidence.

374
00:21:12,177 --> 00:21:14,043
- Minister. - What is it?

375
00:21:14,048 --> 00:21:16,752
The foundation has cut down on subsidies for the ministry.

376
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:20,053
- What? - They just decided it on their own.

377
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,192
We won't have enough funds to run the unofficial organizations.

378
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:34,133
I can't believe that woman.

379
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:43,442
Minister, you didn't make an appointment.

380
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:53,982
I'm sorry. She just barged in.

381
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:55,522
Gosh.

382
00:21:57,857 --> 00:22:00,323
It's okay. I slept well.

383
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:03,992
Don't do that. She works for our country.

384
00:22:08,637 --> 00:22:09,903
It's been a while.

385
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:16,373
Has it?

386
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:20,283
I've been a little distant, right?

387
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,942
Please forgive me.

388
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,017
Being the board chairman is not easy.

389
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:27,553
Why did you cut back on the subsidies?

390
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,823
Is that why you're here?

391
00:22:31,327 --> 00:22:33,426
You must've been very disappointed.

392

Please understand us.

393
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:37,237
There are many organizations that need our help,

394
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:40,603
but with people becoming more selfish, we get fewer donations.

395
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,903
But you're giving more money to the Blue House now.

396
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,272
Well...

397
00:22:49,617 --> 00:22:51,517
That must've been decided by the working-level employees.

398
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,487
I don't remember it well.

399
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,182
Do you want me to refresh your memory?

400
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:01,083
Do you smell something?

401
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:04,593
Like what?

402
00:23:07,498 --> 00:23:11,537
For some reason, I smell blood around you.

403
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:13,462
What could it be?

404
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,873
What are you talking about?

405
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:21,242
How long has it been since Mr. Seo's suicide?

406
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:22,672
Wait.

407
00:23:23,978 --> 00:23:25,972
It must be a touchy subject.

408
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:27,843
I apologize.

409
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:29,457
You served him for a long time.

410
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:32,313
It must've been a shock. You must be in grief.

411
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:38,157
What is it you're trying to say, Minister?

412
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:40,692
Being that I'm in the position that I'm in,

413
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:44,333
I hear a lot of things, you see.

414
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:45,563
For example?

415
00:23:45,597 --> 00:23:49,903
An elder who had received national respect committed suicide.

416
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:52,202
A national funeral wouldn't have been enough,

417
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:55,073
but you rushed to get his body cremated.

418
00:23:55,177 --> 00:23:57,048
Why was his suicide note...

419
00:23:57,048 --> 00:23:59,113
written on the computer instead of by hand?

420
00:23:59,817 --> 00:24:02,383
Especially since he always wrote things in calligraphy.

421
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:05,212
Do you not have a lot of work these days?

422
00:24:05,657 --> 00:24:07,182
Do you want me to give you more work?

423
00:24:07,228 --> 00:24:08,228
What did you say?

424
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:11,692

Oh, and Minister Cha.

I'm sorry,

431
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:36,883
but the cost of fuel for your official car is quite high.

432
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,083
The national finances aren't doing so well,

433
00:24:39,288 --> 00:24:42,553
so can we change it to something a bit smaller?

It was just so sudden.

447
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:37,343
Jung Sun Ah's file said that she was a maid in Kang Yo Han's house.

448
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:41,518
I'm sure Kang Yo Han will know something...

449

00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:29,444
Gosh, the audio is so darn clear.

544
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:32,444
I can even hear Min Yong Shik's breathing.

545
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,254
What do you think you're doing here?

546
00:34:40,898 --> 00:34:43,228
Is this your Inwang-dong Team that's better than...

547
00:34:43,229 --> 00:34:44,893
the National Intelligence Service?

548
00:34:45,298 --> 00:34:46,524
Let's go inside.

549
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,198
Let's talk out here.

550
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,564
They're all on your team.

551
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:53,774
How did you find this place?

552
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,707
I'm very interested in the youth, law, and education.

553
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:59,904
Forget that and get to the point.

554
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:03,274
How do you know Jung Sun Ah?

555
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:05,618
I don't know what you're talking about.

556
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:08,658
I heard she used to work as your servant.

557
00:35:08,659 --> 00:35:10,524
- Is that true? - I can't say.

558
00:35:11,059 --> 00:35:13,558
I can't speak of another person's private life.

559
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:16,553
There's talk that she killed her own parents.

560
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:21,134
Is there? That's shocking.

561
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,263
"Nothing's for free."

562
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:25,234
That's what your look says.

563
00:35:25,738 --> 00:35:27,203
What is it you want?

564
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:29,933
Juk Chang.

565
00:35:30,909 --> 00:35:32,203
"Juk Chang"?

566
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:34,643
Cooperate with me so I can put him on trial.

567
00:35:34,949 --> 00:35:36,344
The prosecution just has to indict him,

568
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:39,513
then sit and watch the show.

569
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,614
Heo Joong Se will make a fuss.

570
00:35:41,818 --> 00:35:43,687
Why are you being so timid?

571
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,953
I'm the one who must deal with the aftermath.

572
00:35:50,829 --> 00:35:51,964
Okay.

573
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:54,163
Thank you.

574
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,103
Oh, by the way.

575
00:36:06,378 --> 00:36:09,174
I found this on the way here.

576
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:12,714
Shall I give it to you? Or to him?

577
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,254
Here you go.

(Autopsy Report)

581
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,743
An internet broadcaster...

582
00:36:42,878 --> 00:36:44,283
Isn't this...

583
00:36:44,818 --> 00:36:47,913
too menial a case for the live court show?

584
00:36:48,258 --> 00:36:51,083
He instigated violence and caused unrest.

585
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:54,053
Wouldn't it please the Blue House too?

586
00:36:54,458 --> 00:36:57,424
I believe it goes very well with the president's wish...

587
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,123
to strengthen law and order.

588
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,134
That does make sense.

589
00:37:04,469 --> 00:37:07,333
Very well. Make this work.

590
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,243
How did it go?

591
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,473
It's a pass.

592
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:17,484
Let me set up this one.

593
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:19,013
You?

594
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:22,214
I know people like Juk Chang very well.

595
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,397
This is a blatant challenge to...

596
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,768
the beloved and respected people of Korea.

597
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:40,908
A patriotic young man took action...

598
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:44,308
to protect his country, and he's being put on trial?

599
00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:45,777
Are judges that great?

600
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:47,748
Are they above the people?

601
00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:52,317
This is clearly a coup planned by the judiciary!

602
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:54,114
(What is Kang Yo Han's plan?)

603
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:55,788
This isn't what I thought.

604
00:37:55,789 --> 00:37:58,159
Either way, didn't this happen because of...

605
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,258
a young man's pure patriotism to protect his country?

606
00:38:02,258 --> 00:38:03,298
Right?

607
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:06,297
Whether this trial is carried out fair and lawfully,

608
00:38:06,298 --> 00:38:10,338
I will keep a watchful eye until the very end.

610
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:15,404

00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:19,344
Kang Yo Han, I want to rip you apart.

612
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,674
This is insane.

613
00:38:22,278 --> 00:38:23,373
Mr. Lawyer.

614
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:26,143
I'm a political offender.

615
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:27,783
A revolutionary leader.

616
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:31,154
I'm not like the common criminal. Do you get that?

617
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:34,728
Then shall I not submit anything that shows mitigating circumstances?

618
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,754
Like your unhappy upbringing?

619
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,763
Hang on.

620
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,404
Wouldn't it be an advantage to submit that?

621
00:38:44,608 --> 00:38:47,033
Write something up. With as much detail as possible.

622
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:48,734
Okay, I'll do that.

623
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,574
Since we're on the topic,

624
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,743
Kang Yo Han and the younger judge came at me...

625
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:59,544
and threatened me with a wooden pole.

626
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,683
How about we leak that to the media?

627
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:06,728
To plea insanity,

628
00:39:06,729 --> 00:39:08,993
you need a doctor's diagnosis.

629
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:10,424
I saw it.

630
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:12,797
Would I lie to you about that?

631
00:39:12,798 --> 00:39:14,064
You saw it?

632
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:20,877
Then can you give me a list of names of people who witnessed it?

633
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:22,774
I need objective evidence.

634
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:26,404
No, forget it.

635
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,344
I was alone.

636
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:34,013
Are you sure you can win?

637
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,083
I can't go to prison.

638
00:39:39,889 --> 00:39:41,694
Yes, don't worry.

639
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,824
I'll get you out on probation.

640
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,308
You're putting in too much effort.

641
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:57,678
You care for the plants here...

642
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:00,777
and a gruff guy and weird girl in a weird mansion.

643
00:40:00,778 --> 00:40:03,884
I'm pretty sure I'm just as weird.

644
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:05,944
Yes, you have been a bit weird.

645
00:40:07,088 --> 00:40:09,583
Why? Did Professor Min say something?

646
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:11,158
Why would he?

647
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,453
I haven't seen him since we met here last time.

648
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,254
Oh, really?

649
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:17,623
I wondered if he nagged again.

650
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,167
You suddenly show up outside my workplace...

651
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,933
and ask what I'd do if you did something bad.

652
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:28,478
Then Kang Yo Han shows up when we're trying to get Juk Chang.

653
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:30,703
Are you up to no good?

654
00:40:31,508 --> 00:40:32,603
Do you think so?

655
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,674
No, well...

656
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:38,344
I just feel a bit jealous.

657
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:41,858
My childhood best friend's hanging out with a rich guy...

658
00:40:41,858 --> 00:40:42,917
and it feels weird.

659
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:45,024
Like you're living in a different world.

660
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,553
I see.

661
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:51,794
He's not rich.

662
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:54,134
If you get to know him,

663
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,194
Kang Yo Han's really poor.

664
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:02,373
I'm way richer.

665
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:06,944
I have fond memories of my mom and dad...

666
00:41:08,418 --> 00:41:11,044
and a pretty home I kept.

667
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:12,544
And...

668
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:23,424
I have a fan club.

669
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:25,094
They root for me.

670
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,904
I'm going home.

671
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:34,674
Already?

672
00:41:35,238 --> 00:41:36,607
I'm busy.

673
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:38,873
Being a police officer keeps you busy.

674
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:41,143
Get home safe.

675
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:10,234
I have you,

676
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:12,344
Soo Hyun.

677
00:42:21,629 --> 00:42:23,925
Hi, Master Yo Han.

(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

679
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:39,244
Just because you're the head of the Operation Support Committee...

680
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,715
doesn't mean you can barge in like this.

681
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,744
Why do you keep making me barge in?

682
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:47,814
Are you doing this on purpose to see me?

683
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:54,124
What brings you here today?

684
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:56,460
The live court show.

685
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,394
Why did you choose such a high-profile case again?

686
00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:02,164
The defendant is neither a politician nor a conglomerate.

687
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,994
What's high-profile about it?

688
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,710
Isn't he just a petty offender?

689
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,540
He works for Heo Joong Se.

690
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,339
He was throwing a fit, saying he'd get rid of the live court show,

691
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,879
but I managed to calm him down.

692
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,980
I told you to wait just two years.

693
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:16,945
Why do you keep complicating things?

694
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,514
Wow, that psycho works for the president?

695
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:22,115
That's interesting.

696
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,655
The thing is, he attacked my niece.

697
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,255
He did?

698
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,595
It's still not okay.

699
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:33,270
You'll have to give in this time.

700
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,735
Just scold him a little in court and let him go.

701
00:43:36,899 --> 00:43:38,164
What if I can't?

702
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,080
That would put me in a difficult situation.

703
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,680
And that would mean...

704
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,675
you'll be in a difficult situation too.

705
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:52,514
All right.

706
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:55,485
I'll think about it.

707
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:00,485
Master Yo Han, you're being a good boy these days.

708
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,394
So please stop barging in like this.

709
00:44:05,169 --> 00:44:09,068
Exactly. Instead of making me barge in like this,

710
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:12,005
you should invite me sometimes.

711
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,405
Is your house still beautiful?

712
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,144
Like in the old days?

713
00:44:25,149 --> 00:44:27,914
Do you miss the place where you used to work as a maid?

714
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,204
Never...

715
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:47,034
Never say that again.

716
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,604
I was just a guest who stayed there for a while.

717
00:44:51,879 --> 00:44:54,675
Don't you dare insult me.

718
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,485
Fine. I'll keep that in mind.

719
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:24,009
We are...

720
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:25,509
- Juk Chang! - Juk Chang!

721
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,879
- We are power! - We are power!

722
00:45:27,879 --> 00:45:29,818
- Juk Chang! - Juk Chang!

723
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:31,620
- Juk Chang! - Juk Chang!

724
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,450

My name is Kim Ju Won. Please call me Kim Ju Won.

Yes, Your Honor.

before history and our people.

continuously asked for donations through his channel.

905
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,124
He said that he needs funds to create a revolution in our nation.

906
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,365
He managed to collect a significant amount of money.

907
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,664
What did you do with that money?

908
00:54:11,069 --> 00:54:12,769
Why are you avoiding eye contact, Defendant?

909
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:16,735
Did you purchase bombs and guns in the black market?

910
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:19,749
What exactly are funds for a revolution?

911
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,744
No. I don't know what you're talking about.

912
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:26,414
- I plead the fifth. - Defendant, if this is the truth,

913
00:54:26,919 --> 00:54:28,454
this is treason.

914
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:31,854
The main culprit behind treason can be sentenced to death,

915
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,628
life imprisonment, or life imprisonment without labor.

916
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:35,758
Were you aware of this, Defendant?

917
00:54:35,759 --> 00:54:36,854
No.

918
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,699
Do you have something to say, Counsel?

919
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:44,805
Yes. The defendant didn't use that money to plot treason.

920
00:54:44,969 --> 00:54:47,309
This is a part of the defendant's privacy,

921
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,539
so I was hesitant to reveal it,

922
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,148
but in this situation, I have no choice. Let's watch it together.

923
00:54:52,149 --> 00:54:53,548
(Counsel)

924
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:56,519
- Let's watch it. - I work as a content creator.

925
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,519
One day, Kim Choong Sik and another fan got into a battle,

926
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,159
and they started sending me a lot of donations.

927
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,959
It was a couple of thousand dollars every single day.

928
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,258
- No! I don't know her! - It's not like he's rich.

929
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:09,898
- I wish he would stop. - What are you doing?

930
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:12,099
- He keeps asking to meet me. - Please calm down.

931
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,465
He keeps begging me.

932
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:15,735
He makes me feel uncomfortable.

933
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:18,334
- I really wish he would stop. - No way.

934
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,334
Did you use your grandmother's funeral funds to send her donations?

935
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,445
You went too far.

936
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,918
(National Vote Status)

937
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,115
Hold on. It's okay.

938
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:36,284
It's okay. I told you I'd make sure you got off with a reprieve.

939
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:38,684
Go back to your seat.

940
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:40,354
Go ahead.

941
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,655
It's okay.

942
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:47,465
Your Honors.

943
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:51,064
As you can see, the defendant isn't a revolutionary.

944
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:55,834
And he's not a dangerous person who's plotting treason.

945
00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:59,979
To be honest, he's not even worth being on trial right now.

946
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,879
- Lawyer Ko. - Of course,

947
00:56:01,879 --> 00:56:03,878
the defendant's crimes aren't small,

948
00:56:03,879 --> 00:56:07,845
but I will be grateful if you gave him a chance to redeem himself.

949
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:26,405
What could be the best punishment for the defendant?

950
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,805
Is it flogging? Or is it imprisonment?

951
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:31,874
I racked my brains for an answer.

952
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,545
I received the suggestion that...

953
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,744
we give this young defendant another chance,

954
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,789
so I sentence the defendant to three years in prison...

955
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:45,425
with a five-year stay of execution.

956
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,055
However,

957
00:56:49,259 --> 00:56:50,858
the defendant's crimes were terrible...

958
00:56:50,859 --> 00:56:54,195
and the chance of recidivism is quite high,

959
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:57,195
so the defendant must wear an electronic anklet...

960
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,805
and be placed on probation.

961
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:06,108
Through the electronic anklet signal, the defendant's location...

962
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:08,418
will be traceable on the DIKE app.

963
00:57:08,419 --> 00:57:10,148
(DIKE)

964
00:57:10,149 --> 00:57:11,945
(Kim Choong Sik, Date of Birth: September 23, 1993, Age: 33)

965
00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:15,659
An electronic anklet? What an embarrassment.

966
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,684
What are you going to do in the summer? You can't wear shorts now.

967
00:57:18,689 --> 00:57:22,595
As of today, I'm creating a squad to go after Juk Chang.

968
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:27,068
Hey, Juk Chang. Come out. I'll go after you.

969
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:29,934
To all the citizens watching this trial,

970
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,639
can you all be...

971
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:32,709
(The defendant's location)

972
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,275
the defendant's probation officer?

973
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,008
Keep an eye on what he's doing and where he is.

974
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:40,309
Don't take your eyes off of him for one second.

975
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,045
The defendant needs your attention.

976
00:57:46,149 --> 00:57:47,644
Don't you agree, Defendant?

977
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,595
My gosh. I brought him up, and he ruined it all!

978
00:57:56,899 --> 00:58:00,494
My gosh! Kang Yo Han!

979
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,135
Just scold him a little in court and let him go.

980
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,805
All right.

981
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,679
I'll think about it.

982
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,040
(Defendant Kim Choong Sik sentenced to probation.)

983
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,474
(The entire nation can trace him via an electronic anklet.)

984
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,545
Darn it.

985
00:58:22,689 --> 00:58:24,954
Did he fool me?

986
00:58:45,379 --> 00:58:46,604
Do you see Juk Chang behind me?

987
00:58:46,879 --> 00:58:49,818
I will show you how I punish Juk Chang live.

988
00:58:49,819 --> 00:58:52,019
Don't forget to subscribe, leave comments, and like.

989
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,389
(Why is Juk Chang so fast?)

990
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,584
(Where did he go? Let's get him!)

991
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:12,738
- Get him! - The Kim Choong Sik Case...

992
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:14,869
is a national embarrassment,

993
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:17,275
and it should never happen again.

994
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,309
This kind of behavior is like spitting on the faces...

995
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:22,718
of everyone across the country who has volunteered...

996
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,389
to help provide relief, and our beloved citizens...

997
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,454
with their pure patriotism.

998
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,318
It's a case that just reeks.

999
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:33,684
It smells. It smells terribly...

1000
00:59:34,089 --> 00:59:35,525
like a conspiracy.

1001
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,525
Where did he go?

1002
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:44,834
Let's keep going. Hurry.

1003
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:51,709
But that man, Kim Choong Sik. Is he really Korean?

1004
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:53,249
Is he a real Korean, like us?

1005
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:57,318
Not a fake Korean, but a real Korean with citizenship?

1006
00:59:57,319 --> 00:59:58,688
One nation, pureblood.

1007
00:59:58,689 --> 01:00:01,144
A descendant of Dangun would never do something so idiotic...

1008
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,755
I'm sorry. I meant, they would never do...

1009
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,925
something so embarrassing.

1010
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,195
That's all.

1011
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,278
There you are.

1012
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:27,175
You should hide, so we can't come find you.

1013
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,949
Are you going to let them do that to Choong Sik?

1014
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,715
Hey, are you crazy?

1015
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:39,124
Don't you dare bring up his name ever again.

1016
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,095
Yeon Jung, this is really hard on me.

1017
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,124
My goodness.

1018
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,095
Gosh, darn it.

1019
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,039
Hey! Why do you keep running away?

1020
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,909
Your location can be traced with this app.

1021
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,005
Everyone. We will punish Juk Chang!

1022
01:00:56,009 --> 01:00:58,334
- Hey, get over here. - Come on.

1023
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,874
Let's get started.

1024
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:03,718
Hey, are you guys having fun?

1025
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,218
Why wouldn't we be having fun?

1026
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,284
Okay. Get him!

1027
01:01:14,989 --> 01:01:16,099
(Let's Get Juk Chang! Juk Chang is Dead Today.)

1028
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,159
(Let's Get Juk Chang! Juk Chang is Dead Today.)

1029
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,798
- That's right! - Get him!

1030
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:21,295
- Hit him harder! - Go for it!

1031
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:23,968
Hey, Secretary. Can you turn that off?

1032
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,235
Yes, sir.

1033
01:01:26,069 --> 01:01:27,865
Why? Does it make you feel uncomfortable?

1034
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:30,405
It feels like we created another monster.

1035
01:01:31,410 --> 01:01:33,175
Monsters aren't made.

1036
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:37,045
The monster within is just awoken.

1037
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:40,115
Whenever there's a good excuse.

1038
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,894
You're pretty focused.

1039
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,104
Minister Cha, how did you get in?

1040
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,805
Why are you so surprised?

1041
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,845
That's very unlike you.

1042
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,945
Are you carrying out a search and seizure?

1043
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,124
You're quite an interesting person.

1044
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:54,624
Are you that great a person?

1045
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:57,055
That the Minister of Justice...

1046
01:02:57,129 --> 01:02:59,025
should carry out a search and seizure?

1047
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:04,664
Then are you here to ask for a favor?

1048
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,334
I think you're mistaken.

1049
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:12,604
I came here to remind you of your place.

1050
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:16,744
- "My place"? - You know,

1051
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,845
you look best...

1052
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,560
when you're standing behind someone...

1053
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,914
in utter silence, hands politely folded.

1054
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:27,854
If one fails to know their place,

1055
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:29,854
their end is not pretty.

1056
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:35,334
Minister Cha.

1057
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,005
Perhaps you're the one who fails to realize your place.

1058
01:03:40,169 --> 01:03:43,640
Do you still think you're most likely to become president...

1059
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,005
after what happened to your son?

1060
01:03:47,549 --> 01:03:49,644
Aren't you a little too confident?

1061
01:03:51,149 --> 01:03:54,284
Do you think you deleted your past completely?

1062
01:03:57,589 --> 01:03:58,925
My past?

1063
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:02,595
What is it you're trying to say?

1064
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:06,925
Why do people around you keep dying?

1065
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,600
When you were 12, it was your mom.

1066
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,564
When you were 20, your dad who had abandoned you and your mom.

1067
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:14,104
And most recently,

1068
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,235
Mr. Seo whom you had been serving as secretary.

1069
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:27,845
I had no idea you enjoyed writing novels.

1070
01:04:28,419 --> 01:04:30,684
You have a great imagination.

1071
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,394
Do what suits you best.

1072
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:41,795
You used to be a servant?

1073
01:04:46,509 --> 01:04:49,075
What a lowlife.

1074
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:53,474
See you around.

1075
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:13,494
Hi, Sun Ah.

1076
01:05:13,669 --> 01:05:16,600
Kang Yo Han told Cha Kyung Hee about me.

1077
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,334
- What? - Look into it.

1078
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,739
Why would he...

1079
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:21,934
Shut your mouth and look into it!

1080
01:05:25,009 --> 01:05:27,849
You'll have to pay for interfering with my plans.

1081
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,675
It seems you worked hard to get here.

1082
01:05:30,649 --> 01:05:31,845
Would that be okay?

1083
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:56,204
I will kill you,

1084
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,204
Kang Yo Han.

1085
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,775
I will tear you to shreds.

1086
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,224
(The Devil Judge)

1087
01:06:40,989 --> 01:06:43,460
We have no choice but to make them turn their blades at each other?

1088
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,685
Hello, Young Master.

1089
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,528
I think it would be fun to play with you.

1090
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:50,095
Will she join you?

1091
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,824
I'll give you one week.

1092
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,864
Bring me what I want.

1093
01:06:53,870 --> 01:06:55,795
Cha Kyung Hee doesn't know yet, right?

1094
01:06:55,939 --> 01:06:57,395
The first step.

1095
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,569
She'll testify that Kang Yo Han made her lie in court.

1096
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:01,870
Isn't it too risky?

1097
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:03,739
You said you never know what she'll do.

1098
01:07:03,739 --> 01:07:06,175
We risk it all and it's still life and death.

1099
01:07:07,309 --> 01:07:08,815
Do I scare you?

1100
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:10,475
That's too bad.
