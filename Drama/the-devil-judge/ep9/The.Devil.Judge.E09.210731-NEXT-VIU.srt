1
00:00:13,584 --> 00:00:15,913
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,180
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:22,649
(Previously, on "The Devil Judge".)

4
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:25,889
Master Yo Han...

5
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:29,660
was an abandoned child.

6
00:00:30,934 --> 00:00:33,160
He was a child nobody wanted.

7
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,200
Some humans are born as monsters.

8
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,073
Among them, revenge is an excuse...

9
00:00:43,074 --> 00:00:45,609
to prey on others for fun.

10
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:48,480
This is fate, everyone!

11
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:52,279
Arson and acts of terrorism!

12
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,424
Forget all about it.

13
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:57,660
A powerful judicial reform. It begins now!

14
00:00:58,495 --> 00:01:00,830
There's concern the live court show is unconstitutional.

15
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:02,929
Who is weak?

16
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:07,703
I exercise the judicial power delegated to me...

17
00:01:07,704 --> 00:01:09,529
by the sovereign Korean public.

18
00:01:09,704 --> 00:01:11,400
This is a court?

19
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,274
No one else here wants to go against the wind.

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,310
You want me to be Judas?

21
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:19,710
Ladies and gentlemen.

22
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:22,379
Welcome to...

23
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,450
a court owned by you.

24
00:01:31,764 --> 00:01:33,060
He looks just like him,

25
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:36,590
more than I expected.

26
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,400
You didn't even hesitate to shoot.

27
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:42,499
Were you going to kill that man?

28
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:43,700
If I had to.

29
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:47,710
Why does Judge Kang Yo Han want to raise the stakes like this?

30
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,109
Do you think this is a trial to reveal his crimes...

31
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:53,040
or the opposite?

32
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:55,049
We should try to do something no matter what.

33
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:56,510
The verdict is...

34
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:59,480
a total of 235 years.

35
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,794
I thought he was going to let him off the hook.

36
00:02:01,794 --> 00:02:03,350
I'm kind of confused.

37
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,260
It was moving. I even teared up.

38
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:10,659
He might not be tame enough.

39
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,629
Are you looking for this?

40
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:21,569
(Justice will be done by the judgment of the people.)

41
00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:32,550
Where am I?

42
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,390
Stay put. Don't wander around.

43
00:02:37,124 --> 00:02:39,020
Is there something I shouldn't see?

44
00:02:39,295 --> 00:02:41,360
Curiosity killed the cat.

45
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,400
Who is this person?

46
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,360
Who is this?

47
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:48,735
Yo Han, go...

48
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,129
I'll come right back.

49
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:53,599
It's Master Isaac. Master Yo Han's older brother.

50
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:55,575
I wonder how much you've discovered.

51
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,870
Don't pretend to be tough.

52
00:02:57,384 --> 00:03:00,710
You're not even brave enough to face your pains.

53
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:04,120
You falter when I speak like this.

54
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:07,689
Do you know how they ended up gaining their power?

55
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:10,050
They turned a crisis into an opportunity.

56
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,894
This is how the ones who conquer the world work.

57
00:03:11,895 --> 00:03:13,120
Mr. President!

58
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:17,499
After the pandemic, the foundation began expanding its charity.

59
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:19,330
What's your next plan?

60
00:03:19,404 --> 00:03:20,504
Division.

61
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:23,599
There's nothing we can do if those who have power stick together.

62
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,599
We need to shake them up.

63
00:03:25,645 --> 00:03:27,539
What if I give you a bigger prey?

64
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,140
A rich businessman? The president?

65
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:32,409
The Social Responsibility Foundation is accepting donations...

66
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,449
for their Dream Home Village project.

67
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:38,183
But I received a tip that the money...

68
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,120
is being used elsewhere.

69
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:43,520
To reveal that Kang Yo Han is bluffing,

70
00:03:43,594 --> 00:03:45,789
you must show your hands.

71
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:49,490
We have Mr. Seo, don't we?

72
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:52,259
You just picked a fight with the country.

73
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,599
Let's aim for the body first.

74
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,599
I lived on so I could go back there.

75
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:00,240
As the master of the world...

76
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,009
you kicked me out of.

77
00:04:04,145 --> 00:04:06,439
We have to meet.

78
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,349
Are you...

79
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,219
Hi, Master Yo Han.

80
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,354
Threats are meaningless.

81
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,590
Because I have nothing...

82
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,465
I wish to protect.

83
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,459
Let's see if Master Yo Han really has nothing...

84
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,734
- Soo Hyun! - he wishes to protect.

85
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,259
How dare you lay a hand on Soo Hyun? Soo Hyun of all people!

86
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,129
I didn't do anything to your friend.

87
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:30,069
Don't ever attack me again.

88
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:32,945
- Never do that. - How can I trust you?

89
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,769
I have to show you something.

90
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,639
Inmate number 70618, he is Doh Young Choon.

91
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:40,284
Never once, not even for a single day have I forgotten his face.

92
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:41,709
It's not him.

93
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:43,910
This is the system.

94
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,550
A system has no chance against power.

95
00:04:46,784 --> 00:04:50,720
Power can control a system however it likes.

96
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,424
Why did you go in the first place?

97
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,195
You wanted to shake me, someone who kept interfering with your plans.

98
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,430
I wanted...

99
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,904
you to be on my side.

100
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:01,030
Make your choice.

101
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,670
Will you stand in my way...

102
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,170
or stand on my side?

103
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:07,569
If there's no justice in reality and it's just a game,

104
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:10,839
I would like to be on the winning team.

105
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:13,579
You once asked me...

106
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,850
how I was going to fight against those who run this world.

107
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:20,620
I make sure I win before the game even starts.

108
00:05:20,924 --> 00:05:22,319
I'll promise you one thing.

109
00:05:22,594 --> 00:05:24,259
The man who stole from your parents.

110
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,019
They will pay for what they did.

111
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:27,689
Very cruelly.

112
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:29,589
It's not just about revenge.

113
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,230
I want to fight...

114
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,259
the corrupt world.

115
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,199
(Episode 9)

116
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:41,509
Did you...

117
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,639
make your decision?

118
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,649
You're the one who forced me to choose.

119
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:54,290
If there's no justice in reality and it's just a game,

120
00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:58,860
I would like to be on the winning team.

121
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,100
"We worked hard."

122
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:48,209
"Please pay us."

123
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,949
Put your hands up.

124
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:03,990
Put the camera down.

125
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:09,990
Are you a cop?

126
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:12,829
Will you shoot me?

127
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:15,600
Shoot.

128
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,040
You can't anyway.

129
00:07:20,344 --> 00:07:21,839
Put that down.

130
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,009
Film me.

131
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:40,720
Do you regret it?

132
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,030
I'll promise you one thing.

133
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:51,269
The man who stole from your parents.

134
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,810
And the people who smuggled him away.

135
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,709
They will pay for what they did.

136
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,149
Very cruelly.

137
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:07,120
It's not just about revenge.

138
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:08,949
Then what is it?

139
00:08:11,094 --> 00:08:12,490
I want to fight...

140
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,490
the corrupt world.

141
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:28,310
Elijah?

142
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,040
Yes, what is it?

143
00:08:33,114 --> 00:08:35,113
Yo Han, come quickly.

144
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,380
I'm in trouble.

145
00:08:36,655 --> 00:08:37,780
Where are you?

146
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:39,880
Where are you right now?

147
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:43,689
Stay right there.

148
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,119
What's going on?

149
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:04,910
Kill the video and record the audio.

150
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,920
Are you all right?

151
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:16,520
Are you watching this, Mr. President?

152
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,359
I am a patriotic citizen of this country.

153
00:09:19,695 --> 00:09:23,430
I was summoned by the president, so I stood up dauntlessly.

154
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,630
But a mere police officer is trying to oppress me.

155
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:34,469
Step back.

156
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,349
Shoot.

157
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,619
What? Darn it!

158
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,819
Hey, are you okay?

159
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:50,020
Hey.

160
00:09:50,594 --> 00:09:51,760
Darn it.

161
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,989
No, stop!

162
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,089
No, don't!

163
00:09:56,734 --> 00:09:58,130
Stop her.

164
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,000
- No! - Elijah...

165
00:10:00,465 --> 00:10:01,670
No!

166
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,900
Hey!

167
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:10,014
No!

168
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:11,910
Elijah! Soo Hyun!

169
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:15,910
Go away! Get off of me!

170
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,094
Elijah, are you okay?

171
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,589
Are you hurt?

172
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:26,560
It's... Kang Yo Han.

173
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:28,530
It's Kang Yo Han

174
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:31,504
- We respect you. - It's really him.

175
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:34,260
- Sir. - Sir. My name is Juk Chang.

176
00:10:34,974 --> 00:10:36,130
Gosh.

177
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:39,869
You remember me, don't you?

178
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:53,280
Soo Hyun, are you okay?

179
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,619
I'm fine. How did you come here?

180
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,150
You're not hurt, are you?

181
00:11:01,364 --> 00:11:03,290
How dare you touch my niece?

182
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:05,329
I didn't know.

183
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,900
I really didn't know.

184
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,839
Stop it. Are you trying to kill him?

185
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,739
Stop it!

186
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:22,455
Soo Hyun.

187
00:11:22,455 --> 00:11:23,810
I said stop.

188
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:27,250
Soo Hyun, put your gun down.

189
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,319
You stop too.

190
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:41,869
Goodness...

191
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,050
You're pointing a gun at me?

192
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,930
You're under arrest for special assault.

193
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:23,969
This is Yoon Soo Hyun.

194
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:26,079
I need backup.

195
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,160
Come here.

196
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,540
Say something at least.

197
00:13:36,354 --> 00:13:37,449
Yoon Soo Hyun.

198
00:13:38,425 --> 00:13:39,619
She's out of her mind.

199
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,353
How dare she put you in danger?

200
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,993
- Soo Hyun didn't do anything wrong. - "Soo Hyun"?

201
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:47,164
I was craving tteokbokki, so she took me out.

202
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,633
And we ran into those scumbags on our way back.

203
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:50,060
What could I have done about that?

204
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,229
I...

205
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,770
don't even have anyone who I can have tteokbokki with.

206
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:57,630
Do you know that?

207
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,270
Chief Kang.

208
00:14:41,244 --> 00:14:42,979
I know what you're worried about.

209
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,380
But Soo Hyun is a good person.

210
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,250
Not as an officer,

211
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:50,689
but as a person, she worries about and likes Elijah.

212
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,989
You're being nosy.

213
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:57,334
How much longer...

214
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,459
do you think you can look after a teenage girl alone?

215
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,534
I know the church fire traumatized you.

216
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:06,404
But Elijah is no longer a six-year-old.

217
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,003
You can't lock her up forever...

218
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:09,540
She's been kidnapped twice.

219
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:11,685
Pardon?

220
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:14,040
Many people either want our family's money...

221
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:17,010
or hold a grudge against us.

222
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,349
And Elijah trusts whoever treats her nicely.

223
00:15:23,854 --> 00:15:25,560
She's hungry for affection.

224
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:31,430
No matter how much you hate the world and the people in it,

225
00:15:31,905 --> 00:15:33,400
you can never live alone.

226
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:35,770
You always need someone to rely on.

227
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,300
As long as you're a human being.

228
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:44,810
Rest up.

00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:18,140

This is my office now.

233
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:48,640
What a long journey it's been.

(Jae Hee)

239
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,109
Hi, Sun Ah.

240
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:24,774
What are you up to?

241
00:17:24,774 --> 00:17:26,109
What else?

242
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,179
I'm enjoying my fancy private life after work.

243
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,323
I see. You sound busy.

244
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,480
Is something up?

245
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,119
I can come over if it's urgent.

246
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:37,690
No, nothing's up.

247
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:41,730
I was just wondering if we could have a glass of champagne together.

248
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:44,089
Sun Ah.

249
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:46,904
Don't tell me the mighty chairman of the foundation...

250
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,030
has no one to have champagne with.

251
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,030
Have some fun. Don't worry about what people think.

252
00:17:51,034 --> 00:17:53,339
Well? Should I send some models over?

253
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,639
No, I'm fine.

254
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,679
Have a good time.

255
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:03,909
(Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah)

256
00:18:13,865 --> 00:18:15,260
Models?

257
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,030
That sounds fun.

258
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:27,839
Chief Kang.

259
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:29,675
What's the matter?

260
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,609
Soo Hyun just called me.

261
00:18:31,845 --> 00:18:34,013
Everyone from Jukchang TV got released.

262
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,109
They all got released?

263
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:37,579
It was the police commissioner's order.

264
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:40,679
I wonder what made the commissioner step in.

265
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,290
So they're not just a bunch of psychos?

266
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:49,560
Hello?

267
00:18:51,395 --> 00:18:52,465
Yes, sir.

(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

269
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,099

270

With all three of us.

271
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:01,099
What?

272
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,310
That's an interesting idea.

273
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:05,810
Here they come.

274
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,679
Have a seat.

275
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:23,230
The head of the Live Court Show Operation Support Committee here...

276
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:24,829
is very enthusiastic.

277
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,164
She wants to make...

278
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:30,374
live court show promotion videos and posters featuring you three...

279
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,700
by herself.

280
00:19:31,744 --> 00:19:34,169
You need to increase media exposure.

281
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:36,510
Make the public go wild.

282
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:40,214
Make them look up to and love Judge Kang.

283
00:19:40,215 --> 00:19:42,179
Make them desire him.

284
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:44,550
Just like I do.

285
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,720
You're funny, Ms. Jung.

286
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:55,690
I wasn't joking.

287
00:19:56,465 --> 00:19:58,659
You want us to be clowns in front of the public?

288
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,063
Is that it?

289
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:03,569
Chief Kang. Don't be so negative.

290
00:20:03,804 --> 00:20:07,174
The foundation wants to support our live court show.

291
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,540
This is our chance to improve the court's position.

292
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,609
Say no more and cooperate.

293
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:14,510
Chief Justice, you do understand these things.

294
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:17,553
I'm sorry, but I don't think that's something judges should do.

295
00:20:17,554 --> 00:20:19,950
Getting close to the public.

296
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:22,149
That doesn't sound bad to me.

297
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,094
Are you sure it's the live court show that you want to promote?

298
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,859
Of course. Why are you asking?

299
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,763
Things have been quite uncomfortable between us lately.

300
00:20:34,764 --> 00:20:37,404
And the foundation suddenly wants to promote our show?

301
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:39,800
That's unbelievably generous of you.

302
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:45,780
By any chance, do you have any slogans in mind?

303
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:51,679
"Strong law and order, a safer Korea."

304
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,720
"The live court show is with you."

305
00:20:56,494 --> 00:20:59,790
Isn't that the slogan the president has been pushing?

306
00:21:01,935 --> 00:21:04,129
Does that make you uncomfortable?

307
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:07,899
Don't tell me you're against the government policy.

308
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:09,970
That sounds fun.

309
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:13,569
Let's do this.

310
00:21:14,845 --> 00:21:15,940
Chief Kang.

311
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,119
What?

312
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,490
Goodness, Master Yo Han. Are you seeing me off?

313
00:21:42,804 --> 00:21:44,530
Was my warning not enough?

314
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:48,569
I'm pretty sure I told you that I don't have much patience.

315
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:52,310
Oh, that? It's okay.

316
00:21:52,415 --> 00:21:54,010
It didn't leave a mark.

317
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:57,750
You'll have to pay for interfering with my plans.

318
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:00,819
It seems you worked hard to get here.

319
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:03,389
Would that be okay?

320
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:05,560
Interfering?

321
00:22:06,195 --> 00:22:08,929
I'm helping you right now.

322
00:22:09,034 --> 00:22:11,195
The survivor of a tragic accident.

323
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:13,500
The judge who punishes evil mercilessly.

324
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:15,674
Right. It all sounds good.

325
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:18,200
People love stories like that.

326
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:22,839
But wouldn't it be more fun if the stage was bigger?

327
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:25,714
There are only two more years left before the elections.

328
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:28,579
Instead of Heo Joong Se or Cha Kyung Hee,

329
00:22:32,155 --> 00:22:34,379
you should grab onto this country.

330
00:22:34,524 --> 00:22:36,290
That suits you best.

331
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,359
Shining brightly at the top.

332
00:22:39,764 --> 00:22:40,990
So?

333
00:22:41,524 --> 00:22:42,659
Use us.

334
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:44,389
Use the foundation.

335
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:46,530
How interesting.

336
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:51,470
You want me to become a sheepdog instead of a wolf...

337
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,569
with you?

338
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:58,915
There are a lot of cases that draw the interest of people.

339
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:01,480
Child abusers, rapists, gangsters...

340
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,484
If you get rid of those pieces of trash,

341
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,679
I'll make you into a bigger hero.

342
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:09,125
The foundation can make anyone the most powerful person in Korea.

343
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,720
We did that with Heo Joong Se, that piece of trash.

344
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:19,164
If you wait another two years, you and I...

345
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,829
Everything sounds good except for that.

346
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:23,399
"You and I".

347
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,700
You should take into consideration what I like.

348
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:34,879
Master Yo Han.

349
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,919
Can you...

350
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,790
be a little nicer to me?

351
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:53,399
I'll see you again.

352
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,125
I thought you'd like a drink.

353
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,856
Thank you.

354
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,265
They don't have a separate occupational force.

355
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:21,335
They want to use us for the things that they've started.

356
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:24,440
It's not a bad idea to make them think we're letting them go.

357
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,136
We could search for an opening then.

358
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,735
You're right.

359
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,706
But they suddenly want us to do promotions? This isn't a joke.

360
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,116
It probably is.

361
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,485
That's the kind of person she is.

362
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:40,055
Why?

363
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,156
Do you know Ms. Jung well?

364
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:49,366
Have you known her for a long time?

365
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,166
Yes. I met her here in this house.

366
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:53,966
Here?

367
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:55,906
Didn't Ms. Ji say anything?

368
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:58,366
The story of the maid that jumped.

369
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:01,106
That was a true story?

370
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:03,206
How you played with someone's heart?

371
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,045
I knew it. You're just like him.

What are you talking about this time?

373
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,946
The way you judge things based on what you see.

374
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,985
Why on earth did you do that?

375
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:16,156
That girl could've gotten seriously injured.

376
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,186
She may never walk again.

377
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,095
Yo Han. I'm really worried about you.

378
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:28,396
This on top of what happened at school?

379
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,065
You could end up in a lot of trouble.

380
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,545
If things like this keep happening, who knows what Father would do?

381
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,946
Yo Han, can you promise me something?

382
00:25:41,381 --> 00:25:43,916
Don't hurt innocent people.

383
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,386
Okay?

384
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,136
This...

385
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:13,476
When you look at this, think about the promise you made me.

386
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,315
Okay?

387
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:42,805

388

Mr. Park, why are you being so impatient?

399
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,291
A gang isn't a gang for no reason.

400
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:33,426
A gang is a gang because they do things in secret.

00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:38,595

- Yes? - Recently, there has been...

404
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:43,710
an increase of people who support the internet personality Juk Chang,

405
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,781
and they've been acting as vigilantes throughout the country...

406
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:47,680
and committing mob violence.

407
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,250

408

409
00:27:52,521 --> 00:27:54,219
That's all fake news.

00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:09,525
You're out. Got it?

418
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,095

I think the Blue House is being impetuous.

427
00:28:35,561 --> 00:28:38,025
They're overreaching which is why they're being impetuous.

428
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,226
Putting him in that position was a mistake from the start.

429
00:28:41,801 --> 00:28:43,866
It's all because of that old man, Seo Jeong Hak.

430

if you don't get the pandemic under control,

470
00:30:33,111 --> 00:30:35,305
you'll be criticized during your entire term.

471
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:38,606
Why are you offering to be a human shield?

472
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,015
You can control him from the back. Right?

473
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,045

474
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,489
They didn't want a powerful president.

475

That wasn't Seo Jeong Hak's idea.

476

Yes. I have everything on Jung Sun Ah's past.

Yes. Hide the sources. And one more thing.

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,265
aim a gun at the heart of an unarmed civilian?

550
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,925
Aren't you ashamed?

551
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,535
My gosh.

552
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,166
He's pretending to be the victim?

553
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:37,066
This is unbelievable.

554
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,336
Let's put him away.

555
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,905
Shall I help?

556
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:44,276
No. I'll see what I can do on my own.

557
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,546
Okay.

558
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:49,316
If you can't manage, come to me.

559
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:53,655
Okay?

560
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:57,425
Okay. Thank you.

561
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:11,736
Ms. Ji. Are you going to cook?

562
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,006
Yo Han told you not to.

563
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:16,149
I'm going to cook for Ga On.

564
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,110
He never told me not to cook.

565
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,916
I'd be grateful if you'd cook for me.

566
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:23,289
Elijah, join me.

567
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:26,390
What? No, it's fine. Leave me out.

568
00:37:26,391 --> 00:37:30,356
- Still, she put in the effort to... - I said I don't like Korean food.

569
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,526
Are you a goldfish? Can't you remember anything I say?

570
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,626
Darn it.

571
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,465
I just...

572
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,066
Sorry, Ms. Ji. I guess I was out of line.

573
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,035
It's fine. I'm used to it.

574
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:52,376
The truth is, Elijah is much more cheerful than before.

575
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:54,776
Is she?

576
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:58,720
She actively starts a conversation...

577
00:37:58,721 --> 00:38:00,956
and offers to do something.

578
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,925
She never did that before.

579
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,555
Not since that accident.

580
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,566
It's all thanks to you.

581
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,805
I'm usually quiet and gruff,

582
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,905
and this is the only way I can show my thanks.

583
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:43,166
Will it be okay?

584
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,865
Whatever.

585
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,465
You're a great cook.

586
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:55,905
I just put a few simple dishes together.

587
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:57,206
Go on.

588
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:58,945
Thanks for cooking.

589
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:15,055
I wonder if the food's to your taste.

590
00:39:16,131 --> 00:39:18,965
So, the taste is...

591
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:23,106
It tastes very different.

592
00:39:25,111 --> 00:39:28,776
It's not something ordinary people eat every day.

593
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,175
I added wild honey so it's even better for you.

594
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,075
Oh. Wild honey?

595
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,745
You put honey in doenjang jjigae.

596
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,916
That's amazing.

597
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,495
That's ginseng kimchi.

598
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,729
I added lots of truffle oil,

599
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,599
so it'll have a unique flavor.

600
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,166
That's the truffle oil...

601
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,265
Isn't it delicious?

602
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,675
The thing is...

603
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,805
- Ms. Ji. - Yes? Go ahead.

604
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:09,316
Since when did you say Chief Kang banned you from cooking?

605
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,115
He started to eat less and less,

606
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:15,419
then he told me not to cook.

607
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,055
He used to eat everything without any complaints.

608
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,195
He suspects me.

609
00:40:22,931 --> 00:40:24,965
Without any complaints?

610
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,595
My gosh...

611
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,566
Oh, you should eat.

612
00:40:33,741 --> 00:40:35,336
It's still so hot.

613
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:39,376
Then have more ginseng kimchi.

614
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,115
Well...

615
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:49,385
So you don't like Korean food?

616
00:40:50,091 --> 00:40:51,456
Did you finish everything?

617
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,155
You're pale.

618
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,825
Why didn't you warn me?

619
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,396
How could I?

620
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,495
She tries so hard.

621
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,736
She uses whatever healthy ingredients she can find.

622
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:06,836
What a fool she is.

623
00:41:12,381 --> 00:41:14,715
So that's why you always finished everything without complaining.

624
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,816
Both of you.

625
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,026
Have you leaked the information about Jung Sun Ah to Cha Kyung Hee?

626
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,595
Yes, I did as you said.

627
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,666
She must be digging for information about the foundation.

628
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,236
And we need to get our hands on it.

629
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,546
Elijah, what's the matter?

630
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,606
- When are you coming home? - What?

631
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:47,146
I said, when are you coming home?

632
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,476
I'm hungry.

633
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,385
- What are you talking about? - Ga On prepared a meal,

634
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:55,456
but he says we can't start until you come.

635
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,086
Hurry and come home.

636
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:03,325
What?

637
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,635
- Take me home. - Pardon?

638
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:12,111
What about the appointment?

639
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,305
Put it off until tomorrow.

640
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,936
Yes, sir.

641
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:47,777
Did you want to see me?

642
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:52,248
It's time to get them.

643
00:43:52,923 --> 00:43:54,147
Who do you mean?

644
00:43:54,293 --> 00:43:56,757
Your enemy. And...

645
00:43:57,162 --> 00:43:58,618
those who hid him away.

646
00:44:01,662 --> 00:44:07,297
(A safe Korea. I will make it come true.)

647
00:44:07,302 --> 00:44:08,998
Did you catch Doh Young Choon?

648
00:44:09,032 --> 00:44:11,598
Did you find the proof that Cha Kyung Hee hid him away?

649
00:44:11,843 --> 00:44:12,998
Not yet.

650
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:15,938
But at least I know who we should ask.

651
00:44:16,343 --> 00:44:17,837
Lawyer Ko here.

652
00:44:19,412 --> 00:44:20,678
Lawyer Ko?

653
00:44:21,313 --> 00:44:22,983
He's being a lot of help.

654
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,748
He brings us information from the prosecution...

655
00:44:24,782 --> 00:44:26,417
and leaks ours to them.

656
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:31,217
There are countless prosecutors who wish to join our law firm.

657
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:33,492
The only person the careful Cha Kyung Hee...

658
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:35,928
would trust with such errands...

659
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,932
is her secretary.

660
00:44:38,932 --> 00:44:42,627
He goes on a business trip every month using a government vehicle.

661
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,098
I see.

662
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:47,467
Is he very loyal?

663
00:44:47,773 --> 00:44:50,613
He's been working for her for years since her days in the assembly.

664
00:44:50,613 --> 00:44:52,308
He's one of her closest confidants.

665
00:44:52,443 --> 00:44:54,478
So it won't be easy to make him talk.

666
00:44:55,713 --> 00:44:57,317
But we should still give it a try.

667
00:44:57,552 --> 00:45:00,618
- We should get hold of him... - That's my job.

668
00:45:00,822 --> 00:45:02,118
I'm already on it.

669
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:11,857
Then...

670
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,667
I'll try and make him talk.

671
00:45:15,273 --> 00:45:16,567
What's your plan?

672
00:45:16,773 --> 00:45:18,673
Chief Kang, you have a lot of money, don't you?

673
00:45:18,673 --> 00:45:19,868
What?

674
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:23,908
Money is an extremely powerful motive, isn't it?

675
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:52,667
You woke up?

676
00:45:54,242 --> 00:45:55,567
Judge Kim Ga On?

677
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:58,138
What do you think you're doing?

678
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:12,018
I want a word with you.

679
00:46:12,762 --> 00:46:16,928
About the man in his 50s that you track down every month...

680
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:18,928
and keep the minister updated on.

681
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:20,728
What are you talking about?

682
00:46:21,102 --> 00:46:22,403
I have no idea what you're talking about.

683
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:23,797
Yes, you do.

684
00:46:24,903 --> 00:46:28,438
His name is Doh Young Choon. He was involved in a pyramid scheme.

685
00:46:28,673 --> 00:46:31,178
My parents committed suicide after being conned by him.

686
00:46:31,313 --> 00:46:34,147
What does any of that have to do with me?

687
00:46:36,153 --> 00:46:38,877
I didn't expect you to have a conscience anyway.

688
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:51,257
This is pure gold manufactured in Switzerland.

689
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:52,728
Each bar is worth 500,000 dollars.

690
00:46:54,173 --> 00:46:56,368
So 1.5 million dollars in total.

691
00:46:57,543 --> 00:46:58,697
I said, 1.5 million dollars.

692
00:46:59,343 --> 00:47:02,467
Is that enough to buy your loyalty...

693
00:47:02,843 --> 00:47:04,178
to Cha Kyung Hee?

694
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:09,277
No?

695
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,518
Two million dollars.

696
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,188
You're wasting your time.

697
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:24,362
This can't make me betray the minister.

698
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:25,458
Make that 2.5 million.

699
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:29,127
You think I serve her for money?

700
00:47:29,202 --> 00:47:31,498
She'll be leading this country.

701
00:47:35,012 --> 00:47:36,237
You're going to regret this.

702
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,742
Whatever you do,

703
00:47:37,742 --> 00:47:39,478
you can't change my faith.

704
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:49,748
You're still at it?

705
00:47:52,923 --> 00:47:54,228
Judge Kang Yo Han?

706
00:47:58,032 --> 00:47:59,697
You don't know how to make use of tools.

707
00:48:05,372 --> 00:48:08,308
Listen. We have 2.5 million dollars here.

708
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:09,467
Will you talk?

709
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,282
What do you take me for?

710
00:48:11,282 --> 00:48:12,438
All right.

711
00:48:13,113 --> 00:48:15,147
Two million. How about now?

712
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,087
- Hold on. - 1.5 million.

713
00:48:25,822 --> 00:48:27,027
I'm a busy man.

714
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:30,197
Hold on. Give me just a second.

715
00:48:30,432 --> 00:48:31,757
I need to think...

716
00:48:31,762 --> 00:48:32,857
One million.

717
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:36,368
I can't...

718
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:38,538
Wait!

719
00:48:40,642 --> 00:48:42,067
I'll talk.

720
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:44,438
I'll tell you everything.

721
00:49:15,773 --> 00:49:17,737
I didn't know it'd be so simple.

722
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:22,007
It hurts more to lose what you already have.

723
00:49:39,162 --> 00:49:41,197
(Seobu-ro 1901, Danwon-gu, Ansan)

724
00:49:49,113 --> 00:49:51,538
Doh Young Choon is hiding out in a place like this?

725
00:49:52,983 --> 00:49:54,377
Don't have high expectations.

726
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:56,578
We're just here to check things out.

727
00:49:57,253 --> 00:50:00,078
Once we're done preparing and figuring out what to do,

728
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:01,788
let's come back.

729
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:21,167
Right. Over there.

730
00:51:23,432 --> 00:51:24,538
Honey.

731
00:51:24,642 --> 00:51:26,438
Oh, my. Honey.

732
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:29,272
- It's braised spicy chicken. - Goodness. It looks good.

733
00:51:29,273 --> 00:51:31,911
Honey. You should eat a lot today.

734
00:51:31,912 --> 00:51:34,882
You need to eat a lot of protein as you get older.

735
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,681
I eat well.

736
00:51:36,682 --> 00:51:38,752
You should eat up.

737
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:40,721
I'm sure you're exhausted from working in the fields.

738
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:43,761
My gosh. Are you guys a newlywed couple? I just got chills.

739
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:46,991
Hey. I've made a lot of mistakes and hurt your mom.

740
00:51:46,992 --> 00:51:49,931
- What about me? - The same goes for you too.

741
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:52,601
Here. Eat all of this.

742
00:51:52,602 --> 00:51:54,132
- My gosh. - Eat up.

743
00:51:54,133 --> 00:51:55,228
Go ahead.

744
00:51:56,003 --> 00:51:57,938
This was seasoned well.

745
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:00,312
My gosh. This is good. There's a bug over there.

746
00:52:00,313 --> 00:52:02,337
My gosh!

747
00:52:04,343 --> 00:52:05,438
Did I scare you?

748
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:08,178
My gosh. Does that still scare you?

749
00:52:11,222 --> 00:52:12,848
Gosh, that's good.

750
00:52:56,563 --> 00:52:57,658
Kim Ga On.

751
00:52:58,202 --> 00:52:59,458
Don't be hasty.

752
00:53:01,702 --> 00:53:04,638
That man is the perfect bait to catch Cha Kyung Hee.

753
00:53:05,343 --> 00:53:06,768
Is it because it's not your business?

754
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:09,038
All that matters to you is the hunt that you planned.

755
00:53:09,313 --> 00:53:11,277
Do you know how I feel right now?

756
00:53:12,642 --> 00:53:14,377
This isn't just about you.

757
00:53:15,713 --> 00:53:17,721
Cha Kyung Hee framed and ruined...

758
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:20,987
tons of innocent people just to get to where she is right now.

759
00:53:22,452 --> 00:53:24,292
The father of the guy who has been helping me...

760
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:26,562
was framed by Cha Kyung Hee for accepting bribes...

761
00:53:26,563 --> 00:53:28,031
and being a sexual offender,

762
00:53:28,032 --> 00:53:29,587
and he ended up committing suicide.

763
00:53:30,262 --> 00:53:32,998
Furthermore, how do you intend to face your friend...

764
00:53:33,363 --> 00:53:35,998
if you get blood on your hands?

765
00:53:49,813 --> 00:53:51,821
Execute Doh Young Choon!

766
00:53:51,822 --> 00:53:54,018
- Execute him! - Execute him!

767
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:01,487
(Emergency Transfer)

768
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:04,632
I've made a lot of mistakes and hurt your mom.

769
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:05,728
Don't do it.

770
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:08,397
Don't ruin your life over a crook like him.

771
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:10,567
He's not worth it, Ga On.

772
00:54:42,202 --> 00:54:43,297
Ga On.

773
00:54:44,343 --> 00:54:45,438
Soo Hyun.

774
00:54:47,773 --> 00:54:49,471
What brings you here at lunch during the week?

775
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:50,582
Why are you dressed like this?

776
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:51,978
I took the day off.

777
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:53,478
Why?

778
00:54:55,153 --> 00:54:56,308
Because I missed you.

779
00:54:57,822 --> 00:54:59,047
Have you lost your mind?

780
00:54:59,983 --> 00:55:03,748
What possessed you to do something so sweet?

781
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:10,757
- This is good. - This is good.

782
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:13,967
- What flavor is yours? - Banana.

783
00:55:25,983 --> 00:55:28,107
Gosh, this is nice.

784
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:30,408
I wish every day were like today.

785
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,518
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

786
00:55:35,093 --> 00:55:38,888
If... If by chance...

787
00:55:39,463 --> 00:55:41,428
I did something bad, how would you feel?

788
00:55:43,563 --> 00:55:44,658
Something bad?

789
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,868
Here? Suddenly?

790
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:52,598
No, not something like that.

791
00:55:53,102 --> 00:55:54,337
Something really bad.

792
00:55:54,443 --> 00:55:55,538
A crime.

793
00:55:56,972 --> 00:55:58,438
My gosh.

794
00:55:59,083 --> 00:56:01,808
Why are you asking me? I would arrest you on the spot.

795
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:03,851
How could a judge commit a crime?

796
00:56:03,852 --> 00:56:05,678
Do you think I'd sit and watch that happen?

797
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,447
Right?

798
00:56:08,892 --> 00:56:11,458
Of course, you'd do that. That's who you are.

799
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,958
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

800
00:56:16,432 --> 00:56:17,828
Is something wrong?

801
00:56:19,003 --> 00:56:22,098
Nothing is wrong. I just wanted to say something weird...

802
00:56:22,372 --> 00:56:23,467
to you.

803
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,777
Did you ride your bike drunk?

804
00:56:33,483 --> 00:56:35,007
Why are you being like this?

805
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:22,027
Who are you?

806
00:57:23,963 --> 00:57:25,627
Are you atoning?

807
00:57:31,343 --> 00:57:34,268
Who are you?

808
00:57:35,273 --> 00:57:37,877
Who says you can pretend to be atoning?

809
00:57:39,113 --> 00:57:41,478
Don't you know how many people died because of you?

810
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:48,188
Are you one of the victims?

811
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:57,257
I've committed a terrible sin.

812
00:57:59,162 --> 00:58:00,558
I'm so sorry.

813
00:58:01,532 --> 00:58:04,138
Give me a break. Did you think I'd fall for it?

814
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:05,837
I know exactly who you are.

815
00:58:06,872 --> 00:58:10,167
Where did you hide all that money to put on a show like this?

816
00:58:10,642 --> 00:58:14,147
No. It's not like that.

817
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:16,377
Most of it was seized,

818
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:18,217
and whatever I had left...

819
00:58:19,282 --> 00:58:22,147
was taken from me by Minister Cha Kyung Hee.

820
00:58:23,352 --> 00:58:26,817
I don't have anything left.

821
00:58:27,892 --> 00:58:29,658
Even if I want to atone for what I did,

822
00:58:30,032 --> 00:58:32,357
I have no means of repaying the victims.

823
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:36,768
I'm just waiting for the day I die.

824
00:58:40,202 --> 00:58:43,268
Thank you for coming. Please...

825
00:58:44,483 --> 00:58:47,208
Please kill me.

826
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:59,257
Okay. You deserve to die.

827
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:01,458
I'll make your wish come true.

828
00:59:14,412 --> 00:59:15,507
Die.

829
00:59:18,142 --> 00:59:19,337
Die!

830
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:22,583
Honey!

831
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:25,082
Who are you? What are you doing?

832
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,351
Honey!

833
00:59:26,352 --> 00:59:28,292
What are you doing? Honey!

834
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:29,388
Die!

835
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:32,292
Please let him go. Please.

836
00:59:32,293 --> 00:59:33,388
- Dad! - Don't kill him.

837
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:35,027
Please don't do this.

838
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:37,192
- Please let him go. - Please don't do this.

839
00:59:37,193 --> 00:59:39,431
- Please don't kill him. - Please stop.

840
00:59:39,432 --> 00:59:42,127
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

841
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,972
Kill me instead!

842
00:59:43,972 --> 00:59:45,868
- Please don't hurt him. - Please.

843
00:59:46,702 --> 00:59:49,368
Honey. Are you okay?

844
00:59:54,153 --> 00:59:55,678
Dad.

845
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:58,978
- Let him go. - Don't hurt my dad.

846
00:59:59,253 --> 01:00:01,193
Please don't kill my husband.

847
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:04,217
Honey. Don't hurt him, please.

848
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:07,487
Honey.

849
01:00:09,863 --> 01:00:12,328
Who said you're atoned for?

850
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:17,737
Why won't you even let me get revenge? Why not?

851
01:00:17,943 --> 01:00:19,868
I'm so sorry.

852
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:24,067
You have no right to be human.

853
01:00:27,512 --> 01:00:28,877
You should be a devil.

854
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:33,478
You should've stayed evil!

855
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:36,587
I'm sorry...

856
01:00:45,702 --> 01:00:47,357
I'm sorry.

857
01:00:50,872 --> 01:00:52,998
Let go. Let go of me!

858
01:00:53,043 --> 01:00:54,167
Let go!

859
01:01:00,213 --> 01:01:01,852
- What are you doing? - Come outside.

860
01:01:01,852 --> 01:01:04,078
Honey. No, honey!

861
01:01:09,222 --> 01:01:10,848
Honey! Darling!

862
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:13,717
Honey!

863
01:01:18,063 --> 01:01:19,928
Quit the stupid act.

864
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:24,027
My money. What happened to my money?

865
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,438
My money! Where is it?

866
01:01:28,943 --> 01:01:30,737
My money! Where's my money?

867
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:33,107
My money.

868
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:34,978
My money.

869
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:39,417
Are you looking for this?

870
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:40,947
My money.

871
01:01:43,222 --> 01:01:45,458
My money. It's mine!

872
01:01:51,102 --> 01:01:52,498
Hold onto him.

873
01:01:54,102 --> 01:01:55,697
My money!

874
01:01:55,972 --> 01:01:58,737
My money! That's mine!

875
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:05,678
Don't do it.

876
01:02:07,852 --> 01:02:09,808
Don't do it. It's my money!

877
01:02:09,983 --> 01:02:11,817
My money. Don't touch it.

878
01:02:12,083 --> 01:02:14,388
No, you punk.

879
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,188
Chief.

880
01:02:16,753 --> 01:02:18,788
- Stop it! There are people inside! - Chief!

881
01:02:19,593 --> 01:02:21,558
- There are people inside! - Stop it!

882
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,161
- Let us out! - No!

883
01:02:23,162 --> 01:02:24,288
Chief!

884
01:02:24,903 --> 01:02:26,202
Save us!

885
01:02:26,202 --> 01:02:27,363
Dad!

886
01:02:27,363 --> 01:02:28,598
There are people inside.

887
01:02:31,602 --> 01:02:33,072
- Kang Yo Han! - Don't do it!

888
01:02:33,072 --> 01:02:34,337
Save us!

889
01:02:35,813 --> 01:02:36,967
Stop it!

890
01:02:37,472 --> 01:02:38,682
Don't do it.

891
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:41,078
I'm only trying to give him an opportunity.

892
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:44,923
- Don't do it. - Save them.

893
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:46,248
- Don't do it. - Don't do it!

894
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:47,788
No!

895
01:02:55,093 --> 01:02:56,761
- Save us! - No!

896
01:02:56,762 --> 01:02:58,728
No! Don't.

897
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:00,797
Don't do it.

898
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:03,828
No. Not my money.

899
01:03:04,003 --> 01:03:05,138
It's my money!

900
01:03:13,943 --> 01:03:16,908
Honey! Get us out of here!

901
01:03:19,182 --> 01:03:20,377
Don't do this.

902
01:03:20,822 --> 01:03:23,551
Save us! Help!

903
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:25,188
Let me go. Let go!

904
01:03:25,293 --> 01:03:26,917
Calm down and look at him.

905
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:32,228
My money!

906
01:03:33,662 --> 01:03:34,868
My money.

907
01:03:35,932 --> 01:03:38,768
No! It's mine!

908
01:03:39,242 --> 01:03:41,438
It's my money!

909
01:03:42,673 --> 01:03:43,868
My money!

910
01:03:46,813 --> 01:03:48,748
It's my money!

911
01:03:49,313 --> 01:03:51,178
This is mine!

912
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,583
It's my money!

913
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:54,788
Help us, please!

914
01:03:55,153 --> 01:03:56,447
Let us out!

915
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:07,297
What is this? It's all fake!

916
01:04:11,702 --> 01:04:13,067
Darn you!

917
01:04:18,282 --> 01:04:19,908
It's not my money.

918
01:04:20,512 --> 01:04:22,348
It's not mine!

919
01:04:26,883 --> 01:04:28,888
- I must save them! - Relax.

920
01:04:29,693 --> 01:04:31,188
Relax and watch.

921
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:48,507
Honey.

922
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:52,978
- Save us! Let us out! - Come with me.

923
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:57,348
This is... What happened is...

924
01:04:57,653 --> 01:04:59,917
So... This is...

925
01:05:00,822 --> 01:05:03,248
I thought that...

926
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:05,058
He lied to his family too.

927
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:07,087
That he'd lost all the money.

928
01:05:08,032 --> 01:05:09,188
Seo Jin.

929
01:05:09,963 --> 01:05:14,228
Seo Jin. Daddy didn't have a choice.

930
01:05:14,233 --> 01:05:17,627
I honestly had to...

931
01:05:17,843 --> 01:05:21,438
Honey, I'll explain everything. I'll...

932
01:05:23,372 --> 01:05:24,607
Darn you!

933
01:05:29,253 --> 01:05:31,618
Don't go! Stay!

934
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,848
Don't go!

935
01:05:33,883 --> 01:05:35,087
Don't go.

936
01:05:35,593 --> 01:05:36,848
Honey.

937
01:05:39,662 --> 01:05:40,857
Honey.

938
01:05:41,693 --> 01:05:44,458
Here. Get your revenge if you want.

939
01:05:44,702 --> 01:05:45,958
Don't hesitate.

940
01:05:52,843 --> 01:05:54,237
Don't hurt me.

941
01:05:55,642 --> 01:05:58,078
I'm sorry. Let me live.

942
01:05:58,113 --> 01:06:01,877
I'm sorry for what I did. All this isn't...

943
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:03,408
My money...

944
01:06:04,523 --> 01:06:06,217
Please don't kill me.

945
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:08,417
I'm sorry.

946
01:06:08,892 --> 01:06:10,188
I was wrong.

947
01:06:10,952 --> 01:06:13,058
I shouldn't have done what I did.

948
01:06:31,383 --> 01:06:34,077
I'm really sorry.

949
01:06:46,322 --> 01:06:47,617
My money!

950
01:07:04,912 --> 01:07:07,077
He's our only bait to get Cha Kyung Hee.

951
01:07:08,683 --> 01:07:09,948
Let's not waste him.

952
01:07:11,723 --> 01:07:12,978
My money!

953
01:07:34,402 --> 01:07:36,638
Darn it!

954
01:07:41,652 --> 01:07:44,848
But where is the real money?

955
01:07:45,383 --> 01:07:48,287
It's right where he buried it.

956
01:07:50,093 --> 01:07:51,787
You pranked him?

957
01:07:53,062 --> 01:07:54,217
I told you.

958
01:07:54,522 --> 01:07:57,157
Humans lose their minds when they think...

959
01:07:57,463 --> 01:07:58,997
they lost what they had.

960
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:46,643
Have just one spoonful, Mom.

961
01:08:46,643 --> 01:08:48,348
Have just a little more.

962
01:09:05,402 --> 01:09:09,167
(To the victims of Doh Young Choon's scam)

963
01:09:53,513 --> 01:09:57,948
(The Devil Judge)

964
01:10:25,912 --> 01:10:29,648
It would be more fun to topple it all at once.

965
01:10:29,982 --> 01:10:33,182
How dare they put a patriotic young man on trial?

966
01:10:33,183 --> 01:10:35,353
Why did you pick a troublesome case?

967
01:10:35,353 --> 01:10:36,423
Please cooperate.

968
01:10:36,423 --> 01:10:38,717
Why should I care about that?

969
01:10:38,793 --> 01:10:41,217
If you fail to heed the warning,

970
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,892
you must be blown up.

971
01:10:42,893 --> 01:10:44,691
Monsters aren't made.

972
01:10:44,692 --> 01:10:47,827
The monster within is just awoken.

973
01:10:48,103 --> 01:10:50,497
What is this "revolution fund"?

974
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:52,297
My gosh.

975
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:54,467
You should've done better.

976
01:10:55,412 --> 01:10:57,268
This plan failed.
