1
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:16,070
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,376
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:08,586
(Number of Voters)

4
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:18,146
Your Honor.

5
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:21,717
The Ministry of Justice just issued an emergency stay of execution.

6
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,387
On whose orders?

7
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:27,726
Judge Kim Ga On just held a press conference.

8
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,267
The live court show...

9
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,336
was all...

10
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:42,976
a fake.

11
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:48,651
Can you go into detail?

12
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,447
Are you saying Judge Kang manipulated the trials?

13
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:02,226
I will speak instead.

14
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:07,327
It is true that Judge Kang manipulated the trials.

15
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:11,037
He decided on a conclusion, and to suit that,

16
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,310
he created evidence...

17
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:15,981
and met with lawyers in advance to clue them into the story.

18
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:17,550
The counsel was in on it?

19
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:19,206
- Is that true? - For real?

20
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,176
Is that true?

21
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,990
Judge Kim Ga On here already gave his statement to the Supreme Court,

22
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:29,216
and a committee will be put together to get to the truth.

23
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:31,526
What will happen to the live court show?

24
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,390
When the truth comes to light,

25
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,956
all the trials Judge Kang presided over will be retried...

26
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,966
and annulled.

27
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:41,601
Will the live court show be discontinued?

28
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,866
What will happen to Judge Kang?

29
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,810
(Stay of execution)

30
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:54,007
As you can see,

31
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,646
the execution...

32
00:02:59,222 --> 00:03:00,547
was stayed.

33
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,387
I will release a separate statement...

34
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,727
on my view of this matter.

35
00:03:08,762 --> 00:03:11,001
Members of the public, I thank you.

36
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:14,071
(Execution stayed, Kang Yo Han to release statement)

37
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:16,167
(Stay of execution)

38
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:18,966
Release the defendant.

39
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:39,686
You did your job, Your Honor.

40
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:42,327
I wish you luck...

41
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:45,327
Defendant.

42
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,067
We'll meet again.

43
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:50,267
I look forward to it.

44
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,221
What is happening?

45
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:11,156
They're fighting among themselves.

46
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,597
You'll get your way without doing anything, Mr. President.

47
00:04:15,931 --> 00:04:17,026
A toast.

48
00:04:17,972 --> 00:04:19,067
Cheers.

49
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:22,096
That kid Juk Chang.

50
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,570
He doesn't die that easily.

51
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:26,666
What?

52
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,010
Right before he dies,

53
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,740
weren't you going to cut power to save him?

54
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:32,010
That's just what I told him.

55
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:34,010
You're more naive than you look.

56
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,877
That's just what I said.

57
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,391
You didn't tamper with the electric chair?

58
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,916
I did tamper with it in a way.

59
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:46,057
If Juk Chang couldn't handle the pain...

60
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:51,532
and was going to talk, right before he did,

61
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:54,466
I was going to up the voltage to the maximum...

62
00:04:54,972 --> 00:04:56,267
and boom.

63
00:04:56,871 --> 00:05:00,267
I bet he'd smoke.

64
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:04,007
Juk Chang, goodbye forever.

65
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:06,476
You're something.

66
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,216
That's why you were so relaxed.

67
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:12,716
I'm impressed, Mr. President.

68
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:18,760
I just don't get those fools who pretend to be so righteous.

69
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,060
They grab each other at the ankles,

70
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,331
show off,

71
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:24,896
and then trip up over each other.

72
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:27,526
Then they bring each other down.

73
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:30,197
What is that mess? I don't get it.

74
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:34,137
Fights must be won.

75
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:49,786
Judge Kim.

76
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,387
I apologize.

77
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,456
Is it true?

78
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,896
Chief Kang really did that?

79
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:01,697
Yes.

80
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:05,206
I'm sorry for not telling you.

81
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:10,206
I had no idea.

82
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,706
Then...

83
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,617
Jang Ki Young, the witness who was bribed.

84
00:06:16,782 --> 00:06:18,117
Is that true too?

85
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:20,286
Chief Kang's explanation was a lie?

86
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,887
I was for show.

87
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,456
- Judge Oh. - I don't care if I was.

88
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:34,166
I still believed in what the chief stood for.

89
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:37,867
I thought he was a good judge, unlike me.

90
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:12,042
(Handwritten Affidavit)

91
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:16,411
(Department: Live Court Show Name: Kim Ga On)

92
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:20,077
(Interview Room, Fact-finding Committee)

93
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,146
I...

94
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,891
first met Judge Kang Yo Han...

95
00:07:26,892 --> 00:07:29,786
(I first met Judge Kang Yo Han...)

96
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,596
Nice to meet you.

97
00:07:58,422 --> 00:07:59,687
Is something wrong?

98
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:01,117
Nothing.

99
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:03,187
Judge Kim Ga On, right?

100
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,927
- Yes, I look forward to... - Welcome...

101
00:08:06,032 --> 00:08:07,226
to the battlefield.

102
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:14,526
Why are you doing this?

103
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,842
(Making justice isn't difficult. It will be done at DIKE.)

104
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:17,836
Why am I doing this?

105
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,166
Yes.

106
00:08:19,772 --> 00:08:21,906
- Because I can. - What?

107
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:24,776
Possibility is like a drug.

108
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:37,587
Like I said, there's no justice in reality.

109
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:39,587
There's only a game.

110
00:08:39,691 --> 00:08:41,826
A dreadful unjust game.

111
00:08:51,002 --> 00:08:53,806
(Handwritten Affidavit)

112
00:08:53,912 --> 00:08:55,536
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

113
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:08,316
Is it happening all over again?

114
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,957
Treating me like a monster.

115
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:13,786
- Oh, it's a bird. - My goodness!

116
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:26,936
Are you crazy? Why would you kill it?

117
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:35,146
From that day, the kids called Yo Han a monster.

118
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:41,617
That little boy...

119
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,686
will kill his brother one day.

120
00:09:46,061 --> 00:09:47,757
Yo Han. I'm really worried about you.

121
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,701
This on top of what happened at school?

122
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:51,227
You could end up in a lot of trouble.

123
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:53,896
You're quite incredible.

124
00:09:54,032 --> 00:09:56,272
You got rid of your foolish brother,

125
00:09:56,272 --> 00:09:58,441
and you rescued his daughter...

126
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:01,337
so that you wouldn't be suspected and acted like a hero.

127
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:04,207
Say that again.

128
00:10:05,551 --> 00:10:07,076
Did you kill your brother too?

129
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:16,191
Yes, that's math.

130
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,987
2 is bigger than 1.

131
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,526
Sir, you seem to really enjoy playing with numbers.

132
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,970
You want to come up with a verdict based on how viewers vote on an app?

133
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:28,796
Do you think that's playing with numbers?

134
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,002
I call it democracy.

135
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,737
(Over three million votes)

136
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:42,046
I just choose the fastest way...

137
00:10:43,051 --> 00:10:44,416
for them.

138
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:05,007
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

139
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,036
Why are you here?

140
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:10,837
You stabbed me in the back.

141
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,176
So what is there to talk about?

142
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:18,646
I came to say goodbye.

143
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:23,987
I told you...

144
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:29,156
that I didn't want to see you go to a place you can't turn back from.

145
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,396
But while looking at you in the court, I realized something.

146
00:11:35,672 --> 00:11:38,637
Doing it to make Juk Chang talk was just an excuse.

147
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,066
It didn't matter if he talked or not.

148
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,806
You just wanted everyone to have blood on their hands.

149
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:46,806
And after that,

150
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:50,646
they'll have no choice but to stand by your side.

151
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,217
That's right.

152
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:57,717
People desperately want to believe they made the right choice.

153
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,127
That's human nature.

154
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,656
Using the vulnerability of human beings...

155
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:07,127
is what the devil does.

156
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:14,007
Say that again.

157
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:32,127
If you don't attack first, you get attacked in this world.

158
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,786
You don't want me to cross the line in the middle of a fight?

159
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,296
You're being naive.

160
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:39,926
I...

161
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,267
chose the fastest way.

162
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:48,007
It's human nature to hesitate.

163
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,877
They're vulnerable.

164
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:55,117
But they know when to hesitate,

165
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:58,686
and they know when to stop.

166
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,117
If they don't,

167
00:13:02,292 --> 00:13:04,717
only monsters will be left in this world.

168
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:08,727
Self-pitying monsters.

169
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:16,267
Here we go again.

170
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,707
It's something I've heard all my life.

171
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:28,316
Do you feel the same way?

172
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:33,987
Are you scared of me too?

173
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:46,326
You don't want to become a monster like me, do you?

174
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,337
Well?

175
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:54,767
If you want to kill me,

176
00:13:56,481 --> 00:13:57,707
just do it.

177
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:11,987
You are a weak loser.

178
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,526
Get lost.

179
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:25,967
I truly wished...

180
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,306
you would stop.

181
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,431
Since the shocking revelation...

182
00:15:27,431 --> 00:15:30,137
that the live court show's trials have been fabricated,

183
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:33,111
Judge Kang Yo Han has not responded publicly...

184
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:34,837
and is just keeping his silence.

185
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,981
The live court show has offered encouragement to the people...

186
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:38,581
with its aim of making justice.

187
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:39,711
But the revelation of its fabrication...

188
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:41,377
put the people in a state of shock.

189
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:44,946
Negative publicity has been growing against Judge Kang Yo Han.

190
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:48,217
You see that? That's how good I am.

191
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:52,186
Yeon Jung, now do you see how brilliant your husband is?

192
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,262
Of course, I do.

193
00:15:54,262 --> 00:15:56,497
You know Chief Justice Min Jung Ho, right?

194
00:15:56,632 --> 00:16:00,831
He thinks he was attacked by Kang Yo Han's supporters...

195
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,837
and he's furious about it.

196
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,607
Yes, is the police not here yet?

197
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,107
I'm telling you it's urgent!

198
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,676
But actually, Juk Chang did it. Isn't that hilarious?

199
00:16:18,081 --> 00:16:20,922
I took more proactive measures...

200
00:16:20,922 --> 00:16:22,786
and sowed seeds everywhere.

201
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:26,461
And that's why we have beautiful fruits like these.

202
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,387
Of course. Certainly.

203
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,997
You're the best.

204
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,666
You're a genius.

205
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:35,867
But it's a pity.

206
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:37,967
It's a real pity.

207
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,767
We should've seen some blood by now.

208
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:44,882
I would've run over the jerks that go against me with a tank.

209
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:47,512
Then only the patriots would've been left.

210
00:16:47,512 --> 00:16:51,282
We would've made Korea more powerful...

211
00:16:51,282 --> 00:16:52,720
that will make history.

212
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:53,847
Honey.

213
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:57,217
Making history is all good.

214
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,227
But don't forget where we started.

215
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:04,497
What do you mean?

216
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:07,997
"Great nation, Korea. Pure-blooded Koreans!"

217
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:13,306
That was just the concept of our Internet show.

218
00:17:13,872 --> 00:17:16,306
I think you're getting too deep into the character.

219
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:18,947
I'm worried about you.

220
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:23,017
Was I immersed too much?

221
00:17:23,082 --> 00:17:26,147
To be honest, we started this to make some money.

222
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:28,147
I hope you don't forget that.

223
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,717
Money is the only thing that matters in the end.

224
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:34,626
You're right.

225
00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:38,000
"The first president to turn a nation into a business model."

226
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,296
We did talk about that.

227
00:17:41,531 --> 00:17:42,767
But Yeon Jung.

228
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,767
There is something more important than money.

229
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:50,407
What's that?

230
00:17:51,951 --> 00:17:54,046
To make sure your name goes down in history.

231
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:58,450
To etch your name in the grand, splendid credits...

232
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:00,116
that is history...

233
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,116
as the eternal protagonist!

234
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:07,626
Yes, that's it.

235
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,157
Yes.

236
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:12,026
That's exactly it.

237
00:18:29,451 --> 00:18:30,816
I saw the news.

238
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:32,586
You did?

239
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:35,987
Are you okay?

240
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,316
Are you worried about me?

241
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:40,457
Worried, my foot.

242
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:43,497
If you get arrested,

243
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,167
this house will be mine.

244
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:52,767
It's been yours all along.

245
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,707
By the way, Ga On is...

246
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:05,217
never coming back here, I guess.

247
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,217
We're just going back to the way we used to be.

248
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:11,816
We used to...

249
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:15,296
only have each other, remember?

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,326
- Cheers. - Cheers.

251
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,040
Hello, Professor.

252
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,136
Ga On.

253
00:20:39,082 --> 00:20:41,177
I can't stop thinking that...

254
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:44,316
Kang Yo Han was involved in Soo Hyun's death.

255
00:20:46,592 --> 00:20:47,687
Professor.

256
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:51,316
That can't be possible.

257
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:55,227
Do you really think he killed his own brother for money...

258
00:20:57,001 --> 00:20:59,397
and killed Soo Hyun to cover that up?

259
00:21:00,332 --> 00:21:02,997
He's not that monstrous.

260
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:05,806
No matter what the world thinks of him,

261
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:08,467
I know one thing for sure.

262
00:21:10,142 --> 00:21:11,677
He deserves sympathy.

263
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,407
It's not that you don't believe me.

264
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:17,376
You don't want to believe me.

265
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,576
Professor.

266
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:21,717
All right. It must've been a long day for you.

267
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:23,886
Get good rest.

268
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:52,253
Kang Yo Han is no longer a threat.

269
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,626
You should lift the state of emergency...

270
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:56,325
and try to calm the public...

271
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:57,752
That's nonsense.

272
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:00,062
We should finish what we started.

273
00:22:00,197 --> 00:22:02,496
We'll announce the virus has been found in more areas...

274
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:05,396
and evacuate more people.

275
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:09,072
Mr. President, that's not what we planned.

276
00:22:09,106 --> 00:22:10,535
If we evacuate too many people,

277
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:12,342
there won't be enough facilities to accommodate...

278
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:13,772
From now on...

279
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:21,742
From now on,

280
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:25,621
I'll take charge.

281
00:22:25,987 --> 00:22:29,626
When I make a decision that will go down in history,

282
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:33,227
all you have to do is follow it.

283
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,322
Do you understand?

284
00:22:34,627 --> 00:22:38,562
And you. You've been getting on my nerves for a long time.

285
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:41,636
You talk too much. You should know your place.

286
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:43,171
How dare you, woman?

287
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,042
Most of all,

288
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:58,052
this is our chance to wipe them all out.

289
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:02,025
Those who leech off our welfare system...

290
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:03,596
without making any contributions.

291
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:06,427
Old people, good-for-nothings,

292
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,765
whiners who protest all the time...

293
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:14,335
We'll wipe out all those useless people...

294
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:17,502
and build a new country, okay?

295
00:23:17,836 --> 00:23:20,406
A young and strong Korea.

296
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:23,976
That's been my slogan since my Internet broadcast days.

297
00:23:23,977 --> 00:23:26,681
Korea's Total Change!

298
00:23:29,187 --> 00:23:32,822
This is a revolution!

299
00:23:32,887 --> 00:23:36,325
A revolution...

300
00:23:36,326 --> 00:23:39,292
to put Korea on the right track!

301
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:44,732
I'm really moved by your speech.

302
00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:49,171
But have you thought about the aftermath of that?

303
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,136
What aftermath?

304
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:54,871
By raising the stakes, you'll face more resistance.

305
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,946
What if people pour out onto the streets,

306
00:23:56,947 --> 00:23:59,646
protest, and make a mess?

307
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:00,842
What else?

308
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,951
I'm the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

309
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:05,926
I can sweep them all away.

310
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:08,126
I'll send all units to Gwanghwamun...

311
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,926
and even deploy airborne troops.

312
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,121
Why can't I?

313
00:24:12,467 --> 00:24:14,795
That's what they did in the old days.

314
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:16,732
Darn it.

315
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:28,141
What?

316
00:24:33,147 --> 00:24:34,411
What are you doing?

317
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:37,951
Oh, my.

318
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:39,681
Hold on.

319
00:24:40,286 --> 00:24:42,921
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

320
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,451
Are you out of your mind? You're insane!

321
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:48,921
Hey...

322
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,262
What?

323
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:53,265
Did you team up?

324
00:24:53,266 --> 00:24:54,701
What is going on?

325
00:24:56,637 --> 00:25:00,601
There's a limit to my patience, punk.

326
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:04,746
You're nothing but a puppet.

327
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:06,012
Didn't you know that?

328
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:09,681
Did you think you really were a great leader or something?

329
00:25:13,356 --> 00:25:17,522
Hello? Secretary Kim! A coup!

330
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:18,691
Hey!

331
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:21,121
Hello? Secretary Kim!

332
00:25:23,336 --> 00:25:26,666
Listen carefully. You have no idea what's going on here.

333
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,701
I'm serious. You have to trust me.

334
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:31,575
Trust me, you have my permission to shoot them. I mean it.

335
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:33,042
Trust me, okay?

336
00:25:33,106 --> 00:25:35,976
This is a coup. I'm giving you an order to shoot them.

337
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:38,342
Pull yourself together. Start with this woman.

338
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:40,911
Shoot her! Now!

339
00:25:45,556 --> 00:25:46,681
Ms. Jung.

340
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:51,851
What?

341
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,242
You're scaring him.

342
00:26:11,217 --> 00:26:13,082
It's fine. You may leave.

343
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:15,181
Yes, ma'am.

344
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,282
Hey! Secretary Kim!

345
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:32,161
Stand up already, will you?

346
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,262
What?

347
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:38,032
Go stand by the flag instead of getting in the way.

348
00:26:54,356 --> 00:26:57,822
Honey. Our great leader, Mr. President.

349
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,722
This is all business.

350
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:03,065
Revolution doesn't make money.

351
00:27:03,066 --> 00:27:04,691
Neither does history.

352
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:07,461
So why would the foundation support that?

353
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:10,502
You're so stupid.

354
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:25,482
I'm sure you have an idea of why I called you here today.

355
00:27:25,957 --> 00:27:27,881
It's obvious.

356
00:27:28,526 --> 00:27:31,151
You must want to talk about someone who's not here.

357
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:33,891
Like our great leader, Mr. President.

358
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:37,931
Right. What do you two think?

359
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:40,762
He seems really excited these days.

360
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:44,532
He was always a supporting actor, but now he's the lead.

361
00:27:44,877 --> 00:27:46,502
I get how he feels,

362
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,772
but if he keeps overreacting like that, he'll dig his own grave.

363
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:55,542
I heard he told them to kill Juk Chang if he spoke.

364
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:57,252
In front of the entire nation at that.

365
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:02,082
I know. He doesn't think about the after-effects.

366
00:28:02,086 --> 00:28:03,552
He watched too many movies.

367
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:06,421
I asked him what he'd do if the nation started protesting,

368
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,992
and he said he'd run them all over with tanks.

369
00:28:08,326 --> 00:28:10,661
All he ever does is threaten people.

370
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:14,262
We want to clean and redevelop Seoul and sell it to foreign investors,

371
00:28:14,536 --> 00:28:17,032
but he really doesn't know anything about the economy.

372
00:28:20,106 --> 00:28:22,576
Do you want me to tell you something even more surprising?

373
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,842
- What? - What is it?

374
00:28:25,846 --> 00:28:27,582
Our great leader, Mr. President,

375
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:31,782
was planning on spreading a real virus in Seoul.

376
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:36,596
What should we do about this lunatic?

377
00:28:36,596 --> 00:28:37,826
Has he lost his mind?

378
00:28:37,826 --> 00:28:39,661
How would we sell contaminated property?

379
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,262
He lacks business skills...

380
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:45,431
because he's an artist.

381
00:28:47,306 --> 00:28:48,931
This is precarious.

382
00:28:55,546 --> 00:28:58,111
We need to come up with a Plan B.

383
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:00,742
An elite who is a bit safer.

384
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:10,197
The president and the chief justice of the Supreme Court...

385
00:29:10,197 --> 00:29:12,921
are all temporary employees chosen by us.

386
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:15,522
Yet they all become delusional.

387
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:18,766
There are male leads who never change,

388
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,901
but you never got a chance to be one.

389
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:30,671
Right?

390
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:41,022

You're quite brave.

394
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,242
I can't believe you showed up here.

395
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:46,351
Why? Do you want to get revenge for her death?

396
00:30:47,187 --> 00:30:50,322
Please. I know you're not that stupid.

397
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:54,592
You would never do something just based on your emotions...

398
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,961
when you have nothing to gain.

399
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,911
I'll give you one last chance.

400
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:22,252
I want to give you a chance...

401
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:26,762
because it's you, Master Yo Han.

402
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:38,377
So stop bluffing.

403
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:41,647
I'm giving you an opportunity of a lifetime.

404
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:44,941
A chance to go to the Blue House instead of prison.

405
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,681
Why?

406
00:31:48,016 --> 00:31:49,951
Do you need a new puppet?

407
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:53,982
Is Heo Joong Se not to your taste?

408
00:32:00,766 --> 00:32:03,292
Are you willing to go to prison for manipulating the trials?

409
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:07,262
To put on a prison uniform and live among the trash you put away?

410
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,101
Do you think you can handle that?

411
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,242
You're working so hard.

412
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:20,441
You're really impressive.

413
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:25,881
You're always working so hard to stay afloat.

414
00:32:27,356 --> 00:32:29,951
To fill a hunger that can't be filled...

415
00:32:30,826 --> 00:32:33,861
and to get something you can't dare to even have.

416
00:32:36,336 --> 00:32:37,592

417
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:40,332
really bad for you.

According to an emergency poll,

485
00:39:59,437 --> 00:40:02,876
as many as 57.6 percent said they would vote...

Not long ago.

507
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:53,777
About two weeks ago, I think.

508
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,880
She said she'd found everyone...

509

but Jung Joseph.

510
00:41:57,311 --> 00:42:01,176

Yes, this is Joseph.

513
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:10,531
Shortly after she came to see me,

514
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:15,156
someone said they'd seen Joseph somewhere in Seoul.

If you're that worried,

552
00:45:28,691 --> 00:45:30,556
I'll move you somewhere today.

553
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:33,027
Chief Justice Min Jung Ho will help.

554
00:45:34,432 --> 00:45:37,797
Can you promise me that you'll protect me?

555
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,226
Yes.

556
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:42,266
I'll let you talk to the chief justice if you want.

557
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:52,777
I have CCTV footage...

558
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:54,576
of the church fire.

559
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:57,547
I was in charge of the CCTV.

560
00:45:58,592 --> 00:46:00,587
Shortly after the fire,

561
00:46:01,222 --> 00:46:03,487
Judge Kang came to me.

562
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,326
He asked for the file...

563
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:07,596
and asked me to keep quiet for the rest of my life.

564
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,596
He promised me a new house...

565
00:46:10,302 --> 00:46:12,627
and enough money for me to live on in return.

566
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:14,437
So I did as he said.

567
00:46:14,541 --> 00:46:15,697
But the thing is...

568
00:46:17,512 --> 00:46:20,507
I'm ashamed to tell you this,

569
00:46:21,142 --> 00:46:25,107
but I had made a copy, hoping I could make money from it.

570
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,947
A few months ago,

571
00:46:28,682 --> 00:46:31,487
Judge Kang sent a man to me.

572
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,920
He tortured me,

573
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,217
asking if there were any copies.

574
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:38,326
I thought I was going to die.

575
00:46:39,191 --> 00:46:41,857
In the end, I confessed and handed over the copy.

576
00:46:46,631 --> 00:46:49,496
What about these wounds?

577
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:52,067
A few days ago,

578
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:55,136
a detective came to see me.

579
00:46:58,682 --> 00:46:59,846
Hello?

580
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,576
Who is it?

581
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:06,187
Mr. Jung Joseph?

582
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:09,956
Just a second.

583
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:12,286
I'm Officer Yoon Soo Hyun from the RIU.

584
00:47:13,662 --> 00:47:17,096
I told her I knew nothing and she should bring a warrant...

585
00:47:17,372 --> 00:47:19,366
and sent her back.

586
00:47:19,602 --> 00:47:22,266
But last night, Judge Kang's man came back.

587
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,641
Asking if I said anything to the detective...

588
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:27,777
or gave her another copy. Then he beat me up.

589
00:47:35,282 --> 00:47:37,547
About that man,

590
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:40,286
do you have his phone number or anything?

591
00:47:40,722 --> 00:47:44,187
No. We only talked in person.

592
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:50,357
He parked his car outside my house last night.

593
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:02,107
- Here you go. - I appreciate it.

594
00:48:02,342 --> 00:48:03,512
Thank you so much.

595
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:05,976
Sure. You can keep it as long as you want.

596
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:28,797
That's him. And that's his car.

597
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:30,067
- This car? - Yes.

598
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:39,246
First, catch Kang Yo Han's man by all means.

599
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:41,377
If he killed Soo Hyun,

600
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:44,217
Kang Yo Han might try to kill him to get rid of any evidence.

601
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:48,257
Can we look up his car right away?

602
00:48:48,421 --> 00:48:50,857
Yes, one of my old students works at the Police Agency.

603
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:53,087
I'll find out the man's address and call you back.

604
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:54,326
Okay.

605
00:49:04,912 --> 00:49:08,237
Just what is in the footage?

606
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,211
I can't tell you that.

607
00:49:11,211 --> 00:49:13,047
Please don't ask me.

608
00:49:13,311 --> 00:49:16,581
Judge Kang said, if I told anyone about it,

609
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:19,246
he'd chase me to the ends of the earth and kill me.

610
00:49:19,552 --> 00:49:22,257
I know he meant it.

611
00:49:24,532 --> 00:49:27,187
Give me some time.

612
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:28,731
I'll find out who Kang Yo Han is.

613
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:30,561
I'm almost there, Ga On.

614
00:49:30,561 --> 00:49:31,926
(Police Notebook)

615
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:44,076
You've arrived at your destination.

616
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,556
Who are you?

617
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,476
(Call History)

618
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:38,257
(Call History)

619
00:51:54,642 --> 00:51:55,806
Hello?

620
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,647
Hello?

621
00:52:45,131 --> 00:52:47,386
Who do you think shot Soo Hyun?

622
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,726
He wasn't trying to shoot her.

623
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:55,197
They were planning to attack us in the confusion.

624
00:52:57,742 --> 00:52:59,636
If you want to save the world,

625
00:52:59,771 --> 00:53:03,507
you have to cut Yoon Soo Hyun out of your life

626
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:10,016
You can't help me and be with her at the same time.

627
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:33,937
You must feel like you're in a fiery pit.

628
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:39,147
An eternal fiery pit you'll never be able to get out of.

629
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:42,552
find the people who are responsible for this...

630
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,016
and make them burn in the fiery pit.

631
00:53:46,191 --> 00:53:49,156
That's the only way you can survive in that place.

632
00:55:08,602 --> 00:55:10,337
Are you sure you won't regret this?

633
00:55:13,872 --> 00:55:16,206
I can let you kill me if you want.

634
00:55:16,242 --> 00:55:17,377
But...

635
00:55:19,852 --> 00:55:21,516
you'll regret it...

636
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,746
for the rest of your life.

637
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:49,676
You killed Soo Hyun.

638
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,277
Ga On.

639
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:59,516
You're hurting.

640
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:02,886
You're hurting so much that you want to blame someone.

641
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:04,656
Shut it!

642
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,496
I saw it with my own eyes.

643
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,866
The evidence that proves that you're the culprit.

644
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,297
I don't know what you saw,

645
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,467
but I'm sure you're aware...

646
00:56:17,401 --> 00:56:19,406
of how futile evidence is.

647
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:21,437
How easy it is to fool people.

648
00:56:23,311 --> 00:56:25,306
You killed your brother too.

649
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:26,877
What?

650
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:29,846
What was on the video you took from Jung Joseph?

651
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:34,147
You lighting the cathedral on fire? Right?

652
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,516
Did you meet with Joseph?

653
00:57:07,622 --> 00:57:09,357
Did you meet him?

654
00:57:12,032 --> 00:57:13,127
Step away from him!

655
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,937
Step away from Ga On right now.

656
00:57:40,651 --> 00:57:41,757
Mr. Kang Yo Han.

657
00:57:42,262 --> 00:57:45,156
You are under arrest for abetting in Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun's murder.

658
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:47,060
You have a right to an attorney,

659
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,601
the right to remain silent,

660
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:51,297
and the right to submit a review of legality for arrest and confinement.

661
00:57:55,671 --> 00:57:57,496
Do you really believe that?

662
00:57:57,872 --> 00:58:00,737
Do you believe that I killed my brother and Soo Hyun...

663
00:58:00,742 --> 00:58:02,437
and that I used you?

664
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:09,746
Do you believe that everything I said to you was a lie?

665
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:16,886
Kim Ga On.

666
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:43,976
This is so moving.

667
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,187
You...

668
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,016
I've never seen this look in your eyes before.

669
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,587
Why are you here?

670
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:55,527
Welcome, Ms. Jung.

671
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,406
Professor Min.

672
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:09,837
Do you mean...

673
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:14,447
Coincidences don't repeat themselves.

674
00:59:15,622 --> 00:59:18,250
It was a coincidence that you resembled Kang Isaac,

675
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:20,951
but the fact that you started working with Kang Yo Han...

676
00:59:20,952 --> 00:59:24,487
Well, things like that can't be a coincidence.

677
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:26,786
How dare you...

678
00:59:33,401 --> 00:59:34,697
Oath.

679
00:59:35,171 --> 00:59:37,641
As a judge,

680
00:59:37,642 --> 00:59:39,670
I will make fair and wise decisions...

681
00:59:39,671 --> 00:59:42,437
based on the Constitution and the law.

682
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:45,451
I will follow the Judicial Code of Ethics...

683
00:59:45,452 --> 00:59:47,980
and be faithful to my duty...

684
00:59:47,981 --> 00:59:50,151
to serve the people to the best that I can.

685
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:53,286
- To this, I swear. - I swear.

686
01:00:07,231 --> 01:00:09,297
He looks just like him.

687
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:12,536
One, two, three.

688
01:00:13,972 --> 01:00:15,411
- No. - Hurry.

689
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:16,507
Gosh.

690
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:19,206
Okay, I'm going to take the picture.

691
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,911
You should take it together.

692
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:22,176
No way, Professor.

693
01:00:22,282 --> 01:00:23,817
- My gosh. - I'll take another.

694
01:00:23,822 --> 01:00:25,420
Please smile in this photo.

695
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:29,161
Okay. One, two, three.

696
01:00:29,162 --> 01:00:31,087
(Communicating with the people)

697
01:00:40,731 --> 01:00:44,467
Who do you think made Professor Min Chief Justice?

698
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:56,417
Professor Min.

699
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:59,047
This was all for the sake of the greater good.

700
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,426
You'll come to understand one day.

701
01:01:19,171 --> 01:01:20,266
Ga On.

702
01:01:22,282 --> 01:01:24,676
Professor Min.

703
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,317
You're Master Yo Han's weakness that I planted.

704
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,056
This man...

705
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:40,226
is really dangerous.

706
01:01:47,372 --> 01:01:51,067
I told you I'd make sure you'd end up lonely. Didn't I, Master Yo Han?

707
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,587
This was all a manipulation.

708
01:02:14,392 --> 01:02:15,527
This was all a manipulation.

709
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,926
Kang Yo Han didn't do it.

710
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:21,326
She did it.

711
01:02:21,541 --> 01:02:22,636
There's no point.

712
01:02:23,602 --> 01:02:25,737
Everyone here has been won over by her.

713
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,156
You were behind everything?

714
01:02:50,631 --> 01:02:53,797
The person who told that old lady where Jung Joseph was,

715
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,366
and the person who told Joseph to lie...

716
01:02:59,171 --> 01:03:00,437
No.

717
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:03,777
Everything Joseph said was true.

718
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,552
Master Yo Han did everything he could to hide the truth.

719
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,777
The only thing is...

720
01:03:11,052 --> 01:03:14,190
The man who tortured Joseph to get the CCTV footage...

721
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,587
That man wasn't sent by Master Yo Han.

722
01:03:17,222 --> 01:03:19,487
I was the one who sent him.

723
01:03:21,662 --> 01:03:23,757
I, Jung Sun Ah, did that.

724
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:26,096
Darn it.

725
01:03:35,742 --> 01:03:36,837
No.

726
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:39,547
No!

727
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:42,746
This is the thing that Master Yo Han did everything he could to hide.

728
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,947
No!

729
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:50,056
No! Don't do it. No!

730
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:52,190
Let go!

731
01:03:52,191 --> 01:03:55,156
Let go. Let go of me!

732
01:03:58,771 --> 01:03:59,866
Don't do it!

733
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,197
Don't do it!

734
01:04:08,142 --> 01:04:10,476
Don't do it!

735
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:19,147
Let go!

736
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:21,656
Don't do it. Stop

737
01:04:29,662 --> 01:04:31,156
Turn it off!

738
01:04:52,852 --> 01:04:53,947
Let go!

739
01:04:56,521 --> 01:04:57,616
Let go of me!

(Verena Church)

741
01:05:35,302 --> 01:05:37,027
The Lord's body.

742
01:05:38,131 --> 01:05:40,426
- The Lord's body. - Did you see Elijah?

743
01:05:41,331 --> 01:05:43,197
She'll be outside. Don't worry.

744
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:45,266
The Lord's body.

745
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,377
Teddy. Let's pray.

746
01:05:49,012 --> 01:05:50,536
Put your hands together,

747
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:53,976
bow your head, and close your eyes.

748
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:58,987
Let Mom, Dad, and Elijah live happily.

749
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:04,156
Teddy, what did you pray for?

750
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,386
Teddy, do you feel cold?

751
01:06:07,861 --> 01:06:09,697
I'll make you warm.

752
01:06:24,541 --> 01:06:28,306
Pet. I'm petting you.

753
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:30,376
Let's go, Teddy.

754
01:06:38,991 --> 01:06:40,556
The Lord's body.

755
01:06:42,902 --> 01:06:44,157
The Lord's body.

756
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:48,226
The Lord's body.

757
01:07:32,451 --> 01:07:33,707
Elijah...

758
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:48,726
I feel sorry for you, Young Master.

759
01:07:49,602 --> 01:07:53,397
For fear she would find out she killed her parents,

760
01:07:54,602 --> 01:07:57,067
you spent your whole life keeping that a secret.

761
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:08,777
Let me go.

762
01:08:16,222 --> 01:08:17,386
Ga On?

763
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,027
- Elijah. - Elijah?

764
01:08:21,592 --> 01:08:23,626
Elijah.

765
01:08:24,331 --> 01:08:25,926
- Elijah. - Yo Han!

766
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,596
Yo Han!

767
01:08:28,232 --> 01:08:29,437
Elijah.

768
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:31,907
Yo Han.

769
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:33,207
Elijah.

770
01:08:33,871 --> 01:08:35,067
Elijah!

771
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:36,636
Yo Han!

772
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:42,216
Yo Han!

773
01:08:42,222 --> 01:08:43,321
Let go!

774
01:08:43,321 --> 01:08:44,577
Elijah!

775
01:08:44,722 --> 01:08:45,852
- Let go! - Let her go.

776
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:46,987
Let go!

777
01:08:47,722 --> 01:08:49,857
- Yo Han! - Elijah!

778
01:08:50,022 --> 01:08:53,056
It's time she knew the truth.

779
01:08:53,862 --> 01:08:55,296
Poor Elijah.

780
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,367
No. Don't tell her.

781
01:08:59,501 --> 01:09:01,966
- Let go! - Don't tell her.

782
01:09:02,902 --> 01:09:04,096
Elijah...

783
01:09:08,881 --> 01:09:10,077
Please.

784
01:09:11,482 --> 01:09:13,147
Please!

785
01:09:13,381 --> 01:09:14,747
- Please! - Yo Han!

786
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:18,147
Let me go! Yo Han!

787
01:09:18,381 --> 01:09:19,586
Please.

788
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,617
Yo Han. Why...

789
01:09:23,762 --> 01:09:25,827
I wanted just one thing.

790
01:09:28,902 --> 01:09:32,197
For you to look at me like that.

791
01:09:41,472 --> 01:09:42,676
Please.

792
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:46,277
Take him.

793
01:10:25,552 --> 01:10:26,787
Yo Han.

794
01:10:45,942 --> 01:10:47,367
That moment,

795
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:54,976
I decided to die.
