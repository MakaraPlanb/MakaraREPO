I'd like to think while I smoke one of these.

Step back.

00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,907
You there. Stand up.

00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:48,337
Ga On, what's going on?

19
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:51,211
Why are you here?

20
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:53,437
- Soo Hyun. - What are you doing here?

21
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,277
She killed herself.

22
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:01,347
We came here to question her and found her dead.

23
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:03,578
Are you going to arrest us?

25
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,008
- Soo Hyun. - Leave.

26
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:36,418
- Soo Hyun... - Leave right now.

27
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:39,548
We should go.

28
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,298
This is Yoon Soo Hyun.

29

00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:56,557
Wait a minute. What did you just say?

33
00:04:57,102 --> 00:04:58,697
Cha Kyung Hee is dead?

34
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:04,242
I have a file.

35
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,338
And I'm going to give it to Kang Yo Han.

36
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:11,678
Send someone to her office.

37
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,278
I'm sure she had it somewhere near her.

38
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:17,678
Find it no matter what. Do you understand?

39
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:39,102
Minister Cha Kyung Hee was found dead in her office...

40
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:41,327
before an arrest warrant was about to be issued to her.

41
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:45,143
A detective from RIU visited her office for an interview at the time.

42
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,867
And the detective first witnessed the scene.

43
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:50,307
They say it is clear that she decided to commit suicide...

44
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,108
and there's no evidence to suspect otherwise.

45
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:56,077
The police are investigating to find out the specific reason for...

46
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:01,788
Do you feel relieved now?

48
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:07,988
I'm sorry.

49
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,298
I know it's not your fault...

50
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,567
I know you're shocked, but it already happened.

51
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:17,767
Just forget about it.

52
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:21,207
Forget about it?

53
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:22,507
Yes, forget about it.

54

55

We failed this time.

The file she was keeping...

57
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,127
is in Heo Joong Se's hands for sure.

58
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,412
A cigarette is so harmful to our health,

59
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,778
so why did she enjoy it so much?

60
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,757

68
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,307
I had to destroy the evidence.

69

70
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:12,518

Did Cheif Kang tell you to find me?

127
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:25,827
Does he think I might cause trouble?

I'm sorry if it upset you.

In the end, Cha Kyung Hee got punished for her crimes.

130

She ended up punishing herself.

I'm not sure. I don't feel anything.

132
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:49,557
I lived my entire life hoping to get revenge,

133
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,457
but now that I've got it, it seems futile.

134
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,668
Judge Kim.

135
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,727
Yes?

136
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:03,337
Don't get too involved.

137
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:05,237
What do you mean?

138
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,168
I have nothing to lose,

139
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:10,607
but you're different.

140
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,447
If you stay by Judge Kang's side,

141
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,217
you'll end up losing everything,

142
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:23,788
including yourself.

Yes.

145
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:56,057
I heard you went to see Yoon Soo Hyun.

146
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:59,261
How could you go see her...

147
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,758
when the whole country is watching you?

148
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,562
Are you out of your mind?

149
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:03,658
Why?

150
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:06,567
Are you afraid I told her about...

151
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,467
your plan?

152
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,697
Does this fight seem like a joke to you?

153
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:16,538
This is a matter of life or death!

154
00:16:17,382 --> 00:16:20,947
How long must I play along to your little games?

155
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,048
I put everything on the line as well.

156
00:16:24,722 --> 00:16:27,418
Do you have any idea how I feel...

157
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:29,687
as I'm helping you?

158
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,261
Even though I saw someone dead in front of me,

159
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:34,857
the first thought that came to mind was...

160
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:39,197
We have to find the file first.

161
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:46,207
What kind of monster am I turning into?

162
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,207
I know it must be hard, but we have no choice.

163
00:16:57,252 --> 00:17:00,317
You know what kind of people we're up against.

164
00:17:00,423 --> 00:17:02,618
They're going to be more high-spirited now.

165
00:17:02,992 --> 00:17:04,857
You don't know what they will do next.

166
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:14,898
Your friend...

167
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,497
came to see me.

168
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:22,437
She said she'd arrest me if I didn't stop.

169
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,678
If you want to save the world,

170
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:31,547
you have to cut...

171
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,918
Yoon Soo Hyun out of your life

172
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,787
You can't help me...

173
00:17:40,162 --> 00:17:42,297
and be with her at the same time.

174
00:17:58,852 --> 00:18:00,547
To me, Soo Hyun...

175
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,878
is my world.

176
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:54,497
Hey.

177
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,267
Did you have a fight with Yo Han?

178
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,668
It's not like that.

179
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:04,082
Then why are you moving out?

180
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:06,148
I can't live here forever.

181
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:08,878
I have a home too.

182
00:19:09,283 --> 00:19:11,217
But this is too sudden.

183
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,558
Of course, it doesn't matter to me,

184
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,822
but someone could try to retaliate.

185
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,858
You know, Juk Chang's underlings or people like that.

186
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,762
This house is safe.

187
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,931
Yo Han must feel guilty about something...

188
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,632
because the security of this place is like a fortress.

189
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,341
The CCTV and the alarm system...

190
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:32,467
Elijah.

191
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:43,247
I'm sorry...

192
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,747
that I couldn't stay by your side until the end.

193
00:19:52,362 --> 00:19:53,558
I'm really sorry.

194
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:56,997
Are you leaving for real?

195
00:20:02,172 --> 00:20:03,871
Do you want to come over to my place from time to time?

196
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,467
I'll cook you something delicious.

197
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:07,808
How can I go anywhere like this?

198
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:00,987
I don't believe in deities,

199
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:02,928
but that night,

200
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:05,997
I prayed to someone.

201
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,118
If things get overwhelming, tell me.

202
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,658
Okay. Thanks.

203
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:37,858
Did you have a nightmare?

204
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:40,598
Are you okay?

205
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:03,858
I prayed that everyone in this home...

206
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,187
could have a night...

207
00:22:07,463 --> 00:22:10,358
where there are no tears or nightmares.

208
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,928
Why did you let him go?

209
00:22:15,303 --> 00:22:16,967
He left on his own accord.

210
00:22:17,442 --> 00:22:18,668
It was his choice.

211
00:22:18,803 --> 00:22:20,671
This house is safer and better.

212
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,482
Why did you let him go after making him do all those dangerous things?

213
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:25,678
Since when did you worry about others?

214
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:28,578
You could've tried to get him to stay!

215
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,517
He's not your dad.

216
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,447
- What? - You heard me.

217
00:22:34,922 --> 00:22:36,318
He's not your dad.

218
00:22:38,293 --> 00:22:41,358
You're going to get hurt if you think that.

219
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,527
Elijah.

220
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,898
I was being too harsh.

221
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:20,128
Get lost!

222
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,328
Elijah!

223
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:23,168
Why are doing something so out of character?

224
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,967
You never apologize.

225
00:23:30,483 --> 00:23:31,638
Elijah.

226
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,207
Just act like you always do.

227
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,148
Get lost.

228
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:17,164
Let's all toast to...

229
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,334
the memory of Cha Kyung Hee.

230
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:21,993
- Cheers. - Should we light some incense?

231
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,304
Ms. Jung, you did us a great favor.

232
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:30,279
That Cha Kyung Hee lashed out,

233
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,378
like a crazy, wild pony that needed taming.

234
00:25:32,378 --> 00:25:34,844
She gave me such a headache.

235
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:36,513
I did my job.

236
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:39,683
I had to eliminate a threat to the foundation.

237
00:25:39,688 --> 00:25:42,789
Whenever she gave me that laser-sharp look,

238
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:45,229
I almost felt sick to the stomach.

239
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:46,493
I almost died myself.

240
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,699
Chairman Park, you must feel so much better now.

241
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,969
Money is good and so is power.

242
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,269
But people must live like people should.

243
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:57,569
She's always looking for weaknesses to blackmail others.

244
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,773
No wonder she met a dismal end.

245
00:25:59,838 --> 00:26:01,908
What weaknesses do you have...

246
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,973
that our timid Chairman Park trembled so much?

247
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:09,488
Are you blameless and upright, then?

248
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:12,559
I know you tried to get a Dominican Republic passport.

249
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,519
You must be so pleased you already have citizenship.

250
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:17,559
Why are you here when you're not Korean?

251
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:18,928
Go to your real country.

252
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,453
Will you stop it?

253
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,124
That's enough nonsense.

254
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,364
Stop making fools of yourselves.

255
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:26,834
The game's not over yet.

256
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:30,404
Ms. Jung, we must move onto the next step.

257
00:26:32,408 --> 00:26:33,533
What's that?

258
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:37,443
There are still threats to the foundation.

259
00:26:39,878 --> 00:26:41,114
Kang Yo Han.

260
00:26:42,618 --> 00:26:45,013
He's right. We brought up a tiger's cub.

261
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:52,898
Including him will be safer than eliminating him.

262
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,299
He has grown too much.

263
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:55,554
How?

264
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:58,124
How do we bring him in?

265
00:26:58,598 --> 00:27:00,594
He is very ambitious.

266
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:03,263
He already showed us what he wants.

267
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,933
Does it have to be Cha Kyung Hee?

268
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:10,404
Does Cha Kyung Hee have to be the one...

269
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:13,173
to protect all of your fortunes?

270
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,644
Cha Kyung Hee is out of the picture.

271
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:19,588
If we guarantee he becomes the next president,

272
00:27:19,588 --> 00:27:22,259
Kang Yo Han will be a very reliable...

273
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,423
Do we actually need another president?

274
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,554
Mr. President.

275
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,624
The next presidential election is just two years...

276
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,033
Wait.

277
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:36,334
Must there be a presidential election?

278
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:50,144
When a nation's in crisis,

279
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:53,654
even democracy is a luxury.

280
00:27:54,188 --> 00:27:55,614
That is true.

281
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,054
What is the crisis?

282
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:02,894
Why?

283
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:05,864
Is it not bad enough for you?

284
00:28:05,969 --> 00:28:08,137
Should I cause more trouble?

285
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,433
Ms. Jung, I'm disappointed in you.

286
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,209
We make Kang Yo Han the next president?

287
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,104
Someone like him? Are you serious?

288
00:28:18,078 --> 00:28:20,577
He's worth keeping around for our use.

289
00:28:20,578 --> 00:28:21,948
Rather than eliminate him...

290
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:25,084
You slept with him. Did he take you to his bed?

291
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:31,324
Why would you say something so crass?

292
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,154
Come on, now.

293
00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:35,723
Don't get too serious. It was a joke.

294
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:39,094
Why are you coddling him, then?

295
00:28:42,908 --> 00:28:44,203
It was a joke.

296
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:47,138
Ms. Jung. Before Cha Kyung Hee died,

297
00:28:47,138 --> 00:28:48,773
she barged in to see me.

298
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,443
Do you even know what she said?

299
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:54,973
What did she say?

300
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:58,148
That if I refused to help her, she would turn over...

301
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:00,983
everything the foundation did to Kang Yo Han.

302
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:04,388
That's what Kang Yo Han demanded from her.

303
00:29:04,388 --> 00:29:08,898
That punk tried to take us all down for good!

304
00:29:08,898 --> 00:29:10,864
Including you!

305
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:14,438
Without even knowing he's using you,

306
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:17,763
you went and started a support committee.

307
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,003
You need to get a grip, okay?

308
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,779
Darn it.

309
00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:28,148
Don't act like a mad woman in heat...

310
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:30,848
who can't get enough of a man!

311
00:29:30,848 --> 00:29:32,854
Pull yourself together.

312
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,324
I just said you're doing well. Don't let it get to your head.

313
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:10,324
Hello.

314
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:16,394
I wonder what made you call me.

315
00:30:16,828 --> 00:30:18,023
How have you been?

316
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:23,604
What is it?

317
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,134
Is something wrong?

318
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:40,753
Come in.

319
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:44,453
You asked to see me?

320
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,993
(Chief Justice Min Jung Ho)

321
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:49,493
Take a seat.

322
00:30:57,469 --> 00:30:59,003
What is this about?

323
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:04,473
What are you making Ga On do?

324
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,743
That child has been through so much.

325
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:11,013
He suffered and struggled through the worst to get here.

326
00:31:11,348 --> 00:31:14,114
Everyone has the lowest low, sir.

327
00:31:14,188 --> 00:31:17,154
Plus, he's no longer a child.

328
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:20,294
I will not let this slide.

329
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:23,824
- I will look into it... - If you do,

330
00:31:24,428 --> 00:31:26,533
Ga On will get hurt as well.

331
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,564
It's a crime.

332
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:32,463
You haven't heard the details, then.

333
00:31:32,668 --> 00:31:35,273
Did you hear it from Ga On himself?

334
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:42,473
You heard it from Yoon Soo Hyun.

335
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:43,844
What did she say?

336
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:51,023
She thinks you're putting Ga On in danger.

337
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,423
I guess it's more than that.

338
00:31:54,699 --> 00:31:55,923
A crime?

339
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:58,124
Did you say it's a crime?

340
00:31:59,398 --> 00:32:03,164
You are the one who put Ga On in danger.

341
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,367
You sent him to work for me.

342
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:07,039
Why are you acting so dignified?

343
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,374
You're so shameless!

344
00:32:08,378 --> 00:32:11,473
Are you so sure that everything you do is just?

345
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:14,074
I never mistook my actions for justice.

346
00:32:14,078 --> 00:32:16,814
I am just making certain choices.

347
00:32:17,188 --> 00:32:18,544
Until now,

348
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,854
I didn't have many choices in life.

349
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:24,854
I had to accept everything,

350
00:32:25,428 --> 00:32:27,354
or fight everything.

351
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,564
Ga On made his own choice.

352
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:32,394
Whether he goes on or stops,

353
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,594
that is also up to him.

354
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:37,503
You fought everything?

355
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:41,574
You seem to think you're fighting a monstrous world.

356
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,249
If you look into the abyss long enough,

357
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:49,044
the abyss looks back at you.

358
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:50,743
You must stop.

359
00:32:51,148 --> 00:32:52,314
You are...

360
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,183
ruining the world.

361
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,523
You seem to misunderstand.

362
00:33:05,069 --> 00:33:07,634
I am the abyss.

363
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:16,874
Yes, sir.

364
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,874
I think we need to watch Min Jung Ho.

365
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:23,084
- And... - Yes?

366
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,653
Keep an eye on Kim Ga On too.

367
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,524
Yes, sir.

368
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,144
The anger... I understand that.

369
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,743
Even if nobody in the world understands,

370
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,414
I do.

371
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,883
At least when it comes to that emotion.

372
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:06,087
I wanted you to be on my side.

373
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:09,198
If I needed to, I would've done something even worse.

374
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,064
Whether it was switching him or something else.

375
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:12,863
That's my method.

376
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:16,164
That won't change in the future.

377
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,144
It's not just about revenge.

378
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,683
Then what is it?

379
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:37,553
I want to fight...

380
00:34:38,058 --> 00:34:39,524
the corrupt world.

381
00:34:59,148 --> 00:35:01,544
What kind of monster am I turning into?

What are you doing?

384
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:43,984
Do you want some?

385
00:35:45,288 --> 00:35:47,124
I have mine.

386
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:51,823
What's that?

387
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:55,294
Ga On made it.

388
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,064
Spicy pork,

389
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:00,903
doenjang jjigae...

390
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,973
My goodness.

391
00:36:03,409 --> 00:36:04,774
Come have a seat.

392
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:07,573
If you want, you can eat with me.

393
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:09,274
Pardon?

394
00:36:09,478 --> 00:36:10,613
I was just joking.

395
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,517
You never joke.

396
00:36:14,518 --> 00:36:15,783
What's gotten into you?

397
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,924
You must be getting old.

398
00:36:23,869 --> 00:36:27,263
They say, absence makes the heart grow fonder.

399
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:31,363
The house feels so empty.

400
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:39,243
You should've been nicer to him when he was still here.

401
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:08,374
Will you be okay?

402
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,403
You're going to regret this.

403
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:12,644
- You're lying. - I'll give you one last chance.

404
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:14,914
You're just saying that.

405
00:37:17,188 --> 00:37:18,718
Gosh. Not again.

406
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,957
You're a born cop.

407
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:22,354
How can you pick the Thief every time?

408
00:37:23,018 --> 00:37:24,424
Do you have a death wish?

409
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,028
No, you're a born gangster.

410
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:27,798
Your blows are so deadly.

411
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:28,997
You'll hurt many people.

412
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,497
Hey, Kim Ga On.

413
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,593
What?

414
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:36,194
- Hey, you're here. - Hi.

415
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:38,564
Let me join you guys.

416
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:42,937
Elijah, you should bet your pocket money.

417
00:37:42,938 --> 00:37:45,107
I guess I'll be rich this month.

418
00:37:45,108 --> 00:37:46,743
- You two are doomed. - Here we go.

419
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:49,048
Chief Kang doesn't know how to do this. I'll shuffle the cards.

420
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:51,944
I'll divide them equally.

421
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,683
Abracadabra.

422
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,834
I don't care if humanity falls...

423
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:13,874
as long as I have you two.

424
00:39:10,998 --> 00:39:16,803
(Call, Judge Kang Yo Han)

425
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,414
The number you've dialed is not available now.

426
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:35,584
Please try again later.

427
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:40,544
Excuse me.

428
00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:44,647
- Hello, ma'am. - Oh, my.

429
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:46,283
- It's you again? - Yes.

430
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:47,857
Aren't you happy to see me?

431
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:49,814
How can I be?

432
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:52,828
People died in that fire.

433
00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:54,798
Why would you pry into that incident?

434
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:56,194
It's horrible.

435
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:57,624
Please, ma'am.

436
00:41:58,429 --> 00:42:00,337
I asked around about the man...

437
00:42:00,338 --> 00:42:01,897
who worked at the church back then.

438
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:03,903
His name seems to be Jung Joseph.

439
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,537
It must be his Christian name.

440
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:07,238
But I can't find him anywhere.

441
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,778
By any chance, do you know his real name,

442
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:12,343
or where he could be living now?

443
00:42:12,409 --> 00:42:13,714
I'm not sure.

444
00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:15,573
Jung Joseph?

445
00:42:16,248 --> 00:42:18,017
His name is Jung Joseph?

446
00:42:18,018 --> 00:42:20,783
(Jung Joseph)

447
00:42:21,518 --> 00:42:22,653
Hello, Judge Kang.

448
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,283
Min Jung Ho seems to be up to something.

449
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:28,593
He's meeting with members of the opposition party and reporters.

450
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:30,823
I see. Keep a close eye on him.

451
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:33,537
Be ready to refute...

452
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:35,568
any suspicious articles that may come out.

453
00:42:35,569 --> 00:42:38,537
Yes, sir. By the way, something strange happened.

454
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:39,633
Is it about Juk Chang?

455
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,604
Did you know that?

456
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:43,303
Is he on the run?

457
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:45,448
He broke his ankle monitor and ran away.

458
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:48,774
But the police and the prosecution aren't taking any action.

459
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:51,144
It must be Heo Joong Se's doing.

460
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:53,613
He's not even being cautious anymore?

461
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:57,624
He must be planning something huge.

462
00:42:58,288 --> 00:42:59,524
This is the beginning.

463
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,794
Sir, don't you think it's still too early?

464
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:05,568
We don't have enough evidence yet.

465
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:08,734
We can't wait for the right moment any longer.

466
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:12,303
Whatever happens, we should at least raise our voices.

467
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:14,433
There are people in our generation...

468
00:43:15,608 --> 00:43:18,203
who hold different opinions.

469
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,573
I want the next generations to know that.

470
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:24,743
I understand, sir.

471
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,883
I'll set up a press conference.

472
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,584
Judge Kang Yo Han...

473
00:43:28,989 --> 00:43:32,683
is stirring up lunacy and violence in our country.

474
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:36,558
Because of him, students began tying up a weaker peer...

475
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:38,394
and flogging them,

476
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:39,828
and he started a hunt...

477
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:42,199
against a defendant and had the entire nation track him...

478
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,363
through the DIKE app.

479
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:46,234
The trials that he holds...

480
00:43:46,438 --> 00:43:49,478
don't have clear evidence and careful process.

481
00:43:49,478 --> 00:43:50,909
Rather, they're filled with surprise disclosures...

482
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:52,973
and provocative instigations.

483
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:54,243
This...

484
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,444
isn't justice.

485
00:43:57,748 --> 00:43:58,914
In the human world,

486
00:43:59,788 --> 00:44:02,113
there is no such thing as easy justice.

487
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:03,984
I will...

488
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,283
put my job as chief justice on the line...

489
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,153
to demand that the live court show be dissolved.

490
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:12,493
Kang Yo Han...

491
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:15,794
must step down.

492
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:20,834
Gosh, the timing was amazing.

493
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,814
You answered quickly.

494
00:44:27,878 --> 00:44:29,343
Give him a call.

495
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,513
There's something else he must do.

496
00:44:34,558 --> 00:44:36,788
Min Jung Ho must resign!

497
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:39,053
- Resign! Resign! - Resign! Resign!

498
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:41,624
The live court show must continue!

499
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:43,694
Min Jung Ho! Resign!

500
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:45,694
(The live court show must continue!)

501
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:48,294
(Protect Judge Kang Yo Han!)

502
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:51,533
Min Jung Ho!

503
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:53,504
(Min Jung Ho must resign!)

504
00:44:56,208 --> 00:44:59,274
I think you should request bodyguards for when you leave today.

505
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:01,073
It is getting worse.

506
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,414
It's okay.

507
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:05,383
You don't have to go so far for my sake.

508
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,053
Even still, sir...

509
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,924
Chief Justice Min Jung Ho?

510
00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:16,924
Who are you?

511
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:19,394
You dared to defame our dear Judge Kang Yo Han?

512
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:21,164
I guess you don't value your life.

513
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,694
How dare you threaten me?

514
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:25,903
I guess you think what I'm saying is a joke.

515
00:45:27,038 --> 00:45:29,037
Should I ask your wife and kid...

516
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:30,374
if they care about their lives?

517
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:32,279
What?

518
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:36,044
Your home is quite small.

519
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:40,113
Are you upright or are you pretending to be upright?

520
00:45:45,228 --> 00:45:48,024
(10S 0846)

521
00:45:50,569 --> 00:45:52,493
Yes, is the police not here yet?

522
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:54,964
I'm telling you it's urgent!

523
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:03,878
This morning Chief Justice Min Jung Ho...

524
00:46:03,878 --> 00:46:07,218
was attacked by someone who is presumed...

525
00:46:07,219 --> 00:46:08,748
to be one of Judge Kang Yo Han's fanatical supporters,

526
00:46:08,748 --> 00:46:10,814
and he was rushed to the hospital.

527
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:13,388
After Chief Justice Min held a press conference demanding...

528
00:46:13,389 --> 00:46:14,989
the dissolution of the live court show,

529
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:18,484
he has been harassed by the protests and threats of those against it.

530
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:21,529
This is something that is so barbaric...

531
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,298
and unheard of in a civilized society,

532
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:27,863
I truly hope that Chief Justice Min...

533
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:29,498
recovers quickly.

534
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:30,509
(The Blue House)

535
00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:33,433
I think this is preposterous.

536
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,338
How can the fanatical followers of a specific judge...

537
00:46:36,338 --> 00:46:38,604
use violence against another? This is...

538
00:46:38,608 --> 00:46:41,219
This is unbelievable.

539
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:45,144
Is it okay for him to maintain his position as a presiding judge?

540
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:48,183
I hope that the Supreme Court take careful consideration on this.

541
00:46:48,759 --> 00:46:50,889
Furthermore... I mean,

542
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:53,929
it's not like Korea...

543
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:56,524
only has one great judge, right?

544
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,863
We should enhance our position with the idea of a K-judge.

545
00:47:01,038 --> 00:47:03,694
It's about time for us to have one of those.

546
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:25,584
You don't have to get up.

547
00:47:40,038 --> 00:47:42,874
You acted like you would never see me again last time.

548
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,144
You're okay, right?

549
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:48,774
Luckily, you're not in critical condition.

550
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:53,283
It doesn't matter what happens to someone like me.

551
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,513
Why would you say that?

552
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,453
But they're harassing my wife and kid who have done no wrong.

553
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:01,958
My family's personal information has been posted online,

554
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:04,394
so my daughter can't even go to work.

555
00:48:04,898 --> 00:48:05,898
Sir...

556
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:08,694
I never expected Kang Yo Han to stoop so low.

557
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:12,438
But sir. I'm sure that this isn't Kang Yo Han's doing.

558
00:48:12,438 --> 00:48:14,834
- Even still... - How long will you take his side?

559
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:16,374
I can never...

560
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,044
forgive that man.

561
00:48:58,262 --> 00:48:59,456
This is him.

562
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,297
The person who's been looking into you.

563
00:49:01,932 --> 00:49:03,062
Really?

564
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:06,127
He's been helping Kang Yo Han for a long time.

565
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:08,972
He used this chief of the Regional Investigation Unit...

566
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:11,107
to find your mom's case file.

567
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:15,377
He's still looking into you.

568
00:49:16,111 --> 00:49:18,206
He's looking into your father's case...

569
00:49:19,251 --> 00:49:21,177
as well as Seo Jeong Hak.

570
00:49:23,481 --> 00:49:24,686
Okay.

571
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:27,386
Good job.

572
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:45,541
Yes, Ms. Jung.

573
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:48,706
Your voice is quite seductive today.

574
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:52,476
Let's move forward with...

575
00:49:52,912 --> 00:49:54,481
the thing that you mentioned.

576
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,751
That's right. That's it.

577
00:49:56,751 --> 00:49:58,386
We have to push forward with it.

578
00:49:58,952 --> 00:50:01,916
The foundation has to help us out a lot.

579
00:50:02,122 --> 00:50:03,416
Okay.

580
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:07,857
I also have a favor to ask.

581
00:50:08,302 --> 00:50:11,666
When Juk Chang moves forward with this plan,

582
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:15,467
can I ask him to do a personal favor for me as well?

583
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:17,337
Juk Chang?

584
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:21,877
Sure. Okay. That's fine.

585
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:23,237
Thank you.

586
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:30,136
Smile.

587
00:51:30,952 --> 00:51:33,907
You belong in this house.

588
00:52:23,332 --> 00:52:24,496
It hurts.

589
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,487
Hello?

590
00:54:02,581 --> 00:54:04,676
Hello, Young Master.

591
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:09,017
Why did you call me this early in the morning?

592
00:54:09,552 --> 00:54:12,216
Gosh, that's so cold.

593
00:54:12,491 --> 00:54:14,191
You got rid of Cha Kyung Hee,

594
00:54:14,192 --> 00:54:16,227
so now you have no use for me?

595
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:18,997
As if.

596
00:54:19,262 --> 00:54:21,426
We must go on seeing each other.

597
00:54:22,032 --> 00:54:23,127
"We"?

598
00:54:25,402 --> 00:54:27,607
Then shall we meet up now?

599
00:54:28,842 --> 00:54:29,937
Now?

600
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,736
Let's go on a date.

601
00:54:33,512 --> 00:54:35,707
I want to show you something.

602
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,026
Hello?

603
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,656
Judge Kim Ga On?

604
00:54:52,902 --> 00:54:54,156
Yes. Who's this?

605
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:56,897
If you want to save Chief Justice Min Jung Ho,

606
00:54:57,101 --> 00:54:59,437
come to the Hyungsan-dong slum.

607
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:00,796
Who are you?

608
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:05,107
Right now.

609
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:07,006
- Get it done! - No!

610
00:55:07,382 --> 00:55:08,477
Hello?

611
00:55:10,922 --> 00:55:12,821
(Contacts)

612
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,316
(Professor Min Jung Ho)

613
00:55:18,822 --> 00:55:20,716
The number you've dialed...

614
00:55:23,032 --> 00:55:24,656
Come on, hurry!

615
00:55:26,462 --> 00:55:28,397
- Go. - Come with me!

616
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,136
Drag them over, quick.

617
00:55:31,302 --> 00:55:32,397
Go!

618
00:55:33,302 --> 00:55:34,767
Hey, move it.

619
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:45,116
Don't!

620
00:55:45,322 --> 00:55:46,520
Stop, you fool.

621
00:55:46,521 --> 00:55:49,586
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

622
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:52,687
(The nation's betrayal)

623
00:55:58,862 --> 00:56:00,926
Let go! Let go of me!

624
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,006
Ladies and gentlemen.

625
00:56:10,041 --> 00:56:14,707
A plague virus reemerged in the Hyungsan-dong slum.

626
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:16,711
To preserve your lives and safety,

627
00:56:16,712 --> 00:56:19,517
please cooperate with the authorities.

628
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:21,546
I will repeat.

629
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:26,216
A plague virus reemerged in the Hyungsan-dong slum.

630
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:28,361
To preserve your lives and safety,

631
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:31,796
please cooperate with the authorities.

632
00:56:37,431 --> 00:56:39,470
We can fight this again.

633
00:56:39,471 --> 00:56:41,071
Whatever difficulty we face,

634
00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:43,607
we can overcome it.

635
00:57:00,262 --> 00:57:01,386
Professor Min.

636
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:23,066
You made it.

637
00:58:24,911 --> 00:58:26,377
It's quite romantic.

638
00:58:27,181 --> 00:58:28,977
Just the spot for a morning date.

639
00:58:30,512 --> 00:58:32,847
I knew it would be to your taste.

640
00:58:35,252 --> 00:58:37,386
It's nice, isn't it?

641
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:45,827
Where's the necklace?

642
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:48,696
You're so observant.

643
00:58:49,402 --> 00:58:52,696
It's such a precious gift that I put it somewhere safe.

644
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:54,937
What if someone were to take it from me?

645
00:58:55,311 --> 00:58:57,366
Is there anyone who could?

646
00:58:58,741 --> 00:58:59,836
Maybe not.

647
00:59:03,411 --> 00:59:05,821
Are you afraid of me?

648
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:06,917
No.

649
00:59:07,422 --> 00:59:08,687
Why would I be?

650
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:12,156
I'm so happy.

651
00:59:12,891 --> 00:59:15,557
It's so nice when you're sweet.

652
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:24,366
But you know, Young Master...

653
00:59:27,771 --> 00:59:29,267
Why did you do it?

654
00:59:29,712 --> 00:59:30,836
Do what?

655
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:40,477
You should've been just a little kinder to me.

656
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:42,917
Judge!

657
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:47,256
Judge!

658
01:00:15,192 --> 01:00:16,647
What are you doing?

659
01:00:16,922 --> 01:00:20,216
Didn't we agree to reach the top together?

660
01:00:21,232 --> 01:00:22,426
Two years.

661
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:25,796
I told you to wait for just two years.

662
01:00:26,431 --> 01:00:29,727
Then you could have the whole world.

663
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:32,037
I don't want much else.

664
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:38,877
So that's it.

665
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:42,946
You just want to smash everything.

666
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:45,017
But why?

667
01:00:45,482 --> 01:00:47,321
Even if we throw out the current trash,

668
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:50,187
the remaining trash will replace them.

669
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:52,787
Leading a group of trash.

670
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,127
That's not my thing.

671
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,526
I see.

672
01:01:03,802 --> 01:01:05,066
What a pity.

673
01:01:08,572 --> 01:01:09,807
Kill him.

674
01:01:11,311 --> 01:01:12,577
No!

675
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:05,057
Judge.

676
01:02:19,882 --> 01:02:21,006
Judge.

677
01:02:26,081 --> 01:02:27,347
No.

678
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:31,316
Don't come up here. You can't!

679
01:02:31,862 --> 01:02:33,057
Judge.

680
01:02:34,161 --> 01:02:35,426
Judge!

681
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:38,827
Professor!

682
01:02:46,672 --> 01:02:47,767
Hey!

683
01:02:51,072 --> 01:02:53,336
No, Judge.

684
01:02:53,342 --> 01:02:54,736
Please don't.

685
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:57,906
Don't come up here. Don't!

686
01:03:00,552 --> 01:03:03,917
No, Judge...

687
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:07,986
Don't come upstairs, please.

688
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:10,687
No, Judge!

689
01:03:31,721 --> 01:03:32,877
Professor!

690
01:03:34,922 --> 01:03:36,116
Professor!

691
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:39,816
Professor!

692
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,796
(Say no to forceful redevelopment!)

693
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,127
Please don't come up here, Judge.

694
01:03:51,771 --> 01:03:53,196
It's dangerous.

695
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:57,836
Please, don't come here!

696
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:02,176
I said, don't!

697
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:19,656
Put that down.

698
01:04:22,802 --> 01:04:24,397
You know,

699
01:04:25,641 --> 01:04:28,307
I want you to be lonely, Young Master.

700
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:30,236
Like me.

701
01:04:31,012 --> 01:04:33,607
Then perhaps you'd stay by my side.

702
01:04:35,012 --> 01:04:37,906
If there were no one else by your side.

703
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:43,446
- Don't. - Professor!

704
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:50,986
Move.

705
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:24,957
Professor.

706
01:05:25,831 --> 01:05:29,232
Help us! No, mister!

707
01:05:29,232 --> 01:05:30,426
Mister!

708
01:05:31,741 --> 01:05:33,296
(Redevelopment kills the people.)

709
01:05:33,871 --> 01:05:35,037
Stop it!

710
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,466
(We are against it.)

711
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,747
Let go of me!

712
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:47,347
Let go!

713
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:56,187
Are you okay? Get out.

714
01:05:57,491 --> 01:05:58,727
- Are you okay? - Yes.

715
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,196
Thank you.

716
01:06:00,732 --> 01:06:01,871
Go that way.

717
01:06:01,871 --> 01:06:03,667
(Redevelopment kills the people. We are against it.)

718
01:06:03,771 --> 01:06:04,997
Ga On!

719
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:07,597
It's been a while.

720
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:11,136
It's me. Don't you remember me?

721
01:07:04,262 --> 01:07:05,527
I will...

722
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:10,267
kill you...

723
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:13,567
in a lonely, miserable way.

724
01:07:16,172 --> 01:07:18,477
In a way that suits you perfectly.

725
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:43,767
Goodbye, Young Master.

726
01:07:50,842 --> 01:07:56,006
(The Devil Judge)

727
01:08:23,472 --> 01:08:26,876
Judge Oh, you just be prepared.

728
01:08:27,512 --> 01:08:29,407
He's under attack.

729
01:08:29,911 --> 01:08:32,447
It's just the beginning, Young Master.

730
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:34,320
You won't do anything?

731
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:36,046
That news. It's all fake.

732
01:08:36,092 --> 01:08:37,392
The foundation made it up.

733
01:08:37,392 --> 01:08:39,357
- No! - If there's no stage,

734
01:08:39,392 --> 01:08:41,361
he is just a man.

735
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:43,461
Jung Joseph? Just a moment.

736
01:08:43,462 --> 01:08:45,557
The government is blinding you.
