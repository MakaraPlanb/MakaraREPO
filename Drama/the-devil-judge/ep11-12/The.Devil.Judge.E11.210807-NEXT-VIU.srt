1
00:00:22,343 --> 00:00:24,339
Do what suits you best.

2
00:00:26,883 --> 00:00:28,879
You used to be a servant?

3
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,948
What a lowlife.

4
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:42,962
Hi, Sun Ah.

5
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:45,933
Kang Yo Han told Cha Kyung Hee about me.

6
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:47,628
- What? - Look into it.

7
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:49,043
Why would he...

8
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:51,338
Shut your mouth and look into it!

9
00:00:54,413 --> 00:00:57,212
You'll have to pay for interfering with my plans.

10
00:00:57,213 --> 00:00:59,078
It seems you worked hard to get here.

11
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,209
Would that be okay?

12
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:25,709
I will kill you,

13
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:29,608
Kang Yo Han.

14
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:33,149
I will tear you to shreds.

15
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,758
But isn't it too risky?

16
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:51,533
You said you never know what she'll do.

17
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,843
I told you. If the powerful stick together,

18
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:56,269
there's no way.

19
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:58,843
We have Doh Young Choon.

20
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:00,813
We can use him to get Cha Kyung Hee...

21
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:02,179
And let prosecutors take over?

22
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:03,909
Or the press?

23
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,419
Cha Kyung Hee has leverage against every media company.

24
00:02:11,084 --> 00:02:13,649
We can't take her down from the outside.

25
00:02:13,894 --> 00:02:16,558
We have no choice but to make them turn their blades at each other?

26
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,688
What if that blade turns to face you?

27
00:02:20,734 --> 00:02:23,359
How can I shake them without risking anything?

28
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:26,498
Fortunately for us, everyone...

29
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:29,968
has their own sore point.

30
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:32,908
Whoever that may be.

31
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,408
Darn it.

32
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:44,649
Have you had dinner?

33
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:46,919
How is Young Min?

34
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,158
He's the same as yesterday.

35
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:52,128
The wound almost healed up.

36
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,128
But you know how he feels...

37
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,699
Mom, let's move to America.

38
00:03:00,304 --> 00:03:02,338
I don't think I can live here.

39
00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:06,568
I'm too scared to live here.

40
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:08,438
Move to America with me, Mom.

41
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,479
Stand up.

42
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:14,153
- Mom. - I said stand up.

43
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,348
Stand up.

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,049
Can't you hear me?

45
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:19,688
Stand up.

46
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:25,993
- You weak little loser. - Honey.

47
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,229
You should seek revenge not run away!

48
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:30,699
How could you run away after being humiliated like that?

49
00:03:30,963 --> 00:03:34,568
How could you? You stupid little boy.

50
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:50,919
How much do you think Cha Kyung Hee knows about me?

51
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,989
I looked into it, but I can't find any connecting link between them.

52
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,233
They're certainly enemies.

53
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,028
Do you think Cha Kyung Hee would join hands with Kang Yo Han?

54
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,028
There's no one other than Kang Yo Han.

55
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:08,269
The one who would put a knife in her hand and make her stab me.

56
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:15,079
He's after something.

57
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:26,449
(Minister Cha Kyung Hee)

58
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,488
Yes, Minister Cha.

59
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,044
(Unnatural Death Case Report)

60
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:46,838
You did a pretty good job of hiding it.

61
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,709
I guess you spent a lot of money on it.

62
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,313
A mother who beat her daughter whenever she was drunk...

63
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:56,019
unfortunately fell down the stairs in a hillside slum and died.

64
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:59,319
The security light was off, and the only witness was her daughter.

65
00:04:59,823 --> 00:05:02,358
Her acting was outstanding and tears seemed so real.

66
00:05:02,924 --> 00:05:05,129
The police officers never doubted her.

67
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:08,199
So it's closed as a slip and fall accident under the influence.

68
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,399
I think it's enough for me to pursue it.

69
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:16,199
The daughter's statement was the only proof that she was drunk.

70
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:20,168
But what if I find a doctor's note that says otherwise?

71
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:23,338
"There was no trace of alcohol in her system."

72
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,149
"Unless someone pushed her from behind,"

73
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:28,278
"it would've never happened."

74
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,918
But there was no report that says so.

75
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:37,519
You still don't understand, do you?

76
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,428
The thing about truth is that...

77
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,928
I make it up.

78
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,829
All I need is some source that can fire up people's imagination.

79
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:49,769
I guess you're an expert at it.

80
00:05:51,104 --> 00:05:53,344
Fabricating evidence and carrying out a pressed investigation.

81
00:05:53,344 --> 00:05:55,178
You're good at those.

82
00:05:55,484 --> 00:05:57,038
I'll take that as a compliment.

83
00:05:57,313 --> 00:05:59,082
What is it that you want?

84
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,209
Kang Yo Han.

85
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,348
Catch him and regain my son's reputation.

86
00:06:03,953 --> 00:06:05,588
Then I'll let you go.

87
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,823
But the trial is over. How can I ever...

88
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:11,629
That's why I need someone like you.

89
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,693
Someone who was born in a dirty swamp.

90
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:17,028
Someone who would do anything to survive.

91
00:06:22,143 --> 00:06:23,798
I'll give you a week...

92
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,338
to get it done.

93
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,858
A pleasure to see you again, Master Yo Han.

94
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:44,218
You've been well, right?

95
00:06:54,974 --> 00:06:57,104
Do you want it done just as usual?

96
00:06:57,104 --> 00:06:58,269
Yes.

97
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,238
Thank you.

98
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:04,168
Hi, Master Yo Han.

99
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:12,649
How is it that you are here?

100
00:08:15,753 --> 00:08:16,949
Where's the barber?

101
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:24,059
Don't tell me you...

102
00:08:24,164 --> 00:08:25,588
Don't get all worked up.

103
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,689
He's just asleep.

104
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,358
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:36,298
Nothing. I always wanted to do this.

106
00:08:36,644 --> 00:08:38,198
I wanted to...

107
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,269
make my master pretty.

108
00:08:47,514 --> 00:08:48,749
Then get what you wished for.

109
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,389
But you know what?

110
00:08:58,024 --> 00:08:59,359
Why did you do it?

111
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:01,458
Do what?

112
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:04,629
You leaked a story about me to Cha Kyung Hee.

113
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:08,168
Thanks to you, I'm in big trouble.

114
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:10,869
I did it because I need you.

115
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,068
Are you serious?

116
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:16,178
I want to get Cha Kyung Hee.

117
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:18,578
And I was hoping you will do the same.

118
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:22,479
So you put me in danger because you needed me?

119
00:09:27,054 --> 00:09:28,458
Master Yo Han.

120
00:09:29,223 --> 00:09:31,219
You are a bad man.

121
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,658
And a brazen one too.

122
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:40,729
Isn't that why you like me?

123
00:09:41,473 --> 00:09:42,899
Because I'm like you.

124
00:09:45,744 --> 00:09:48,938
After all, things are irreversible for you now.

125
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,208
As long as Cha Kyung Hee is alive and well,

126
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:55,879
you won't get your freedom back.

127
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,259
Now make a choice.

128
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,528
What if I choose the blade?

129
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:14,399
Then I can't help it.

130
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:18,509
Do as you wish.

131
00:10:35,624 --> 00:10:37,188
Do you want to come to my place?

132
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:43,499
It's been a long time.

133
00:10:45,034 --> 00:10:48,068
It'll remind you of the old days. It's going to be fun.

134
00:13:21,453 --> 00:13:23,119
What are you thinking about?

135
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:31,798
Everything's the same as before.

136
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,708
But you've changed.

137
00:13:41,874 --> 00:13:42,979
I have?

138
00:13:43,744 --> 00:13:44,938
How?

139
00:13:46,014 --> 00:13:47,109
Ms. Jung?

140
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,288
Welcome.

141
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:55,219
Chief Kang told me he was inviting you over.

142
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:57,063
He did?

143
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,428
If it is okay with you, would you like to eat with us?

144
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,828
It's dinnertime soon.

145
00:14:21,884 --> 00:14:25,149
Did you really make all of this, Judge Kim?

146
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:28,249
I'm living off this family, thankfully.

147
00:14:28,254 --> 00:14:31,318
I thought you were fully recovered. Aren't you?

148
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:40,828
I didn't know you had so many talents.

149
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,469
When I first met you, I didn't know...

150
00:14:44,603 --> 00:14:46,739
you had so many talents either.

151
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:53,509
Who's this lady again?

152
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:56,778
She is the head of the Live Court Show Operation Support Committee.

153
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,352
This is the first time you've brought a woman over.

154
00:15:00,353 --> 00:15:01,448
Are you two together?

155
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,523
- Elijah. - I'm honored.

156
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:05,889
I'm your first female guest?

157
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:07,558
You're together, right?

158
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:10,028
Let's eat.

159
00:15:12,774 --> 00:15:15,168
- Are you together or not? - We're not.

160
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:18,942
She helps Chief Kang.

161
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,168
Please continue to help us.

162
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:22,708
I'm not sure.

163
00:15:22,884 --> 00:15:26,753
Am I even capable of helping Chief Kang?

164
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,418
Chief Kang told me he absolutely needs you.

165
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:32,818
My, I'm flattered.

166
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:35,119
Did you really say that?

167
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,732
You're talking too much.

168
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:40,558
Please start. You too.

169
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,798
Elijah, try this first.

170
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:58,609
Judge Kim, you seem to belong right in this family.

171
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:01,178
You blend in perfectly.

172
00:16:01,654 --> 00:16:03,349
You think so?

173
00:16:05,994 --> 00:16:08,019
I guess you don't feel lonely anymore.

174
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:11,119
I'm envious.

175
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:20,298
Have you known each other for a long time?

176
00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:21,599
Well...

177
00:16:21,904 --> 00:16:25,469
We've been supporting each other over the years,

178
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,839
Elijah.

179
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,908
How do you know my name?

180
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:34,009
How about a toast? We have our important guest here.

181
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:45,432
- Not you. - What do I drink then?

182
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:46,528
Drink juice.

183
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,503
Thank you. Cheers.

184
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,969
Hold on. She should be here any minute.

185
00:16:56,573 --> 00:16:58,869
Why did you want me to come in the evening?

186
00:16:59,213 --> 00:17:01,009
Oh, I see you have a guest.

187
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,979
To Ms. Jung Sun Ah,

188
00:17:05,214 --> 00:17:09,049
who has returned home after all these years.

189
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:13,518
Sun Ah... Are you Sun Ah?

190
00:17:23,234 --> 00:17:25,198
Are you playing me?

191
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,428
You don't like it?

192
00:17:27,804 --> 00:17:28,938
That's too bad.

193
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:31,268
Yes, I'm playing you.

194
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:33,069
It's fun.

195
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:36,238
You're smart,

196
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,178
ruthless,

197
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:40,708
and as broken as I am.

198
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:43,178
That's pretty rare.

199
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,389
But I'm thinking, playing with you might be fun too.

200
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,329
Remember the offer you made me?

201
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:58,829
You wanted me to climb to the top of the world...

202
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:01,569
with you.

203
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:37,938
Smile.

204
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:41,708
You belong in this house.

205
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:58,758
Do you think Jung Sun Ah will join hands with you?

206
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:01,263
She might choose Cha Kyung Hee.

207
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:02,928
She's unpredictable.

208
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,428
That's nonsense. He's obviously tricking you.

209
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,438
Right?

210
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:14,539
What does Kang Yo Han take you for?

211
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:16,412
I can't believe this.

212
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,539
I know.

213
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:20,978
He's obviously tricking me.

214
00:19:22,823 --> 00:19:26,389
But he doesn't even seem to try to hide it.

215
00:19:26,694 --> 00:19:27,789
So?

216
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:30,418
It's strange.

217
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,758
I want to fall for his trick.

218
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:35,658
Even...

219
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,498
just for a short while.

220
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,029
Sun Ah.

221
00:19:43,774 --> 00:19:45,369
But I probably shouldn't,

222
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:47,069
I guess.

223
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,398
Hello? Judge Oh Jin Joo speaking.

224
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,594
I know.

225
00:20:03,729 --> 00:20:07,933
This is Park Du Man, chairman of Saram Media.

226
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:10,738
Oh, hello.

227
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:13,607
I'm sorry I called you so suddenly. But I'd love to see you.

228
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:16,448
On behalf of the Social Responsibility Foundation.

229
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,413
Do you mean all of us three judges?

230
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,514
No.

231
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,213
Just you, Judge Oh.

232
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,724
Well, okay. Sounds good.

233
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,623
Is something wrong?

234
00:20:38,568 --> 00:20:39,663
What?

235
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:42,234
No, nothing's wrong.

236
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,494
Judge Oh, you're here.

237
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:19,834
Have a seat.

238
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:21,834
Over there.

239
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:40,294
Nice to meet you. I'm Oh Jin Joo.

240
00:21:41,459 --> 00:21:43,824
I enjoyed the promotional video for the live court show.

241
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:46,494
You were meant for the camera. You did a great job.

242
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:47,969
Thank you.

243
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:50,363
Why don't you help us with the work we do at the foundation?

244
00:21:51,469 --> 00:21:54,373
- What do you mean? - You'll be working for the nation.

245
00:21:54,538 --> 00:21:57,744
We just need someone that the citizens can trust to head it.

246
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:00,344
You're great,

247
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,584
but we had a few questions, which is why we asked you to come.

248
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,383
I don't understand...

249
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,524
When you were working outside of Seoul,

250
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:14,653
you put a business owner under court custody.

251
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:17,098
I'd think probation would be enough...

252
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:18,923
for using some of your own company's money.

253
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:20,963
Why were you so harsh?

254
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,103
Do you have anti-corporation sentiments?

255
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,504
Is this...

256
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,804
a job interview?

257
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:34,047
I don't think we're here, so you can hire me as a model.

258
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:35,774
Is this a job interview...

259
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,544
for the position of the presiding judge for the live court show?

260
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:42,014
You catch on quick. As expected.

261
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:45,353
I want you to trust in me to become a star,

262
00:22:45,358 --> 00:22:48,423
but I must know what kind of risks I'm taking first.

263
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,103
Did Judge Kang Yo Han have to go through this process as well?

264
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:03,903
Hilarious.

265
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:07,244
Even the Chief Justice underwent this process.

266
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,014
Don't you think this is the proper distance for a conversation?

267
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,284
What would you like to know about me?

268
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,968
- I'll show you how good I am. - It's falling.

269
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:05,239
It's falling. Look.

270
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:06,933
Elijah. Eat this.

271
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:13,544
Fall. Fall!

272
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,213
It's your turn, Elijah.

273
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:25,683
Oh, no.

274
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:27,953
It looks like it might fall.

275
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:29,899
You got it.

276
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:31,994
It's going to... No!

277
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:33,963
Yes!

278
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:43,574
Do you want to join us? Chief Kang...

279
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,344
- Chief Kang? - Forget it.

280
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:47,544
Yo Han doesn't play games like this.

281
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,824
Chief Kang, did you have something to say?

282
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,393
What?

283
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:07,294
No. I was just passing by.

284
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,873
There was something creepy about Yo Han since then.

285
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:19,943
Is that so?

286
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,613
One day, I was playing with my friends,

287
00:25:22,618 --> 00:25:24,643
and he watched us in secret.

288
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,988
He even imitated us.

289
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:28,554
- Let's win, anyone! - Let's win, anyone!

290
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:31,453
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot! - Let's win, anyone!

291
00:25:31,558 --> 00:25:34,494
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot! - Yes!

292
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,724
Nice!

293
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,794
Hey. Do you only know how to play paper?

294
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:41,994
You fool.

295
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:44,209
- Why are you so bad? - Do a better job!

296
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,334
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,633
- My gosh. - Just do a better job next time.

298
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:51,643
Okay!

299
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:54,443
It gave me chills.

300
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,213
But Father.

301
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,713
Yes?

302
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:05,024
Don't you think that maybe that child wanted to play too?

303
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,463
- Rock-paper-scissors, shoot! - Win!

304
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,568
What do you mean?

305
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:15,834
That child...

306
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:20,103
might've just been really lonely.

307
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:32,584
- Chief Kang. - Yes?

308
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,423
What?

309
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:39,824
You're taking me away from reading to play this game?

310
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,399
I have homework to do too.

311
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:43,594
Do your homework then.

312
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,564
Stop it.

313
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:47,899
You guys should spend time together.

314
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:50,264
I have some dishes to do...

315
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:52,804
Ma'am. Let's play together.

316
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,244
I don't think it's a good idea to put them up against each other.

317
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:58,879
- Why? - I don't even have time to read.

318
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:00,074
What a waste of time.

319
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:05,248
Have you spent more than five minutes with Elijah...

320
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,413
without fighting?

321
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,863
Let's play. Move over.

322
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,393
Go first.

323
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,909
- Come in. - What are you talking about?

324
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,863
Go ahead. Hurry.

325
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,804
- Do I just pull anything out? - Can't you tell?

326
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:30,744
You're so dumb.

327
00:27:32,308 --> 00:27:33,514
Hurry up.

328
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:36,443
- Any one of them? - Just go!

329
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:03,474
Okay, then I choose this.

330
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,844
Okay. Nice.

331
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:11,514
Elijah. I think that's enough...

332
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,183
It's shaking. It's shaking.

333
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:17,524
It's shaking. It's shaking.

334
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:21,353
You need to know about structural mechanics.

335
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,633
They've been at it for two hours. Will they be okay?

336
00:28:26,669 --> 00:28:29,433
That's why I told you that you should reconsider.

337
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:33,433
Thirty-one.

338
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:35,873
I choose this one.

339
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:38,844
Yes!

340
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,143
Yo Han.

341
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:48,153
Give me your arm.

342
00:28:54,328 --> 00:28:55,994
Let's play again. Stack it up again.

343
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:58,094
Hurry.

344
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:05,163
Hurry. Over here.

345
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:21,653
Did something good happen?

346
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:24,383
You seem a bit different.

347
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:27,453
Something good is happening.

348
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,994
I'm with you.

349
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,623
What is it? You're scaring me. You're joking, right?

350
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:34,463
I'm not joking.

351
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:38,138
What is this?

352
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:41,537
Last time, you rode your bike, but you wanted to go for a walk.

353
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:43,703
Then you wanted to go get ice cream.

354
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,943
Do you have a terminal disease? Is it serious?

355
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:49,213
I'm not going to die.

356
00:29:49,818 --> 00:29:51,347
So let's just eat.

357
00:29:51,348 --> 00:29:52,584
Okay.

358
00:29:57,088 --> 00:30:00,294
Once this is over, I'll definitely...

359
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:07,163
Yes. This place is really famous.

360
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:08,594
Really?

361
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:15,903
Did you bring me the answer I wanted to hear?

362
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,004
The first step.

363
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,618
The first step?

364
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:21,979
In your son's case, there were over 20 people...

365
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:23,689
who testified as victims.

366
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:25,719
It's hard to turn things around at that point.

367
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,413
It's too obvious too.

368
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,758
So?

369
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:30,889
But if we say that...

370
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,153
there was a mistake in the first step,

371
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,057
then the overall impression turns bad.

372
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:37,524
It's not pretty.

373
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,663
From that state,

374
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:43,064
if there are 1 or 2 more suspicious aspects about it,

375
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,734
what do you think will happen?

376
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:47,479
"What was the intention of the presiding judge..."

377
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,703
"who conducted a hasty trial and had the defendant flogged?"

378
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,673
That's not a bad title for an article.

379
00:30:53,348 --> 00:30:54,844
So what's the first step?

380
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,567
I'm sure you remember her.

381
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,564
She's the first person to step up...

382
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,963
and change the game.

383
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,439
He's a complete psycho.

384
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:21,277
He threw a tantrum, complaining about the congestion.

385
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:22,507
I was so shocked and stared at him.

386
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,103
Then he slapped me in the face.

387
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,218
I felt so upset and frustrated.

388
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,713
Hey, have you lost your...

389
00:31:33,318 --> 00:31:36,923
You're the excited young lady who had a field day.

390
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:39,757
So what can you do for us?

391
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:40,928
I'll do anything.

392
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:43,228
Just help my mom. Please.

393
00:31:43,229 --> 00:31:44,767
She will say that...

394
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:47,264
Kang Yo Han paid her to give a false statement.

395
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:48,564
Is that true?

396
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:50,363
Is that important?

397
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,103
What's important...

398
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:56,974
is that we can make up the truth.

399
00:31:58,508 --> 00:32:00,774
My mom's really okay, isn't she?

400
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,584
She has a heart condition.

401
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:07,284
I let you hear her voice.

402
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:12,853
That's not too bad a story.

403
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,193
Kang Yo Han bought a witness.

404
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:19,163
There was that Jang Ki Young issue from the previous case.

405
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:22,337
If the same thing keeps happening,

406
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:24,738
it gives off a completely different feel.

(Ministry of Justice)

408
00:32:27,308 --> 00:32:29,748
But would Kang Yo Han just let it happen?

409
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:32,178
You must go public fast, so he has no time to fight back.

410
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,014
Let the whole nation see.

411
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,383
You look good on camera, don't you, Minister Cha?

412
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:49,963
I received an important tip that made me wonder...

413
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:51,998
if the live court show is impartial.

414
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:54,037
- What is it? - Can you tell us?

415
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,507
Telling you about it now will make some think...

416
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,903
I'm doing this to clear my son's name.

417
00:33:00,608 --> 00:33:05,074
I suggest Judge Kang Yo Han attend a public hearing.

418
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:08,344
I will reveal everything in front of the people.

419
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,414
Explain yourself if you can.

420
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,514
Where the live court show is held.

421
00:33:13,718 --> 00:33:15,713
What do you want him to explain?

422
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,954
Does this really not involve your son?

423
00:33:18,058 --> 00:33:19,898
- What is this about? - Tell us something.

424
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:22,958
- Is it not about Lee Young Min? - What is going on?

425
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,293
Any comments, ma'am?

426
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:38,043
Judge Kang Yo Han.

00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,918
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han's Open Hearing)

428
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,043
You're known for inheriting a huge sum.

429
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:45,983
Is that true?

430
00:33:46,189 --> 00:33:48,253
Is that what you wanted to know?

431
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,724
Yes. It's true.

432
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,394
Is that why you think you can buy anything in the world?

433
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,298
Can you be more specific?

434
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:01,333
I'm talking about the truth.

435
00:34:02,598 --> 00:34:06,034
A witness to the JU Chemical's case, your first live court show.

436
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:07,934
You paid him, didn't you?

437
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:10,048
I explained those payments already.

438
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:13,204
What if you paid a witness of the very next case too?

439
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:16,077
Would you not find that strange?

440
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:18,418
Even more so if you demanded a fake testimony?

441
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,014
That is an interesting statement.

442
00:34:20,888 --> 00:34:23,184
What evidence do you have?

443
00:34:23,988 --> 00:34:25,784

I believe you have a lot to say.

447
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:53,313
Be brave and speak up.

450
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:02,824
that I'd been assaulted by Lee Young Min.

451
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:06,463
I was...

452
00:35:09,169 --> 00:35:11,503
forced to make a false statement.

453
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:16,137
Forced to make a false statement.

454
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:18,273

455
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:19,778
What?

456
00:35:19,779 --> 00:35:21,273
No way.

457
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:24,184
That's it. This is what I'm talking about.

458
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,958
I said your mom would do it.

Minister Cha Kyung Hee threatened me.

466

She said that if I didn't come here...

467
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,927
and say Judge Kang bribed me to lie,

468
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:09,197
she'd put me in prison for smuggling drugs...

469
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:11,324
when I didn't do such a thing.

470
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:14,568
She said it takes nothing to make me a criminal.

471
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,037
What are you talking about? Why are you lying?

472
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:18,403
That's what you said!

473
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,034
Is that true?

474
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,648
Yes. She said that to me in her own office last week.

I did, and the knife went right in.

545
00:40:52,709 --> 00:40:54,443
Do you think I'll let this slide?

546
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:58,883
You just wait. I'll reveal everything you did.

547
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:02,284
Well, let's see...

548
00:41:02,488 --> 00:41:05,153
Do you think people will believe anything you say?

549
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:07,894
You're the symbol of manipulation.

550
00:41:08,129 --> 00:41:09,197
What?

551
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:10,394
See?

552
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:15,733
You should've been nice...

553
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,164
to the mere secretary.

554
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:30,383
That crazy little...

555
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:04,987
Good work.

556
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:32,947
Hi, Soo Hyun.

557
00:42:33,082 --> 00:42:36,146
Hi, Ga On. Did you see it? Kang Yo Han caught Doh Young Choon.

558
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:38,357
Yes. I just saw it on TV.

559
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:41,027
How can you be so calm?

560
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:44,056
It's really great. I'm so relieved.

561
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,326
To think how much you've suffered all these years...

562
00:42:46,332 --> 00:42:48,471
Anyway, how did Kang Yo Han do that?

563
00:42:48,472 --> 00:42:49,896
How did he find Doh Young Choon?

564
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:52,936
It doesn't really matter.

565
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,272
It's all over now. Let's forget everything.

566
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,536
What are you talking about? This is just the beginning.

567
00:42:57,582 --> 00:43:00,306
Ga On, I'll make sure...

568
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,607
Cha Kyung Hee is brought to justice.

569
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,087
I said, you can't.

570
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,157
She has a lot on her plate right now.

571
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,456
I'm hanging up.

572
00:43:15,691 --> 00:43:16,826
Hello, ma'am.

573
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:21,226
A detective from the RIU keeps trying to barge in.

574
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,996
Did you get what I asked for?

575
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:25,837
Yes.

576
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:27,737
It's being brought here.

577
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:43,246
(Ministry of Justice)

578
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:57,837
(495Y 6541)

579
00:44:03,981 --> 00:44:07,947
(495Y 6541)

580
00:44:39,981 --> 00:44:41,746
Even if you kill someone here,

581
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:43,706
no one would know.

582
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:44,976
It's pouring too.

583
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:49,887
Why did you want to see me?

584
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:54,657
Why are you doing this to me?

585
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,396
What did I ever do to you?

586
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:00,826
The fire many years ago?

587
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:05,036
I'm a victim too. I didn't do anything wrong.

588
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,637
Or the assemblyman who committed suicide?

589
00:45:09,512 --> 00:45:11,637
I was just following orders.

590
00:45:11,682 --> 00:45:14,512
I was just trying to survive in the organization,

591
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:16,576
without anyone having my back.

592
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,976
How do you think I got where I am now?

593
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:24,317
All I ever did is...

594
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,757
struggle to survive.

595
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,686
Do you understand?

596
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:34,067
The self-pity of the powerful.

597
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:36,166
It's hard to stand.

598
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:38,197
It makes me sick.

599
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:42,837
What?

600
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:04,357
Fine. Do whatever you want.

601
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:08,567
Do you think you can get me with one surprise show?

602
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:10,666
I know it won't be easy.

603
00:46:11,841 --> 00:46:14,171
You'll stall for time by requesting an official investigation,

604
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,042
look for someone to take the fall,

605
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,706
and claim it was all political maneuvering.

606
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:22,376
It's your specialty, isn't it?

607
00:46:23,182 --> 00:46:25,047
Then why did you start all this?

608
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:28,416
You may be able to dodge a couple of arrows.

609
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:32,387
But if dozens of arrows fly at you at the same time, what will you do?

610
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:33,857
It won't be easy.

611
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:36,927
This is just the beginning.

612
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:40,726
Tell me what you want from me.

613
00:46:41,772 --> 00:46:43,697
You even set up a special team...

614
00:46:43,972 --> 00:46:47,166
to check on the foundation members including Heo Joong Se.

615
00:46:47,711 --> 00:46:50,266
Hand over the files to me.

616
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:53,777
Then I'll give you a way out.

617
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:58,246
You'll give me a way out?

618
00:46:58,881 --> 00:47:01,846
Do you think I'll go down so easily?

619
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:05,587
You should know your place.

620
00:47:06,492 --> 00:47:07,657
Are you sure?

621
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:10,387
All right.

622
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:14,927
Call me if you change your mind.

623
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:50,197
Honey, are you okay?

624
00:47:50,841 --> 00:47:52,596
What do we do now?

625
00:47:53,001 --> 00:47:56,306
You're all over the news. Everyone's talking about you.

626
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:05,947
I'm sorry, Mom.

627
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:08,047
It's all my fault.

628
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:12,717
I'm sorry.

629
00:48:15,832 --> 00:48:17,757
Listen, both of you.

630
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:23,096
Never become weak.

631
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,797
If you become weak, you become a victim.

632
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:28,967
I'll stay strong until the end...

633
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:32,206
and make everyone kneel before me.

634
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:36,576
To think how I've struggled to get where I am...

635
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:40,576
Yes, honey. You can overcome this.

636
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,487
You're a strong person.

637
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,257
I'm sorry, Mom.

638
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:52,126
I know how you got where you are now.

639
00:48:52,801 --> 00:48:53,996
I'm sorry.

640
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:00,666
We must keep pushing her.

641
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,907
To achieve her ambition, she'd even betray her own child.

642
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:06,007
She won't give up easily.

643
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:11,146
Good that we went through her old investigation files.

644
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:14,617
Thank you, Judge Kim.

645
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:16,217
Don't mention it.

646
00:49:16,392 --> 00:49:19,817
You're the one who visited every single victim.

647
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:22,757
It's not over yet. We shouldn't relax.

648
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,357
What about the testimony from the prison warden? Did it go well?

649
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:28,927
Yes. He's very scared. He'll do as we say.

650
00:49:29,401 --> 00:49:31,666
I've talked to Cha Kyung Hee's secretary as well...

651
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:33,666
so that you can enter without anyone knowing.

652
00:49:34,142 --> 00:49:37,266
If everything goes as planned, she'll eventually go down.

653
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:40,237
That's when we should reach out.

654
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:43,476
We'll make her beg for our help.

655
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,376
Minister Cha is here.

656
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:52,921
Did you really hide Doh Young Choon away?

657
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:54,561
Did you really force someone to make a false statement?

658
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:57,286
- Do you admit to the charges? - Why did you do that?

659
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,726
- Can you say something? - Give us a comment!

660
00:50:00,801 --> 00:50:03,596
The truth will be found out by the prosecution.

661
00:50:04,542 --> 00:50:07,166
- Is everything true? - Tell us why you did that!

662
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:09,036
Minister Cha!

663
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:11,076
Give us a comment!

664
00:50:11,611 --> 00:50:13,306
- Minister Cha, please! - Minister Cha!

665
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:16,381
- Please say something! - Can you please explain yourself?

666
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,177
Tell us why, Minister Cha!

667
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:21,016
Please say something!

668
00:50:26,361 --> 00:50:29,360
Your broadcasting station is attacking me the most!

669
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:30,927
Are you out of your mind?

670
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,761
Goodness, Minister Cha.

671
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:36,126
Do you think reporters these days listen to what their superiors say?

672
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:39,596
Their journalistic spirit is driving me crazy too!

673
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:44,480
These little jerks!

674
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,936
Minister Cha. We're in trouble.

675
00:50:47,111 --> 00:50:48,306
What is it this time?

676
00:50:49,211 --> 00:50:53,221
The warden of the Southern Gyeonggi Prison made a confession...

677
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:55,351
in front of reporters about switching out a notorious conman...

678
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,860
due to the orders of Minister of Justice, Cha Kyung Hee.

679
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:00,291
Did the Minister of Justice order you to do this?

680
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:01,530
("Minister Cha ordered me to switch out Doh Young Choon.")

681
00:51:01,531 --> 00:51:04,087
Yes. Minister Cha Kyung Hee ordered me to do it.

682
00:51:04,301 --> 00:51:06,527
Were you bribed or blackmailed?

683
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:08,496
I'm sorry.

684
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:11,300
I couldn't endure the threats from Minister Cha.

685
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,670
That little punk.

686
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,271
He said he'd do anything as long as he was promoted.

687
00:51:16,272 --> 00:51:19,277
Even my business failed.

688
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:22,646
(Ministry of Justice)

689
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:26,646
Minister Cha, it's the chief of the Central Prosecutor's Office.

690
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:31,621
I think you should come to the District Prosecutors' Office.

691
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,321
- What? - There are...

692
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:35,090
twelve suits filed against you.

693
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,801
They're the defendants in the cases...

694
00:51:37,801 --> 00:51:39,061
you were in charge of and their families.

695
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:40,261
Blackmail, coercion,

696
00:51:40,262 --> 00:51:42,766
publicizing suspected crime, abuse of power...

697
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:44,637
The charges are quite severe.

698
00:51:46,441 --> 00:51:47,666
Listen here, Mr. Kim.

699
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:52,710
Did you forget who put you in that seat?

700
00:51:52,711 --> 00:51:54,137
I'm sorry, ma'am.

701
00:51:55,051 --> 00:51:59,317
I don't think this is something that I can just cover up.

702
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:02,286
What do you think about doing things as they should be done?

703
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:10,460
(Ministry of Justice)

704
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,927
Get the car ready.

705
00:52:12,401 --> 00:52:13,831
Where are you going to go?

706
00:52:13,832 --> 00:52:14,996
To the Blue House.

707
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:25,806
Why don't you have some? Do you not eat snacks?

708
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:28,181
How did things turn out this way?

709
00:52:28,182 --> 00:52:30,750
You were set to move in here in two years,

710
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:33,717
so how did things end up like this?

711
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,491
My wife and I were really careful with the furniture...

712
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:39,561
so that they wouldn't have any scratches on them...

713
00:52:39,562 --> 00:52:41,261
when you move in.

714
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:43,030
Let me get straight to the point.

715
00:52:43,031 --> 00:52:45,530
No, it's okay. You can give me the whole story,

716
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:48,070
from the beginning, middle, and end.

717
00:52:48,071 --> 00:52:50,797
We won't be seeing each other ever again, anyway.

718
00:52:53,401 --> 00:52:56,137
There's a file that I've been collecting.

719
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:04,076
A file?

720
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,916
It contains the information of slush funds from the last election,

721
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:10,416
and the reason why the Gwanghwamun demonstration turned into a riot.

722
00:53:14,162 --> 00:53:15,487
Gosh, this is...

723
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:18,701
You want to ruin the entire game.

724
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:20,300
Do you think...

725
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:23,326
someone who's about to be imprisoned can do something so big?

726
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:25,797
I'm not saying that I'm going to do it.

727
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:27,067
Then?

728
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,376
I'm going to give it to Kang Yo Han.

729
00:53:36,082 --> 00:53:38,250
If you don't want that to happen,

730
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:41,286
do whatever you can to stop all of this.

731
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:44,250
Whether that's calling the NIS or the military.

732
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:46,460
Hold on. Okay.

733
00:53:46,461 --> 00:53:49,027
Gosh, you're coming on strong.

734
00:53:49,162 --> 00:53:53,761
I have this strange handicap where I can't make big decisions on my own.

735
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:57,326
Hold on. Honey. Hey, honey!

736
00:53:59,301 --> 00:54:02,036
- Yes? - We have a guest.

737
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:04,237
Ms. Cha.

738
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:07,737
How could this happen to us?

739
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,351
What are you playing at right now?

740
00:54:11,352 --> 00:54:15,190
So from now on, I'm saying we should talk as parents.

741
00:54:15,191 --> 00:54:16,887
Young Min and Joon...

742
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:19,491
were best friends since they were kids.

743
00:54:19,492 --> 00:54:23,757
Right. Joon was really worried about Young Min...

744
00:54:24,231 --> 00:54:26,357
because he gets lonely easily,

745
00:54:26,832 --> 00:54:27,996
and he's sensitive.

746
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,596
What is it that you want to say?

747
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:38,706
Ms. Cha. Did you know?

748
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:40,576
He...

749
00:54:42,352 --> 00:54:45,516
has been using drugs since high school.

750
00:54:49,751 --> 00:54:51,690
When it comes to drugs, once you've tried it,

751
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:53,460
it's hard to quit.

752
00:54:53,461 --> 00:54:55,631
I looked into it, and Young Min...

753
00:54:55,631 --> 00:54:57,960
has been using all sorts of drugs.

754
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,460
He's been using a ton of drugs.

755
00:55:00,461 --> 00:55:04,396
That must be why he's been acting out.

756
00:55:05,941 --> 00:55:09,137
So what do you intend to do to Young Min?

757
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:11,206
What can we do?

758
00:55:11,312 --> 00:55:14,550
Korea is a constitutional nation, so we must do as the law says.

759
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:15,780
You know the law well.

760
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:18,550
Once he goes in, he'll be locked up for quite a while.

761
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:21,621
But will he be okay? Ever since he was young,

762
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:25,221
he has always been weak both physically and mentally.

763
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:26,956
I'm worried about him.

764
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:30,331
I heard that after he got flogged because of his mom,

765
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:32,427
he has become even weaker.

766
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,126
All mothers feel the same way.

767
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:39,036
Your self is what's most important.

768
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,166
Think about it carefully, Ms. Cha.

769
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:46,206
Honey, look at this. The cup looks like it'll break.

770
00:55:51,651 --> 00:55:54,376
Let go. Let go of it. It's about to break.

771
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,387
Minister Cha.

772
00:55:56,952 --> 00:55:59,916
Cool down and think about it rationally.

773
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:02,826
For the sake of your kid.

774
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:20,206
I guess your talk didn't go well.

775
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:30,146
Who are you?

776
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,087
Where's Secretary Kim?

777
00:56:33,162 --> 00:56:34,987
Secretary Kim quit.

778
00:56:38,631 --> 00:56:40,857
Who on earth are you, and why are you driving my car?

779
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:43,967
I assist Judge Kang Yo Han.

780
00:56:46,642 --> 00:56:48,436
This is your last chance.

781
00:56:49,512 --> 00:56:51,007
Have you made up your mind?

782
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,376
The only person who can stop all of this...

783
00:56:55,852 --> 00:56:57,777
is Judge Kang Yo Han.

784
00:57:05,961 --> 00:57:07,217
Have we...

785
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:10,326
met before?

786
00:57:10,832 --> 00:57:12,956
You look familiar.

787
00:57:17,772 --> 00:57:20,137
The assemblyman you investigated...

788
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,567
Do you remember him?

789
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:34,016
He was framed at the time and committed suicide.

790
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,016
I was in middle school at the time.

791
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,027
Is that so?

792
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:49,266
Did he have a son?

793
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:01,376
You resemble your father a lot.

794
00:58:22,772 --> 00:58:23,867
Who is it?

795
00:58:30,312 --> 00:58:32,110
(Cha Kyung Hee, Minister of Justice)

796
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:34,241
(Ministry of Justice)

797
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:37,846
I thought you might want to see me about now. Was I wrong?

798
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:47,757
Because of Doh Young Choon, the man you switched,

799
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,286
I lost my parents.

800
00:58:53,461 --> 00:58:57,266
Remorse, apologies. I don't expect any of that from you.

801
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,896
Cooperate with us...

802
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:03,766
so that we can catch bigger criminals.

803
00:59:13,952 --> 00:59:16,087
Are you saying you'd pardon me...

804
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:19,587
if I became a whistleblower or something?

805
00:59:20,762 --> 00:59:22,786
Do you have any other options?

806
01:00:06,901 --> 01:00:10,607
I'd like to think while I smoke one of these.

807
01:00:12,941 --> 01:00:15,076
Could you excuse me?

808
01:00:47,312 --> 01:00:50,947

809
01:00:52,222 --> 01:00:53,646
Can I see your ID?

810
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:56,952

812
01:00:59,091 --> 01:01:00,416
Thank you.

Young Min.

817
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:47,357
Come here.

818
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:50,096
Come closer.

819
01:03:00,881 --> 01:03:02,876
I'm so sorry, Mom.

820
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:05,476
I'm sorry.

821
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,416

We have to find the files first.

825
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:27,317
Raise your hands and step back.

826
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:34,826
Kang Yo Han?

(Ministry of Justice)

828
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,137
Step back.

829
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:56,547
You there. Stand up.

I want you to be lonely, Young Master.

834
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:05,917
Like me.

835
01:07:06,062 --> 01:07:08,461
Do you know how I feel helping Chief Kang?

836
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:10,032
Please leave Ga On alone.

837
01:07:10,032 --> 01:07:13,001
Yoon Soo Hyun. Cut her out of your life.

838
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:15,867
The foundation is still under threat.

839
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:19,567
I risk my title as Chief Justice and demand the live court be disbanded.

840
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:21,071
Go ahead with it.

841
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:22,812
She's planning something big.

842
01:07:22,812 --> 01:07:26,006
- Are you afraid? - Do you think this is a joke?

843
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,806
What is the meaning of this?

844
01:07:27,812 --> 01:07:30,907

No!
