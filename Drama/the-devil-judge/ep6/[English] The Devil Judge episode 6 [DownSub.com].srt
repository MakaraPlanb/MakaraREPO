00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,079
Wake up.

Elijah.

20
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,420
What's up at this early hour?

21
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,720
Yo-han is missing.

22
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
What?

23
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,090
I said, Yo-han is missing.

24
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,300
When I woke up, he was gone.

25
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,730
Where did he go?

26
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,610
Were you scared because he's gone?

27
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,640
-I didn't say I was scared.
-Maybe he's seeing his girlfriend.

28
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,520
He has never left this place.

29
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,089
Since that accident.

30
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,500
It's hot. Be careful.

31
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,909
This is stupid.

32
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,510
What kind of house has
such a lame heating system?

33
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,440
It's unnecessarily big.

34
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,250
Maybe you like Yo-han too, after all.

35
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,290
-What?
-Why not?

36
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,290
You helped him find the state prison.

37
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,320
I think you helped him
because you knew it was meaningful.

38
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,730
-It's fun.
-Fun?

39
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,730
Yes. Or perhaps,

40
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,130
cutting his junk might've been more fun.

41
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,700
You are his niece indeed.

42
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,170
Don't say stuff like that.

43
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,110
Yo-han

44
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,710
destroys everything around him.

45
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,350
And I don't want to be like him.

46
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,250
What do you mean?

47
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,220
Didn't our housekeeper tell you?

48
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,720
Yo-han has been like that
ever since he was young.

49
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:29,120
He made the maid who liked him
jump off from the second floor.

50
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,090
Look what happened to my dad

51
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
and me.

52
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,460
Old habits die hard.

53
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,390
You still don't know your place
and touch things that don't belong to you.

54
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,030
Gosh. Young Master.

55
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,960
You finally recognized me?

56
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,440
[Oh, my.]

57
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,010
This is just gorgeous.

58
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,710
I had no idea that
there was a world with so much beauty.

59
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,450
A world with only beautiful things.

60
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,250
Stay focused and just learn your tasks.

61
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,990
What do I have to do
to live in a world like this?

62
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,360
Do I have to be born again?

63
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,659
The chairman doesn't like chatty maids.

64
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,860
Unless you want to get kicked out,
learn to shut your mouth.

65
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,470
What about Young Master Yo-han?

66
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,070
I've never seen anyone
as beautiful and handsome as him.

67
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,870
How can someone like him
stay in the basement?

68
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,110
Be quiet!

69
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,250
Please have some food.

70
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
I prepared this meal for you.

71
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,120
Thanks.

72
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:13,760
You should come outside
when the chairman isn't home.

73
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,200
I can be on the lookout for you.

74
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,110
Do you like me?

75
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,880
Yes.

76
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,310
How much do you like me?

77
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,280
Pardon?

78
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,550
How much do you like me?

79
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,620
A lot. I like you very much.

80
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,150
Really?

81
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,060
Then, can you jump from here?

82
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,290
Pardon?

83
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,260
Can you do that for me?

84
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,870
Really?

85
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,880
Sun-ah.

86
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,540
You were too mean.

87
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,740
I really liked you.

88
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,780
Unbelievable.

89
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,710
The object of your love wasn't me.
It was something else.

90
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,330
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

91
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,990
Young Master Yo-han.

92
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you're caught,
it won't end well for you.

93
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,370
He doesn't forgive anyone.

94
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,640
Are you looking out for me?

95
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,210
You were worried about me, right?

96
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,880
I really like you.

97
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,780
But do you not like me?

98
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,590
This is odd.

99
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,730
Why do I get the feeling
some of our silverware is missing?

100
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,560
Really?

101
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,270
Actually, something
has been bothering me lately.

102
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,270
What is it?

103
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,070
I want to be very careful
bringing this up.

104
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,010
But I've seen Young Master Yo-han
walking around the house lately

105
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,880
when the chairman told him
not to leave the basement.

106
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,590
-Is that so?
-Yes, I'm worried about that.

107
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,820
Okay.

108
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,480
Not that.

109
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,150
That's the keepsake
from my brother's mother.

110
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,290
My brother cherishes that.

111
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,990
If you steal that,
I will tell them what I saw.

112
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,820
Gosh. I was just admiring it
because it was beautiful.

113
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,030
If I steal his late wife's things,
he will kill me.

114
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,550
Do you like me?

115
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,890
Then, can you jump from here?

116
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,680
What? Is that what happened?

117
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,010
You have such a good memory.
You are so smart, Young Master.

118
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,750
But I did like you.

119
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,420
I like everything that sparkles.

120
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,060
I've always had and still do.

121
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,130
Is that so?
I guess you've led a diligent life.

122
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,430
So are you stealing from the foundation

123
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,240
as you do menial jobs like a maid?

124
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,030
No. What you did was amazing.

125
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,470
After getting rid of your stupid brother,

126
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,070
you carried out his daughter
to avoid any suspicions

127
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,600
and became a hero.

128
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,880
It's impossible not to fall for you.

129
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,750
[Why do you think it was Yo-han's doing?]

130
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,120
[There must've been a reason.]

131
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,290
-His computer.
-His computer?

132
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,490
When I was 12,

133
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,700
I cracked down the security
and got into his computer for fun.

134
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,000
There was a hidden folder.

135
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,530
So I looked through the folder

136
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,700
and that's where it was.

137
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,110
The application to withdraw the donation.

138
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,210
And on top of that,
the application was originally filled out

139
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,050
a week before the fire.

140
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,490
To me,

141
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,660
he was the only family left.

142
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,390
To me...

143
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,350
This is enough
for our trip down memory lane.

144
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,650
Just get to the point.

145
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,660
Shall I?

146
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,320
Whether you want to play judge

147
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,230
or go after Cha Kyung-hee,

148
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,900
I don't care.

149
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,200
But I'd appreciate it if you could
stay away from the foundation.

150
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,930
You see, you're trying

151
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,970
to ruin a sheep farm that
so many people put a lot of work into.

152
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,910
The "Home of Dreams" thing?

153
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,010
I suppose that project has "a sparkle"
that entices you.

154
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,150
You know, we're pretty similar.

155
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,780
If we don't encroach on each other's turf,

156
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,480
we can do a lot of fun things--

157
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,050
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

158
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,190
Wasting time like this.

159
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,120
It might be best
to just go ahead and kill me

160
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,660
when you have the chance.

161
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
That's quicker.

162
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
I say that because

163
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,160
I know you won't be able
to get me like this ever again.

164
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,730
If you're going to keep this up...

165
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,270
Threats are pointless

166
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,470
because I have nothing

167
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,070
I wish to protect.

168
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,710
Is that so?

169
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,320
What a pity.

170
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,910
What's with that reaction?
You're the one who injected it.

171
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,980
Syringes scare me more than anything.

172
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,220
Sure, whatever.

173
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,290
Jae-hee.

174
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,330
Take him back to his home.

175
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,660
What?

176
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,430
As he said,
why don't you just finish him off here?

177
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,600
No.

178
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,670
A herding dog needs a wolf.

179
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,600
The more Kang Yo-han acts up,

180
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,870
the more those old geezers
at the foundation will rely on me.

181
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,210
But this guy is too fearless, I must say.

182
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,790
You have nothing you wish to protect?

183
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,540
There's no such person.

184
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,000
Mr. Kang, where were you last night?

185
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,440
Are you prying into my private life now?

186
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,040
I was with a rough lady.
Do you want to hear all about it?

187
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,880
She grabbed me by the hair and kissed--

188
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,950
Jeez, I don't want to hear it.

189
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,310
Ga-on.

190
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,080
Yes?

191
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,280
Can you open that for me?

192
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,650
What?

193
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,650
Open that for me.

194
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,690
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:28,890
-This one?
-Yes.

196
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,430
Instant noodles for breakfast?

197
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,030
Add hot water and bring it to me.

198
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,060
Elijah.

199
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,130
What? What about my noodles?

200
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,740
No instant noodles for you.
Let's have some real food.

201
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,010
"Real food"?

202
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,710
Mr. Kang, come and eat.

203
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,580
Why did you cook out of the blue?

204
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,550
I've given up on you people.

205
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,180
Let's eat like normal people do.

206
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,220
I cooked because you're letting me stay.

207
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,490
Come on, let's eat. Hurry up, Mr. Kang!

208
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,730
Gosh, what's with him today?

209
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,130
No one asked him to cook.
He should just mind his own business.

210
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,970
But I see that you're smiling.

211
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,370
No, I'm not.

212
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,770
What? I don't like that look on your face.

213
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm just fascinated, that's all.

214
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,410
Fascinated by what?

215
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,950
Why can't you take your eyes off Ga-on?

216
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,720
-When did I--
-Hurry!

217
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,320
-I'm coming!
-"I'm coming!"

218
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,160
Seriously! Do you have a death wish?

219
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,600
You call this a simple meal?

220
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,840
Should I order more salmon
in advance, Master Ga-on?

221
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,110
Yes, some celery too.

222
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,040
"Master Ga-on"?

223
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,810
But this is Korean food.

224
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Don't you like it?

225
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,380
I must've been a royal taster
or something in my past life.

226
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,720
I really hate Korean food.

227
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,820
I bet I died after eating
something poisonous.

228
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,790
Okay. Don't eat it if you don't want to.

229
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,560
I shall taste it and see
how awful your cooking is.

230
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,200
There's no poison in it.

231
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:01,340
Dig in.

232
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,310
Like I told you before,
I have a dull palate.

233
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,380
I just chew and swallow.

234
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,730
You must really have a dull palate.

235
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes.

236
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,530
Have some more.

237
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,740
By the way,
why are you suddenly doing this?

238
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,010
I told you.

239
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,840
I should do something to earn my keep.

240
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,980
Let me just say this in advance.

241
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,050
I do not accept pity.

242
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,610
I can't afford to pity anyone now.

243
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,080
Do you want some fruit?
Tell me if you need anything.

244
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Okay.

245
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,690
Where did you learn to cook?

246
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,960
-I didn't "learn" it.
-Then what?

247
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,830
I was a restaurant owner's son
for 16 years

248
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,930
and lived on my own for 13 years.

249
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,260
If your parents own a restaurant,

250
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,830
you're still a restaurant owner's son.

251
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:01,400
Did they close the restaurant?

252
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,980
Some stuff happened.

253
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Have some kiwi.

254
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,880
What is all this?

255
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,780
Young Master Yo-han.

256
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,660
This joyful vibe does not suit this house.

257
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
What is going on here?

258
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,930
Young Master Yo-han.

259
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,230
You don't even touch the food that I make.

260
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,830
Ms. Ji, I put aside some food for you.

261
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,170
Elijah.

262
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,880
You're still up, right?

263
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,450
Yes, I'm trying to digest the food.

264
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,580
It didn't taste bad,

265
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,850
but I'm not the type to eat a lot at once.

266
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,820
Is that right?
That was a week's worth of food.

267
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,460
Stop overexaggerating.

268
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,330
-Do you have time tomorrow?
-What?

269
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,830
I don't know, I'll have to check.

270
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,400
Why?

271
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,100
If you're okay with it,
I'd like you to meet someone.

272
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,370
I see.

273
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,610
With someone else?

274
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,550
Who is it?

275
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,680
-My friend.
-Friend?

276
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,430
Hello!

277
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,530
You're here. Sit on the inside.

278
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,470
Hello, Elijah.

279
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,500
I'm...

280
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,870
Just call me Yoon Soo-hyun.

281
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,240
I've heard a lot about you from Ga-on.

282
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,840
He's certainly not the type
to care about others so much.

283
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,580
Don't twist the truth like that.

284
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,910
What are you two?

285
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,320
Why do you ask?

286
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,950
We're friends. Didn't Ga-on tell you?

287
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,020
No, he didn't.

288
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,890
He didn't tell me
that his friend was so beautiful.

289
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,630
-You think she's pretty?
-Why are you laughing?

290
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,830
Elijah, you're so much prettier than I am.

291
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,830
I know.

292
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,040
I'm sorry I overreacted,

293
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,270
but I thought it'd be nice for you
to have a big sister.

294
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,810
Do you mind if I drop the honorific
so that we can get closer?

295
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,610
Or you can call me big sister.

296
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,780
That sounds great.

297
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,120
-No, thanks.
-Sorry?

298
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm not a little kid anymore.

299
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,450
In just 4 years, I'll be 20.

300
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,120
Right.

301
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,790
Okay, then.

302
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,960
Where's Elijah?

303
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,630
I haven't seen her either.

304
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,070
Do you have the file that you found
on his computer?

305
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,750
-No.
-Soo-hyun,

306
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,180
why do you ask?

307
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,520
Just in case.

308
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,950
Elijah,

309
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,820
you know that donating
all your wealth is a lot.

310
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,660
He could've canceled it for you,

311
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,760
and the date encoded on the computer file

312
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,030
-could be wrong.
-No, I'd like to confirm everything.

313
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,680
-Mr. Kang.
-Come here.

314
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,350
Don't you know
that this can be considered kidnapping?

315
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,550
Please stop, Mr. Kang.

316
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,950
I won't sit still
if you lay a finger on her,

317
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,580
whoever it is.

318
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,330
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

319
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,660
I'm fine too.

320
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,800
[285 S 7511]

321
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,600
-I'm not getting in.
-Don't be a kid.

322
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,740
I won't get in!

323
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,070
I said, don't act like a kid!

324
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,410
Am I a toy to you?

325
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,010
Do I look like a pushover
because I'm sitting in a wheelchair?

326
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,120
Did you have to humiliate me?

327
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
Elijah.

328
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,530
What are you doing? Just go.

329
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,910
I'm going to do it myself.

330
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,040
[285 S 7511]

331
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,780
I'll pour you a glass.

332
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,350
-Oh, my.
-I'm going to get drunk.

333
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,780
Why not?

334
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,750
How are boys these days so pretty?

335
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,520
Isn't it great?

336
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,720
It's the best!

337
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,530
-Hey! Come here.
-Yes, ma'am.

338
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,190
-Okay.
-And you're an idol singer?

339
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,560
Yes, I am.

340
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,630
I've brought you a present.

341

-Where is it?
-A present?

342
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,900
Here it is!

343
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,570
Where did you learn to do such a thing?

344
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,340
-It's my love for you.
-You're so funny.

345
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,010
Stop it!

346
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,640
He's totally my type.

00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,930
Go.

357
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,080

Get ready to head to the Prosecution.

00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,270
What?

363
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,170
What happened?

364
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,510
The shantytown
for the second Home of Dreams Town.

365
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,280
You've used other names
to buy a lot of the properties there.

366
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,580
This project is for the country.

367
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,250
It's not for you to take
private information

368
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,680
and make money for yourselves.

369
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,620
You've gone too far.

370
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,820
-Kyung-hee.
-Please, Kyung-hee.

371
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,320
We're closer than that.

372
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,430
If you have a grudge against us,
please let it slide.

373
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,760
We just thought

374
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,670
you were having a hard time
because of Young-min.

375
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,370
That's why we haven't been
calling you as often.

376
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,200
Our Young-min!

377
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,540
-Have fun.
-We mean it!

378
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,110
-Sure.
-Kyung-hee!

-Kyung-hee!

382
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Oh, no!

383
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,650
If we get exposed,

384
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,820
we'll be left with nothing

385
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,730
and be totally crushed!

386
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,060
We ran so many fundraisers
for the Home of Dreams projects!

387
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,560
-My head hurts.
-Seriously.

388
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,870
Ms. Jung!

389
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,740
-What do we do?
-Is there a way?

390
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,080
It seems like Ms. Cha feels left out

391
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,110
from the foundation.

392
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,010
You think so, right?

393
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,650
Only Mr. Seo would be able to solve this

394
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,520
as she's angered
by how the foundation is run.

395
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:16,860
Ms. Jung,

396
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:20,190
-please give her good words for me.
-Yes.

397
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,400
I'll donate all the properties

398
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,370
to the foundation.

399
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,470
All of it?

400
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,540
Do you want to go to the Prosecution
with your husband?

401
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,170
Cha Kyung-hee is ready to fight right now!

402
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,140
Fine.

403
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,310
We'll donate everything as well.

404
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:38,980
Please let her know.

405
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,650
I'll do my best.

406
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,390
It's you two, after all.

407
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,190
Thank you, Sun-ah!

408
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,430
[Is that enough?]

409
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:58,000
Yes. Mr. Seo will be satisfied too.

410
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,840
By the way, who is the real Mr. Seo?

411
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,310
The old man who disappears
all the time because he has to pray?

412
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:09,909
Or...

413
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,250
Does that matter?

414
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:19,949
I guess it doesn't.

415
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,120
Just make sure to stop Kang Yo-han.

416
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,020
You said you would.

417
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,960
[I'll protect you.]

418
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,730
I promise.

419
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,940
Just please stop us from being summoned.

420
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,010
My husband looks tough on the outside,

421
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,770
but in fact, he's very timid.

422
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,340
He has angina,

423
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:45,010
so he might get in serious trouble
while talking to the police.

424
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,980
My husband is the same.

425
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,610
He's scared of cameras,

426
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,449
so he might get a panic attack
in front of all the reporters.

427
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,719
Don't worry. I won't make that happen.

428
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,560
We have Mr. Seo, remember?

429
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,930
Please wait for the time being.

430
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,060
Ms. Jung. I'm counting on you.

431
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,400
Let us know if you need anything.

432
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,100
-I will.
-We can do anything.

433
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,270
Okay.

-No problem.

443
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,230

of hurting Soo-hyun...

Look, Judge Kang. You know this
better than anybody else does.

746

In the court of public opinion,

747
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,480

than evidence.

749

You tormented the others
and made them suffer.

755

and do whatever you want.

Did you say "scam"?

772
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,290
A judge bribed a witness.

773
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,560
Doesn't that make the trial
a complete scam?

774
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,290
It's a one-sided claim.

775
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,160
First, please give me a chance
to reveal the truth.

776
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,360
Public opinion played a huge role
in that trial.

777
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,040
The law and the legal principles
weren't the only factors at play.

A boomerang always returns back
to the person who throws it.

779
