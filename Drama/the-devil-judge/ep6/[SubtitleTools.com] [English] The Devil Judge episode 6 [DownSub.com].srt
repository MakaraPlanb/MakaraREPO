20
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,420
What's up at this early hour?

21
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,720
Yo-han is missing.

22
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,060
What?

23
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,090
I said, Yo-han is missing.

24
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,300
When I woke up, he was gone.

25
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,730
Where did he go?

26
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,610
Were you scared because he's gone?

27
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,640
-I didn't say I was scared.
-Maybe he's seeing his girlfriend.

28
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,520
He has never left this place.

29
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,089
Since that accident.

30
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,500
It's hot. Be careful.

31
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,909
This is stupid.

32
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,510
What kind of house has
such a lame heating system?

33
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,440
It's unnecessarily big.

34
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,250
Maybe you like Yo-han too, after all.

35
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,290
-What?
-Why not?

36
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,290
You helped him find the state prison.

37
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,320
I think you helped him
because you knew it was meaningful.

38
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,730
-It's fun.
-Fun?

39
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,730
Yes. Or perhaps,

40
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,130
cutting his junk might've been more fun.

41
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,700
You are his niece indeed.

42
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,170
Don't say stuff like that.

43
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,110
Yo-han

44
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,710
destroys everything around him.

45
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,350
And I don't want to be like him.

46
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,250
What do you mean?

47
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,220
Didn't our housekeeper tell you?

48
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,720
Yo-han has been like that
ever since he was young.

49
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,120
He made the maid who liked him
jump off from the second floor.

50
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,090
Look what happened to my dad

51
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
and me.

52
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,460
Old habits die hard.

53
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,390
You still don't know your place
and touch things that don't belong to you.

54
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,030
Gosh. Young Master.

55
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,960
You finally recognized me?

56
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,440
[Oh, my.]

57
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,010
This is just gorgeous.

58
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,710
I had no idea that
there was a world with so much beauty.

59
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,450
A world with only beautiful things.

60
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,250
Stay focused and just learn your tasks.

61
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,990
What do I have to do
to live in a world like this?

62
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,360
Do I have to be born again?

63
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,659
The chairman doesn't like chatty maids.

64
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,860
Unless you want to get kicked out,
learn to shut your mouth.

65
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,470
What about Young Master Yo-han?

66
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,070
I've never seen anyone
as beautiful and handsome as him.

67
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,870
How can someone like him
stay in the basement?

68
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,110
Be quiet!

69
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,250
Please have some food.

70
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
I prepared this meal for you.

71
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,120
Thanks.

72
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,760
You should come outside
when the chairman isn't home.

73
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,200
I can be on the lookout for you.

74
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,110
Do you like me?

75
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,880
Yes.

76
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,310
How much do you like me?

77
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,280
Pardon?

78
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,550
How much do you like me?

79
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,620
A lot. I like you very much.

80
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,150
Really?

81
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,060
Then, can you jump from here?

82
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,290
Pardon?

83
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,260
Can you do that for me?

84
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,870
Really?

85
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,880
Sun-ah.

86
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,540
You were too mean.

87
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,740
I really liked you.

88
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,780
Unbelievable.

89
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,710
The object of your love wasn't me.
It was something else.

90
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,330
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

91
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,990
Young Master Yo-han.

92
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you're caught,
it won't end well for you.

93
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,370
He doesn't forgive anyone.

94
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,640
Are you looking out for me?

95
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,210
You were worried about me, right?

96
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,880
I really like you.

97
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,780
But do you not like me?

98
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,590
This is odd.

99
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,730
Why do I get the feeling
some of our silverware is missing?

100
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,560
Really?

101
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,270
Actually, something
has been bothering me lately.

102
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,270
What is it?

103
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,070
I want to be very careful
bringing this up.

104
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,010
But I've seen Young Master Yo-han
walking around the house lately

105
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,880
when the chairman told him
not to leave the basement.

106
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,590
-Is that so?
-Yes, I'm worried about that.

107
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,820
Okay.

108
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,480
Not that.

109
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,150
That's the keepsake
from my brother's mother.

110
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,290
My brother cherishes that.

111
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,990
If you steal that,
I will tell them what I saw.

112
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,820
Gosh. I was just admiring it
because it was beautiful.

113
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,030
If I steal his late wife's things,
he will kill me.

114
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,550
Do you like me?

115
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,890
Then, can you jump from here?

116
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,680
What? Is that what happened?

117
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,010
You have such a good memory.
You are so smart, Young Master.

118
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:51,750
But I did like you.

119
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:56,420
I like everything that sparkles.

120
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,060
I've always had and still do.

121
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,130
Is that so?
I guess you've led a diligent life.

122
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,430
So are you stealing from the foundation

123
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,240
as you do menial jobs like a maid?

124
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,030
No. What you did was amazing.

125
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,470
After getting rid of your stupid brother,

126
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,070
you carried out his daughter
to avoid any suspicions

127
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,600
and became a hero.

128
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,880
It's impossible not to fall for you.

129
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,750
[Why do you think it was Yo-han's doing?]

130
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,120
[There must've been a reason.]

131
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,290
-His computer.
-His computer?

132
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,490
When I was 12,

133
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,700
I cracked down the security
and got into his computer for fun.

134
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
There was a hidden folder.

135
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,530
So I looked through the folder

136
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,700
and that's where it was.

137
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,110
The application to withdraw the donation.

138
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,210
And on top of that,
the application was originally filled out

139
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,050
a week before the fire.

140
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,490
To me,

141
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,660
he was the only family left.

142
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,390
To me...

143
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,350
This is enough
for our trip down memory lane.

144
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,650
Just get to the point.

145
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,660
Shall I?

146
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,320
Whether you want to play judge

147
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,230
or go after Cha Kyung-hee,

148
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,900
I don't care.

149
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
But I'd appreciate it if you could
stay away from the foundation.

150
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,930
You see, you're trying

151
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,970
to ruin a sheep farm that
so many people put a lot of work into.

152
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,910
The "Home of Dreams" thing?

153
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,010
I suppose that project has "a sparkle"
that entices you.

154
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,150
You know, we're pretty similar.

155
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,780
If we don't encroach on each other's turf,

156
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,480
we can do a lot of fun things--

157
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,050
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

158
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,190
Wasting time like this.

159
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,120
It might be best
to just go ahead and kill me

160
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,660
when you have the chance.

161
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,720
That's quicker.

162
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,560
I say that because

163
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,160
I know you won't be able
to get me like this ever again.

164
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,730
If you're going to keep this up...

165
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,270
Threats are pointless

166
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,470
because I have nothing

167
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,070
I wish to protect.

168
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,710
Is that so?

169
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,320
What a pity.

170
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,910
What's with that reaction?
You're the one who injected it.

171
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,980
Syringes scare me more than anything.

172
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,220
Sure, whatever.

173
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,290
Jae-hee.

174
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,330
Take him back to his home.

175
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,660
What?

176
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,430
As he said,
why don't you just finish him off here?

177
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,600
No.

178
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,670
A herding dog needs a wolf.

179
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,600
The more Kang Yo-han acts up,

180
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,870
the more those old geezers
at the foundation will rely on me.

181
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:10,210
But this guy is too fearless, I must say.

182
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,790
You have nothing you wish to protect?

183
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,540
There's no such person.

184
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,000
Mr. Kang, where were you last night?

185
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,440
Are you prying into my private life now?

186
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,040
I was with a rough lady.
Do you want to hear all about it?

187
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,880
She grabbed me by the hair and kissed--

188
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,950
Jeez, I don't want to hear it.

189
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,310
Ga-on.

190
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,080
Yes?

191
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,280
Can you open that for me?

192
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,650
What?

193
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,650
Open that for me.

194
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,690
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,890
-This one?
-Yes.

196
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,430
Instant noodles for breakfast?

197
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,030
Add hot water and bring it to me.

198
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,060
Elijah.

199
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,130
What? What about my noodles?

200
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,740
No instant noodles for you.
Let's have some real food.

201
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,010
"Real food"?

202
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,710
Mr. Kang, come and eat.

203
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:35,580
Why did you cook out of the blue?

204
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,550
I've given up on you people.

205
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,180
Let's eat like normal people do.

206
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,220
I cooked because you're letting me stay.

207
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,490
Come on, let's eat. Hurry up, Mr. Kang!

208
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,730
Gosh, what's with him today?

209
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,130
No one asked him to cook.
He should just mind his own business.

210
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,970
But I see that you're smiling.

211
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,370
No, I'm not.

212
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,770
What? I don't like that look on your face.

213
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,640
I'm just fascinated, that's all.

214
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,410
Fascinated by what?

215
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,950
Why can't you take your eyes off Ga-on?

216
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,720
-When did I--
-Hurry!

217
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,320
-I'm coming!
-"I'm coming!"

218
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,160
Seriously! Do you have a death wish?

219
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,600
You call this a simple meal?

220
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,840
Should I order more salmon
in advance, Master Ga-on?

221
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,110
Yes, some celery too.

222
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,040
"Master Ga-on"?

223
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,810
But this is Korean food.

224
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
Don't you like it?

225
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,380
I must've been a royal taster
or something in my past life.

226
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,720
I really hate Korean food.

227
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,820
I bet I died after eating
something poisonous.

228
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,790
Okay. Don't eat it if you don't want to.

229
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,560
I shall taste it and see
how awful your cooking is.

230
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,200
There's no poison in it.

231
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,340
Dig in.

232
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,310
Like I told you before,
I have a dull palate.

233
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,380
I just chew and swallow.

234
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,730
You must really have a dull palate.

235
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,800
Yes.

236
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,530
Have some more.

237
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,740
By the way,
why are you suddenly doing this?

238
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,010
I told you.

239
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,840
I should do something to earn my keep.

240
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,980
Let me just say this in advance.

241
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,050
I do not accept pity.

242
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,610
I can't afford to pity anyone now.

243
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,080
Do you want some fruit?
Tell me if you need anything.

244
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Okay.

245
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,690
Where did you learn to cook?

246
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,960
-I didn't "learn" it.
-Then what?

247
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,830
I was a restaurant owner's son
for 16 years

248
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,930
and lived on my own for 13 years.

249
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,260
If your parents own a restaurant,

250
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,830
you're still a restaurant owner's son.

251
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,400
Did they close the restaurant?

252
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,980
Some stuff happened.

253
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Have some kiwi.

254
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,880
What is all this?

255
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,780
Young Master Yo-han.

256
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,660
This joyful vibe does not suit this house.

257
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
What is going on here?

258
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,930
Young Master Yo-han.

259
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:42,230
You don't even touch the food that I make.

260
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,830
Ms. Ji, I put aside some food for you.

261
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,170
Elijah.

262
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,880
You're still up, right?

263
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,450
Yes, I'm trying to digest the food.

264
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,580
It didn't taste bad,

265
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,850
but I'm not the type to eat a lot at once.

266
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,820
Is that right?
That was a week's worth of food.

267
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,460
Stop overexaggerating.

268
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,330
-Do you have time tomorrow?
-What?

269
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:19,830
I don't know, I'll have to check.

270
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,400
Why?

271
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,100
If you're okay with it,
I'd like you to meet someone.

272
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,370
I see.

273
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,610
With someone else?

274
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,550
Who is it?

275
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,680
-My friend.
-Friend?

276
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,430
Hello!

277
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,530
You're here. Sit on the inside.

278
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,470
Hello, Elijah.

279
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,500
I'm...

280
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,870
Just call me Yoon Soo-hyun.

281
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,240
I've heard a lot about you from Ga-on.

282
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,840
He's certainly not the type
to care about others so much.

283
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,580
Don't twist the truth like that.

284
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:06,910
What are you two?

285
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,320
Why do you ask?

286
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,950
We're friends. Didn't Ga-on tell you?

287
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,020
No, he didn't.

288
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,890
He didn't tell me
that his friend was so beautiful.

289
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,630
-You think she's pretty?
-Why are you laughing?

290
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,830
Elijah, you're so much prettier than I am.

291
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,830
I know.

292
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,040
I'm sorry I overreacted,

293
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,270
but I thought it'd be nice for you
to have a big sister.

294
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,810
Do you mind if I drop the honorific
so that we can get closer?

295
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,610
Or you can call me big sister.

296
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,780
That sounds great.

297
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,120
-No, thanks.
-Sorry?

298
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm not a little kid anymore.

299
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,450
In just 4 years, I'll be 20.

300
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,120
Right.

301
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,790
Okay, then.

302
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,960
Where's Elijah?

303
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,630
I haven't seen her either.

304
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,070
Do you have the file that you found
on his computer?

305
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,750
-No.
-Soo-hyun,

306
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,180
why do you ask?

307
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,520
Just in case.

308
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,950
Elijah,

309
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,820
you know that donating
all your wealth is a lot.

310
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,660
He could've canceled it for you,

311
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,760
and the date encoded on the computer file

312
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,030
-could be wrong.
-No, I'd like to confirm everything.

313
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,680
-Mr. Kang.
-Come here.

314
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,350
Don't you know
that this can be considered kidnapping?

315
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,550
Please stop, Mr. Kang.

316
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,950
I won't sit still
if you lay a finger on her,

317
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,580
whoever it is.

318
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,330
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

319
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,660
I'm fine too.

320
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,800
[285 S 7511]

321
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,600
-I'm not getting in.
-Don't be a kid.

322
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,740
I won't get in!

323
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,070
I said, don't act like a kid!

324
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,410
Am I a toy to you?

325
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,010
Do I look like a pushover
because I'm sitting in a wheelchair?

326
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,120
Did you have to humiliate me?

327
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Elijah.

328
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,530
What are you doing? Just go.

329
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,910
I'm going to do it myself.

330
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,040
[285 S 7511]

331
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,780
I'll pour you a glass.

332
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,350
-Oh, my.
-I'm going to get drunk.

333
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,780
Why not?

334
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,750
How are boys these days so pretty?

335
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,520
Isn't it great?

336
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,720
It's the best!

337
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,530
-Hey! Come here.
-Yes, ma'am.

338
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,190
-Okay.
-And you're an idol singer?

339
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,560
Yes, I am.

340
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,630
I've brought you a present.

341
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,500
-Where is it?
-A present?

342
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:20,900
Here it is!

343
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,570
Where did you learn to do such a thing?

344
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,340
-It's my love for you.
-You're so funny.

345
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,010
Stop it!

346
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,640
He's totally my type.

-Ladies.
-Let's...

-Today we...

-Give me a moment.
-Sure.

My goodness.

356
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,930
Go.

357
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,080
Have a seat.

Get ready to head to the Prosecution.

00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,270
What?

363
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,170
What happened?

364
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,510
The shantytown
for the second Home of Dreams Town.

365
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,280
You've used other names
to buy a lot of the properties there.

366
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,580
This project is for the country.

367
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,250
It's not for you to take
private information

368
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,680
and make money for yourselves.

369
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,620
You've gone too far.

370
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,820
-Kyung-hee.
-Please, Kyung-hee.

371
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:23,320
We're closer than that.

372
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,430
If you have a grudge against us,
please let it slide.

373
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,760
We just thought

374
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,670
you were having a hard time
because of Young-min.

375
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:34,370
That's why we haven't been
calling you as often.

376
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,200
Our Young-min!

377
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,540
-Have fun.
-We mean it!

378
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,110
-Sure.
-Kyung-hee!

-Minister?
-Kyung-hee!

382
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,880
Oh, no!

383
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,650
If we get exposed,

384
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,820
we'll be left with nothing

385
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,730
and be totally crushed!

386
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,060
We ran so many fundraisers
for the Home of Dreams projects!

387
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,560
-My head hurts.
-Seriously.

388
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,870
Ms. Jung!

389
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,740
-What do we do?
-Is there a way?

390
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,080
It seems like Ms. Cha feels left out

391
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,110
from the foundation.

392
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,010
You think so, right?

393
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,650
Only Mr. Seo would be able to solve this

394
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,520
as she's angered
by how the foundation is run.

395
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,860
Ms. Jung,

396
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,190
-please give her good words for me.
-Yes.

397
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,400
I'll donate all the properties

398
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,370
to the foundation.

399
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,470
All of it?

400
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,540
Do you want to go to the Prosecution
with your husband?

401
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,170
Cha Kyung-hee is ready to fight right now!

402
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,140
Fine.

403
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,310
We'll donate everything as well.

404
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,980
Please let her know.

405
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,650
I'll do my best.

406
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,390
It's you two, after all.

407
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,190
Thank you, Sun-ah!

408
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,430
[Is that enough?]

409
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,000
Yes. Mr. Seo will be satisfied too.

410
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,840
By the way, who is the real Mr. Seo?

411
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,310
The old man who disappears
all the time because he has to pray?

412
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,909
Or...

413
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:28,250
Does that matter?

414
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:32,949
I guess it doesn't.

415
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,120
Just make sure to stop Kang Yo-han.

416
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,020
You said you would.

417
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,960
[I'll protect you.]

418
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:44,730
I promise.

419
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:49,940
Just please stop us from being summoned.

420
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,010
My husband looks tough on the outside,

421
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,770
but in fact, he's very timid.

422
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,340
He has angina,

423
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,010
so he might get in serious trouble
while talking to the police.

424
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,980
My husband is the same.

425
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,610
He's scared of cameras,

426
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,449
so he might get a panic attack
in front of all the reporters.

427
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,719
Don't worry. I won't make that happen.

428
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,560
We have Mr. Seo, remember?

429
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,930
Please wait for the time being.

430
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,060
Ms. Jung. I'm counting on you.

431
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,400
Let us know if you need anything.

432
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,100
-I will.
-We can do anything.

433
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,270
Okay.

434
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,040
-Thank you so much.
-No problem.

All right.

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,250
really has nothing to protect.

441
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,490

[She was totally crazy.]

443
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,230

of hurting Soo-hyun...

Look, Judge Kang. You know this
better than anybody else does.

746
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,780
In the court of public opinion,

747
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,480

than evidence.

Am I wrong?

749

You tormented the others
and made them suffer.

755
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,080
I'm surprised to hear all this

761

and do whatever you want.

768
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,850

Did you say "scam"?

772
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,290
A judge bribed a witness.

773
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,560
Doesn't that make the trial
a complete scam?

774
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:01,290
It's a one-sided claim.

775
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,160
First, please give me a chance
to reveal the truth.

776
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:06,360
Public opinion played a huge role
in that trial.

777
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,040
The law and the legal principles
weren't the only factors at play.

778

A boomerang always returns back
to the person who throws it.

779

The public is impatient and cruel.

780
