(Viewer discretion is advised.)

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,969
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,304
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,514
Why did the police arrest Yo Han?

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,114
What on earth is going on?

7
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:42,595
Why aren't you saying anything? What is it?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,934
Did Yo Han really do it? The church fire.

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,004
Did he really kill my mom and dad?

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,775
No, Elijah. That's not true.

11
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:09,814
It's all my fault.

12
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,525
I was stupid enough to be fooled by them.

13
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:20,225
I told the police that Yo Han killed Soo Hyun.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,135
What?

15
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,104
I'll fix it no matter what.

16
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:30,204
I'll bring Yo Han back by all means.

17
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:32,975
I'll even risk my life.

18
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,684
Why... Why did you do that?

19
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,154
Why? Tell me.

20
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,654
I'm sorry, Elijah.

21
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,225
Why did you do that? Why?

22
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,184
Ms. Ji.

23
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,955
Please stay with Elijah at all times.

24
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,555
What about you?

25
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,034
Why did you want to see me in the middle of the night?

26
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,865
So are you saying...

27
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,179
Judge Kang has nothing to do with Lieutenant Yoon's death,

28
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,378
and it's all Ms. Jung's doing,

29
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,775
the Board Chairman of Social Responsibility Foundation?

30
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,045
That's right.

31
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,485
All right. I see.

32
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,058
That's an interesting claim,

33
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,389
but as you probably know,

34
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,654
we can't take action unless we have enough evidence.

35
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:00,964
Wait a second.

36
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,805
I accused Kang Yo Han of something he didn't do.

37
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:08,404
Is that right?

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,434
Are you saying you made a false accusation?

39
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,605
Yes.

40
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:15,775
I falsely accused him with malicious intent.

41
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:19,088
He got away with tampering with the trial by using public opinion.

42
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:21,348
I wanted to make sure he gets punished.

43
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:24,214
That's why I tampered with evidence...

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,884
and falsely accused him.

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,525
Arrest me.

46
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,325
Sir, please don't get so worked up.

47
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:38,438
Go home, have a good night's sleep,

48
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:39,865
and give it some thought.

49
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,805
The case is already closed. There's no point in doing this.

50
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,844
I guess you already received an order from the higher-ups.

51
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,615
I might have to report you for dereliction of duty.

52
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,784
I'll talk to the press as well.

53
00:03:57,289 --> 00:03:58,555
Go ahead.

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,925
Oh, let me remind you of something.

55
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,564
A state of national emergency has been declared.

56
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:08,669
Under the emergency law, the press can't report anything...

57
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,265
without the government's permission.

58
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,404
But go ahead and try.

59
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:16,504
Who knows you'll find a company crazy enough to report it?

60
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:46,704
Kang Yo Han!

61
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,975
Kang Yo Han is here!

62
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,774
Welcome, punk. I missed you.

63
00:04:52,609 --> 00:04:54,048
You're never going to leave this place.

64
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:57,045
Why? Because I'll kill you!

65
00:04:57,179 --> 00:05:00,944
I'll kill you with my own hands, okay?

66
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,785
This place will be your grave!

67
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,988
We have shocking news.

68
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,129
Judge Kang of the live court show was arrested last night...

69
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,798
for aiding and abetting a murder...

70
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,999
and is being held in custody at Jungbu Detention Center.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,298
The investigation revealed that the victim is...

72
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,338
Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun from RIU.

73
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,510
I can't believe this.

74
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,370
Judge Kang Yo Han was arrested without a warrant.

75
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,510
Judge Kang has been loved by the people...

76
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,805
running the live court show.

77
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,049
But now that Judge Kang is accused of murder by proxy,

78
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,944
it seems he'll face a public outcry.

79
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,250
You're the one who put Kang Yo Han...

80
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,954
in charge of the live court show, sir.

81
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,814
He fabricated the trials.

82
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,760
And he's arrested for solicitation to commit murder.

83
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,225
My goodness, Chief Justice Min.

84
00:06:15,429 --> 00:06:17,295
How would I have known that?

85
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,599
And it wasn't me who wanted to put him in charge.

86
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,634
Are you saying it's not your responsibility?

87
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,434
Chief Justice Min.

88
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,165
Don't insult the judiciary anymore.

89
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,405
Now make a decision.

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,754
You're here.

91
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,405
Didn't you say you'll resign?

92
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,105
I'm here because someone has to clean up the mess.

93
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,814
I don't avoid taking responsibility.

94
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,715
How shameless you have become.

95
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,514
What about Soo Hyun?

96
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,024
Did you really let Soo Hyun die?

97
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,295
Just to put Kang Yo Han in danger?

98
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,624
How could you possibly do that?

99
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,564
I didn't know Soo Hyun would die.

100
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,605
I didn't think Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah would go that far.

101
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,805
One, two, three.

102
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,415
(Professor Min Jung Ho)

103
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:48,084
You want me to be the chief justice?

104
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,684
I know well enough that you don't care about the position.

105
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:57,954
But this generation needs someone like you.

106
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,370
Someone like Heo Joong Se is in politics...

107
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,365
and someone like Kang Yo Han conducts trials.

108
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,865
They're all the same.

109
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,235
Crooks who incite the masses.

110
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,749
The live court show they're planning run.

111
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,345
It seems very dangerous.

112
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,144
They're turning trials into cheap street shows.

113
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,514
I'm only assisting Mr. Seo Jeong Hak.

114
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,954
But I sincerely believe we should stop this no matter what.

115
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,024
I will try it at the foundation and you at the Supreme Court.

116
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,695
Maybe we could do something about this quietly.

117
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,945
You're a brave woman.

118
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,075
Well, someone has to do it.

119
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,745
When you become the chief justice, there's something you need to do.

120
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,185
You should put someone near him to keep an eye on him.

121
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,185
Keep an eye on him?

122
00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:05,225
Professor Min.

123
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,424
My goodness.

124
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:09,335
I'm sorry. It's Chief Justice Min now.

125
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,065
You want me to be Judas?

126
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,235
Someone has to be there.

127
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,345
Someone who can keep his eyes wide open in this crazy wind.

128
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,475
Please.

129
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,685
There's no easy way...

130
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,615
to make justice in this world.

131
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:34,654
I hated Kang Yo Han for ruining the world.

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,825
So I just wanted to stop him.

133
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,394
Kang Yo Han's supporters are attacking me...

134
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,335
and revealing my family's personal affairs.

135
00:09:46,069 --> 00:09:47,664
I can't let them do this.

136
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,575
I'll drag Kang Yo Han down...

137
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,404
from his position at all costs.

138
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,090
(Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah)

139
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,685
Did you kill Soo Hyun?

140
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:08,284
You didn't say something like that will happen!

141
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,524
Soo Hyun was like a daughter to me.

142
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:19,065
So? Are you saying you want to quit now?

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,174
Didn't you say you want to stop Kang Yo Han...

144
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:25,134
"at all costs"?

145
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,624
There's no going back now.

146
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:41,995
We're almost there.

147
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,829
The great chief justice of the supreme court...

148
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,164
who ended the time of chaos.

149
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,664
Don't you want to be remembered like that in history?

150
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:55,975
What do you think?

151
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,605
Chief Justice.

152
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:06,884
Someone has to become a monster to stop Kang Yo Han.

153
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,215
You can blame me all you want.

154
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:15,124
But history will judge me.

155
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,695
You dirty hypocrite.

156
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:26,865
Call security.

157
00:11:28,409 --> 00:11:30,105
How could you do it?

158
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,144
How could you let Soo Hyun die?

159
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,945
How could you?

160
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,345
How could you let Soo Hyun die?

161
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,445
Tell me, Min Jung Ho! Tell me!

162
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,745
- Tell me. - Sir!

163
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,355
Tell me!

164
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,120
Let go. Let go!

165
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,024
Min Jung Ho, tell me!

166
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:50,825
Tell me! How could you do it?

167
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,995
Min Jung Ho!

168
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,304
Judge Kim, I just watched the news. What's going on?

169
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,975
It's not true, is it? Chief Kang didn't do it, right?

170
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,044
It's not true. The foundation set this up.

171
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,845
I knew it.

172
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,985
What can I do to help?

173
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:14,845
We should get the chief out of this.

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,995
Oh my. Look who's here.

175
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,669
(Chief Warden Nam Shi Woo)

176
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,880
They say you'll run into your enemy at the worst place and time.

177
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,345
Do you know what I've been through because of you?

178
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,874
What about the testimony from the prison warden? Did it go well?

179
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,274
Yes. He's very scared. He'll do as we say.

180
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:47,620
Did the Minister of Justice order you to do this?

181
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,890
("Minister Cha ordered me to switch out Doh Young Choon.")

182
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,384
Yes. Minister Cha Kyung Hee ordered me to do it.

183
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,924
Were you bribed or blackmailed?

184
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,894
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,554
I couldn't endure the threats from Minister Cha.

186
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,825
I was demoted and ended up here because of you.

187
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,770
You're assigned for the victims of major cases.

188
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,565
Isn't that a good thing for you?

189
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,774
How dare you!

190
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:18,784
Hey. Do you still think you're a judge?

191
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,715
You're now a rat under my control. Do you get that?

192
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,884
Got that?

193
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,524
Gosh.

194
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,569
Board Chairman Jung, you're amazing.

195
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,309
When did you turn Min Jung Ho over to our side?

196
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,548
You're the best! The best!

197
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:47,705
The best!

198
00:13:58,459 --> 00:13:59,585
Gosh.

199
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,455
My goodness.

200
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,900
Here, Board Chairman Jung...

201
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,164
Sit.

202
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:14,304
Board Chairman Jung, you're a brilliant storyteller.

203
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,380
You know Jesus loved Judas the most among his disciples.

204
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,605
But Judas stabs him in the back...

205
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:23,650
and betrays him.

206
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,520
I bet Kang Yo Han is out of his mind in jail by now.

207
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,315
He ordered someone to murder a police officer.

208
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,654
He's completely out of the game now.

209
00:14:35,429 --> 00:14:36,894
Kang Yo Han...

210
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,565
don't have to be put on a trial, right?

211
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,264
What do you mean?

212
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:49,038
Now that he's out of the game anyway.

213
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,809
So if he just disappears quietly,

214
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,745
won't everyone be happy?

215
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,874
That's what I think.

216
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:00,644
Our president thinks too much.

217
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:02,520
If you have too many trivial thoughts,

218
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,554
that means it's time for you to step down.

219
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,585
Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:10,054
I'm sure you won't need my help. My apologies.

221
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:13,325
Well, if you'll excuse me. I need to go to the toilet.

222
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,924
Stop right there!

223
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:19,735
She can do a perfect job on her own.

224
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:21,034
What's wrong with you?

225
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,504
Of course, she can.

226
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,874
Board Chairman Jung is not an ordinary woman.

227
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,075
How dare you!

228
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,685
Heo Joong Se got used to it pretty quickly.

229
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,360
His position changed,

230
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,955
then the man has completely changed too.

231
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,254
Right.

232
00:15:41,789 --> 00:15:43,095
But...

233
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,264
he changed too quickly.

234
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,294
What?

235
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,908
Plus, the conniving old men who only care about money...

236
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:56,534
are suddenly playing up to Heo Joong Se, who's useless now.

237
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,174
I might have underestimated Heo Joong Se.

238
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,115
Look into it. I'm sure there's something there.

239
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,154
Heo Joong Se...

240
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:16,095
kept obsessing over forcing more residents out.

241
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,065
Check the Dream Home Village accommodations.

242
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:22,634
See if there any places with missing people...

243
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:25,634
or if they have been moving the residents to some other place.

244
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,504
Thank you for supporting my husband's plans.

245
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,245
The weekend farm?

246
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,715
Yes.

247
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,384
You guys did a great job convincing your husbands.

248
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,345
It was close.

249
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:43,284
No need to thank us.

250
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:46,784
To be honest, we support things that make us money.

251
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,099
Since we're on the topic, do you want to visit the weekend farm?

252
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,695
Sounds good.

253
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,794
I'm curious to see if our crops are growing well.

254
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,534
Okay. I'll set it up.

255
00:17:07,979 --> 00:17:09,748
Even if you fell for a trap,

256
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,685
how could you frame Judge Kang for murder?

257
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,854
I know it's shameless,

258
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,385
but can you help me out this one time?

259
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,054
I need to save Chief Kang,

260
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,988
but I can't do anything without your help.

261
00:17:21,989 --> 00:17:23,155
I'm not sure.

262
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,228
I don't know if we can continue trusting in you, Judge Kim.

263
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:28,524
We don't have time.

264
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,034
Do you think they would leave Chief Kang alone...

265
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,064
until before his trial?

266
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,364
You don't know what they would do.

267
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,539
The only thing we can do is...

268
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,274
disclose something huge to tie up their hands and feet.

269
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,514
If the attention of the nation falls on them,

270
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:45,149
they'll back off to save themselves.

271
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,245
Hold on.

272
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,385
By something big, do you mean...

273
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,514
Yes, the inside of Dream Home Village.

274
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,188
It's an internment camp, so I'm sure it'll be dismal.

275
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,554
We need to expose that.

276
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,155
That's impossible.

277
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,725
There are soldiers standing guard.

278
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,064
I'll go alone.

279
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:06,604
Which facility is the most strictly guarded?

280
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:07,834
That place...

281
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,034
will have something they want to hide.

282
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:15,205
Then it's the Dream Home Medical Center.

283
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,248
Even if you manage to get inside,

284
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:19,314
there's no way you can manage to get out.

285
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:20,945
Will you still do it?

286
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,655
Yes.

287
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,614
Just get me in.

288
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,359
Okay. Let's say you get lucky, and you find something.

289
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,158
We have no means of revealing it.

290
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,198
The media is busy walking on eggshells around the administration.

291
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,839
Video platforms and social media have all been blocked.

292
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,135
This country...

293
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,064
is no longer a free nation.

294
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,935
There's...

295
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,905
something that I've come up with for that.

296
00:18:46,749 --> 00:18:48,844
What did you come up with?

297
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:53,485
Just get me one thing.

298
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,975
Elijah.

299
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,675
There's something I wanted to tell you.

300
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:30,284
I met someone who worked at that cathedral recently.

301
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:32,925
That fire...

302
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,725
happened because a switchboard caught on fire...

303
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,195
due to some old wiring.

304
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,564
It wasn't anyone's fault. It was just an accident.

305
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,405
But Yo Han purposely tried to get you to suspect him.

306
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,339
You said, if you can walk again, you'll kill me first.

307
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,304
Don't get ahead of yourself. One at a time, okay?

308
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,445
He purposely filled out the application form...

309
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,084
to cancel the deed of covenant for you to see,

310
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,254
and he kept saying things to irritate you.

311
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:06,485
I don't care about someone I've already killed.

312
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,895
If I'm the one who really killed that someone.

313
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,165
It's because...

314
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:17,135
you had a really hard time after you lost your parents.

315
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,034
You didn't eat or sleep,

316
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:23,175
and you got thinner every day.

317
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,044
That's why Yo Han wanted you to continue living...

318
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:30,175
even if it was based on your hatred towards him.

319
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,885
But Elijah. Even if you were mistaken about Yo Han,

320
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:37,685
- You have to come soon. - that isn't your fault.

321
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,125
Yo Han did it because he wanted to.

322
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,455
You didn't do anything wrong, Elijah.

323
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:50,465
You just need to treat him well when you see him again.

324
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:54,965
Yo Han will come back to you soon.

325
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,935
It won't take long. I promise.

326
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,084
So eat something.

327
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:08,915
When Yo Han gets back,

328
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,385
how would he feel if you were sick?

329
00:22:24,199 --> 00:22:25,794
- What are you doing? - Hey!

330
00:22:27,729 --> 00:22:29,264
Hey, step back!

331
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,139
You've already been charged with the death penalty.

332
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,678
You can be executed at any time if that's what you want.

333
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,875
Don't kill me.

334
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,705
Is that as loud as you can be?

335
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:45,918
Don't kill me!

336
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,215
Don't kill me!

337
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:50,014
Go!

338
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,155
Hey!

339
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,059
- Hey! - Break it up!

340
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,529
Move it! Move out of the way!

341
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,569
Hey! Break it up!

342
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,594
- What are you doing? - Get out of here!

00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,959
The president is coming.

364
00:26:51,959 --> 00:26:53,725
The president is here.

365
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:57,395
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

366
00:27:06,469 --> 00:27:07,665
Hello.

367
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:10,834
Our selected medical staff.

368
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,645
You're doing a really good job.

369
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,215
As requested by EU, we're clinically testing the new vaccine.

370
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,689
Out of the 3,620 subjects,

371
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:24,019
the number of people who have died from side effects so far...

372
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:25,614
is 182.

373
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,324
Only 182? That's not bad.

374
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,530
Share the results with the client.

375
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,929
And let me know if any countries are behind in their payments.

376
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:35,100
One more thing.

377
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,939
Including Russia and Japan, we've received requests...

378
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:39,569
from a few more countries.

379
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,435
I think we should expand our farm quickly.

380
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,375
Many countries are competing to develop vaccines first.

381
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:49,004
Clinical trials are in extremely high demand right now.

382
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,475
My goodness. If Seoul citizens are not enough,

383
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,215
we'll need Busan, Daegu, and Gwangju citizens as well.

384
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,830
Nice. Our country doesn't produce a single drop of oil,

385
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,485
but we're fine as long as we have human resources.

386
00:28:05,229 --> 00:28:09,495
As I always say, human lives come first.

387
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,340
You know I say that all the time, right?

388
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,739
Take a look around.

389
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:15,804
Do you know how much money each person is worth...

390
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,274
in clinical trials?

391
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,979
It's beyond your imagination.

392
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:23,215
And when they die, we remove all the functioning organs.

393
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,679
It doesn't end there. From hair to blood,

394
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,159
we collect and export all the by-products as well.

395
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,054
Absolutely nothing goes to waste.

396
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,269
Mr. President, you're a genius businessman.

397
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,769
Why have you been hiding it from us?

398
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,235
Were you going to hog all the profits for yourself?

399
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,109
I was waiting for the right moment to share it with you.

400
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:29,245
By the way, do we have to let Jung Sun Ah in?

401
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:36,245
I'm not saying we should leave her out though.

402
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,455
Without her, there's more for us, I guess.

403
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,495
She's not that useful anymore anyway.

404
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,695
She's just like Cha Kyung Hee. I hate aggressive women.

405
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,235
She's too smart for her own good.

406
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,004
She's just a lowly maid, after all.

407
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:59,604
Right? This is our chance to cut her off.

408
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,679
Also, send a man to the prison...

409
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:05,445
and take care of Kang Yo Han before he gets up to anything.

410
00:30:05,449 --> 00:30:07,985
Yes, Mr. President!

411
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,254
Why are you doing this?

412
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,725
Do you like it?

413
00:30:19,199 --> 00:30:20,370
Wait for me.

414
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,594
- Let's go. - Yes, let's go.

415
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,905
So Yoon, let's get out of here.

416
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,304
What are you doing?

417
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,485
I've been ordered to check her vitals.

418
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:43,145
I see.

419
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,385
Let's go.

420
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,584
Hold on a second.

421
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,614
What is it?

422
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,354
Relax, Judge Kim.

423
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,594
I've been waiting for someone to come and help.

424
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:33,100
And I'm not the only one.

425
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,304
We're all locked up here with our phones have been taken away.

426
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,375
There are sane people in here too.

427
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,975
This doesn't make any sense.

428
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:44,715
How could a nation do this to its people?

429
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,245
The person is dead.

430
00:31:47,249 --> 00:31:50,014
The organs have been removed. We're taking her to the incinerator.

431
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,024
We'll help you.

432
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,364
We'll help you two escape. Please tell the world...

434
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,935
Yes, I will.

437
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,725
Hello, Judge Kim. Are you okay?

438
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,135
Yes. I saved Ms. Han too.

439
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,564
I was lucky.

440
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,534
Did you get what I asked for?

441
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,274
Are you sure it's the only way?

442
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:51,350
Why don't you look for a brave reporter...

443
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,945
That's a long shot. We don't have time for that.

444
00:32:56,659 --> 00:32:57,784
I understand.

I'm 18 years old.

448
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,335
What have I done?

449
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,214
I'm sorry.

Kang Yo Han who was arrested for instigating murder is dead.

He was taken to Jungbu Detention Center...

where it seems he was stabbed by an assailant.

00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,755
May I ask what your future plans are?

545
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,495
(Chief Justice Min Jung Ho's Inaugural Press Conference)

546
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:12,295
Sir.

547
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,205
Congratulations.

548
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:18,034
Thank you, Judge Oh.

549
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:22,005
While you were talking to the press...

550
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,114
Chairman Jung Sun Ah asked me to tell you...

551
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:30,085
she wants to see you in private.

552
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:33,518
- Did she? - She said...

553
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,355
she'd wait in your old office...

554
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,025
because it's still empty.

555
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:41,864
Okay.

556
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:55,505
Ga On, I gave him the message.

557
00:43:55,809 --> 00:43:57,275
Thank you.

558
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,978
Now please leave the building.

559
00:43:59,979 --> 00:44:03,045
What? Leave the building? Why?

560
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,514
I'll explain later.

561
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:07,014
Do as I say for now.

562
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:08,654
Okay.

563
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:17,768
Wow, the interior here is actually quite nice.

564
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:20,935
Up here, wow, what a great view.

565
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,234
You all look like minions.

566
00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:27,449
So this is why Kang Yo Han...

567
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,375
was so haughty and arrogant.

568
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,288
Chairman Jung, you look amazing up there.

569
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:45,828
It's as if there's a light shining from behind you.

570
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:47,099
That's right.

571
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:51,395
Can we host future important foundation events here now?

572
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,639
Upper-class ladies definitely have...

573
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:56,840
a better sense of theatrics.

574
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,534

There's no media outlet with the conscience to report the truth.

583
00:46:01,939 --> 00:46:05,505
But things might change if the news is tantalizing and money-making.

584
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,605
How about...

You got out with the help of the guy who swapped Doh Young Choon?

Then did you really return his money?

647
00:51:17,249 --> 00:51:18,514
I did.

Dear citizens. This is the truth behind the Dream Home Project.

725
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,795
Is this the despicable thing you were doing behind my back?

726
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,224
Did you know about it?

727
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:49,438
- You crazy wench! - Isn't this incredible?

728
00:55:49,439 --> 00:55:52,108
They used a nonexistent virus as an excuse to drag people away,

729
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:54,635
and they sold them to conduct experiments on human bodies.

730
00:55:55,779 --> 00:56:00,744
This is only something that a creative lunatic could come up with.

731
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:03,414
- This is all fake... - I admire you, Mr. President.

732
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,845
This doesn't make sense. Hold on.

733
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,660
Dear fellow citizens whom I love and respect.

734
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,289
This video has been fabricated!

735
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:12,588
This is an anti-national act conducted...

736
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:14,829
in an attempt to overthrow the current administration.

737
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,829
- As I always say, - Okay?

738
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:19,729
human lives come first.

739
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:21,934
Take a look around.

740
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:24,264
Do you know how much money each person is worth...

741
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,838
in clinical trials?

742
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,209
It's beyond your imagination.

743
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:28,608
And when they die,

744
00:56:28,609 --> 00:56:30,479
we remove all the functioning organs.

745
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,979
It doesn't end there. From hair to blood,

746
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,244
we collect and export all the by-products as well.

747
00:56:38,419 --> 00:56:40,684
Absolutely nothing goes to waste.

748
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:42,854
And...

749
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,124
You look good on camera. It must be because you were an actor.

750
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,500
These people died in the hands of Jung Sun Ah,

751
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,064
the board chairman of Social Responsibility Foundation.

752
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,175
She killed innocent people...

753
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,275
to fulfill her ambitions...

754
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:18,354
and to attack me.

755
00:57:24,759 --> 00:57:27,624
And the newly appointed Chief Justice, Min Jung Ho,

756
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,298
is a hypocrite...

757
00:57:29,299 --> 00:57:32,064
who acted as Jung Sun Ah's informant for his personal greed.

758
00:57:32,509 --> 00:57:34,169
He betrayed Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun,

759
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:35,909
who was like a daughter to him,

760
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,449
and joined forces with her murderer, Jung Sun Ah.

(DIKE Live)

762
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:45,985
Isn't this surprising?

763
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:16,874
Go...

764
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,454
and live in misery for the rest of your life.

765
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:30,854
Your name will go down in history.

766
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:34,195
Just like you wanted.

767
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:23,545
Dear fellow citizens.

768
00:59:24,219 --> 00:59:25,545
Are they guilty?

769
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,715

00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,858

773
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,738
- Darn. - No.

774
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:49,278
I'm being falsely charged.

775
00:59:49,279 --> 00:59:50,834
I'm being falsely charged.

776
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,775
Then we need a proper sentence.

777
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,519
What is that? Where is that?

778
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,749
Is that here? Look at that.

779
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,758
Honey. What is going on?

780
01:00:02,759 --> 01:00:05,128
If you try to leave this place,

781
01:00:05,129 --> 01:00:06,825
this bomb will go off.

782
01:00:07,529 --> 01:00:09,059
- He said there's a bomb. - Go check!

783
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,325
Oh, no. Honey!

784
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,264
It's real!

785
01:00:19,969 --> 01:00:21,735
Oh, no!

786
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:24,805
Dear fellow citizens. You should judge them yourselves.

787
01:00:24,939 --> 01:00:28,374
Our president received ten million votes during the election, right?

788
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,014
The moment the votes on the DIKE app reach that number,

789
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,485
you will get to watch magnificent fireworks.

790
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:37,954
It'll be to celebrate the victory of democracy.

Where will you be going?

801
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:39,814

Kang Yo Han, that jerk.

808
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:06,575
Honey.

809
01:02:07,149 --> 01:02:09,414
Is it locked?

810
01:02:09,879 --> 01:02:12,184
- It's locked. - Darn it.

811
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:14,588
Darn it!

812
01:02:14,589 --> 01:02:15,684

- Kang Yo Han! - Oh, my.

815
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:28,834
If you take one more step,

816
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:32,034
I'm going to blow this place up right now.

Dear fellow citizens.

819
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,985
The footage of the inside of the Dream Home Medical Center...

820
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,454
was taken by Judge Kim Ga On, who risked his life to film it.

821
01:02:56,529 --> 01:02:58,354
Once everything is over,

822
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:02,235
Judge Kim will testify and tell the whole truth.

823
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,834
The evil people who are with me...

824
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,834
will go to the afterlife with me.

825
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:12,575
No.

Honey.

827
01:03:20,819 --> 01:03:24,155
Judge Kang. You have to let me live.

828
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:27,454
I did everything you told me to do.

829
01:03:28,629 --> 01:03:30,724
I brought everyone here!

830
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:44,778
Hello?

831
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,305
It's been a while, Chairman Min.

832
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:50,345
You're... How did you...

833
01:03:50,419 --> 01:03:52,215
I'll get straight to the point. Listen up.

834
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,084
I need you to do something for me.

835
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,684
On the day of Min Jung Ho's inauguration ceremony,

836
01:03:55,819 --> 01:03:58,889
bring every member of the foundation to the court.

837
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,084
What?

838
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,825
- Have you lost your mind? - Otherwise, you're dead meat.

839
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,795
You pocketed the foundation's funds to save Minbo Group from bankruptcy.

840
01:04:08,939 --> 01:04:10,095
I have the evidence.

841
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,795
You're lying.

842
01:04:12,009 --> 01:04:14,135
If you can't believe me, check your desk drawer.

843
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:15,934
I put a copy in there.

844
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:19,545
You had the audacity to steal their money.

845
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:23,345
Save me.

846
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:25,244
When that gets out, they'll kill me.

847
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,885
If you want to live, do as I say.

848
01:04:27,089 --> 01:04:28,284

849
01:04:29,589 --> 01:04:31,814

You crazy little...

851
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,425
Get off me. How dare you?

852
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:42,135
You crazy clown.

853
01:04:44,469 --> 01:04:45,865
Save me.

854
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:48,465
You have to save me!

855
01:04:52,149 --> 01:04:54,644
All right. Since you made a deal with me,

856
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,144
I'll give you a chance.

857
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:05,084

873
01:08:57,989 --> 01:09:00,660
Hold on. Quiet, everyone!

874

Hold on a second. Kang Yo Han, listen.

I'll offer you a deal.

Quiet, everyone! Attention!

878
01:09:13,639 --> 01:09:15,410
I'm the only person you should save.

879

I'm the commander-in-chief.

880
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:18,910
It'll be a win-win for both of us.

881
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:22,744
The others are just a bunch of businessmen and women!

882
01:09:23,849 --> 01:09:25,319
I'm different.

883
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:27,914
Without me, what will happen to the country?

884
01:09:28,019 --> 01:09:30,219
I'm the Republic of Korea, for goodness's sake!

885
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,255
I'm an artist and leader.

886
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:34,784
Save me this once.

887
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:37,728

01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:07,265
Please, let us live.

909
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:09,799
- Sir, help us. - Help us.

910
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,598
- I'm sorry. - Help us.

911
01:14:11,599 --> 01:14:13,339
Please let us go.

912
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,938
I'm sorry. Let us go.

913
01:14:15,939 --> 01:14:17,904
I'm sorry.

Why did you come here?

917
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,395
Don't do it.

918
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,895
Will you leave Elijah behind?

919
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,864
And die with these jerks?

920
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:53,204
I have no choice.

921
01:14:53,649 --> 01:14:56,645

Don't do it!

962
01:21:51,429 --> 01:21:53,629

01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:09,345
What happened? Where is Elijah?

967
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:12,015
Well...

968
01:22:20,290 --> 01:22:21,385
Master Yo Han.

969
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:24,355
You're alive.

970
01:22:24,559 --> 01:22:25,629
Were you worried?

971
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:27,895
Do you even have to ask?

972
01:22:28,429 --> 01:22:31,164
Ms. Ji. You're fired.

973
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:32,699
What?

974
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,608
Leave this house and be free.

975
01:22:34,609 --> 01:22:36,738
No one will live here anymore.

976
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:38,704
What do you mean?

977
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:41,645
But...

978
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,274
Master Yo Han.

979
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:52,784
Is Elijah in her room?

980
01:22:53,029 --> 01:22:54,124
Yes.

981
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:56,795
Master Yo Han.

982
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,114
Elijah.

983
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:26,925
Yo Han.

984
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,965
Are you out of prison?

985
01:23:42,439 --> 01:23:43,605
Are you okay?

986
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:45,540
Yes.

987
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:48,204
You don't have to worry about me. I'm fine.

988
01:23:50,019 --> 01:23:51,815
Now we're going to move to somewhere safe.

989
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:54,685
Somewhere safe?

990
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:56,484
Do you want to see where it is?

991
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:04,895
It's a rehabilitation hospital in Switzerland.

992
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:09,395
I wanted them to find a way to make you walk again.

993
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,334
So I've been donating to them.

994
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,105
Would you like to go there?

995
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:23,475

996
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:28,045
Yo Han...

997
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:05,385
So he was alive.

998
01:25:07,189 --> 01:25:08,555
Thank goodness.

999
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:14,864
It seems I'm going to get a lot busier from now on.

1000
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:16,569
Excuse me?

1001
01:25:16,569 --> 01:25:20,534
Master Yo Han gave me a healthy food shopping mall...

1002
01:25:20,569 --> 01:25:22,005
as a retirement gift.

1003
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:27,744
He told me to sell healthy food that doesn't taste good.

1004
01:25:28,809 --> 01:25:30,444
Should I take it as an insult?

1005
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:41,555
- You'll go back to your hometown? - Yes.

1006
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,324
It's unfair only the people in Seoul can see how charming I am.

1007
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,830
You're right.

1008
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:50,395
I volunteered to the department in charge of juvenile cases.

1009
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:54,265
I want to scold some troubled kids and help them.

1010
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,435
I think I'll be good at it.

1011
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,234
I'm sure you will be like you've always been.

1012
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:03,074
Thank you for everything.

1013
01:26:04,779 --> 01:26:05,975

1026
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:09,244
To avoid a shameful incident from happening again,

1027
01:27:09,779 --> 01:27:12,414
what should we do? Do you have any idea?

1028
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:16,715
Was it a shameful incident?

1029
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,225
Kang Yo Han isn't a hero.

1030
01:27:20,529 --> 01:27:22,385
But he's not a criminal.

1031
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:26,124
Do you think people were too naive and easily shaken?

1032
01:27:26,260 --> 01:27:28,694
Do you think that's why they went enthusiastic about him?

1033
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:34,005
I can see that you're a vigorous young man.

1034
01:27:34,439 --> 01:27:38,109
I think you're trying to say we need to find the fundamental problem.

1035
01:27:38,109 --> 01:27:39,675
But can we fix it easily?

1036
01:27:41,109 --> 01:27:46,444
I think we need to find a solution to settle the public sentiment.

1037
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:48,545
You're right.

1038
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:50,555
The prosecution wants...

1039
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:52,689
to strengthen the screening process in selecting the judges...

1040
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:55,389
so that we can eliminate dangerous ones.

1041
01:27:55,389 --> 01:27:58,499
The Ministry of Justice should be in charge of selecting the judges.

1042
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,664
What kind of nonsense is that?

1043
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:02,598

Kim Ga On is gaining a lot of popularity from the public.

1046
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,340
So why don't we make him the presiding judge...

1047
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,909
and make another live court show?

1048
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:13,135

01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:16,305

1055
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:27,984
Forgive me for saying this.

1056
01:28:34,099 --> 01:28:35,425
We are the people...

1057
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:38,795
who were empowered by the public to do our job.

1058
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:41,265
We should make sure no one feels resentment...

1059
01:28:42,139 --> 01:28:44,704
and no one sheds tears of blood.

1060
01:28:44,939 --> 01:28:47,410
And the ones who make other people shed tears of blood.

1061
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:49,444
We should make sure they pay for their crimes.

1062
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,045
Isn't that what we're supposed to do?

1063
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,215
I became a judge to do that.

1064
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:00,055
But if we don't do our job,

1065
01:29:00,689 --> 01:29:03,425
someone has to suffer. And that suffer...

1066
01:29:04,899 --> 01:29:06,624
will create a monster.

1067
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,265
People go furious...

1068
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:12,595
for a reason.

1069
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,435
Those were great comments.

1070
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:20,309
Young people should be vigorous like you.

1071
01:29:20,309 --> 01:29:21,645
I respect that.

1072
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:25,420
But I think we heard enough of Judge Kim's comments.

1073
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:27,290
Now why don't we have a discussion...

1074
01:29:27,290 --> 01:29:29,318
to come up with solutions that are more practical?

1075
01:29:29,319 --> 01:29:30,389
Certainly.

1076
01:29:30,389 --> 01:29:31,689
You just talked about...

1077
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:33,160
the screening process of selecting the judges.

1078
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,728
Shall we continue to...

1079
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:36,324
We still need to...

1080
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:48,664
It's still the same.

1081
01:29:50,179 --> 01:29:52,105
Nothing has changed at all.

1082
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:58,774
What should I do now...

1083
01:30:00,349 --> 01:30:02,444

1084
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:15,965

1085
01:30:18,170 --> 01:30:20,234
If you don't, I'll come back.
