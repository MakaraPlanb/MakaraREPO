Yes, I'm forever indebted to you.

Because I shook up your sheep farm

397

It was at your house

Hello, Ms. Jung.

444
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,680
Ms. Oh. You still owe me
a private conversation with you.

445
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,190
What was that? Come on.

446
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,730
Mr. Kang.

00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,070
What do you mean?

449
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,570
The whole country is stirred up
because of what you started.

450
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,540
But you still have not told me a thing.

451
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,680
You said you would resign
without talking to us.

452
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,650
But now, you're asking
the public for tip-offs.

453
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,350
And why is that woman doing here
all of a sudden?

454
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,250
-Ms. Oh.
-Wait.

455
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,690
I have one more thing to say.

456
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,890
I don't know how you think of me.

457
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,830
But I am still a judge.

458
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,600
And I'm a member of this department.

459
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,530

you're on your own.

460

463
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,810
Isn't that what you said?

464
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,280
I remember you telling me that.

465
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
You sound ambitious now.

466
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,410
I should congratulate you,
but I wonder what caused this change.

467
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,520
I told you everything I have to say.

468
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,530
Is this your way of handling things?

469
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:29,000
You're pushing away people
who are on your side.

470
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,540
How can you go up against
these world leaders?

471
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,970
You have no one.

472
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,740
Let's talk about that later.

473
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,350
Stop by my house.

474
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,620
Elijah seems anxious and concerned.

475
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,660
Everything is happening
without my involvement.

00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,430
Seo Jeong-hak died out of the blue.

478
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,900
And the Violence Gang now?

479
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,700
Did you find out about
the gang they have arrested?

480
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:05,000
The National Intelligence Service won't
share anything as it's their jurisdiction.

481
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,440
Darn those pigs.

482
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,239
So they will only answer to the President.

483
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:18,650
Don't we have a team that's looking into
Heo Joong-se's corruption?

484
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,250
Yes, Ms. Cha.

485
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,219
I will need some of them
on a different task.

486
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:23,860
Which task?

487
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,060
The new chairman of Social
Responsibility Foundation, Jung Sun-ah.

488
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,770
It looks like a sly fox has gotten

489
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,739
[Minister of Justice Cha Kyung-hee]

490
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,139

[285 S 7511]

00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,660

493
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,190
Sure. Sounds good.

494
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,300
Elijah.

495
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,380
It looks like you want to ask me
why I didn't get Oh Jin-joo involved.

496
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,950
Our bench consists of three judges.

497
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,250
Two judges will be the majority.

498
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,950
So you don't need the minority?

499
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,420
But she's a good person.

500
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,660
I don't trust fickle factors

501
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,790
such as good will or principles.

502
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,600
So you're only interested in

503
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,970
resentment and rage.

504
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,400
Compared to the others, yes.

505
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,940
Her sponsor and her son.

506
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,280
So you're targeting Cha Kyung-hee
from the first trial.

507
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,780
Is it because of

508
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,980
Elijah?

509
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,790
[Mom. Mom!]

510
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,220
It's not that simple.

511
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,960
As I told you before,

512
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,600
when people with power stick together,
we won't have a shot.

513
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,730
So you're isolating
the most powerful one of all.

514
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,500
On top of that,
she's the easiest one to isolate.

515
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,640
Easy?

516
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,970
Do you know why she's powerful?

517
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,380
Because she knows everyone's secrets.

518
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,810
A lot of people will be happy
once she's cornered.

519
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,620
And

520
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,950
I want the secrets
Cha Kyung-hee has of everyone.

521
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,790
I would love to get them.

522
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,060
So you'll keep pressuring her.

523
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,060
Until she comes to you
and cuts a deal with her last trump card.

524
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,530
If you understood my plan,
review this first.

525
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,100
The cases we can cover
in our next live trial.

526
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,940
The show must go on.

527
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,770
The public's support is our only weapon.

528
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,880
By the way, it's about Do Young-chun.

529
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,090
Who's behind this?

530
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,320
I'm not sure.

531
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,090
I'm still looking into this for now.

532
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,830
Whoever that is, why would they
do something like this?

533
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,100
He wasn't a politician.

534
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,800
It wasn't like they needed to make
a trade with another country. So why?

535
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,500
If we can't pinpoint a specific reason,
usually, it's the money.

536
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,440
Money?

537
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,010
Money is a very strong motive.

538
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,310
For everyone.

539
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,620
[Must we get Mr. Kim Ga-on involved?]

540
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,160
-Why must we--
[-Whether we like him or not,]

541
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,960
I can't have an enemy on my team.

542
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,800
Either I win him over to my side.

543
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,900
[-Or...]
-Or I must eliminate

544
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,540
a threat.

545
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,950
Elijah.

546
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,420
Yes. Come in.

547
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,590
You're eating frozen convenience meals
now that I'm gone.

548
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,030
What were you guys talking about?
It ran pretty long.

549
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,770
We were just talking
about boring work stuff.

550
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,540
-Can I sit?
-Sure.

551
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,140
Right. Two old geezers won't be
talking about anything fun.

552
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,740
That's too mean.

553
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,480
I thought I was more like your friend.

554
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,210
Let's just drop it.

555
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,620
Why aren't you coming here these days?

556
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,820
I just have a lot on my mind.

557
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,330
I've given some thought

558
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,900
to what you said earlier.

559
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:58,730
What did I say?

560
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,470
That awful con artist. The one
responsible for your parents' deaths.

561
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
I shouldn't have told you that.

562
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,170
Don't think about that.

563
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,140
How could I not?

564
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,840
You said you tried to kill yourself
so many times because of him!

565
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,350
Elijah?

566
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,820
-Let's kill him.
-What?

567
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,490
I've been thinking about it,
and that's the only way.

568
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,360
I really don't understand.

569
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,820
Why do we have to keep that punk

570
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,330
fed and clothed
with the tax our people paid?

571
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,690
How do you even sleep at night?

572
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,330
If I were you,
I wouldn't be able to sleep in peace.

573
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,000
I've been thinking about it,

574
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,570
and I don't think it's impossible.

575
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,940
I'll hack the prison's system

576
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,940
and find out when his furlough is.

577
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,510
When he comes out, I'll pop out and...

578
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
Elijah.

579
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,850
Yes?

580
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,750
Thanks for being supportive.

581
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,590
Well, I'm just...

582
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,560
But I'm really okay now. Don't worry.

583
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,930
Oh, is that so?

584
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,660
If you say so...

585
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,700
Can I ask you something?

586
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,280
This may sound silly,
but hypothetically speaking,

587
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,450
what if someone replaced
that awful con artist

588
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,580
with someone innocent?

589
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,520
What?

590
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,660
What a ridiculous thought you had.

591
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,890
Why don't you stop wasting
your time on the nonsense

592
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,860
-and just go kill...
-You're right.

593
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,630
It's ridiculous.

594
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,430
It is.

595
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,570
Who would do something so crazy like that?

596
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,740
Why bother?

597
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Right?

598
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,740
Unless it's some strange person
with a strange purpose,

599
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,810
why bother?

600
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,850
Never mind.

601
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,750
Get some rest, Elijah.

602
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,290
Good night.

603
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,060
What was that?

604
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,310
[Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency,
Yoon Soo-hyun]

605
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,030
I was really surprised.

606
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,230
You called me

607
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,600
right when I was thinking about you.

608
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,570
Well, the old geezers wouldn't have been

609
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,840
of much help here.

610
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
That one.

611
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,680
-What do you think?
-It looks great. It looks good on you.

612
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,790
Because the model is not so bad.

613
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
How about that one?

614
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,690
That one is a bit old...

615
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:18,630
I mean, it looks like it's for grown-ups.

616
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,770
Is it?

617
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:29,840
By the way, is something up

618
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
with Ga-on lately?

619
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Ga-on?

620
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,380
I'm not sure.

621
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,590
Come on. You said you were best friends.

622
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,190
Are you worried?

623
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:44,290
No, I'm not. Why would I be?

624
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,960
I'd like to get this one.

625
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:48,090
Okay.

626
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,800
And also the one
this old lady was looking at earlier.

627
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,570
Pardon? Oh.

628
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,630
Old?

629
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,270
Never mind. I'm good.

630
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,710
Why don't you pick one too?

631
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,170
Shopping alone is not fun.

632
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,910
Right.

633
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,080
But how about we go somewhere else?

634
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,720
Somewhere else?

635
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,830
All right.

636
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,540
You like him.

637
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,810
You mean, the ice cream?

638
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:12,950
You know what I mean.

639
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,310
Ga-on?

640
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:19,220
I can't say I don't like him.

641
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,490
Since I was in kindergarten,
I asked him out five times.

642
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,690
-Five times?
-But he turned me down every time.

643
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,260
But why...

644
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,160
Why did I keep asking him out?

645
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,900
I wonder why.

646
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:37,570
At first, it must have been
because of his face.

647
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,810
He was quite cute when he was young.

648
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,410
And?

649
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,610
And...

650
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,640
he cried.

651
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,380
What?

652
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,280
His family went broke for the first time,

653
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,590
and he had to quit kindergarten.

654
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,690
And he bawled his eyes out.

655
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,160
But I hated it.

656
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,430
I hated to see him cry.

657
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,670
There was nothing else I could do.

658
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,070
Before I knew it,

659
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,470
I was confessing my feelings for him.

660
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:18,080
Silly, right?

661
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,050
Oh.

662
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:23,720
Does that mean he cried...

663
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,050
I saw him cry

664
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,720
five times.

665
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,240
[That was the start
of Ga-on's family's misfortune.]

666
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:53,580
And it never stopped.

667
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,450
It continued.

668
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,060
It's too late.

669
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,690
-Shall we go now?
-Soo-hyun.

670
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,100
Let me come with you.

671
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:21,170
Okay, Elijah.

672
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,750
Hey. It's me.

673
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,720
You've interviewed
Jungwon FNB before, right?

674
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,160
Could you take a look at their financial
situation during the past few years?

675
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:39,890
Yes. Thank you.

676
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Ga-on.

677
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,300
Sorry, I'm late.

678
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,230
I know you're a busy man.
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Park.

679
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,100
Come on. You're the most
successful friend of all.

680
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,210
You're Judge Kim Ga-on.
Of course, I take time for you.

681
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,410
-I'm successful?
-Of course. You're a star.

682
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,480
Could you sign your autograph here?

683
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:03,750
It's for my nephew.

684
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:05,650
Sure.

685
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,850
Actually, I wanted to ask you a favor.

686
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,390
What is it?

687
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,430
There's this inmate in prison

688
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:15,060
who has embezzled billions of won.

689
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:17,930
And one of the teams in the prosecution
was in charge.

690
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,470
I know this is a lot to ask,

691
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,330
but could you see
if they had found anything?

692
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,440
Is this for the live trial?

693
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,640
No, it's something personal.

694
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:28,610
I'd very much appreciate your help.

695
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,280
Okay.

696
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,580
Then

697
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,450
I'm afraid you'll have to give me
more of your autograph.

698
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,580
This isn't enough.

699
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:40,990
Okay. Thanks.

700
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,230
Hey.

701
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,530
Are you back for good now?

702
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,000
Not really.

703
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,030
I came by to look after these guys.

704
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,100
Don't just drop by. Come back.

705
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,670
This is your home.

706
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,170
There are some people
I need to look after there too.

707
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:05,040
Why don't you look after yourself first?

708
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:06,510
What about me?

709
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,050
I have had it easy for too long so far.
There's no need to do that.

710
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,190
-Soo-hyun.
-Yes.

711
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,860
What's that pensive look about?

712
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,060
I was just thinking.

713
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,960
Ga-on...

714
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,430
Professor Min.

715
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,930
Gosh. Goodness.

716
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,000
Hey. Hello.

717
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,940
-Hello.
-You have so many steps here.

718
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,380
My legs.

719
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,540
What brings you here at this late hour?

720
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,550
Did you enjoy your food?

721
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:49,220
Orange juice?

722
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,320
Hey, you should have brought soju,
not orange juice.

723
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,990
Exactly.

724
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,590
How dense.

725
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:00,370
I talked to Soo-hyun on the phone
to catch up and decided to stop by.

726
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,500
I heard you were here.

727
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:04,270
You and I work at the courthouse
every day. Why the fuss?

728
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,640
I don't know if we're working
at the courthouse or somewhere else.

729
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,740
I don't know anymore.

730
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,450
I met up with the Chief Justice today.
He sounded like a military commander.

731
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,120
Courts all over Korea
must be work in unison.

732
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:21,020
This isn't the country I had in mind
when I protested all those years ago.

733
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:23,620
I was ordered to use live ammunition.

734
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,630
I didn't become a policewoman
to shoot bullets at our people.

735
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,560
Police brutality is getting worse.

736
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:32,500
Even when drunk people talk a bit,

737
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,770
-the police--
-Is that so bad?

738
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:36,940
Ga-on.

739
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,070
It's not normal
that police officers get beaten up

740
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,040
by drunks every night.

741
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:44,510
How can that happen in a normal country?

742
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,710
But a monster who goes berserk

743
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,820
will not stop until the end.

744
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:52,450
And your department awoke that monster.

745
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,490
So what will you do?

746
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,690
I will get your department disbanded.

747
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,960
There's no hope in our organization.

748
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,090
I will bring up this matter
with a civic organization.

749
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,030
And if some of the press outlets
publish the story,

750
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,770
the opposition party will demand
to investigate the administration.

751
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,100
Ga-on.

752
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,700
You're at the center of this plan.

753
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,470
I need to know everything you came across

754
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,340
in your department.

755
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,780
-Is that a demand?
-I'm asking.

756
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,910
And

757
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,880
I'm sorry.

758
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:29,450
This is my fault.

759
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,890
[Associate Judge Kim Ga-on]

760
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,840
[Associate Judge Kim Ga-on]

761
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:51,640
Yes.

762
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:52,840
Let's talk.

763
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:56,480
[Chief Judge Kang Yo-han]

764
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,620
Did you take a look?

765
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:05,660
What do you mean?

766
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,890
The file I gave you.
The cases for the next live trial.

767
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,830
Yes.

768
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,500
You still have a lot on your mind.

769
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,910
I need you to come with me later.

770
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:23,940
Where again?

771
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:25,140
You need to see this.

772
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,690
Where are we going?

773
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,500
Where are we going?

774
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,670
You're here.

775
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:50,540
He helps me get things done.

776
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,770
And this is Judge Kim Ga-on.

777
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,810
Nice to meet you.

778
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,410
I guess you were the one who did
a thorough background check on me.

779
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,910
You're very good at your job.

780
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:02,850
You were working hard too, Mr. Kim.

781
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:04,450
You did a thorough
background check on him.

782
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,750
I'm sorry to say this,
but I can't compliment you.

783
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,420
You weren't that good.

784
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,020
I'm sorry to point out

785
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,860
that such jobs aren't my specialty.

786
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,630
You guys are hitting it off.

787
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,900
That's enough for introductions.

788
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:21,070
So you wanted to introduce me to him?

789
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,240
You asked me the other day

790
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,970
how I plan to fight against world leaders.

791
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:29,980
To answer your question,

792
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,450
even before the game begins,
I'll make sure that it's my victory.

793
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,050
How is that possible?

794
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,550
Of course, it won't be easy by myself.

795
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,290
So I have more people helping me
besides this guy.

796
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:43,590
They are everywhere.

797
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,560
So you have people helping you?

798
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,030
They should be here right about now.

799
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,500
Mr. Go.

800
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,340
[I'll meet the lawyer today.]

801
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,510
Sir.

802
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:09,880
[Not murder, professional negligence]

803
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,080
[You're admitting
to professional negligence?]

804
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,480
Mr. Go.

805
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,750
You said five years.

806
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,050
Five years...

807
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,160
Jang Ki-hyun wasn't the only person
you bought off?

808
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,560
I told you

809
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,260
that I must make sure that we win
even before the game begins.

810
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:28,970
Please excuse my behavior
during the trial.

811
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,470
But what about Lee Young-min's trial?
That's impossible to rig.

812
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,540
Right. That would be impossible.

813
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:38,580
But I would have been able to
prepare some spark.

814
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:39,910
Spark?

815
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,610
Starting is half the battle.

816
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,280
She's an aspiring actress.
I liked her voice.

817
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,250
Nice to meet you.

818
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:48,620
I'm a fan.

819
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:49,990
I even signed up at your fan club.

820
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,830
[Hello, Your Honor.]

821
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:01,570
[I'm a huge fan.]

822
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,200
You're so cool.

823
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:05,100
[He's a psycho.]

824
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,410
[I used to work
at a department store's parking lot.]

825
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,170
[It was unfair and infuriating.]

826
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,950
That was pretty good, right?

827
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,160
Can I accept this?

828
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,290
Good job.

829
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,860
Thanks.

830
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,220
So everything we've been doing was a show?

831
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,850
A show?

832
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,690
I don't care if you criticize me.

833
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,000
But you can't invalidate our trials.

834
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,330
If you do, you will be insulting
everyone who mustered up their courage.

835
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:11,700
We just helped them get the ball rolling.

836
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:14,570
We wouldn't have been able to get
anything done without their bravery.

837
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:18,540
Sorry. I'm late.

838
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:20,080
-Hello.
-Hey.

839
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,450
Thank you.

840
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,990
Nice to meet you. I'm Cho Min-sung
of the Regional Investigation Unit.

841
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:31,290
I talked to my team leader,
but his reaction was off.

842
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,460
[Hardworking Police]

843
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,520
[He was annoyed from the get-go.]

844
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,460
[Is he the one who completely went berserk
when you said you'd investigate him?]

845
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,930
[Yes.]

846
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,200
You're Soo-hyun's team leader.

847
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,140
Yes. Soo-hyun may seem too feminine
for the job, but she's a good cop.

848
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,740
Sometimes, she's too eager. That's all.

849
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,740
So is Mr. Kang paying you generously?

850
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,610
Pardon?

851
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,180
You were right.
Money is indeed a strong motive.

852
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,180
For everyone.

853
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,880
Mr. Kim, stop thinking
you have us figured out.

854
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,690
Did I say something wrong?

855
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,020
Do you know why I'm helping Mr. Kang?

856
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,930
Why?

857
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,430
I lost my daughter

858
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,330
to the domestic disinfectants case.

859
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,870
I lived my entire life,
defending the conglomerates.

860
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,340
But when I became a victim,
I didn't know what to do.

861
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,210
I'm sure you know what happened
with the case.

862
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,780
And the sentencing as well.

863
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,110
Mr. Go.

864
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,650
Gosh. Don't call me like that.

865
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,320
I have deceived my client.

866
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,020
And I'm not even a lawyer now.

867
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,820
I'm just a criminal.

868
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,260
Once everything is over,

869
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,060
I will face my punishment.

870
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,170
And this girl got sexually assaulted

871
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,970
when she was drunk.

872
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,300
But she had to watch her assailant
get released

873
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:54,810
on probation.

874
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,380
The judge said that

875
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,080
since he was a promising medical student,
he will be shown leniency.

876
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:04,150
Then, what about me?

877
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,750
Since my future
doesn't seem that promising,

878
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,590
I'm supposed to put up with this?

879
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,530
As for Cho Min-sung,

880
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,400
his older sister worked
at Serim Department Store.

881
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,140
My sister was the breadwinner
who had to take care of his brother.

882
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,740
So she had never taken days off

883
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,510
down to the moment when
the department store started to crack,

884
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,210
made a rumbling sound,
and crumbled down in the end.

885
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:38,780
And do you remember
the sentencing for that case?

886
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,360
Ms. Oh.

887
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,470
You're the chairman of the foundation now.

888
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,240
I heard you're also leading
the Operations Support Task Force.

889
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,240
I'm not that capable,
but I've taken on a lot of work.

890
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,180
I'm aware that
there have been a lot of issues

891
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,050
with the foundation.

892
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,680
Right.

893
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,290
But I'm going to change it.

894
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,990
I'll cut off all ties with politicians
and conglomerates.

895
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:53,060
We'll now focus on helping those in need,

896
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,530
just like when we started.

897
00:58:56,290 --> 00:58:58,830
Okay. It won't be easy though.

898

Don't hesitate to let me know
if there's anything I can help with.

899
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,940

A smile like that is exactly
what the public needs now.

902

Are you satisfied
with just assisting Judge Kang Yo-han?

910
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,850
Many are concerned with his recent moves.

911
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,680
He gave money to a witness

912
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,420
and used the show to figure out
how many people are in support of him.

913
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,960
Some are saying that
the Live Court Department should be led

914

more professional as a judge.

Let's continue to discuss
how the department should be run.

01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,120
Someone needs to keep
their eyes wide open and watch.

918
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:42,430
You could use a necklace.

919
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:51,280
No, it's okay. I can't accept...

920
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:53,140

921
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,220

924

[Special thanks to Park Hyung-su
for his guest appearance.]

1069
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:46,700
[Not people like Heo Joong-se
or Cha Kyung-hee.]

1070
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:49,000
You should take over this country,
Young Master.

1071
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,470
Become a shepherd dog?

1072
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:51,640
[Let's do this.]

1073
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:53,170
She plans to use us.

1074
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,440
[It's time]

1075
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,970
[to go after your sworn enemy]

1076
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:58,180
[and those who smuggled him out.]

1077
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,680
[I'll put together a much more loyal team]

1078
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:02,480
and make sure they get the job done.

1079
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:02,680
[Chairman Jung Sun-ah]

1080
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:04,950
[Do you know how I feel right now?]

1081
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,720
-Let go!
[-Is this none of your business?]

1082
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,550
[You only care about your hunt.]

1083
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:09,790
[If you want revenge, get it.]

1084
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:11,620
[Don't hesitate.]

1085
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:13,590
[Die!]
