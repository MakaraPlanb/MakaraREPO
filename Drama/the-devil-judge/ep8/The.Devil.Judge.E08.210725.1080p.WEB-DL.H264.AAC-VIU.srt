1
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,766
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,101
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:01:12,351 --> 00:01:14,387
(Episode 8)

4
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,942
The only thing that can be thoroughly manipulated...

5
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,696
is the system itself.

6
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:31,666
This is the system.

7
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,136
A system has no chance against power.

8
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:38,507
Power can control a system however it likes.

9
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:01,137
(Establishment of order, promotion of morality)

10
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,536
The fire that killed my brother.

11
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:29,856
They abandoned others to save their skin.

12
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:32,286
I understood that much.

13
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,096
Humans did what a human would.

14
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,596
That's humanity.

15
00:03:37,471 --> 00:03:40,696
But something really shocked me.

16
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:44,267
They came to the hospital.

17
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,066
To see me.

18
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:57,091
I could've saved your brother's whole family,

19
00:03:57,092 --> 00:03:58,450
but the flames...

20
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,660
How did you manage to get out of that fire pit?

21
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:03,961
I am so very impressed.

22
00:04:03,962 --> 00:04:07,301
I thought everyone would die in that fire.

23
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,057
The heavens saved us.

24
00:04:10,672 --> 00:04:11,767
I thought...

25
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:15,497
so much of my poor boy...

26
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:19,467
who I'd never said a kind word to.

27
00:04:26,812 --> 00:04:28,576
I'm sorry for your loss,

28
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:30,346
but I remember his spirit.

29
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:33,957
The rest of us, the living, must continue his legacy.

30
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:36,457
The property he donated.

31
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,391
Our foundation will spend it wisely.

32
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,700
We will share it with love.

33
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:45,630
We must live the rest of our lives like we got a second chance.

34
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:48,271
We must live with a grateful, thankful heart.

35
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,641
- That's what we must do. - Yes.

36
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,666
- We must. - We must share even more.

37
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,341
With thanks. You can trust us.

38
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,410
- Yes. - Amen.

39
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:58,480
We share an experience.

40
00:04:58,481 --> 00:05:01,250
We know very well how you feel. Why wouldn't we?

41
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:03,991
We were in the same boat, in the same fire.

42
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:06,921
We are in the same boat now. This is destiny.

43
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,217
Yes, that's right.

44
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:12,361
- We must be good. - There was no one like Isaac.

45
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,801
He was a great person.

46
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:15,130
I'm so grateful.

47
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,561
He was very generous.

48
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:18,871
Wow, isn't the weather lovely?

49
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:20,327
It's perfect for a picnic.

50
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,837
They had no qualms at all.

51
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,907
They were serious.

52
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:42,717
I can't stand such people being hypocrites too.

53
00:05:43,862 --> 00:05:45,226
It makes me nauseous.

54
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,327
They'll be just the same right now.

55
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,567
"What did we do wrong?"

56
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,871
"The project's to revive the economy."

57
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:56,171
"We're being persecuted for something minor."

58
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:57,567
"This is a political conspiracy."

59
00:05:57,972 --> 00:06:00,166
"We must not give in to this."

60
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:18,657
If the devil really does exist among us,

61
00:06:21,102 --> 00:06:22,197
it would be...

62
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:27,397
the self-pity of the powerful.

63
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:07,907
You look like a mess.

64
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:10,877
Think only of yourself right now.

65
00:07:11,782 --> 00:07:13,577
Not something silly.

66
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:39,337
Inmate number 70618, Doh Young Choon.

67
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,306
Sir, why are you in there?

68
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:47,080
Sir. Come out. Sir!

69
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:50,116
(Inmate Personnel File)

70
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,260
- We are... - We are...

71
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,197
- power! - power!

72
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:03,200
- We are... - We are...

73
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,197
- power! - power!

74
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,996
To achieve his goal,

75
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,907
would he not use another man's pain?

76
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:22,077
If the devil really did exist among us.

77
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:09,487
Some foundation employees agreed to testify?

78
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,161
Is there anything useful?

79
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:16,860
There's a member from Accounting.

80
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,031
Oh, really?

81
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,370
They said they'd call me back by yesterday,

82
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,836
but they haven't yet.

83
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:23,737
Their phones are turned off too.

84
00:10:24,471 --> 00:10:26,267
So I’m trying to figure out what happened.

85
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,007
I'll call you back.

86
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,351
(The late Seo Jeong Hak,)

87
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,851
(Board Chairman of the Social Responsibility Foundation)

88
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:36,676
Here is Mr. Seo's last message...

89
00:10:36,851 --> 00:10:38,617
for all of us.

90
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,487
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

91
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:47,027
I apologize for causing public concern.

92
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:49,757
My carelessness has brought all this about.

93
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:53,367
I was wrong to underestimate the greed of human beings.

94
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,367
I was wrong to allow my subordinates to have too much power.

95
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:01,306
Moreover, I was wrong to trust people too easily.

96
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:05,546
I have made irreparable mistakes.

97
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,247
I apologize to the people who trusted and loved me.

98
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:12,446
I have no excuse.

99
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,857
She's even crazier than I thought.

100
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:20,727
All right.

101
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,871
Now I'll go and prepare a statement to the nation.

102
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:27,097
So you take care of that witch.

103
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:28,796
- Get it done right. - Certainly.

104
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,471
Now if you'll excuse me.

105
00:11:30,471 --> 00:11:32,566
Sir, are you leaving so soon?

106
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:34,407
Keep up the good work.

107
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:37,877
- Sir, we're depending on you. - Good night, sir.

108
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:40,977
Come on.

109
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,357
You're amazing, Ms. Jung.

110
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,066
I've worked for him for years.

111
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:03,367
Okay, then.

112
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:05,466
So tell me...

113
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:10,237
why we should take up your offer instead of his.

114
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:11,576
Let's hear what you have to say.

115
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:15,216
Isn't it obvious?

116
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:19,286
He's a highly respected figure in our country.

117
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:21,716
Like he mentioned earlier,

118
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:24,490
if he releases a statement to the nation,

119
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:26,556
it will affect public opinion.

120
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,597
And?

121
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:35,066
But what if...

122
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:39,607
he leaves his last words before he takes his own life,

123
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,576
how influential do you think it'll be?

124
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,252
Are you saying him being dead is more valuable...

125
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:47,676
than him being alive?

126
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:50,617
Gosh, you're scary, Ms. Jung.

127
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,922
I didn't know you're this type of woman.

128
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:54,186
You give me the chills.

129
00:12:54,262 --> 00:12:56,186
Gosh, you're scary, but I like it.

130
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:58,757
My carelessness...

131
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:01,757
has brought all this about.

132
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:04,600
I apologize to the people who trusted and loved me.

133
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,796
I have no excuse.

134
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,566
From now on,

135
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:13,066
I will handle every single matter of the foundation,

136
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:16,237
and I will take responsibility for everything that happens.

137
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:18,306
The first thing I will do...

138
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,416
is to catch Jung Sun Ah who stole the donation.

139
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:24,716
I will catch that criminal no matter what...

140
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,316
and make sure she pays for her crimes.

141
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:30,216
Wherever she is, I will find her no matter what...

142
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,157
and make her...

143
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:35,556
Jung Sun Ah who stole the donation.

144
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:37,666
I will catch that criminal...

145
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,231
Wherever she is...

146
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:40,597
First thing I will do...

147
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:41,936
is to...

148
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,637
To the people who trusted and loved me.

149
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:50,277
I have no excuse.

150
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,407
All done.

151
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:58,046
Mr. Seo has lived without any regret on his conscience.

152
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:01,416
He has taken his subordinates' guilt...

153
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:04,157
on himself and left us.

154
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:05,861
These are the people who are responsible for this.

155
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:07,762
(The Foundation's finance and accounting team)

156
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,527
When the foundation got suspicious of them,

157
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,471
they destroyed all financial data...

158
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:13,227
and suddenly disappeared.

159
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,672
It turned out they were rebel forces...

160
00:14:15,672 --> 00:14:17,867
who got into the foundation systematically.

161
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:22,306
We will find them and make them pay for their crimes...

162
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:24,851
wherever they are.

163
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:27,382
(The Foundation's finance and accounting team)

164
00:14:27,382 --> 00:14:29,446
What on earth are they up to?

165
00:14:31,591 --> 00:14:33,546
These are the people who were going to tip us off.

166
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:35,316
And now they're framing them.

167
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,231
but these people embezzled the money.

168
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,730
This is the story they came up with.

169
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,002
Then we should release a statement to refute this and demand...

170
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:43,257
"They're awful."

171
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:44,966
"They're so cruel."

172
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,397
"It's too harsh."

173
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:49,666
"How could they do that when they're mourning over his death?"

174
00:14:50,941 --> 00:14:53,306
This country shows generosity in death.

175
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:56,282
They will use the media...

176
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,706
to create an atmosphere of grief over Seo Jeong Hak's death...

177
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:02,546
so that no one will ever argue against his last words.

178
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,017
They turned a crisis into an opportunity.

179
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,546
This is how the ones who conquer the world work.

180
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,786
Watch carefully.

181
00:15:10,062 --> 00:15:13,032
These people embezzled a vast sum of money...

182
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:15,002
and suddenly disappeared.

183
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,161
But surprisingly...

184
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:19,302
a radical organization that led Gwanghwamun Riot...

185
00:15:19,302 --> 00:15:21,137
was behind them.

186
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:22,867
What is more surprising about them...

187
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:24,272
is that most of them...

188
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:27,371
were foreigners without Korean citizenship.

189
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:29,042
This could be a conspiracy of a foreign power...

190
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,936
to put this country in a state of turmoil.

191
00:15:32,012 --> 00:15:33,977
It looks highly suspicious.

192
00:15:34,182 --> 00:15:36,922
The authority caught some of the members...

193
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,292
and are interrogating them.

194
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,062
But a big sum of money has already been sent to the organization.

195
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,191
So we don't know when and where...

196
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,586
they'll engage in terrorism and violence.

197
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:47,292
Everyone, we are in a state of emergency.

198
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:49,556
And who's responsible for this?

199
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:53,432
The previous administration's lackluster approach to crime...

200
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,272
is to blame.

201
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:59,711
I will not only eradicate this poisonous organization...

202
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:02,182
but also prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again.

203
00:16:02,182 --> 00:16:04,951
And I will strongly enforce law and order.

204
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,816
I promise to build a safer country...

205
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:09,552
for the people.

206
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,946
This is a declaration!

207
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:13,721
My loving and respectful fellow citizens.

208
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:15,022
This country...

209
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:17,991
will never be trampled by criminals again.

210
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:21,132
Korea will never be fragile again!

211
00:16:21,132 --> 00:16:23,497
With our new chairwoman of the foundation,

212
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,767
Jung Sun Ah...

213
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:30,802
I promise you to make Korea...

214
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:33,706
stronger and safer!

215
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,826
Jung Sun Ah!

216
00:16:54,292 --> 00:16:57,132
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

217
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:58,532
What can we do against them...

218
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:01,367
if we follow the rule of principles and procedure?

219
00:17:04,912 --> 00:17:07,936
Like I said, there's no justice in reality.

220
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,206
There's only a game.

221
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:12,507
A dreadful unjust game.

222
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:17,176
You must be thinking of your parents but keep it together.

223
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:20,816
Because it seems like the game has started.

224
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,357
It's begun.

225
00:17:59,492 --> 00:18:03,097
(Thug)

226
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:08,236
(Thug)

227
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,706
- Soo Hyun. - Hey, Ga On.

228
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,607
Do you know what time it is?

229
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,047
Did you miss me that much?

230
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,776
- Yes. - Yes?

231
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:25,147
Yes.

232
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,087
I miss you, Soo Hyun.

233
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:42,972
You came to the hospital every day to see me.

234
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,436
But you still miss me?

235
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,607
I said I'll take you out for a drink when you're out of the hospital.

236
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,377
Taking me out for a drink is good.

237
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:52,946
I barely kept myself from drinking.

238
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:54,617
I'll buy all the drinks you want.

239
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:58,047
- I like you this way. - I know.

240
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:04,661
Gosh, it hurts.

241
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,931
- What? Where does it hurt? - The place where I got injured.

242
00:19:06,931 --> 00:19:08,627
The place where you got injured?

243
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:11,797
Come here. Let's go.

244
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:20,506
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

245
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:21,812
Didn't you injure your head?

246
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,476
- Shut it. - Yes, ma'am.

247
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,516
It tastes good today.

248
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:30,147
What are you waiting for? Bottoms up.

249
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,726
So when are you going to tell me?

250
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:42,702
Tell you what?

251
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,627
You're under a lot of stress right now.

252
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:45,901
No, not really.

253
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,397
I wanted to have a drink with you when you're out of the hospital.

254
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,367
Kim Ga On.

255
00:19:57,242 --> 00:19:59,976
I just wanted to see your face.

256
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:03,276
I really don't want to talk about it.

257
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:10,387
How can that be? Is that even possible?

258
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:13,057
I saw him with my own eyes.

259
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,797
How can I ever forget his face?

260
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,827
But how is that...

261
00:20:20,272 --> 00:20:23,337
Even the prison warden can't pull off something like that.

262
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,070
Not even the head of the Korea Correctional Service.

263
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:27,367
It has to be someone higher up. Much higher up.

264
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,676
That's exactly what Kang Yo Han said.

265
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:32,847
It makes sense.

266
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,047
It does make perfect sense.

267
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:38,446
Maybe it makes too much sense.

268
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:40,186
When I investigate,

269
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:43,716
I become suspicious if a story makes perfect sense.

270
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,287
What could be Kang Yo Han's intention?

271
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:50,057
He knows about your past in such detail.

272
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:52,701
He took you there...

273
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:55,466
and presented it to you like a magic trick.

274
00:20:57,302 --> 00:21:00,137
What if... Hypothetically speaking,

275
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,137
what if there were...

276
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,176
an ulterior motive behind all this?

277
00:21:06,151 --> 00:21:10,016
What if Kang Yo Han were stirring you up to drag you into this?

278
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,016
You don't disappoint.

279
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,157
I'll get to the bottom of it.

280
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:24,196
I'll find out who's behind all this.

281
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:28,696
Once you get involved, it becomes an official investigation.

282
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,610
But I can't trust anyone above you.

283
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:34,107
- Still... - Just give me some time.

284
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:36,907
I'll play along with Kang Yo Han...

285
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,407
and find out more.

286
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:40,246
Okay?

287
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,327
It must be hard for you, Ga On.

288
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,436
To be honest, I was quite surprised.

289
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:11,037
By how shameless...

290
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:14,307
the person behind this is.

291
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:16,016
Shameless?

292
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,691
Whoever did this isn't afraid of getting caught.

293
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:21,287
The substitute doesn't even resemble the real one.

294
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:25,057
My mom and dad...

295
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:31,357
My mom and dad passed away like that,

296
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,867
and their only son...

297
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:37,666
doesn't even know what really happened.

298
00:22:41,141 --> 00:22:42,236
I can't...

299
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,647
What's with the music here?

300
00:24:56,664 --> 00:25:00,559
Sun Ah, you did really well.

301
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,499
I love you.

302
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:14,849
Are you that proud of yourself?

303
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:17,718
Of course.

304
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:22,089
You of all people must know how hard I've worked.

305
00:25:23,853 --> 00:25:27,958
How I've worked my way up from the disgusting gutter.

306
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:31,259
I do. You have my admiration for today.

307
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:34,128
You sure are incredible.

308
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,868
You think so?

309
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:50,079
You're right.

310
00:25:50,654 --> 00:25:53,618
Jung Sun Ah is one incredible woman.

311
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,118
Anyway, are you going somewhere?

312
00:25:58,664 --> 00:25:59,759
Yes.

313
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,858
I'm thinking of paying a visit to Master Yo Han.

314
00:26:13,244 --> 00:26:14,339
Today's news.

315
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,312
President Heo Joong Se has announced a series of measures...

316
00:26:17,313 --> 00:26:19,612
to improve law and order.

317
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:23,383
After witnessing the effectiveness of the live court show...

318
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:25,223
Stop. Let me look inside your backpack.

319
00:26:25,224 --> 00:26:26,678
Stand still.

320
00:26:27,323 --> 00:26:28,592
- Put your arms up. - Hand it over.

321
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:29,749
Arms up.

322
00:26:30,293 --> 00:26:33,819
(A strong law and order, a safer Korea)

323
00:26:34,863 --> 00:26:36,658
Things seem to be getting more and more serious.

324
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:40,329
The higher-ups have ordered a tighter control.

325
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,628
I don't know what's happening to the world.

326
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,813
You're obviously too busy carrying out an important task...

327
00:26:48,813 --> 00:26:50,509
to notice anything.

328
00:26:51,384 --> 00:26:52,809
I'm the only fool here.

329
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,552
Judge Oh, what do you...

330
00:26:54,553 --> 00:26:55,648
Forget it.

331
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:00,079
(Call 110 to make a report.)

332
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:04,489
The sentencing guidelines will be revised...

333
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:07,163
to expand the heavy sentences delivered by the live court show...

334
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:08,862
to all courts.

335
00:27:08,863 --> 00:27:12,233
Also, a team will be set up to support...

336
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:14,499
the operation and promotion of the live court show.

337
00:27:14,704 --> 00:27:16,133
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

338
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,229
Who is it?

339
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:24,443
Hi, Master Yo Han.

340
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:27,309
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

341
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:36,618
Have you lost your mind?

342
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,489
How dare you barge in here?

343
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:41,019
Nice to meet you.

344
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:44,403
I'll be leading the Live Court Show Operation Support Committee.

345
00:27:44,404 --> 00:27:45,958
I'm Jung Sun Ah.

346
00:27:46,533 --> 00:27:49,569
I look forward to working with you, Judge Kang Yo Han.

347
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:04,718
This violates the independence of the court.

348
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,383
Judges who hand down lighter sentences than instructed...

349
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:10,448
and dismiss a large number of warrants will be penalized?

350
00:28:10,494 --> 00:28:13,122
The Blue House wants to strengthen order in society.

351
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:14,862
Shouldn't the court cooperate?

352
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:17,762
That's not the court's responsibility.

353
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:19,299
Without a nation,

354
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,903
there is no independence of the court.

355
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:24,769
For a nation to exist,

356
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:28,708
the court must be independent, Chief Justice.

357
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,648
Being the board chairwoman of the foundation wasn't enough?

358
00:28:40,154 --> 00:28:41,249
This is funny.

359
00:28:41,823 --> 00:28:45,188
Do you think you're capable of supporting me?

360
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:49,458
That hurts. I'm being sincere.

361
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,658
Sincere?

362
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:56,173
Yes. I'm forever indebted to you.

363
00:28:56,174 --> 00:28:58,003
Because I made a mess in your sheep farm...

364
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:00,468
so you could steal your position?

365
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:01,968
Is that it?

366
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,782
Well, that too.

367
00:29:04,783 --> 00:29:06,408
But it's much more than that.

368
00:29:07,184 --> 00:29:09,349
It was at your house...

369
00:29:09,783 --> 00:29:12,723
that I saw a beautiful world for the first time in my life.

370
00:29:12,724 --> 00:29:15,418
Everything there was shiny.

371
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,958
I've lived to go back there.

372
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:20,819
Not as a thief but as the owner.

373
00:29:22,593 --> 00:29:25,059
As the owner of the world that you...

374
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:26,799
kicked me out of.

375
00:29:27,263 --> 00:29:28,769
You haven't changed at all.

376
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,299
You're still nothing but...

377
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:33,599
a starving little thief.

378
00:29:34,103 --> 00:29:37,039
You're nothing but a thief who has no idea...

379
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:38,579
how messed up you are.

380
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:46,148
I...

381
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:51,049
love it when you act like this.

382
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:55,234
When you ridicule me, curse at me,

383
00:29:55,234 --> 00:29:56,858
and hurt me.

384
00:29:57,593 --> 00:29:58,858
It thrills me.

385
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,099
That's why...

386
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,668
I want to harass you too.

387
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:08,312
I want to scratch you, bite you,

388
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:09,868
and dig into you.

389
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,309
I guess you still don't know me.

390
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,148
I don't have much patience,

391
00:30:25,763 --> 00:30:27,618
and I don't discriminate between men and women.

392
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:34,059
I...

393
00:30:41,313 --> 00:30:42,938
treat everyone the same.

394
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,608
You and I are very alike.

395
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,378
Is that why you like me?

396
00:30:54,593 --> 00:30:55,749
Yes.

397
00:30:57,394 --> 00:30:58,789
How much do you like me?

398
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,658
How much do you like me?

399
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,108
(DIKE will complete Korea. Download it right now.)

400
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,408
What are you doing?

401
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:28,589
Are you okay?

402
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:30,989
I'm fine.

403
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:32,559
You saved me.

404
00:31:33,994 --> 00:31:35,329
Oh, right.

405
00:31:39,004 --> 00:31:40,529
Chief Kang. What are you...

406
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:43,769
Goodbye.

407
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:45,539
I'll see you again.

408
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:01,183
Darn it.

409
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:02,823
That woman said she's is in charge of...

410
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,958
the Live Court Show Operation Support Committee.

411
00:32:05,563 --> 00:32:06,789
Ms. Jung is?

412
00:32:10,664 --> 00:32:12,434
Hello, Ms. Jung.

413
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:15,968
Judge Oh. We should meet soon, separately.

414
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,468
What is it this time?

415
00:32:31,884 --> 00:32:33,019
Chief Kang.

416
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,948
Am I a member of this bench?

417
00:32:36,194 --> 00:32:37,323
What do you mean?

418
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,823
The entire country has been turned upside down with what you started,

419
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:41,793
but you won't tell me anything about it.

420
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,934
You didn't discuss anything with me before you resigned.

421
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,928
Now you're saying you'll accept tips from the entire country.

422
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:48,628
Why did that woman suddenly show up here?

423
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:50,529
- Judge Oh. - Hold on.

424
00:32:50,603 --> 00:32:51,968
Let me just say one more thing.

425
00:32:55,013 --> 00:32:58,178
I don't know what you think about me,

426
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,083
but I'm a judge in this country...

427
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,853
and a member of this live court show.

428
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,809
If you're going to do things like this, hold the trial on your own.

429
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,849
You've changed Judge Oh.

430
00:33:06,724 --> 00:33:09,223
"If you include me in the live court show,"

431
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:12,688
"it would be my honor just to be able to sit next to you."

432
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,063
Didn't you say this?

433
00:33:14,063 --> 00:33:15,559
I believe you did.

434
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,329
You've become quite ambitious.

435
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,599
You deserve to be congratulated,

436
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,698
but I wonder what brought about this change.

437
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:24,799
I've said everything that I need to tell you.

438
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:33,800
<font color="#0080ff">[VIU Ver] tvN E08 'The Devil Judge'</font>

<font color="#0080ff">Synced with Subcake Android</font>

439
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,819
Is this your method?

440
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:42,254
You're cutting off the people who are right next to you,

441
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,793
so how do you intend to fight against people who move the world?

442
00:33:44,793 --> 00:33:46,259
You can't do it alone.

443
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,029
We'll talk about this later.

444
00:33:52,404 --> 00:33:53,628
Stop by at the house.

445
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,898
It seems like Elijah is quite anxious.

446
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:03,939
They've completely excluded me from making their decisions.

447
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:07,209
(Ministry of Justice, Cha Kyung Hee, Minister of Justice)

448
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:09,709
Seo Jeong Hak suddenly died,

449
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:12,178
and now the Violence Gang?

450
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:14,952
Did you get the personal information on the gang member they caught?

451
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,594
The NIS is saying it's their jurisdiction,

452
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,289
and they're refusing to share any information.

453
00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:20,718
Those little jerks.

454
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:24,528
They're saying they'll only move on the orders of the president.

455
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:31,939
Isn't there a team that collects Heo Joong Se's personal corruption?

456
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:33,504
Yes, ma'am.

457
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,472
I think we should have some of them look into someone else.

458
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,138
Who do you want them to look into?

459
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:43,183
The new board chairwoman of Social Responsibility Foundation,

460
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:44,349
Jung Sun Ah.

461
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:49,048
I think that there's a puppeteer...

462
00:34:49,324 --> 00:34:52,419
pulling the strings of our puppet president.

463
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:12,939
Should we have some coffee and talk?

464
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,479
Sounds good.

465
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:17,579
Elijah.

466
00:35:31,464 --> 00:35:34,634
It seems like you're wondering why I'm not including Oh Jin Joo.

467
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:36,203
The bench is a panel of three judges.

468
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,504
Two is more than half.

469
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:39,238
Are you saying you don't need the minority?

470
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:41,709
But Judge Oh is a good person.

471
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:44,939
I don't believe in fickle things...

472
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,079
like good intentions and beliefs.

473
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:51,879
So the only things you're interested in...

474
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:54,249
are things like resentment and anger?

475
00:35:54,384 --> 00:35:55,588
To say the least.

476
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:59,193
You went after Cha Kyung Hee's sponsor and her son.

477
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:02,559
Is that why you're so fixated on targeting her...

478
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:05,059
since the first trial?

479
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,258
Because of Elijah?

480
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:14,068
Mom!

481
00:36:15,174 --> 00:36:17,508
I don't think it's that simple.

482
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,238
Like I told you last time,

483
00:36:20,484 --> 00:36:22,784
when the people who control the world are united,

484
00:36:22,784 --> 00:36:23,879
there's nothing we can do.

485
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:28,019
So you've isolated the strongest person?

486
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:30,789
Furthermore, she's the easiest target to isolate.

487
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:32,919
She's an easy target?

488
00:36:33,194 --> 00:36:35,258
Do you know why Cha Kyung Hee is so powerful?

489
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,658
It's because she holds the cards to everyone's weaknesses.

490
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:41,099
If Cha Kyung Hee gets cornered, many people will be happy.

491
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,899
And I...

492
00:36:43,603 --> 00:36:46,238
really want the weaknesses...

493
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,068
that Cha Kyung Hee is holding onto.

494
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,338
So you're going to corner her even further.

495
00:36:51,614 --> 00:36:55,349
Until Cha Kyung Hee comes forward to make a deal with her final card.

496
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,818
If you understood it, can you look over this?

497
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:02,388
These are some potential cases for the next live court show.

498
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,218
The show must continue.

499
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,059
The public's support is our only weapon.

500
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:18,169
About Doh Young Choon...

501
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:20,368
Who was the one who ordered that?

502
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,599
I'm not sure.

503
00:37:22,543 --> 00:37:24,368
I'm still looking into it.

504
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:27,109
Regardless of who it is, why would they do that?

505
00:37:27,984 --> 00:37:29,353
He's not a political criminal,

506
00:37:29,353 --> 00:37:32,079
and he's not a card that's worth making a deal over either. So why?

507
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:36,789
If you can't find a particular reason, it's usually about money.

508
00:37:37,594 --> 00:37:38,623
Money?

509
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,289
Money is a strong motivator...

510
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,588
to all people.

511
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:53,899
Must you include Judge Kim Ga On?

512
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,439
- Do you have to go this far? - Whether we like it or not,

513
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,238
I can't let him stand behind my back.

514
00:38:04,114 --> 00:38:06,079
I need to have him on my side...

515
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,189
- Or... - or get rid of him.

516
00:38:09,594 --> 00:38:10,818
He's a risk factor.

517
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,229
Elijah.

518
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,698
Yes? Come in.

519
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:31,879
You're so cold whenever I'm not around.

520
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:37,309
What did the two of you talk about for so long?

521
00:38:37,654 --> 00:38:40,048
It's just some boring work stuff.

522
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:42,818
- Can I sit down? - Go ahead.

523
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:48,428
Right. A conversation between two old men can't be fun.

524
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:49,993
You're so mean.

525
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:51,758
I'm not old. I'm still young.

526
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:53,499
Forget it.

527
00:38:54,563 --> 00:38:56,899
Why haven't you been coming by recently?

528
00:38:58,273 --> 00:39:02,109
I just had some things to think about.

529
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,583
I gave a lot of thought to...

530
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,178
what you said last time.

531
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,019
What was it again?

532
00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:15,749
The evil fraud. The one that killed your parents.

533
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:18,289
I shouldn't have said anything to you.

534
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:19,424
Don't worry about it.

535
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:21,393
How can I not worry about it?

536
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:24,129
You tried to die a few times because of him.

537
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:26,629
Elijah?

538
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:31,073
- Let's kill him. - What?

539
00:39:31,074 --> 00:39:33,769
I think that's the best thing to do.

540
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:35,613
I don't get it.

541
00:39:35,614 --> 00:39:38,543
Why should taxpayers' money go to sheltering,

542
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:40,582
clothing, and feeding him three times a day?

543
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:41,952
How can you even sleep at night?

544
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:44,582
I think I'd be too angry to sleep.

545
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,278
So, I did some thinking.

546
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:50,849
I don't think it's entirely impossible.

547
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,093
I'll hack into the prison system...

548
00:39:53,094 --> 00:39:55,193
to find out when he goes on an outing.

549
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:57,763
You can hide somewhere, ambush him...

550
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:58,859
Elijah.

551
00:39:59,034 --> 00:40:00,129
What?

552
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:06,039
Thank you for putting that much thought into it.

553
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:08,868
It's nothing, really.

554
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:11,838
But I'm really okay now. You don't have to worry.

555
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:16,209
Oh, are you?

556
00:40:16,554 --> 00:40:17,948
Then...

557
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,988
What if...

558
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:29,559
This is just a crazy assumption,

559
00:40:31,063 --> 00:40:34,729
but what if someone had swapped him out?

560
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:36,868
With someone else?

561
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:39,798
What?

562
00:40:40,344 --> 00:40:42,939
You imagined something that crazy?

563
00:40:44,174 --> 00:40:47,142
Instead of wasting time imagining something that silly,

564
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,149
- why not kill him... - Yes.

565
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,908
It's my silly imagination.

566
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:52,718
It is.

567
00:40:53,523 --> 00:40:55,849
Who would do something that crazy?

568
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,019
What for?

569
00:40:58,324 --> 00:40:59,419
Right?

570
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:04,028
Unless a weird person had a weird purpose.

571
00:41:04,993 --> 00:41:06,099
What for?

572
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,129
Forget it.

573
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:12,039
Get some rest.

574
00:41:14,344 --> 00:41:15,568
Sleep well, Elijah.

575
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:22,349
What was that about?

576
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:39,599
(Regional Investigation Unit, Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun)

577
00:41:56,754 --> 00:41:58,309
I was surprised.

578
00:41:58,453 --> 00:42:00,582
I'd been thinking a lot about you,

579
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:01,678
and you called me.

580
00:42:02,793 --> 00:42:05,823
It's just that even if I bring the older guys,

581
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,118
they're no help.

582
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:08,729
That one.

583
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:17,968
- How's this? - It's pretty. It suits you.

584
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,068
Because the model's not too bad.

585
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:25,508
What about that one?

586
00:42:26,014 --> 00:42:27,979
This looks a bit old...

587
00:42:28,853 --> 00:42:31,908
No, I'd say it looks mature.

588
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,048
Does it?

589
00:42:39,464 --> 00:42:43,129
So, is something going on...

590
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:44,459
with Ga On?

591
00:42:45,364 --> 00:42:46,459
Ga On?

592
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,669
I'm not sure.

593
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,868
Didn't you say you're best friends?

594
00:42:53,273 --> 00:42:54,468
Are you concerned?

595
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:57,568
Concerned? Why would I be?

596
00:42:58,844 --> 00:43:00,238
Wrap that for me.

597
00:43:00,284 --> 00:43:01,379
Okay.

598
00:43:01,683 --> 00:43:04,079
And the one this woman was eyeing.

599
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,823
Pardon? Oh.

600
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:06,919
"Woman"?

601
00:43:07,023 --> 00:43:10,548
No, it's fine. I don't need anything.

602
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:12,988
You should pick something out.

603
00:43:13,594 --> 00:43:15,459
It's boring to shop alone.

604
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,189
That's all great but...

605
00:43:20,663 --> 00:43:22,368
shall we go somewhere else too?

606
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:23,999
Somewhere else?

607
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:40,118
Here.

608
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:20,818
You like him.

609
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,088
What, ice cream?

610
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:26,229
You know what I mean.

611
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:28,599
Ga On?

612
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,499
Well, I can't say I dislike him.

613
00:44:32,904 --> 00:44:36,742
I asked him out five times since we met in kindergarten.

614
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:39,979
- Five times? - He said no all five times.

615
00:44:42,254 --> 00:44:43,548
Then why...

616
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:45,448
Why did I keep asking him out?

617
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:48,178
Yes, why did I do that?

618
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:50,823
Wouldn't it have been his looks?

619
00:44:50,824 --> 00:44:53,088
He was pretty cute back then.

620
00:44:53,594 --> 00:44:54,689
But what?

621
00:44:54,793 --> 00:44:55,888
But...

622
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:57,928
he cried.

623
00:44:58,563 --> 00:44:59,658
What?

624
00:45:01,404 --> 00:45:04,568
It was the first time his parents had lost everything,

625
00:45:05,674 --> 00:45:07,868
and he had to quit kindergarten.

626
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,968
He cried his eyes out.

627
00:45:13,284 --> 00:45:15,448
I hated that so much.

628
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:18,709
I hated to see him cry.

629
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,948
There was nothing else I could do.

630
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,349
Before I knew it, I'd blurted out...

631
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,758
that I liked him.

632
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,359
Wasn't that stupid?

633
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:33,329
Then...

634
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:36,999
every time he cried, did you...

635
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:41,338
I saw Ga On cry...

636
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:45,008
as many as five times.

637
00:45:59,163 --> 00:46:03,528
It was like a dark cloud of unhappiness covered his family.

638
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:06,859
It never stopped.

639
00:46:08,464 --> 00:46:09,729
It kept going.

640
00:46:17,643 --> 00:46:19,338
It's getting late.

641
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:21,979
- Shall we go now? - Soo Hyun.

642
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:29,388
Come with me.

643
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:34,459
Sure, Elijah.

644
00:46:42,894 --> 00:46:43,989
Hey, it's me.

645
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:46,958
You investigated Joongwon FNB, right?

646
00:46:48,164 --> 00:46:51,398
Can you look into their finances for the last few years?

647
00:46:52,033 --> 00:46:53,128
Thanks a lot.

648
00:46:56,604 --> 00:46:57,699
Ga On.

649
00:46:58,444 --> 00:47:00,708
I'm sorry I'm late.

650
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:02,443
You must be busy, Mr. Prosecutor.

651
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,313
I should come running when I get a call...

652
00:47:05,314 --> 00:47:08,449
from the most successful of my classmates.

653
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:11,648
- I'm successful? - Of course, you are. You're a star.

654
00:47:13,254 --> 00:47:15,693
Can you sign this for me?

655
00:47:15,694 --> 00:47:16,989
It's for my niece.

656
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:18,889
Okay.

657
00:47:20,234 --> 00:47:22,099
I need to ask for a favor.

658
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:24,628
- What is it? - Well...

659
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,632
There's this inmate.

660
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,273
He took hundreds of millions.

661
00:47:28,274 --> 00:47:31,143
The Crime Proceeds Collection Team was under your department then.

662
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:32,708
I know it's a huge task,

663
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:35,579
but can you see if they recovered anything?

664
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:37,643
Is this for the live court show?

665
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:39,878
No, it's a personal favor.

666
00:47:40,453 --> 00:47:41,748
Help me out, please.

667
00:47:43,084 --> 00:47:44,518
Okay, sure.

668
00:47:45,524 --> 00:47:46,818
In return,

669
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:49,688
I'm going to need a lot of autographs.

670
00:47:50,064 --> 00:47:51,829
One won't do.

671
00:47:52,694 --> 00:47:54,228
Okay. Thanks.

672
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:00,469
Hello.

673
00:48:01,973 --> 00:48:03,742
Are you back for good?

674
00:48:03,743 --> 00:48:05,239
Not really.

675
00:48:05,743 --> 00:48:07,268
They need some looking after.

676
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:09,313
You should come back, not drop by.

677
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:10,909
This is where you live.

678
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:13,409
Someone there needs some taking care of too.

679
00:48:15,653 --> 00:48:18,279
Take care of your own self, please.

680
00:48:18,553 --> 00:48:19,648
What about me?

681
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:23,088
I'm living a shamelessly comfortable life.

682
00:48:28,964 --> 00:48:30,403
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

683
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:32,073
What are you thinking about?

684
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:33,298
Nothing.

685
00:48:34,774 --> 00:48:36,199
By the way, Ga On...

686
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:37,644
Professor.

687
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,168
Goodness. Oh, dear.

688
00:48:43,644 --> 00:48:47,179
- Hello. - This house has too many stairs.

689
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:49,619
My legs are dead.

690
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:51,779
What brings you here at this hour?

691
00:48:58,263 --> 00:48:59,789
Are you finished?

692
00:49:01,294 --> 00:49:02,458
Orange juice?

693
00:49:02,664 --> 00:49:05,533
What you should've brought is soju, not orange juice.

694
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:07,228
Exactly.

695
00:49:07,604 --> 00:49:08,838
He's clueless.

696
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:13,572
I called Soo Hyun to say hi and decided to come by.

697
00:49:13,573 --> 00:49:14,713
She told me you were coming.

698
00:49:14,714 --> 00:49:17,509
We both work at the Supreme Court. You didn't have to.

699
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:21,878
These days, I'm not sure...

700
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,978
what kind of place we work at.

701
00:49:24,084 --> 00:49:27,688
I met Chief Justice today. He sounded more like a commander.

702
00:49:27,794 --> 00:49:30,323
He said all courts should act together.

703
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:34,259
This isn't the nation I fought for when I was young.

704
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:36,858
All officers have been ordered to fire live bullets.

705
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:39,869
I didn't become an officer to shoot citizens.

706
00:49:41,374 --> 00:49:43,774
Police brutality is getting more and more serious.

707
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:45,714
When people get drunk and noisy,

708
00:49:45,714 --> 00:49:48,009
- the police... - Is that so wrong?

709
00:49:49,084 --> 00:49:50,179
Ga On.

710
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:54,283
It's just as abnormal for officers to get beaten up...

711
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,254
by drunk people every night.

712
00:49:56,254 --> 00:49:57,723
That kind of nation is not okay either.

713
00:49:57,723 --> 00:50:00,949
But once a monster is unleashed,

714
00:50:01,093 --> 00:50:03,059
it doesn't know when to stop.

715
00:50:03,194 --> 00:50:05,688
And it's the live court show that woke up that monster.

716
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:08,728
So what's your plan?

717
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:10,929
I'm going to break up your court.

718
00:50:11,263 --> 00:50:13,199
I've lost all trust in the court.

719
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:15,303
I'm going to raise an issue through civic organizations.

720
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,268
When it's reported by conscientious media companies,

721
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:20,009
the opposition party will request an inspection.

722
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:21,338
Ga On.

723
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:24,938
You're at the center of this plan.

724
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:27,708
Everything you've seen, heard, and learned so far...

725
00:50:28,084 --> 00:50:29,579
I need it.

726
00:50:30,024 --> 00:50:32,018
- Is that an order? - It's a request.

727
00:50:32,953 --> 00:50:34,148
And...

728
00:50:34,923 --> 00:50:36,119
I'm sorry.

729
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,699
It's all my fault.

730
00:50:46,473 --> 00:50:49,139
(Associate Judge Kim Ga On)

731
00:51:03,754 --> 00:51:04,878
Hello?

732
00:51:04,953 --> 00:51:06,053
Come to my office.

733
00:51:06,053 --> 00:51:09,719
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

734
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:15,858
Have you had a look?

735
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:18,898
What do you mean?

736
00:51:19,173 --> 00:51:22,139
The cases for the next live court show that I gave you.

737
00:51:22,874 --> 00:51:24,068
Well, yes.

738
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:27,739
You still seem to have a lot going on in your head.

739
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:33,148
I'm taking you somewhere later.

740
00:51:35,823 --> 00:51:37,153
Where is it this time?

741
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:38,378
I have something to show you.

742
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:51,929
Where are we going?

743
00:51:55,303 --> 00:51:56,739
I said, where are we going?

744
00:51:59,743 --> 00:52:00,909
We're here.

745
00:52:02,084 --> 00:52:03,743
This is a friend of mine who helps me.

746
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:06,009
This is Judge Kim Ga On.

747
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:08,048
Nice to meet you.

748
00:52:09,923 --> 00:52:12,624
You must be the one who did a thorough check on me.

749
00:52:12,624 --> 00:52:14,148
Your skills are impressive.

750
00:52:14,254 --> 00:52:16,064
You've been working pretty hard too,

751
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:17,688
checking on Judge Kang.

752
00:52:18,363 --> 00:52:20,989
I'm sorry, but I can't compliment you though.

753
00:52:21,064 --> 00:52:22,659
Your skills weren't impressive at all.

754
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:24,234
I apologize.

755
00:52:24,234 --> 00:52:26,099
Snooping is definitely not my forte.

756
00:52:27,173 --> 00:52:28,869
You two seem to hit it off.

757
00:52:29,743 --> 00:52:31,139
But I think you've introduced yourselves enough.

758
00:52:31,473 --> 00:52:34,309
Is this guy what you wanted to show me?

759
00:52:36,113 --> 00:52:37,478
You once asked me...

760
00:52:37,984 --> 00:52:41,208
how I was going to fight against those who run this world.

761
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:43,219
The answer is that...

762
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:47,688
I make sure I win before the game even starts.

763
00:52:47,823 --> 00:52:49,289
How is that possible?

764
00:52:49,863 --> 00:52:51,789
Of course, it isn't easy if you're alone.

765
00:52:52,363 --> 00:52:55,529
That's why I have people who help me including this guy...

766
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:56,802
here and there.

767
00:52:56,803 --> 00:52:58,773
You mean you have assistants?

768
00:52:58,774 --> 00:53:00,268
They should be here any minute.

769
00:53:04,504 --> 00:53:05,739
Lawyer Ko.

770
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:19,588
I'll meet the lawyer today.

771
00:53:19,593 --> 00:53:20,748
Sir.

772
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,293
But admit to professional negligence?

773
00:53:23,294 --> 00:53:24,694
Lawyer Ko.

774
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:25,989
You said it'd be five years.

775
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,289
Five years.

776
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,398
Jang Ki Young wasn't the only one you bought off?

777
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:34,798
Like I said,

778
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:38,498
I had to make sure I win before the game even starts.

779
00:53:39,073 --> 00:53:42,208
I'm sorry I was out of line the other day, Judge Kim.

780
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:46,708
What about Lee Young Min's trial? That would've been impossible.

781
00:53:46,783 --> 00:53:48,779
Yes, it would've been hard.

782
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:51,818
But I could at least try to start a fire.

783
00:53:52,093 --> 00:53:53,124
A fire?

784
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:54,849
Starting a fire is always the hardest.

785
00:53:56,124 --> 00:53:58,518
She's an aspiring actress. I liked her tone.

786
00:53:59,263 --> 00:54:00,489
Nice to meet you.

787
00:54:00,734 --> 00:54:01,834
I'm a fan.

788
00:54:01,834 --> 00:54:03,228
I'm even in your fan club.

789
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:13,068
Hello, Your Honor.

790
00:54:13,073 --> 00:54:14,809
I'm a huge fan of yours.

791
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:16,413
You're incredible.

792
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:18,314
He's a complete psycho.

793
00:54:18,314 --> 00:54:20,613
I used to work part-time at a department store parking lot.

794
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:22,418
I felt so upset and frustrated.

795
00:54:31,823 --> 00:54:33,188
I didn't do a bad job, did I?

796
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:40,398
Is it really okay to accept this?

797
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,539
You did well.

798
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:45,099
Thank you.

799
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:07,458
Are you saying we've been putting on a show?

800
00:55:07,894 --> 00:55:09,099
A show?

801
00:55:11,564 --> 00:55:13,929
I don't care if you criticize me,

802
00:55:14,173 --> 00:55:17,239
but I don't want you to call our trials fake.

803
00:55:17,803 --> 00:55:21,568
That's an insult to all the people who plucked up their courage.

804
00:55:22,214 --> 00:55:24,938
All we did is help them open their mouths.

805
00:55:25,013 --> 00:55:27,809
Without their courage, we couldn't have done anything.

806
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:31,753
I'm sorry I'm late.

807
00:55:31,754 --> 00:55:33,318
- Hello. - Hello.

808
00:55:34,524 --> 00:55:35,688
Thank you.

809
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:40,228
Nice to meet you. I'm Cho Min Sung from the RIU.

810
00:55:41,694 --> 00:55:44,434
I talked to my chief, but his response is strange.

811
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:45,573
He just got annoyed with me.

812
00:55:45,573 --> 00:55:47,104
Isn't he the one who got mad...

813
00:55:47,104 --> 00:55:48,699
when you said you wanted to dig into Kang Yo Han?

814
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,168
Yes.

815
00:55:51,544 --> 00:55:53,438
So you're Soo Hyun's chief.

816
00:55:53,714 --> 00:55:57,378
Yes. She seems soft on the outside, but she's pretty competent.

817
00:55:57,684 --> 00:55:59,978
She can sometimes get overzealous though.

818
00:56:00,383 --> 00:56:02,978
Is my chief paying you all enough?

819
00:56:03,723 --> 00:56:04,849
What?

820
00:56:05,524 --> 00:56:09,393
I guess money is such a powerful motive...

821
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:10,394
to anyone.

822
00:56:10,394 --> 00:56:13,128
Judge Kim, please don't talk like you know it all.

823
00:56:13,263 --> 00:56:14,929
Was I out of line?

824
00:56:14,964 --> 00:56:18,259
Do you know why I'm helping Judge Kang?

825
00:56:19,973 --> 00:56:21,168
Why is it?

826
00:56:22,343 --> 00:56:24,668
Because of the domestic sanitizer case,

827
00:56:26,044 --> 00:56:27,568
I lost my daughter.

828
00:56:28,673 --> 00:56:31,108
I'd defended conglomerates all my life.

829
00:56:31,283 --> 00:56:34,579
Once I became a victim, I didn't know what to do.

830
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:38,422
You know how that case ended, right?

831
00:56:38,423 --> 00:56:40,018
You must remember the sentence too.

832
00:56:41,053 --> 00:56:42,358
Lawyer Ko.

833
00:56:42,823 --> 00:56:44,889
Please don't call me a lawyer.

834
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:47,533
I've deceived my client.

835
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:49,259
I'm no longer a lawyer.

836
00:56:49,564 --> 00:56:51,059
I'm just a criminal.

837
00:56:51,703 --> 00:56:53,498
When all this comes to an end,

838
00:56:53,673 --> 00:56:56,298
I'll pay for what I did.

839
00:56:59,644 --> 00:57:02,409
This young lady here was sexually harassed...

840
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:04,184
while drunk,

841
00:57:04,184 --> 00:57:06,513
and she had to watch the offender...

842
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,048
get released on probation.

843
00:57:09,754 --> 00:57:11,619
The judge said...

844
00:57:12,223 --> 00:57:14,223
the offender was a promising medical student...

845
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:15,318
and should be treated favorably.

846
00:57:16,093 --> 00:57:17,389
What about me?

847
00:57:18,664 --> 00:57:20,989
Since I don't have a promising future,

848
00:57:21,064 --> 00:57:22,829
am I supposed to put up with it?

849
00:57:30,173 --> 00:57:31,768
Chief Cho Min Sung's sister...

850
00:57:32,203 --> 00:57:35,639
used to work at Serim Department Store.

851
00:57:35,814 --> 00:57:39,378
As the breadwinner of the family,

852
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:40,978
she worked 365 days a year.

853
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:44,748
She was working even when the walls started cracking...

854
00:57:44,823 --> 00:57:47,449
and making noises, and the building crumbled.

855
00:57:48,723 --> 00:57:52,018
Do you remember the sentence from that case?

856
00:58:31,403 --> 00:58:32,599
Judge Oh?

857
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:41,708
You're the board chairwoman now, right?

858
00:58:42,383 --> 00:58:43,513
I heard you're in charge of...

859
00:58:43,513 --> 00:58:45,478
the Live Court Show Operation Support Committee too.

860
00:58:45,714 --> 00:58:48,478
I'm not that capable, but I have taken on a lot of work.

861
00:58:52,694 --> 00:58:56,418
I know that there were a lot of issues...

862
00:58:56,564 --> 00:58:58,289
due to our foundation.

863
00:58:58,823 --> 00:58:59,929
Right.

864
00:59:00,064 --> 00:59:01,529
I'll try to change things.

865
00:59:01,564 --> 00:59:04,202
I'll cut off ties with politics and conglomerates...

866
00:59:04,203 --> 00:59:06,298
and focus on helping those in need.

867
00:59:06,673 --> 00:59:07,768
Just like how we started.

868
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:12,068
Right. It won't be easy,

869
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:15,443
but if there's anything I can help you with, tell me.

870
00:59:15,444 --> 00:59:17,179
I'd love to help.

871
00:59:20,553 --> 00:59:21,748
You're so pretty.

872
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:26,548
What the public needs right now is your smile.

873
00:59:26,723 --> 00:59:29,358
When things are hard, you need hope.

874
00:59:29,493 --> 00:59:32,418
Smiles, tears, and familiarity.

875
00:59:33,564 --> 00:59:37,029
Judge Kang is mysterious and charismatic,

876
00:59:38,703 --> 00:59:41,228
but he seems like someone living in a different world.

877
00:59:44,444 --> 00:59:45,539
Right.

878
00:59:46,473 --> 00:59:50,838
I think that you should be the one to stand in the spotlight.

879
00:59:50,984 --> 00:59:52,079
In the spotlight?

880
00:59:52,283 --> 00:59:56,579
Are you satisfied with the foundations that Judge Kang set?

881
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:04,088
There are a lot of people who are worried about Judge Kang's behavior.

882
01:00:04,164 --> 01:00:05,893
He gave a witness money,

883
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:08,659
and he has raised his public support through the show.

884
01:00:09,334 --> 01:00:13,172
Some people are saying that the live court show should be led...

885
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:15,128
by someone who is more like a judge.

886
01:00:31,524 --> 01:00:32,719
Judge Oh?

887
01:00:35,723 --> 01:00:39,358
Let's keep talking about how the live court show should be run.

888
01:00:39,533 --> 01:00:43,358
Someone needs to keep their eyes wide open and watch.

889
01:00:53,973 --> 01:00:55,668
I feel like there's something missing.

890
01:01:01,953 --> 01:01:04,518
No, it's okay. If you do this, I'll be put in a difficult...

891
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:06,389
This is just a costume.

892
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:11,458
A costume?

893
01:01:13,863 --> 01:01:15,358
You have to look familiar,

894
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:17,463
but when you're on stage,

895
01:01:17,464 --> 01:01:20,969
you have to overpower everyone without missing a beat.

896
01:01:22,104 --> 01:01:24,139
Because power is appealing.

897
01:01:48,564 --> 01:01:51,798
(Soo Hyun)

898
01:01:56,444 --> 01:01:57,539
Hello, Soo Hyun.

899
01:02:04,843 --> 01:02:07,282
Ga On. You're the heart of that drawing.

900
01:02:07,283 --> 01:02:10,579
I need everything that you heard and saw until now.

901
01:02:16,164 --> 01:02:17,963
- Hello? - Hey, Ga On.

902
01:02:17,964 --> 01:02:19,389
Are you ready to sign some autographs?

903
01:02:26,403 --> 01:02:28,604
(Report for Termination of Investigation)

904
01:02:28,604 --> 01:02:30,898
(The results of tracking Doh Young Choon's criminal profits)

905
01:02:31,044 --> 01:02:32,168
(July 16, 130,000 dollars, Sold real estate)

906

907
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:52,728
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

908
01:03:04,444 --> 01:03:05,802
What are you doing?

909
01:03:05,803 --> 01:03:07,068
You knew about it, didn't you?

910
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:09,438
The date when Doh Young Choon was suddenly transferred,

911
01:03:09,743 --> 01:03:12,612
the date when the computerized system was updated,

912
01:03:12,613 --> 01:03:15,084
and the date when the team tracking his criminal profits was stopped...

913
01:03:15,084 --> 01:03:16,279
were all the same.

914
01:03:16,883 --> 01:03:19,389
When Joongwon FNB, the company Cha Kyung Hee's husband runs,

915
01:03:19,593 --> 01:03:21,688
was facing bankruptcy,

916
01:03:22,223 --> 01:03:24,663
Cha Kyung Hee became Minister of Justice,

917
01:03:24,664 --> 01:03:26,829
and that's when the fraud who conned people out of millions of dollars...

918
01:03:27,194 --> 01:03:30,898
and kept his criminal profits a secret suddenly disappeared.

919
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:33,929
I'm pretty sure you found out before I did. Why didn't you tell me?

920
01:03:34,274 --> 01:03:36,969
If you didn't find out yourself, you would've doubted me.

921
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:38,672
You would've thought I did something.

922
01:03:38,673 --> 01:03:40,112
Why did you go in the first place?

923
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:42,338
What led you to go see Doh Young Choon...

924
01:03:42,374 --> 01:03:44,179
which led you to find out he had been switched?

925
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:45,842
You already know the reason why.

926
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:49,012
You wanted me to see Doh Young Choon living like a king in prison...

927
01:03:49,013 --> 01:03:52,652
and see how comfortable he was to make me lose my mind in anger.

928
01:03:52,653 --> 01:03:54,693
So you went there before I did to check on him. Right?

929
01:03:54,694 --> 01:03:57,463
You wanted to shake me, someone who kept interfering with your plans.

930
01:03:57,464 --> 01:03:58,619
I wanted...

931
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,688
you to be on my side.

932
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,529
If I needed to, I would've done something even worse.

933
01:04:06,533 --> 01:04:08,429
Whether it was switching him or something else.

934
01:04:09,104 --> 01:04:10,668
That's my method.

935
01:04:11,573 --> 01:04:12,668
That...

936
01:04:13,473 --> 01:04:15,369
won't change in the future.

937
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:43,498
Ga On.

938
01:04:43,843 --> 01:04:44,938
Professor.

939
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:47,909
I was surprised you called me.

940
01:04:48,374 --> 01:04:49,478
You punk.

941
01:04:51,414 --> 01:04:52,509
Right.

942
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:55,449
Have you made your decision?

943
01:04:59,794 --> 01:05:01,389
You have a lot of gray hair now.

944
01:05:01,794 --> 01:05:02,889
Goodness.

945
01:05:03,323 --> 01:05:04,893
The change in the color of my hair isn't a big deal.

946
01:05:04,894 --> 01:05:07,829
Having a full head of hair is really lucky at my age.

947
01:05:08,263 --> 01:05:10,233
To all my fellow patriotic citizens whom I love and respect.

948
01:05:10,234 --> 01:05:12,032
Who's going to create a safe Korea?

949
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,072
Don't you want Korea to be safe?

950
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:16,472
We have to make our country like that.

951
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:17,643
Are you going to leave everything to the police?

952
01:05:17,644 --> 01:05:20,972
Oh, no. No, that won't work.

953
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:22,472
I've been watching this all day.

954
01:05:22,473 --> 01:05:23,742
- This is so funny. - Who will do it?

955
01:05:23,743 --> 01:05:26,079
The people are going to do it. That's right.

956
01:05:26,113 --> 01:05:28,583
- What should we do? - We have to clean it up.

957
01:05:28,584 --> 01:05:30,583
Go out into the streets and see for yourself.

958
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:34,322
It's filled with vagrants, hobos, and the socially discontent.

959
01:05:34,323 --> 01:05:36,063
Especially the foreigners!

960
01:05:36,064 --> 01:05:39,433
These foreigners are the ones behind all the brutal crimes.

961
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:42,492
What should we do? We need to get rid of all of them!

962
01:05:42,493 --> 01:05:43,599
Who will do it?

963
01:05:51,903 --> 01:05:54,643
- "We worked hard." - "Please pay us."

964
01:05:54,644 --> 01:05:56,443
"We worked hard."

965
01:05:56,444 --> 01:05:58,813
Is that the only Korean you know how to say?

966
01:05:58,814 --> 01:06:01,853
These pieces of trash that dirty our country deserve to be flogged.

967
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:02,922
They deserve to be flogged!

968
01:06:02,923 --> 01:06:04,648
Patriotic citizens!

969
01:06:05,124 --> 01:06:08,119
Tonight, we will become the real heroes.

970
01:06:08,124 --> 01:06:11,262
We'll take back our country. How? Like this!

971
01:06:11,263 --> 01:06:14,228
We need to stop all this craziness.

972
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:17,659
Anger is contagious.

973
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:20,068
Who created it?

974
01:06:22,434 --> 01:06:23,539
What?

975
01:06:24,173 --> 01:06:27,009
This craziness, the people's anger.

976
01:06:28,573 --> 01:06:30,739
Who was the one who created it?

977
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:39,949
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

978
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:41,219
What...

979
01:06:41,754 --> 01:06:43,458
What do you think about this?

980
01:06:43,923 --> 01:06:45,963
It's a bit gross, ma'am.

981
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:48,759
What are you saying? You're talking like a cop.

982
01:06:53,303 --> 01:06:55,099
(Provide compensation!)

983
01:06:57,104 --> 01:06:58,838
Elijah. I'm sorry.

984
01:06:59,004 --> 01:07:01,268
- Wait here for a second. - What?

985
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:05,512
Don't come out. Okay?

986
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:06,909
What? Soo Hyun.

987
01:07:06,984 --> 01:07:10,678
Hey. Did you work hard for a long time?

988
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:12,678
Please prepare yourself.

989
01:07:25,263 --> 01:07:26,369
Put your hands up.

990
01:07:27,274 --> 01:07:28,369
Put the camera down.

991
01:07:30,444 --> 01:07:32,443
Do you think that people are angry...

992
01:07:32,444 --> 01:07:34,938
because they are fools and were instigated?

993
01:07:35,614 --> 01:07:37,279
It started someplace else.

994
01:07:38,013 --> 01:07:39,779
It started with bad people.

995
01:07:40,654 --> 01:07:44,082
Those evil people who made good people shed tears.

996
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,348
Wanting those people to be punished properly...

997
01:07:46,753 --> 01:07:47,989
Is that...

998
01:07:48,123 --> 01:07:50,089
Is that too much to ask?

999
01:07:50,864 --> 01:07:53,089
- Ga On. - You guys should've done better.

1000
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:56,302
If people like you did better...

1001
01:07:56,303 --> 01:07:58,962
If you did better as a chief justice,

1002
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:00,428
people wouldn't need to do this.

1003
01:08:01,274 --> 01:08:03,669
If only the people who are in charge of justice did their jobs well.

1004
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:14,079
Did you...

1005
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,178
make your decision?

1006
01:08:19,623 --> 01:08:21,449
You're the one...

1007
01:08:23,293 --> 01:08:24,619
who forced me to choose.

1008
01:08:25,824 --> 01:08:29,329
If there's no justice in reality and it's just a game,

1009
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:33,999
I would like to be on the winning team.

1010
01:09:54,013 --> 01:09:55,178
Are you a cop?

1011
01:09:56,923 --> 01:09:58,119
Will you shoot me?

1012
01:09:59,753 --> 01:10:00,949
Shoot.

1013
01:10:03,694 --> 01:10:05,419
You can't anyway.

1014
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:07,159
Put that down.

1015
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:09,289
Film me.

1016
01:10:17,404 --> 01:10:19,438
Shoot me if you want!

1017
01:10:19,713 --> 01:10:22,513
Can a cop aim a gun at the heart...

1018
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:24,343
of an unarmed civilian?

1019
01:10:24,343 --> 01:10:25,808
Aren't you ashamed?

1020
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,388
Do you regret it?

1021
01:10:45,564 --> 01:10:47,029
I'll promise you one thing.

1022
01:10:49,003 --> 01:10:50,699
The man who stole from your parents.

1023
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:54,209
And the people who smuggled him away.

1024
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:57,508
They will pay for what they did.

1025
01:10:58,444 --> 01:10:59,848
Very cruelly.

1026
01:11:02,154 --> 01:11:03,779
It's not just about revenge.

1027
01:11:04,324 --> 01:11:05,518
Then what is it?

1028
01:11:07,793 --> 01:11:09,289
I want to fight...

1029
01:11:09,763 --> 01:11:11,188
the corrupt world.

1030
01:11:24,104 --> 01:11:29,138
(The Devil Judge)

1031
01:11:57,074 --> 01:11:59,938
Not people like Heo Joong Se and Cha Kyung Hee.

1032
01:11:59,973 --> 01:12:02,239
You should take over the country.

1033
01:12:02,244 --> 01:12:03,684
Become a shepherd dog?

1034
01:12:03,684 --> 01:12:04,842
Let's do this.

1035
01:12:04,843 --> 01:12:06,383
She wants to use us.

1036
01:12:06,383 --> 01:12:07,678
It's time to go after...

1037
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:09,209
your sworn enemy.

1038
01:12:09,314 --> 01:12:11,419
And the people who got him out.

1039
01:12:11,423 --> 01:12:13,894
I'll create a much more loyal group...

1040
01:12:13,894 --> 01:12:15,718
and give them the job.

1041
01:12:16,324 --> 01:12:18,163
Do you know how I feel right now?

1042
01:12:18,163 --> 01:12:19,934
- Let me go! - It's not about you?

1043
01:12:19,934 --> 01:12:21,789
Is your hunt the only one that counts?

1044
01:12:21,793 --> 01:12:23,029
If you want revenge, get it.

1045
01:12:23,534 --> 01:12:24,858
Do not hesitate.

1046
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:26,898
Die!
