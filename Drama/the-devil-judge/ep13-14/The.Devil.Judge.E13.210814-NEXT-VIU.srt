1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:16,025
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,361
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:21,091
No, Judge.

4
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:24,131
Don't come up here. Don't!

5
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,372
No, Judge...

6
00:00:29,106 --> 00:00:31,471
Don't come upstairs, please.

7
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,712
Please, don't come here!

8
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:47,181
Please don't come up here, Judge.

9
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:49,221
It's dangerous.

10
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,861
I said, don't!

11
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:07,971
Put that down.

12
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:12,682
You know,

13
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:16,652
I want you to be lonely, Young Master.

14
00:01:17,387 --> 00:01:18,581
Like me.

15
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,851
Then perhaps you'd stay by my side.

16
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:25,262
If there were no one else by your side.

17
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,661
Professor!

18
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:31,702
Don't do this!

19
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:35,232
- Let go. - No way.

20
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:24,282
Professor.

21
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:28,526
Help us! No, mister!

22
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:29,851
Mister!

23
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:33,766
Stop it! Let go!

24
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,336
Let go of me!

25
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:36,562
Let go!

26
00:02:37,737 --> 00:02:39,332
I won't go!

27
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:41,971
No!

28
00:02:42,476 --> 00:02:43,671
Darn them.

29
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,345
Don't do this to me!

30
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:48,812
Let me go!

31
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,285
Let go.

32
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:54,815
Are you okay? Get out.

33
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:56,082
Are you okay?

34
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,385
It's okay. Are you okay?

35
00:02:57,386 --> 00:03:00,026
Yes. Thank you.

36
00:03:00,027 --> 00:03:02,391
- Go that way. - Thank you.

37
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:04,391
Ga On!

38
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:06,962
It's been a while.

39
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,661
It's me. Don't you remember me?

40
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,131
It has been a long time.

41
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,272
Darn you. Die!

42
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:22,342
Get him.

43
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,321
I will...

44
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:36,992
kill you...

45
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:40,421
in a lonely, miserable way.

46
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:45,661
In a way that suits you perfectly.

47
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:08,791
Does it hurt a lot?

48
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,492
Yes.

49
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,092
Too bad.

50
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,641
You need to go and save Ga On.

51
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,412
Go to the Hyungsan-dong slum.

52
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,852
I told you.

53
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,982
That I want you to be dead lonely.

54
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,951
(Redevelopment kills the people. We are against it.)

55
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,076
Lieutenant Yoon? It's Kang Yo Han.

56
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:40,206
What do you want?

57
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,711
Ga On's in danger. Find him.

58
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,946
What?

59
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:46,711
The Hyungsan-dong slum. Right now.

60
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,191
Your life really blows.

61
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:32,792
Just as much as mine.

62
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:39,232
It was almost over.

63
00:07:41,507 --> 00:07:43,831
You just had to live your own life.

64
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,781
Me...

65
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:56,912
and you...

66
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:39,362
The receiver cannot be reached.

67
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,161
Elijah won't pick up.

68
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:47,962
Elijah...

69
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,242
Gosh, let go of me.

70
00:09:34,987 --> 00:09:36,082
No!

71
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,352
- Where did he go? - Get him!

72
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:42,891
(221S 3584)

73
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:49,997
(221S 3584)

74
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:51,232
Kim Ga On!

75
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:13,252
Hey!

76
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:19,061
(10S 0846)

77
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:42,511
Hey!

78
00:10:44,456 --> 00:10:45,551
(72L 0685)

79
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:51,822
Excuse me.

80
00:10:59,336 --> 00:11:04,732
(Oh my Judge Kim, Hope everything comes up roses.)

81
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:20,551
(Pandemic Emergency Assistance Destination: Dream Home Village)

82
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:22,021
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

83
00:11:23,527 --> 00:11:26,862
(221S 3584)

84
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:32,901
- Soo Hyun. - I'm good if you're not hurt.

85
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:35,872
But why were you there?

86
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:39,401
I got a strange phone call.

87
00:11:39,806 --> 00:11:42,712
He told me to go there if I want to save Professor Min.

88
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,011
What are you talking about?

89
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:46,141
I talked to the professor this morning.

90
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,011
He's resting fine at the hospital.

91
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:50,852
Are you sure?

92
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:56,521
Then that son of a gun Juk Chang lied to get me there.

93
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:03,732
How did you know I was there?

94
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,362
I just...

95
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:09,031
I got the message from the police radio.

96
00:12:11,946 --> 00:12:14,507
Ladies and gentlemen. A plague virus...

97
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:17,572
reemerged in the Hyungsan-dong slum.

98
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,647
We can fight this again.

99
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:22,452
Whatever difficulty we face,

100
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,112
we can overcome it.

101
00:12:26,727 --> 00:12:27,921
Judge.

102
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:31,192
Judge, you have to get up.

103
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,791
Judge, you have to wake up now.

104
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,801
Judge.

105
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:46,541
Judge, get up.

106
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:49,342
Judge.

107
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,181
Judge, you should get up.

108
00:12:56,716 --> 00:12:57,881
Judge.

109
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,421
- Judge. - Judge.

110
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:18,072
How are you feeling?

111
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,942
We stopped the bleeding for now.

112
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:24,472
Are you okay?

113
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:28,381
People who assisted you are being attacked.

114
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:30,357
I was worried about you.

115
00:13:30,357 --> 00:13:32,651
I tracked your location and found you here.

116
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:39,661
We can't find Han So Yoon.

117
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:41,891
What?

118
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:44,862
You two go find Han So Yoon.

119
00:14:11,027 --> 00:14:12,492
Hello.

120
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,822
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

121
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:18,092
Gosh, you startled me.

122
00:14:18,137 --> 00:14:21,035
Why are you yelling? I couldn't get it because I was asleep.

123
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:22,332
Listen to me carefully.

124
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:25,572
Whoever comes to our house, do not open the door.

125
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:27,541
Just stay in your room. Do you understand?

126
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,311
Okay.

127
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:35,017
A plague virus reemerged in Hyunsan-dong.

128
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:37,157
It’s an area where a group of people in poverty reside.

129
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:39,756
The government and Social Responsibility Foundation are...

130
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:41,952
supporting relief activities for the resident in...

131
00:14:53,237 --> 00:14:54,401
Elijah...

132
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:59,342
How did you know I like this?

133
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:02,112
It's delicious.

134
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,141
Where did you buy it?

135
00:15:09,286 --> 00:15:11,352
You and I have the same taste.

136
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:15,391
It's good.

137
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:29,771
You're here.

138
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:40,381
You're late, Judge.

139
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:44,011
She saw strange men in front of the house.

140
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:47,421
I could've been in trouble if it wasn't for her.

141
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:50,692
I heard you asked her to check on me.

142
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,161
Oh, right. I did.

143
00:15:57,966 --> 00:15:59,131
Thank you.

144
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,661
Don't mention it.

145
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,181
Let me do that for you.

146
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:32,801
I want you to be lonely, Young Master.

147
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,401
Like me.

148
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:42,271
Here.

149
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:57,921
Thank you.

150
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,331
Elijah, why don't you go back to your room?

151
00:17:05,637 --> 00:17:07,761
I need to talk to Ms. Jung.

152
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,531
She can't go.

153
00:17:10,537 --> 00:17:14,071
We just got close. Isn't that right?

154
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:20,341
You're an interesting person.

155
00:17:20,787 --> 00:17:23,482
I think you and I will get along well...

156
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:24,652
because we're similar.

157
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:31,291
We are, aren't we?

158
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:33,361
We are so similar.

159
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:37,732
We're both smart and ruthless.

160
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:41,861
And we're both a little bit broken.

161
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:50,311
Master Yo Han, this is only the beginning.

162
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:53,841
My goodness.

163
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:56,982
But don't cross the line.

164
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,781
Gosh, what am I doing?

165
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,351
I went over the line. Silly me.

166
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,192
I'm sorry, Elijah.

167
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:09,561
See you later.

168
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,271
What's wrong with her? She's weird.

169
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,982
Why are you sweating so much?

170
00:18:28,887 --> 00:18:30,252
Did something happen to you?

171
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:33,752
No.

172
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:38,791
What is this?

173
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,692
Is this blood?

174
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:42,791
I'm okay.

175
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,502
I'm okay, Elijah.

176
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:55,841
I'm okay now.

177
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:08,281
I'm okay now.

178
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,091
You said you didn't get hurt.

179
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:28,702
I'm sorry,

180
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:30,811
Soo Hyun.

181
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:37,412
For what?

182
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,652
For putting you through all that.

183
00:19:45,157 --> 00:19:46,761
When Cha Kyung Hee died.

184
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,702
You don't have to apologize.

185
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:56,831
I've never been a great cop anyway.

186
00:20:00,006 --> 00:20:03,511
I know that Kang Yo Han's ways are not right.

187
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,511
I know that it's illegal for a judge to do that.

188
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,281
But I can't stand it.

189
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:16,591
If I don't do this, I'll go crazy.

190
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:20,361
I don't deserve to be next to you.

191
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:24,791
I've been a nuisance to you since we were little.

192
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:27,202
I know it's shameless,

193
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:30,432
but I can't live without you.

194
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:33,942
I think I'll really die.

195
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,742
You're such a fool.

196
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,281
I've had enough.

197
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,412
I can't stand the stupid things you say anymore.

198
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:48,922
- Soo Hyun. - Can't you see?

199
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,195
I don't care whether or not you deserve something.

200
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:54,121
I don't know what's right and wrong or what's happening to the world.

201
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:55,492
But please...

202
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:01,261
don't make me see you in danger again.

203
00:21:04,776 --> 00:21:06,242
Don't cry.

204
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:08,702
Don't become miserable.

205
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,642
Please stop ruining your life.

206
00:21:12,716 --> 00:21:15,111
That's all I need, Ga On.

207
00:21:16,986 --> 00:21:18,912
You're all I need,

208
00:21:20,186 --> 00:21:21,281
Ga On.

209
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:17,445
I'll get going. I need to make sure everything's okay outside.

210
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,485
You stay put.

211
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:21,841
There might be another attack. Bye.

212
00:22:22,557 --> 00:22:23,682
Soo Hyun.

213
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,892
- See you. - Wait, Soo Hyun...

214
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,275
What was his name, Juk Chang?

215
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:57,344
I like the way he handles things.

216
00:22:57,345 --> 00:22:58,814
He's quite bold.

217
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:01,515
- He works extremely fast. - Yes.

218
00:23:01,516 --> 00:23:05,081
Those who have nothing to lose are often good at their jobs.

219
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,551
Ms. Jung, what about those who were helping Judge Kang?

220
00:23:09,296 --> 00:23:10,594
Have they been taken care of?

221
00:23:10,595 --> 00:23:14,121
Yes, most of them were picked up by the evacuation bus.

222
00:23:14,865 --> 00:23:16,891
Human lives come first, right?

223
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:21,131
I'm glad that you know that.

224
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,531
Come in.

225
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,141
Come on in.

226
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,281
Are you done filming the emergency broadcast?

227
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,740
You're doing a good job.

228
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:39,124
Judge Oh, our trusted judge,

229
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,055
has put the citizens at ease.

230
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:43,621
- Give her a big hand! - Way to go!

231
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:53,601
By the way, how serious is the situation?

232
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:55,901
I heard that the mutant virus is quite deadly.

233
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,874
I'm worried about its effect on the working-class residential area.

234
00:23:58,875 --> 00:24:01,341
Don't worry too much.

235
00:24:01,946 --> 00:24:03,541
Emergency measures have been taken...

236
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,141
throughout the area.

237
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,255
Instead of just filming a broadcast,

238
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:10,685
maybe I should go out there and help...

239
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,081
Hold on a second.

240
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,121
I think it's best...

241
00:24:15,925 --> 00:24:18,255
to leave that to professionals. Don't you agree?

242
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,361
Of course.

243
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,031
Okay, I understand.

244
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,730
Now, if you'll excuse me.

245
00:24:31,476 --> 00:24:35,101
Judge Oh, you should start getting ready.

246
00:24:37,345 --> 00:24:38,440
Pardon?

247
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:42,041
To become the presiding judge.

248
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,791
Let's have a drink together sometime.

249
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,535
Following the breakout of the mutant virus in Hyungsan-dong,

250
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,604
the Dream Home Village project is progressing...

251
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,674
faster than initially planned.

252
00:25:06,675 --> 00:25:09,775
As a result, Social Responsibility Foundation is raising additional...

253
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,015
Stay put...

254
00:25:11,016 --> 00:25:13,015
- and get good rest. - Director Jung will be leading...

255
00:25:13,016 --> 00:25:14,515
- Thank you. - efforts to contain the virus...

256
00:25:14,516 --> 00:25:17,510
and develop medicine.

257
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:20,324
If you'd like to make a donation,

258
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:22,695
you can find more information...

259
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:25,455
on the foundation's official website.

260
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:27,621
We look forward to your active participation.

261
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:30,690
Are you okay?

262
00:25:30,895 --> 00:25:32,901
How did you get hurt so badly?

263
00:25:33,806 --> 00:25:35,000
It's no big deal.

264
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:38,470
- Are you sure? - Yes.

265
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:43,311
Don't worry. I'll stay healthy...

266
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,841
until you can stand on your own feet and kill me.

267
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,510
What?

268
00:25:50,885 --> 00:25:52,555
What are you talking about?

269
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:55,055
- Do you think I'll be worried? - Moving on.

270
00:25:55,056 --> 00:25:59,094
President Heo will make an emergency statement shortly.

271
00:25:59,095 --> 00:26:02,695
He will be delivering the government's position...

272
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:04,235
on the mutant virus situation in Hyungsan-dong.

273
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:07,331
All citizens are asked to pay attention.

274
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,344
- Hello? - Mr. Ko.

275
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:18,010
Judge Kang, are you all right?

276
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,781
Yes, I'm fine.

277
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:21,811
Have you found Ms. Han yet?

278
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,551
What about the others?

279
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:26,084
I think they got taken away by the foundation.

280
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,324
Using evacuation as an excuse,

281
00:26:27,325 --> 00:26:29,555
they're taking people away as they like.

282
00:26:29,556 --> 00:26:33,361
In this emergency situation, all citizens' lives are at risk.

283
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:35,091
From now on,

284
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:39,164
the press must follow the government's instructions.

285
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:43,730
Also, a 10pm curfew will be introduced.

286
00:26:47,175 --> 00:26:49,170
This morning, the government rounded up...

287
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:52,785
a group of rebels who disturbed public order...

288
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:55,841
by spreading false rumors...

289
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:58,581
and is currently looking into those who are behind them.

290
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,205
We can't find Han So Yoon.

291
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,334
Have you found Ms. Han yet?

292
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:16,401
I think they got taken away by the foundation.

293
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,805
Despite the terrible events from 10 years ago...

294
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:25,170
Whenever I see you, Judge Kang, I feel bad for you.

295
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,914
Judge Kang, what happened?

296
00:27:31,915 --> 00:27:34,055
Since I don't have a promising future,

297
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:35,924
am I supposed to put up with it?

298
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:37,891
Yo Han.

299
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,894
Is this your method?

300
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:42,935
You're cutting off the people who are right next to you,

301
00:27:42,936 --> 00:27:45,035
so how do you intend to fight against people who move the world?

302
00:27:45,036 --> 00:27:46,601
That's my method.

303
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:48,505
That won't change in the future.

304
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,904
You know what kind of people we're up against.

305
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,775
They're going to be more high-spirited now.

306
00:27:52,776 --> 00:27:54,500
You don't know what they will do next.

307
00:28:01,415 --> 00:28:03,785
I never mistook my actions for justice.

308
00:28:03,786 --> 00:28:06,621
I am just making certain choices.

309
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:10,795
Judge Kang Yo Han...

310
00:28:10,796 --> 00:28:13,990
is stirring up lunacy and violence in our country.

311
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:21,230
We will consider all interferences to emergency disease prevention...

312
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,500
and emergency rescue attempts as murder,

313
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:27,170
and they will be charged with the maximum sentence.

314
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:31,371
What if that blade turns to face you?

315
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,645
They turned a crisis into an opportunity.

316
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,446
This is how the ones who conquer the world work.

317
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,956
I can't stand such people being hypocrites too.

318
00:28:37,956 --> 00:28:39,250
It makes me nauseous.

319
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:42,680
Monster?

320
00:28:42,996 --> 00:28:46,095
You're not even brave enough to face your pains.

321
00:28:46,095 --> 00:28:47,125
No.

322
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,690
Does this fight seem like a joke to you?

323
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:51,791
You must stop.

324
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:54,200
You are ruining the world.

325
00:28:54,936 --> 00:28:57,801
Do not be afraid everyone.

326
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:01,341
We will win no matter what.

327
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:05,541
We will overcome this crisis without fail,

328
00:29:06,216 --> 00:29:10,680
and we will show the world that we are...

329
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:14,124
the best nationality in the world!

330
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,851
So please have faith in...

331
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:18,851
me and this nation.

332
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:22,565
Yo Han, can you promise me something?

333
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:23,930
Can you promise me something?

334
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,236
Don't hurt innocent people.

335
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:29,531
Don't hurt innocent people.

336
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm sorry, Isaac.

337
00:29:42,246 --> 00:29:45,651
I can't keep my promise.

338
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:50,026
The Social Responsibility Foundation has the tremendous responsibility...

339
00:29:50,026 --> 00:29:53,765
to prevent the mutated virus from spreading in Seoul,

340
00:29:53,766 --> 00:29:55,965
and they are doing everything in their power to move...

341
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:57,635
the residents of Hyungsan-dong to the Dream Home Village...

342
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,930
to provide them with treatment and relief measures.

343
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,976
The Social Responsibility Foundation is working alongside the government,

344
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:04,170
and is led by...

345
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,571
Judge Kim.

346
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:09,341
All of that is a bald-faced lie.

347
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:12,770
Do you know what's going on outside?

348
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:14,845
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

349
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:16,655
Things are chaotic because of the virus.

350
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:19,720
They're dragging people away like they're a pack of animals.

351
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:21,885
The news? That's all fake.

352
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:23,220
The foundation made it all up.

353
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,551
That doesn't make sense.

354
00:30:24,726 --> 00:30:26,690
I saw and experienced it myself.

355
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,660
The Jukchang troops did this to me.

356
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:31,891
They are beating people up with metal pipes.

357
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,730
You were attacked?

358
00:30:35,865 --> 00:30:37,700
You know what scares me even more?

359
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,571
No matter how much I think about it,

360
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:42,170
I think that the virus itself...

361
00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:43,841
is a lie.

362
00:30:43,915 --> 00:30:45,071
Hold on.

363
00:30:46,085 --> 00:30:48,914
Judge Kim. You're completely sane, right?

364
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:52,185
They claim that this mutated virus is fatal with a high death rate,

365
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,486
but they chose Juk Chang, who is nothing more than a thug,

366
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:55,920
to be at the front lines.

367
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:59,121
He doesn't wear proper protective gear and only feigns wearing a mask.

368
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:00,365
Think about it.

369
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:03,966
Juk Chang was an administrator of Heo Joong Se's private guards.

370
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:06,105
How could they put a criminal who used to wear an electronic anklet...

371
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,960
on the front lines of disinfection during a national emergency?

372
00:31:09,476 --> 00:31:10,670
Judge Oh.

373
00:31:12,105 --> 00:31:14,041
You're being used.

374
00:31:16,415 --> 00:31:18,516
The streets are filled with videos of you...

375
00:31:18,516 --> 00:31:19,710
I'm sorry.

376
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:22,480
You seem to be too upset right now.

377
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:25,615
I don't know what kind of excessive measures are being taken out there,

378
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:27,980
but you want me to believe in what you're saying?

379
00:31:28,456 --> 00:31:30,855
Don't you think you're going too far?

380
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,855
Judge Oh.

381
00:31:31,855 --> 00:31:35,321
At times like this, we need to take calm and orderly actions.

382
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:37,631
I'm just helping with that.

383
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,250
I didn't see you in the courthouse.

384
00:31:56,556 --> 00:31:57,910
Is something wrong?

385
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,651
I heard you got hurt.

386
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:02,551
I'm fine. More than that...

387
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:05,250
Do you know what's going on right now?

388
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:07,821
I'm glad that you're fine.

389
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:09,631
We'll talk about that later.

390
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:12,291
Hello? Hello?

391
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:22,841
Come in.

392
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,311
Hello, Judge Kang.

393
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,081
Come have a seat.

394
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:34,085
I've been told that I have a good figure,

395
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:36,220
but I don't look good in this.

396
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:37,551
It's so ugly.

397
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:41,520
We need to become more developed in this area first.

398
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:44,460
What are you trying to start?

399
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,230
What am I trying to start?

400
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:51,871
I'm trying to protect the nation and its people from an epidemic.

401
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:53,776
By using a private organization...

402
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,740
to drag away the poor?

403
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,141
Is that what you're talking about?

404
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,611
Then what do you want me to do?

405
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,515
Should I leave the ten million who live in Seoul to die...

406
00:33:03,516 --> 00:33:06,321
just to protect the rights of 10,000?

407
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,321
Ten million is significantly more than ten thousand, isn't it?

408
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,890
Don't you know basic arithmetic?

409
00:33:12,626 --> 00:33:16,465
Furthermore, when this situation is over, people will be happier.

410
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:18,735
Why? Because Seoul will be cleaner...

411
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,531
and the cost of apartments will go up.

412
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,931
That's how humans are.

413
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:26,471
Is there...

414
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:29,071
even a virus?

415
00:33:36,856 --> 00:33:40,051
Seeing you now, you're just a lunatic.

416
00:33:41,525 --> 00:33:44,225
Hey. Why would you joke around like that...

417
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:47,190
during a state of national crisis?

418
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:49,060
Let me get straight to the point.

419
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:51,690
Stop doing all of this.

420
00:33:53,206 --> 00:33:54,661
Cease it.

421
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:02,801
What if I don't want to?

422
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:08,281
I'm going to put everything you did...

423
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:12,911
on the live court show and reveal the truth behind everything.

424
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,250
Until angry people...

425
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:18,020
set this place on fire...

426
00:34:21,525 --> 00:34:25,390
and drag you out like a mutt.

427
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:31,330
Those who have nothing in their hands...

428
00:34:31,476 --> 00:34:33,901
always try to act tough.

429
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,310
How dare you threaten me when you have nothing?

430
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,040
Do you think it will work?

431
00:34:40,186 --> 00:34:42,715
Don't kid yourself.

432
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:44,511
The citizens...

433
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,980
are scared out of their minds. Who would they believe?

434
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,890
Me, who tells them strangers are dangerous and to stay at home,

435
00:34:53,496 --> 00:34:57,730
or you, who tells them to go out and save strangers on the street?

436
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:00,730
Who do you think they will choose?

437
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:04,306
You seem to be overconfident because you've gained some popularity,

438
00:35:04,306 --> 00:35:06,701
but don't kid yourself. Don't be mistaken.

439
00:35:06,706 --> 00:35:09,770
The people who are obsessed with you...

440
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:12,511
and the people who made me president...

441
00:35:12,516 --> 00:35:14,746
are no different from each other.

442
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,051
They're all the same, okay?

443
00:35:18,056 --> 00:35:19,451
Listen to me carefully.

444
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:22,651
I'm going to say something intelligent.

445
00:35:24,226 --> 00:35:26,221
Those who created me...

446
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,931
are the same people who created you, you punk.

447
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:32,131
Got it?

448
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:38,901
If you insist on testing your luck...

449
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:50,850
You look good in yellow.

This is a restricted area. Please step back.

452
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,246
Judge Oh.

453
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:17,911
Is everything going well in there?

454
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:19,071
Pardon?

455
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:22,341
(Police)

456
00:36:22,686 --> 00:36:23,850
Open up for her.

457
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:28,750
(Police)

458
00:36:28,755 --> 00:36:33,120
The plague virus reemerged in the Hyungsan-dong slum.

459
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:35,361
(Police)

460
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,790
Whatever difficulty we face,

461
00:36:40,836 --> 00:36:42,631
we can overcome it.

462
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:47,471
(Police)

463
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,975
Ladies and gentlemen. A plague virus...

464
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:54,040
reemerged in the Hyungsan-dong slum.

465
00:36:54,485 --> 00:36:56,611
We can fight this again.

466
00:36:57,155 --> 00:37:00,151
Whatever difficulty we face,

467
00:37:00,325 --> 00:37:01,821
we can overcome it.

468
00:37:03,655 --> 00:37:06,491
(We oppose the redevelopment that kills residents of shantytowns.)

469
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,971
- Is this the police officer? - Yes, ma'am.

470
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:28,146
Remember how you asked me to call...

471
00:37:28,146 --> 00:37:30,651
if I remembered anything?

472
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,580
About Joseph, who took care of the chapel.

473
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:34,586
Yes.

474
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,025
Someone told me they saw a person who resembled Joseph...

475
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:39,295
in a town in Seoul,

476
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:42,790
but I'm not sure how accurate that is.

477
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:44,790
It's okay, so tell me everything.

478
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:47,600
Yes.

479
00:38:06,586 --> 00:38:08,721
- Ga On. - Hey.

480
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:11,920
I told you to stay inside. What are you doing out here?

481
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,890
I had a feeling you were coming.

482
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:19,761
Shut your mouth. Let's just go inside.

483
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:30,770
Soo Hyun.

484
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:33,841
What?

485
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:36,810
What happened earlier.

486
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,821
It's not like anything happened.

487
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,290
I won't apologize, but...

488
00:38:45,295 --> 00:38:47,120
I think I got the order wrong.

489
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:51,730
The order?

490
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,230
Do you know how timid I am?

491
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,511
I trembled in fear all day today.

492
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:10,810
What if things get awkward between us?

493
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,620
What if I ruined everything?

494
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:16,750
I thought so my whole life.

495
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:21,661
What if we...

496
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,230
get together,

497
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,931
then fight over nothing like others,

498
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:33,270
misunderstand, get jealous, and get upset,

499
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:35,940
and then...

500
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,440
break up, what then?

501
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,911
You are all I have.

502
00:39:45,086 --> 00:39:46,511
If I lose you too,

503
00:39:47,056 --> 00:39:48,681
I won't have anyone.

504
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,460
If we stay friends,

505
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,460
the best friends in the world,

506
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,931
I thought I'd never feel lonely.

507
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:04,500
I'm stupid, aren't I?

508
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:07,140
And selfish.

509
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,015
But I can't do this anymore.

510
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:12,611
I don't care about anything else.

511
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,484
Even if we fight over nothing like others,

512
00:40:15,485 --> 00:40:18,381
misunderstand, get jealous, and get upset...

513
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,491
I want to like you forever.

514
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,991
I like you a lot, Soo Hyun.

515
00:42:13,836 --> 00:42:15,330
Kang Yo Han.

516
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:20,540
Do you think he really has something?

517
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:25,511
Disease Control, the press, the prosecution, the police,

518
00:42:25,916 --> 00:42:27,781
we're in control of them all.

519
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,455
If we say a virus exists, it exists.

520
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:32,181
How can he prove it doesn't?

521
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,024
It's not like he can go around with a microscope.

522
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:38,151
Still, I have this bad feeling.

523
00:42:38,396 --> 00:42:40,165
If I could have my way,

524
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:44,594
I'd love to bury him where no one will find him.

525
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:48,301
If we were to do that, the country would flip out.

526
00:42:52,575 --> 00:42:55,440
Ms. Jung, share an idea if you have any.

527
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:59,611
If he is given a warning and he doesn't heed,

528
00:43:00,215 --> 00:43:01,810
we must blow him up.

529
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:06,654
That is exactly how I feel. But if we were to do that...

530
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:09,821
First, get rid of the stage.

531
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:11,651
The stage?

532
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:15,665
A star only shines when he or she is on a stage.

533
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:17,261
Without a stage,

534
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:20,661
a star is just another person.

535
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:27,875
Ga On. Ga On, wake up.

536
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:31,044
The government decided to disband the live court show.

537
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:34,645
To combat the current nationwide emergency we're facing,

538
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:38,111
we will establish an emergency court.

539
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:40,555
The emergency court will rule on cases regarding...

540
00:43:40,556 --> 00:43:44,495
the disruption of pandemic assistance or relocation,

541
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,055
the spreading of slander,

542
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,821
and illegal gatherings and protests.

543
00:43:48,825 --> 00:43:52,864
Judge Oh Jin Joo will preside over the emergency court,

544
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:55,705
and associate judges will be selected from applicants...

545
00:43:55,706 --> 00:43:58,234
with a strong sense of nationalism.

546
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,071
- This is crazy. - That's all.

547
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:02,901
Soo Hyun. We have to stop this.

548
00:44:03,106 --> 00:44:05,440
They're lying to the public.

549
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:09,011
Chief Kang's the only one who can stop them.

550
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:11,055
Not Kang Yo Han.

551
00:44:11,056 --> 00:44:13,455
It's true that what's going on is strange,

552
00:44:13,456 --> 00:44:16,551
but how can we trust Kang Yo Han? He's dangerous.

553
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:18,651
- Soo Hyun. - Wait.

554
00:44:19,595 --> 00:44:20,991
Give me some time.

555
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:22,665
I'll find out who he is.

556
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:24,661
I'm almost there, Ga On.

557
00:44:25,036 --> 00:44:27,904
Soo Hyun, please. Trust me this once.

558
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:29,734
We have to stop this no matter what.

559
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,270
Whatever Kang Yo Han is, we can find out afterward.

560
00:44:33,106 --> 00:44:34,201
Okay?

561
00:44:36,476 --> 00:44:37,571
Soo Hyun.

562
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:48,668
Can it be done?

563
00:44:49,372 --> 00:44:50,938
It must be done even if it is impossible.

564
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,947
I'll call those who are left of our people.

565
00:44:57,222 --> 00:45:00,277
We do have someone who can get into the main control room.

566
00:45:01,822 --> 00:45:02,917
Chief.

567
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:07,627
I'll call you back, Lawyer Ko.

568
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:13,728
Won't you do anything?

569
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:15,228
Right now, out there,

570
00:45:15,403 --> 00:45:18,297
innocent people are getting beaten up and dragged off.

571
00:45:19,003 --> 00:45:20,808
Will you just sit and watch?

572
00:45:22,843 --> 00:45:24,277
Say something...

573
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:50,297
(Old house, blue gate, uphill)

574
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:58,042
(2-10, Ryangjin-ro, 6-gil)

575
00:45:58,043 --> 00:45:59,138
Hello?

576
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:04,217
- Hello. - Hello.

577
00:46:04,352 --> 00:46:07,118
I'd like to ask you something. Do you know this man?

578
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:09,417
No.

579
00:46:10,193 --> 00:46:12,458
Okay, then. Thanks.

580
00:46:19,762 --> 00:46:20,967
Hello?

581
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:26,868
Hello?

582
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:40,417
Congratulations, Judge Oh.

583
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,317
Chief of the Emergency Court.

584
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,487
You must become the chief justice and then head the Supreme Court.

585
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:48,058
I'll see to that.

586
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:53,502
Why don't you do it properly, then?

587
00:46:53,503 --> 00:46:55,402
- What? - Judge Kang Yo Han.

588
00:46:55,403 --> 00:46:58,368
You may put him down, but he's still very popular.

589
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:00,072
If I'm to become the presiding chief,

590
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:01,908
I must beat him in popularity.

591
00:47:03,142 --> 00:47:05,678
Don't you remember his inauguration speech?

592
00:47:05,843 --> 00:47:08,607
He said, "I am power."

593
00:47:09,052 --> 00:47:11,281
Your beginning should have more of an impact?

594
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:12,377
Yes.

595
00:47:12,523 --> 00:47:15,047
What you see is what you get. My image.

596
00:47:16,693 --> 00:47:19,558
But a certificate of appointment can't give me that.

597
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,388
I'll only look like a cheater...

598
00:47:21,793 --> 00:47:23,828
who took her superior's place.

599
00:47:25,233 --> 00:47:26,828
What do you want then?

600
00:47:26,963 --> 00:47:28,368
Do you want to give a speech?

601
00:47:29,003 --> 00:47:32,038
Yes, at the very place where Kang Yo Han did,

602
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:34,868
with Kang Yo Han and Kim Ga On sitting behind me.

603
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:41,313
(Chairman Park Du Man)

604
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:43,107
Will Kang Yo Han agree to do that?

605
00:47:45,653 --> 00:47:47,118
I'll persuade him.

606
00:47:47,122 --> 00:47:48,352
(Chairman Park Du Man)

607
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:51,317
"I can't let you step down like this."

608
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:54,228
"I'll prepare a short goodbye broadcast."

609
00:47:54,463 --> 00:47:57,958
"Let me honor your achievements that way."

610
00:47:58,102 --> 00:47:59,598
(Chairman Park Du Man)

611
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:02,897
So basically, you want a coronation.

612
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:08,408
Kang Yo Han transferring his crown to you himself.

613
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:10,908
Wouldn't that be beautiful?

614
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:13,507
I'm sure we'll get high viewer ratings as well.

615
00:48:18,322 --> 00:48:20,748
If it's an exclusive broadcast on such a hot topic,

616
00:48:20,753 --> 00:48:22,888
high viewer ratings are guaranteed, I guess.

617
00:48:31,863 --> 00:48:33,127
This is driving me crazy.

618
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:36,773
This is the most successful show I've ever made.

619
00:48:36,773 --> 00:48:38,742
Is it really going to end like this?

620
00:48:38,742 --> 00:48:40,268
Are we getting fired?

621
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:44,337
I heard there will be an emergency court instead.

622
00:48:44,343 --> 00:48:45,507
Come on.

623
00:48:45,742 --> 00:48:47,547
Do you think people will watch it?

624
00:48:48,313 --> 00:48:50,107
It reminds me of an emergency court-martial.

625
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:00,728
Hello, Judge Oh.

626
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:02,788
Yes.

627
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:07,567
I'm so touched that I want to cry, Judge Oh.

628
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,428
Please don't take this the wrong way.

629
00:49:09,733 --> 00:49:10,998
I meant what I said.

630
00:49:11,372 --> 00:49:12,567
Please accept it.

631
00:49:17,282 --> 00:49:21,447
Well... It's only while the emergency situation lasts.

632
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:23,213
Once things settle down,

633
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:25,182
I'm sure the live court show will resume.

634
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:28,793
Tell people that you're letting Judge Oh take over until then.

635
00:49:28,793 --> 00:49:31,492
That way, you'll be able to get back smoothly later.

636
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:32,987
So you need sidekicks. Is that it,

637
00:49:33,793 --> 00:49:35,328
Judge Oh?

638
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,532
Judge Kim, don't be like that.

639
00:49:37,532 --> 00:49:38,728
Let's do it.

640
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,728
Chief Kang.

641
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:45,098
But make sure things look good.

642
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:46,868
Please consider my position.

643
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:48,308
You don't have to worry about that.

644
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:50,908
I'll bet my entire career on this.

645
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:00,547
Hello?

646
00:50:15,503 --> 00:50:16,667
Who is it?

647
00:50:18,343 --> 00:50:20,467
- Hello, I'm from the RIU. - Okay.

648
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,242
Do you know a man named Jung Joseph?

649
00:50:22,242 --> 00:50:23,737
There's no one here by that name.

650
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:26,242
Have you ever seen a man who looks like this around here?

651
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:29,348
No, I haven't. Don't you know what kind of situation we're in?

652
00:50:36,753 --> 00:50:37,987
Hello?

653
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:48,868
Who is it?

654
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:53,138
Mr. Jung Joseph?

655
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:59,138
Just a second. I'm Officer Yoon Soo Hyun from the RIU.

656
00:51:05,052 --> 00:51:06,217
(285S 7511)

657
00:51:09,253 --> 00:51:12,058
I have a feeling we'll get amazing viewer ratings.

658
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:15,388
Everyone will be stuck home, staring at the TV anyway.

659
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:18,462
- Are we stopping for lunch? - What?

660
00:51:18,463 --> 00:51:21,527
They seem to be taking a detour.

661
00:51:22,173 --> 00:51:23,397
You're right.

662
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:25,498
They didn't say anything about it.

663
00:51:25,673 --> 00:51:27,098
Are they looking for a bathroom?

664
00:51:29,012 --> 00:51:30,467
Hello, Judge Oh.

665
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:32,178
We still have some time, right?

666
00:51:32,443 --> 00:51:33,808
Let's stop somewhere for lunch.

667
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:36,147
Sure, let's do that.

668
00:51:36,383 --> 00:51:37,618
Okay.

669
00:51:38,253 --> 00:51:39,547
We're stopping for lunch.

670
00:51:54,702 --> 00:51:56,498
Check the commercial time.

671
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,797
Yes, sir.

672
00:52:51,023 --> 00:52:52,518
You can't enter here.

673
00:52:53,622 --> 00:52:54,757
What's going on?

674
00:52:56,992 --> 00:52:58,233
What's happening?

675
00:52:58,233 --> 00:52:59,697
Come here.

676
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,967
We're ready to roll.

677
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:10,978
Are there even any restaurants here?

678
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:18,777
I'm sorry.

679
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,593
But I'll make sure you get incredible viewer ratings.

680
00:53:21,593 --> 00:53:23,987
- I promise. - All right.

681
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,438
What is this?

682
00:53:49,952 --> 00:53:51,118
What's going on here?

683
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:54,118
What are they doing?

684
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:56,087
We need to show the world...

685
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,518
what is happening here.

686
00:54:14,313 --> 00:54:15,808
Count me in.

687
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:17,978
Judge Oh.

688
00:54:18,512 --> 00:54:21,978
Judge Kim, I've seen what's going on.

689
00:54:23,682 --> 00:54:26,647
I know I can't be forgiven even if I say I didn't know.

690
00:54:30,193 --> 00:54:31,357
I'll do anything.

691
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:34,317
I'll do everything I can.

692
00:54:34,992 --> 00:54:36,928
Do you mean that?

693
00:54:38,032 --> 00:54:39,498
Yes, Chief Kang.

694
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:43,868
Great. Then we can make things look more natural.

695
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:55,478
Yes, we should.

696
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,678
If I see this...

697
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:01,947
and don't film it, I should just quit my job.

698
00:55:02,593 --> 00:55:03,748
Gather around!

699
00:55:05,822 --> 00:55:07,063
- What's the matter? - Hey!

700
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:10,188
You go and get the equipment.

701
00:55:10,463 --> 00:55:12,702
Change of plan. I'm sorry.

702
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,673
But please trust me and do as I say.

703
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:15,868
I'll leave it to you.

704
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,003
It's time for a trial.

705
00:55:19,003 --> 00:55:20,138
A trial?

706
00:55:20,802 --> 00:55:22,167
Put these on first.

707
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:26,678
It's time to go on stage.

708
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:10,618
Judge Kang.

709
00:56:11,722 --> 00:56:13,317
You can leave this place to me.

710
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:15,757
Please.

711
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:34,478
(We don't want redevelopment!)

712
00:56:38,852 --> 00:56:42,518
(Police, Social Responsibility Foundation)

713
00:56:43,523 --> 00:56:45,563
Are all cameras on the rooftop?

714
00:56:45,563 --> 00:56:47,087
Yes, they are.

715
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:48,992
Okay. Be careful.

716
00:56:48,992 --> 00:56:50,991
Team A, shoot the judges.

717
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:53,133
Teams B and C, take close-up shots of the scene.

718
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:55,173
Teams B and C, shoot the entire scene!

719
00:56:55,173 --> 00:56:56,828
I'll be following Judge Kang around.

720
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,102
When will the generator be here?

721
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:00,342
- It's too late... - The sun is setting soon.

722
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:01,967
I'll take full responsibility.

723
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:06,642
Hold on.

724
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:07,877
Attention.

725
00:57:08,782 --> 00:57:10,078
Attention!

726
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:13,147
Attention!

727
00:57:14,182 --> 00:57:15,452
(We don't want redevelopment!)

728
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:16,688
Dear fellow citizens.

729
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:21,228

01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:22,047
I get it. I live it every day.

918
01:13:22,053 --> 01:13:24,252
If there are people trying to stop this trial,

919
01:13:24,253 --> 01:13:26,318
they are criminals.

920
01:13:26,923 --> 01:13:28,928
We must cut off the loose ends.

921
01:13:29,162 --> 01:13:32,463
You don't have feelings of regret, do you?

922
01:13:32,463 --> 01:13:34,598
To get them to fight each other,

923
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:36,633
you need the blood of a sacrifice?

924
01:13:36,633 --> 01:13:39,698
That is what Kang Yo Han really wants.

925
01:13:39,843 --> 01:13:40,843
Fear.

926
01:13:40,843 --> 01:13:44,013
Are you sure who killed Soo Hyun?

927
01:13:44,013 --> 01:13:46,537
A life for a life!

928
01:13:46,612 --> 01:13:48,108
I suggest death!

929
01:13:55,353 --> 01:13:58,053
My child wanted to attend this school.

930
01:13:58,053 --> 01:13:59,622
You've received an invitation...

931
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:00,717
Who did it?

932
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:04,093
Who brought me and my child here?

933
01:14:04,093 --> 01:14:05,657
Who tortured us until now?

934
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:07,928
Why me?

935
01:14:07,963 --> 01:14:10,098
(High Class)
