(Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun)

4
00:00:23,975 --> 00:00:26,040
Salute the deceased!

5
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:30,579
Soo Hyun.

6
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:32,750
My baby.

7
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:35,620
My poor Soo Hyun.

8
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:39,660
Mom.

9
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:17,489
Did you get hurt?

10
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,530
I love you.

11
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:48,560
Will you marry me?

12
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:51,500
I love you.

13
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,199
No, I was kidding. I don't love you.

14
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:59,470
I love you just a little.

15
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,940
- Bye. - Bye. Take care.

16
00:02:11,254 --> 00:02:12,479
She might trip again.

17
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm on my way.

18
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:24,503
What weird taste.

19
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:27,560
- Is that what you say? - It's what you said.

20
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:31,639
I'll be careful. Don't worry.

21
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,130
Soo Hyun.

22
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,150
I want to like you forever.

23
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:54,750
I really like you a lot, Soo Hyun.

24
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:24,209
As a judge...

25
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:27,385
of the Republic of Korea, I do solemnly swear...

26
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:29,155
that I will rule independently according to my conscience...

27
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,920
and in conformity with the Constitution and laws.

28
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,394
I swear to abide by the code of judicial ethics...

29
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,934
and to promote the welfare of the people...

30
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:40,265
executing the duties faithfully...

31
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,199
- to the best of my ability. - to the best of my ability.

(Appointment Ceremony for Judges)

33
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,519
Here we go. One, two, three.

34
00:05:06,895 --> 00:05:09,159
- Oh, no. - Come on.

35
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,029
Okay, please stand in the middle.

36
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,699
- Why don't you two take this one? - Oh, no.

37
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll just step out of the picture.

38
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,130
My goodness.

39
00:05:17,335 --> 00:05:18,374
I'll take one more picture.

40
00:05:18,374 --> 00:05:20,473
Everyone, just smile.

41
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:23,569
One, two, three.

The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

43
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:36,649
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

44
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:42,459
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

45
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:48,269
The roses of Sharon have blossomed.

46
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,370
Kim Ga On, stop crying.

47
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:58,709
You'll be fine.

48
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:08,019
You'll be okay.

49
00:06:08,424 --> 00:06:10,319
You're okay.

50
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,089
Don't cry.

51
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,360
I love you.

52
00:06:20,664 --> 00:06:21,969
Don't cry.

53
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:26,170
Don't cry, Ga On.

54
00:06:28,044 --> 00:06:29,209
Don't cry.

55
00:06:31,414 --> 00:06:32,540
Ga On.

56
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:39,519
Ga On, I love you.

57
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:11,350
(Yoon Soo Hyun)

58
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:44,819
Soo Hyun.

59
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:47,519
Soo Hyun.

60
00:07:53,064 --> 00:07:54,259
Soo Hyun.

61
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:04,569
Soo Hyun.

62
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:21,420
(Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun)

63
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,269
(Episode 14)

64
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:04,630
Are you okay?

65
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:18,240
The shooter. Did they find the shooter?

66
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:25,179
We have to find that scumbag. That son of a gun.

67
00:09:25,454 --> 00:09:27,919
- Kim Ga On, where are you going? - Let go.

68
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:30,889
- I have to catch that jerk. - Where do you think you're going?

69
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:32,990
- Let go of me. - Stop it.

70
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,460
Please.

71
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:39,960
What if something happens to you too?

72
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:44,330
What good will that do poor Soo Hyun?

73
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,439
Are you planning to die in the street?

74
00:09:48,574 --> 00:09:51,039
Do you think Soo Hyun will be happy to see that?

75
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:59,679
Just stay here for now.

76
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:03,120
Just stay here...

77
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,259
and talk to Yo Han. We'll find a way...

78
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,830
We'll find a way no matter what.

79
00:11:15,594 --> 00:11:17,159
Have you calmed down a bit?

80
00:11:19,005 --> 00:11:21,259
Who do you think shot Soo Hyun?

81
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:24,669
He wasn't trying to shoot her.

82
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:29,710
They were planning to attack us in the confusion.

83
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:32,309
Attack us?

84
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:35,980
Think about what the foundation has done.

85
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:42,019
They took us off the air and knocked out power in the district.

86
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,964
- Wait. - What's going on?

87
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,164
Turn the lights on!

88
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,495
They had no time to think of the consequences...

89
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:49,889
and had to do something fast.

90
00:11:50,164 --> 00:11:51,490
But it didn't work.

91
00:11:52,105 --> 00:11:54,130
So they decided to kill us off.

92
00:12:13,824 --> 00:12:15,220
Then did Soo Hyun...

93
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:20,120
die...

94
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,759
Did she die instead of me?

95
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:48,450
I know how you feel right now.

96
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,330
You must feel like you're in a fiery pit.

97
00:12:57,635 --> 00:13:00,200
An eternal fiery pit you'll never be able to get out of.

98
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,700
I know how you feel...

99
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,470
because I live in the same place.

100
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:19,779
But if you have time to cry,

101
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,694
find the people who are responsible for this...

102
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:24,995
and make them burn in the fiery pit.

103
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:27,820
That's the only way you can survive in that place.

104
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:35,669
So have you arrested Juk Chang?

105
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,909
Then we'll have to start with him...

106
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:44,809
in order to punish the foundation.

107
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:55,549
Let us begin.

108
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:57,990
I am ready.

109
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:15,000
- Here they come! - They're here!

110
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:20,980
The emergency rescue workers sent by the government...

111
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:24,183
randomly assaulted innocent citizens...

112
00:14:24,184 --> 00:14:26,450
and brutally murdered an elderly citizen.

113
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:30,289
Also, an unidentified gunman...

114
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,860
shot an officer to death.

115
00:14:34,094 --> 00:14:36,759
The government still has not given any explanation.

116
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:41,104
I'm going to take this case of state violence to court...

117
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:44,299
and hold everyone involved responsible.

118
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,614
But President Heo announced that an emergency court...

119
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:52,080
will replace the current live court show.

120
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:54,840
I'd like to make one thing clear.

121
00:14:55,084 --> 00:14:57,784
I'm not planning on joining the so-called emergency court,

122
00:14:57,785 --> 00:15:00,754
which only aims to suppress...

123
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,220
and control the citizens.

124
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,189
The trial has already begun.

125
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:11,764
(Innocent, Guilty)

126
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:15,200
More than five million citizens have already voted for "guilty".

127
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,169
Whoever tries to stop...

128
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:20,870
this trial...

129
00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:24,169
is the culprit.

130
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,279
(Live Court Show to Hold Government Responsible)

131
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,080
Unbelievable.

132
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,980
He's openly threatening us.

133
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,350
"Stop us, and we won't sit back." Is that it?

134
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:38,524
You and your obsession with viewer ratings.

135
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:40,820
I knew you'd mess up big time someday.

136
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,789
What are you going to do now?

137
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,929
Who knew Oh Jin Joo would stab us in the back like this?

138
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,460
I thought she was the ambitious type.

139
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,029
What's gotten into her?

140
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,203
She had her eyes on the Chief Justice position.

141
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:54,399
She probably wants to get there on her own.

142
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,139
I've never seen her glow like this before though.

143
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,083
Twinkle, twinkle.

144
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,754
Twinkle, twinkle, my foot. Doesn't this concern you?

145
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:04,754
If this gets out, there will be a riot.

146
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,620
We'll all be stoned to death!

147
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:09,789
I'm not afraid.

148
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,990
They can put us on trial if they want.

149
00:16:12,064 --> 00:16:13,159
What?

150
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:14,990
That's not okay.

151
00:16:15,094 --> 00:16:17,734
We'll keep the press under control and pressure the Supreme Court...

152
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,034
The entire nation watched it live...

153
00:16:20,035 --> 00:16:23,830
when that old man got beaten to death with a metal pipe.

154
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,240
It's too risky. That's not an option.

155
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,480
For now...

156
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,179
It's time to shift blame.

157
00:16:42,924 --> 00:16:44,350
The recent incident is...

158
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,293
a tragedy caused by the overenthusiasm...

159
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,034
and competition...

160
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,559
among the field workers.

161
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:55,004
I sincerely apologize to the deceased and their families...

162
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,833
(President of Korea)

163
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:58,299
on behalf of the government.

164
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,600
(The Blue House)

165
00:17:04,945 --> 00:17:09,684
But it is unacceptable to use this occasion...

166
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,754
to spread groundless conspiracy theories...

167
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,889
and criticize the emergency rescue measures.

168
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:19,260
If any of that happens...

169
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:21,659
during the coming trial,

170
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:24,290
it will be considered...

171
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:28,030
an evident case of treason.

172
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:38,010
Good work, sir.

173
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:41,679
The problem isn't...

174
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,219
that the old man got beaten to death.

175
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,580
It's the virus.

176
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:52,860
I think we should prepare ourselves.

177
00:17:54,294 --> 00:17:56,133
What do you mean?

178
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:59,929
Many people are debating whether the virus exists or not.

179
00:18:00,935 --> 00:18:02,530
But we can give it to them.

180
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,803
We'll make sure it's found.

181
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:06,999
We'll make sure the virus is found...

182
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:09,669
in some slum areas.

183
00:18:10,044 --> 00:18:11,239
Are you saying...

184
00:18:12,314 --> 00:18:15,040
you'll spread the virus on purpose?

185
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,919
If that's what it takes, I will.

186
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,550
At times,

187
00:18:25,124 --> 00:18:27,620
a leader is meant to face the lonely decision...

188
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:30,760
to sacrifice the lesser for the greater good.

189
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,830
And that moment...

190
00:18:34,535 --> 00:18:37,070
can come to me as well.

191
00:18:37,275 --> 00:18:40,340
Haven't you seen it in Hollywood movies?

192
00:18:40,544 --> 00:18:44,439
A man crossing himself before pressing the nuclear button?

193
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,290
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

194
00:18:58,624 --> 00:18:59,919
No, sir.

195
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,330
I'm just moved.

196
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,164
I don't like your tone.

197
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:08,903
You don't seem so happy about what we're doing now.

198
00:19:08,904 --> 00:19:10,770
What is it? You want to back out?

199
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,800
That's not okay. That's cheating.

200
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,139
Hold on a second.

201
00:19:18,275 --> 00:19:21,239
Do you have feelings left for Kang Yo Han?

202
00:19:31,955 --> 00:19:34,989
I'll take care of Kang Yo Han.

203
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,830
Meanwhile, I need you to keep that punk quiet.

204
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:40,429
Who?

205
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,573
The very person who caused this situation.

206
00:19:43,574 --> 00:19:46,373
The president of your fan club.

207
00:19:46,374 --> 00:19:47,770
Juk Chang.

208
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:54,540
I trust you don't have feelings left for him.

209
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,024
We've managed to bring them to trial.

210
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,123
We now have to prove them guilty in court.

211
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,860
We'll have to prove the virus never existed.

212
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,159
Will that be possible?

213
00:20:10,894 --> 00:20:12,765
Lawyer Ko contacted a researcher...

214
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:14,664
at the emergency response headquarters.

215
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm meeting with him later.

216
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:20,600
Do you want to come with me?

217
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:23,570
Sure, let's do that.

218
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,310
Hold on.

219
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:33,949
Did you have dinner?

220
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:36,949
I'm not hungry.

221
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,290
Wait.

222
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:42,830
Yes?

223
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:46,459
I'm a little hungry.

224
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,130
So I'm going to make some ramyeon.

225
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,300
Should I make some for you too?

226
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,110
Thanks.

227
00:20:57,144 --> 00:20:59,110
But some other time.

228
00:21:25,134 --> 00:21:26,239
Ga On.

229
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:27,939
Hey.

230
00:21:31,544 --> 00:21:32,639
What are you listening to?

231
00:21:34,314 --> 00:21:35,479
Just...

232
00:21:36,854 --> 00:21:37,949
some music.

233
00:21:38,084 --> 00:21:39,784
Listen to something cheerful.

234
00:21:39,785 --> 00:21:41,780
Stop looking so depressed.

235
00:21:44,894 --> 00:21:45,989
Did you...

236
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:47,889
have dinner?

237
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,989
I'm thinking of making some ramyeon.

238
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,229
You're just like him.

239
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:58,429
What do you mean? Who am I like?

240
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:00,600
Your uncle.

241
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,310
What?

242
00:22:02,314 --> 00:22:04,540
How can you say I'm like that middle-aged man?

243
00:22:04,745 --> 00:22:06,479
You're both bad at comforting others.

244
00:22:07,215 --> 00:22:08,679
Comfort, my foot.

245
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,310
I just can't stand seeing you like this.

246
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:13,620
You look like the world has come to an end.

247
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:16,949
It's boring.

248
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,360
But it actually comforts me...

249
00:22:22,864 --> 00:22:24,060
that you're so bad at it.

250
00:22:27,165 --> 00:22:28,560
Thanks, Elijah.

251
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:31,030
What are you saying?

252
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,919
(Voice recordings)

253
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:55,659
Will you marry me?

254
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:57,929
I love you.

255
00:22:58,435 --> 00:22:59,959
No, I was kidding.

256
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,130
I love you just a little.

257
00:23:04,804 --> 00:23:06,100
Will you marry me?

258
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:08,399
I love you.

259
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:10,439
No, I was kidding.

260
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:12,610
I love you just a little.

261
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:44,274
Many people are debating whether the virus exists or not.

262
00:23:44,275 --> 00:23:45,744
But we can give it to them.

263
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:47,909
We'll make sure the virus is found...

264
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:50,679
in some slum areas.

265
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:00,320
That crazy clown.

266
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:13,139
(Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah)

267
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:20,679
Hey, Sun Ah.

268
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,909
Do you remember the neighborhood I grew up in?

269
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,350
Is that an emergency quarantine area too?

270
00:24:27,154 --> 00:24:29,790
Probably. It's a really poor area.

271
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:33,590
Right. Makes sense.

272
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:38,964
What about the youth welfare center I went to as a mentor?

273
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,005
Is that place also...

274
00:24:40,005 --> 00:24:42,699
No. That place is affiliated with the foundation,

275
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:43,929
so I'm sure it's not included.

276
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:45,899
Do you want me to check?

277
00:24:45,904 --> 00:24:48,870
What? No. I was just curious.

278
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:53,010
My mom must've hoped...

279
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:56,280
that I'd grow up to be an ordinary, good person.

280
00:24:56,584 --> 00:24:58,580
Then why did she do that to me?

281
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:01,350
If that was her wish, why did she beat me up...

282
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,290
every time she was drunk?

283
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:06,919
My mom did that too.

284
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:08,459
She did?

285
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,094
Usually, she was nice like an angel.

286
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,560
But she changed completely when she was drunk.

287
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:15,300
She'd start crying and...

288
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:22,510
Gosh. You're acting weird.

289
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:25,884
Are you going through menopause?

290
00:25:25,884 --> 00:25:27,209
Why are you worrying about other people?

291
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:31,654
Hey. Don't you know how much I worry about you?

292
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:33,584
You always make me do such dangerous things.

293
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:34,679
What do you mean you worry?

294
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:37,649
We have a business relationship.

295
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,090
Just make sure you pay me for the risks I take.

296
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:43,090
You're so cold and rude.

297
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:45,234
Bye.

298
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:51,100
(Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah)

299
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,280
How did I end up here?

300
00:26:08,884 --> 00:26:10,320
What can I do?

301
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,959
I'm already here.

302
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:17,830
(Board Chairman Jung Sun Ah)

303
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:55,047
You made it, Doctor.

304
00:26:56,722 --> 00:26:57,846
Judge Kang.

305
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:00,386
My name is Kim Ga On.

306
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,087
Nice to meet you, Judge Kim.

307
00:27:03,732 --> 00:27:05,656
Let me get straight to the point.

308
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:08,956
Is it true that they found a mutated virus?

309
00:27:10,702 --> 00:27:12,027
As for as I know,

310
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,837
I haven't seen any scientific evidence to prove it.

311
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,642
Haven't you been a researcher in the infectious disease control team...

312
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:20,777
for three years?

313
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:24,507
But are you telling me that you haven't seen anything?

314
00:27:25,452 --> 00:27:29,416
About a month ago, the Blue House changed the researchers.

315
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:33,386
They classified all the key documents,

316
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:36,727
and the emergency response headquarters is in a state of fear.

317
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:39,626
Armed soldiers are restricting everything.

318
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:44,030
Are you saying that you haven't seen a sample of the virus?

319
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:47,797
Right. I barely managed to sneak a peek at some autopsy reports,

320
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:50,237
but there were no similarities between the cases.

321
00:27:50,672 --> 00:27:53,737
It's impossible for one virus to cause such a variety of symptoms.

322
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,507
The only similarity they have is...

323
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:01,946
What is it?

324
00:28:03,392 --> 00:28:04,747
Malnourishment.

325
00:28:05,692 --> 00:28:07,087
Malnourishment?

326
00:28:07,462 --> 00:28:10,426
Almost all of the deceased were homeless...

327
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,057
or neglected senior citizens.

328
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:15,661
The areas where this so-called virus has been found...

329
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:18,426
are all extremely poor areas,

330
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,096
and the thing that killed these people isn't a virus,

331
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,366
but poverty.

332
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:25,706
People who suffer from chronic diseases...

333
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:27,837
due to malnourishment and bad hygiene...

334
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:29,577
are dying for various reasons.

335
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:34,116
They're claiming that a fatal virus has been found in certain areas...

336
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:35,717
to clean people up.

337
00:28:36,122 --> 00:28:37,886
That's the essence of this situation.

338
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,886
Sir. Do you think that you can testify in court...

339
00:28:43,892 --> 00:28:46,626
about everything you just told us?

340
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:48,696
Yes, I can.

341
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,696
This is dangerous.

342
00:28:51,071 --> 00:28:52,366
Are you aware of that?

343
00:28:53,601 --> 00:28:54,936
I have prepared myself.

344
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,781
To prevent the virus from spreading,

345
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,251
they have forbidden people from entering the Supreme Court.

346
00:29:03,251 --> 00:29:05,750
The attorney has gained interest as an active-duty colonel...

347
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:08,146
and Deputy Minister for Legal Affairs...

348
00:29:08,152 --> 00:29:11,186
of the emergency response headquarters under the president.

349
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:15,192
The entire nation is watching and wondering if the truth...

350
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:16,692
will be revealed.

351
00:29:16,692 --> 00:29:19,057
(Defendant: Kim Choong Sik, 33, Job: Internet broadcaster)

352
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:23,227
This was an unfortunate accident.

353
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,967
Counsel, did you just call it an accident?

354
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:35,037

00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:37,376

Get down here!

357
00:29:39,682 --> 00:29:42,452
Get down here!

358
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:43,946
Please answer me again.

359
00:29:44,222 --> 00:29:46,257
Was this an accident?

360
00:29:46,261 --> 00:29:47,517
Yes, it was.

361
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:51,257
Shouldn't the entire context of the incident be brought to light?

362
00:29:51,432 --> 00:29:54,132
Right. Could you tell us what context permits someone...

363
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:57,626
from beating an old man in his 70s to death?

364
00:29:58,132 --> 00:30:01,096
Korea is pretty much in a state of war right now.

365
00:30:01,242 --> 00:30:04,142
In order to prevent the spread of a fatal virus,

366
00:30:04,142 --> 00:30:08,037
field agents risk their lives and are sent to the site.

367
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:11,881
This was just an accidental casualty that occurred...

368
00:30:11,882 --> 00:30:14,021

and they resisted.

370
00:30:17,251 --> 00:30:19,017
It is nothing more than an accidental casualty.

371
00:30:31,972 --> 00:30:35,770
Do you believe that this is proper execution of justice?

372
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:39,067
Let me repeat myself. We are in a state of war.

373
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:42,242
If the virus ends up spreading throughout the country...

374
00:30:42,242 --> 00:30:44,977
because we are busy considering human rights and processes,

375
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,416
who will take responsibility for it?

376
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:48,876
Will you take responsibility for it?

377
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:53,717
Very well.

378
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:57,331
Then let's first find out if we are truly in a state of war...

By the authority of the court,

381
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,531
we will call a witness...

382
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,896
to verify the existence of the virus that was said to have been found.

383
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,237

Mr. Yoon Myung Jin.

387

Mr. Yoon Myung Jin.

388
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,771
If you are looking for Dr. Yoon Myung Jin,

389
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,237
a member of our emergency response headquarters, unfortunately,

390
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:45,206
he passed away this morning.

391
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:49,237
He got infected while treating a patient with the mutated virus,

392
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:52,706
and within 12 hours...

393
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:57,587
May he rest in peace.

394
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,831
(Defendant)

395
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:07,396
The ultimate sacrifice that Dr. Yoon has made...

396
00:32:07,432 --> 00:32:10,031
is evidence that shows exactly...

397
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,166
what kind of state we are in right now.

398
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:14,737

401
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,577
is the nerve-racking,

402

bloody, and unexpected twists that occur.

Don't you agree?

The people who killed Soo Hyun killed Dr. Yoon as well.

405
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:41,727
Calm down, Judge Kim.

406
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:44,171
What should we do, Chief Kang?

407
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:46,672
At this rate, the only option we have left...

408
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:48,166
is to get Juk Chang to talk.

409
00:32:48,972 --> 00:32:51,906
We have to get him to talk no matter what.

410
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:55,906
I prepared something.

411
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,376
Just watch. Don't say anything.

412
00:32:59,821 --> 00:33:00,916
Pardon?

413
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:08,156

Also, the defendant is a young man...

418

without a job who is living from hand to mouth.

419
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:27,641
What is most important is that he sincerely regrets his actions.

420
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,407
Please hand down the most lenient sentence.

421
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:32,347
Prosecution, what do you say?

422
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,987
Considering the circumstances,

423
00:33:42,162 --> 00:33:44,087
I request you sentence him to seven years in prison.

424
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:46,800

429

Yes?

you were part of his staff.

Your Honor. What does that have to do with this trial?

437
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:22,730
You were an unofficial staff member during his presidential campaign.

438
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,826
Is that correct?

No, I know nothing about that.

No.

00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:35,337
You wielded steel pipes a lot then too, didn't you?

444
00:34:36,042 --> 00:34:38,380
You and your team interrupted a peaceful protest,

445

used violence, and stole from nearby stores.

By strengthening the law, you bring order to society.

That was President Heo's idea, and you contributed to that.

- It was a drunken mistake. - Was it?

457
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,221
Then when you wielded a steel pipe while providing urgent assistance,

458
00:35:15,222 --> 00:35:16,916
was that a mistake too?

Yes.

00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:45,581
You gathered your fans, poor young men with no jobs...

466
00:35:45,582 --> 00:35:48,617
to help you in Hyungsan-dong. Whose idea was that?

00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:21,400
in a bad environment and was traumatized by abuse.

523
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:23,570
They should all be arrested.

549
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:59,626
This court will treat every criminal fairly and equally.

550
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:03,337
Humans are dignified because we take responsibility.

551
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:06,606
Cheap pity is an insult to our humanity.

552
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,146
Ladies and gentlemen.

553
00:40:10,412 --> 00:40:13,047
What is the correct penalty for a murderer?

554
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:17,587
How can he pay for the blood of the victim?

555
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:35,737
(National Vote Status)

556
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:43,306

(For)

559
00:41:04,202 --> 00:41:07,496
Thank you for showing us your yearning for justice.

560
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,706
Justice must not end in just words.

561
00:41:11,472 --> 00:41:13,376
A penalty that is not carried out...

562
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,337
is fraud, not justice.

563
00:41:15,981 --> 00:41:19,306
I demand that justice be served.

564
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:34,896
The electric chair?

565
00:41:41,742 --> 00:41:44,811
The death penalty will be carried out in 24 hours.

566
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,467
Right here in this hall.

567
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:50,311
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:50,312 --> 00:41:54,150
(What's your choice?)

569
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:57,916
With your own hands, let justice be served.

570
00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:00,387
The more you vote in favor of his death,

571
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:03,487
the higher the voltage of the electric chair.

572
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:07,197
We need over one million votes for the defendant to die.

573
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:13,536
I will see you tomorrow.

574
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:19,706
Your Honor.

575
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,737
Wait.

576
00:42:22,481 --> 00:42:24,610
Your Honor!

577
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:26,817
Wait. Your Honor.

578
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:28,947
Your Honor!

(Supreme Court)

580
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,601
Does he want to turn the court into a slaughterhouse?

581
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,626
Oh, my gosh...

582
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,001
What is he up to?

583
00:42:46,002 --> 00:42:49,237
That is what Kang Yo Han really wants.

584
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:51,237
Fear.

585
00:42:51,812 --> 00:42:54,637
That's also why he gave the public 24 hours.

586
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,507
He wants Juk Chang...

587
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:58,412
to get so scared he'll tell the truth to the world.

588
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,516
Before the entire nation.

589
00:43:01,022 --> 00:43:03,916
What a heartless jerk.

590
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:07,556
Is he even human? Gosh.

591
00:43:11,961 --> 00:43:14,496
What are you going to do, Mr. President?

592
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:17,266
We should keep him quiet, shouldn't we?

593
00:43:18,372 --> 00:43:21,171
We must get rid of him. Send someone to his cell and...

594
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:22,171
Park Du Man!

595
00:43:22,171 --> 00:43:25,642
Do you want to advertise that we gave him orders?

596
00:43:25,642 --> 00:43:26,812
What do you suggest then?

597
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,007
I'll...

598
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,547
keep him quiet.

599
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:32,947
How?

600
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:37,186
I know how to deal with a guy like him.

601
00:43:37,392 --> 00:43:40,456
Don't worry. I'm Heo Joong Se.

602
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,556
Don't you know who I am?

603
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:45,856
Trust me.

604
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:47,797
I'll take care of it.

605
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:55,137
Chief, this is not right.

606
00:43:55,571 --> 00:43:57,666
No matter how I look at it, this just isn't right.

607
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,550
Then what do we do?

608
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:04,947
Are there any alternatives?

609
00:44:05,511 --> 00:44:07,777
Do we have to go this far to make Juk Chang talk?

610
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:10,746
Are we going to electrocute him using the public?

611
00:44:11,122 --> 00:44:14,617
I asked a question, and the public gave me an answer.

612
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:17,226
You saw how the majority voted in favor.

613
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:19,126
Isn't that what democracy is all about?

614
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:23,697
Then what makes you any different from Heo Joong Se?

615
00:44:26,202 --> 00:44:27,697
If you're so strongly against it,

616
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:30,606
leave the bench.

617
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:32,206
Chief.

618
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,076
Can you talk to him?

619
00:44:38,155 --> 00:44:43,550
(Associate Judge Kim Ga On)

620
00:44:47,495 --> 00:44:49,991
Judge Kim, have you seen the news?

621
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:59,135
Following Judge Kang Yo Han's announcement of the execution,

622
00:44:59,135 --> 00:45:02,170
Chief Justice Min Jung Ho resigned from his office in protest.

623
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:07,081
This isn't punishment. It's barbarism.

624
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:12,515
The Supreme Court has been taken over by a mad rabble-rouser.

625
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:14,186
(Chief Justice Resigns)

626
00:45:14,186 --> 00:45:16,020
I'm leaving the Supreme Court as of today.

627
00:45:29,736 --> 00:45:35,141
(Chief Justice Min Jung Ho)

628
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:39,570
Professor.

629
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:44,811
Ga On.

630
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:46,951
You must stop him.

631
00:45:48,186 --> 00:45:49,951
This is unacceptable.

632
00:45:50,796 --> 00:45:52,621
Kang Yo Han...

633
00:45:53,765 --> 00:45:54,960
is a devil.

634
00:45:57,236 --> 00:45:59,230
He's turning every citizen into a murderer.

635
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:05,336
I'm sure he's doing this on purpose...

636
00:46:05,336 --> 00:46:06,900
- to make Juk Chang talk... - So?

637
00:46:07,506 --> 00:46:09,505
He's having the public electrocute him...

638
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:11,710
in the sacred Supreme Court!

639
00:46:14,845 --> 00:46:16,541
You shouldn't trust him.

640
00:46:17,486 --> 00:46:21,126
That serpent is using people's weaknesses...

641
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,820
to ridicule the world.

642
00:46:23,955 --> 00:46:25,221
But Professor,

643
00:46:25,626 --> 00:46:28,291
people with power are harming innocent citizens.

644
00:46:28,526 --> 00:46:31,031
- They even killed Soo Hyun... - Are you sure?

645
00:46:32,765 --> 00:46:35,460
- Pardon? - Are you sure...

646
00:46:36,035 --> 00:46:37,701
they're the ones who killed Soo Hyun?

647
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:40,641
Who else would have tried to shoot us judges?

648
00:46:41,046 --> 00:46:43,641
- Think about what happened... - Fine.

649
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,811
That's what I thought at first.

650
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:47,041
But...

651
00:46:47,586 --> 00:46:50,281
something's been bothering me.

652
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,851
Recently, Soo Hyun came to see me.

653
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:54,951
She told me...

654
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:57,250
Is everything okay?

655
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:11,371
Is this about Ga On?

656
00:47:19,946 --> 00:47:22,741
She was worried you were being fooled by Kang Yo Han.

657
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,785
She never liked him anyway.

658
00:47:28,785 --> 00:47:30,380
There's more to it. She was...

659
00:47:31,796 --> 00:47:34,320
digging into Kang Yo Han's past.

660
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:36,860
The church fire.

661
00:47:39,436 --> 00:47:40,701
That incident?

662
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:45,500
You know how persistent she can be.

663
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,701
Whenever she had time, she went to that neighborhood...

664
00:47:48,205 --> 00:47:51,311
and looked for people who were involved with the church.

665
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:54,241
But there was one man...

666
00:47:55,515 --> 00:47:58,351
named Joseph that she couldn't find anywhere...

667
00:47:59,055 --> 00:48:01,621
as if someone hid him away on purpose.

668
00:48:03,626 --> 00:48:05,020
Who is he?

669
00:48:05,225 --> 00:48:08,761
He lived at the church, taking care of all kinds of chores.

670
00:48:09,066 --> 00:48:11,130
His responsibilities included...

671
00:48:12,336 --> 00:48:14,661
managing the CCTV.

672
00:48:16,305 --> 00:48:18,670
Soo Hyun was searching for him.

673
00:48:20,546 --> 00:48:21,741
What if...

674
00:48:22,006 --> 00:48:24,971
she found him in the end...

675
00:48:25,416 --> 00:48:27,480
and Kang Yo Han found it out?

676
00:48:33,055 --> 00:48:35,181
That's just an assumption.

677
00:48:35,526 --> 00:48:37,420
You think Kang Yo Han killed his own brother?

678
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:41,261
Do you know how much he suffered after his death?

679
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:45,666
His suffering was completely real.

680
00:48:45,666 --> 00:48:46,860
What if...

681
00:48:48,265 --> 00:48:49,900
he was suffering from guilt?

682
00:48:52,175 --> 00:48:56,170
What if that's why he was hiding his past so desperately...

683
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,440
and Soo Hyun was closing in on it?

684
00:49:05,356 --> 00:49:06,550
Please stop.

685
00:49:10,925 --> 00:49:12,190
I'll be going.

686
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:16,761
Answer me one thing.

687
00:49:20,936 --> 00:49:22,500
If Soo Hyun saw you...

688
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:26,170
electrocute a person...

689
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,340
next to Kang Yo Han,

690
00:49:32,646 --> 00:49:34,011
what would she have said?

691
00:50:03,106 --> 00:50:06,340
That doesn't mean a judge can act out like Kang Yo Han.

692
00:50:06,515 --> 00:50:09,581
What you heard and saw are weird enough.

693
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,781
He broke the rules.

694
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:13,951
That's also a crime.

695
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:16,951
- And don't get the wrong idea. - What wrong idea?

696
00:50:17,455 --> 00:50:20,121
Whether Kang Yo Han had a reason or not,

697
00:50:20,796 --> 00:50:22,526
nothing changes.

698
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:24,491
Everyone has a reason.

699
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:27,900
But not everyone breaks the law.

700
00:50:43,316 --> 00:50:44,851
If Soo Hyun saw you...

701
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:48,020
electrocute a person...

702
00:50:48,026 --> 00:50:49,650
next to Kang Yo Han,

703
00:50:51,955 --> 00:50:53,320
what would she have said?

(Ministry of Justice)

705
00:51:08,905 --> 00:51:10,710
Ga On, what's going on?

706
00:51:12,475 --> 00:51:13,845
Why are you here?

707
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:15,641
- Soo Hyun. - What are you doing here?

708
00:51:18,716 --> 00:51:20,880
Do you know what I had to do for you?

709
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:24,690
I had to destroy the evidence.

710
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:30,391
How could you disappoint me like that? How could you?

711
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:58,690
What do I do?

712
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:00,491
That poor grandpa.

713
00:52:01,566 --> 00:52:04,230
I really had no idea he would die like that.

714
00:52:06,066 --> 00:52:08,500
No. He's going to save me.

715
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:11,831
He cares for me a lot.

716
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,511
He's not going to abandon me like this.

717
00:52:20,216 --> 00:52:21,840
He won't.

718
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:25,351
What is it?

719
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:27,281
What are you doing? Darn it!

720
00:52:27,756 --> 00:52:28,824
What is this?

721
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:30,250
Stop it!

722
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:57,210

("Beyond Good and Evil")

724
00:53:18,276 --> 00:53:19,931
Are you really going to move forward with it?

725
00:53:23,345 --> 00:53:24,915
Is there a reason to stop?

726
00:53:24,916 --> 00:53:26,945
Bad people were the ones who committed a crime,

727
00:53:26,946 --> 00:53:29,511
so why must innocent citizens be punished?

728
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:31,186
Punished?

729
00:53:31,186 --> 00:53:32,216
Are you saying...

730
00:53:32,216 --> 00:53:34,581
that making people kill someone in the middle of the day...

731
00:53:34,986 --> 00:53:36,420
isn't a punishment?

732
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:39,791
Is it okay to let someone else kill them instead?

733
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:45,335
I don't believe in cheap justice...

734
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:47,900
that people talk about in the comforts of their own homes.

735
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:50,634
You want someone else...

736
00:53:50,635 --> 00:53:52,831
to fight evil on your behalf without getting your hands dirty?

737
00:53:53,075 --> 00:53:54,500
That just makes them accomplices.

738
00:53:55,876 --> 00:53:59,371
There is no such thing as an innocent person in this world.

739
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:01,181
No. I disagree.

740
00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:03,744
Even if they can't stand up to fight,

741
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:05,685
there are a lot more people who do no harm...

742
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:07,654
and work hard each day.

743
00:54:07,655 --> 00:54:11,050
And in order to protect that world, some people risk their lives.

744
00:54:11,825 --> 00:54:14,820
Just like Dr. Yoon Myung Jin...

745
00:54:18,236 --> 00:54:20,061
and police officers like Soo Hyun.

746
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:27,500
A world where everyone has blood on their hands is just pandemonium.

747
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:31,440
You're trying to make the world like that.

748
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:35,380
The world I was born into was always like that.

749
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:37,550
Can you please stop?

750
00:54:37,885 --> 00:54:41,781
I don't want to see you go to a place you can't turn back from.

751
00:54:41,785 --> 00:54:42,880
Please.

752
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:45,121
I don't...

753
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:48,491
have another choice.

754
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:00,871
May I ask you something?

755
00:55:01,845 --> 00:55:02,940
What is it?

756
00:55:02,946 --> 00:55:04,971
When we went to the site of forced removals,

757
00:55:05,146 --> 00:55:06,744
did you know that the conflict between...

758
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:08,541
the residents and the Jukchang troops...

759
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:11,181
could end with a casualty?

760
00:55:14,756 --> 00:55:18,195
Your neighbors are dying right now.

761
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:20,094
Are you just going to sit and watch?

762
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:21,690
Get hit with a rock!

763
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:26,831
- Chief Kang. - Judge Kang got hit with a rock!

764
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,804
Did he get hurt badly?

765
00:55:28,805 --> 00:55:29,900
Judge Kang!

766
00:55:30,066 --> 00:55:32,204
You ought to be punished!

767
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:33,871
Darn it!

768
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,541
Kang Yo Han!

769
00:55:44,455 --> 00:55:47,681
Get down here!

770
00:55:48,155 --> 00:55:51,291
Get down here!

771
00:55:58,495 --> 00:56:00,891
Wasn't that your plan all along?

772
00:56:02,436 --> 00:56:04,570
If you want people to fight,

773
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:08,641
you needed a victim to shed blood.

774
00:56:21,955 --> 00:56:23,920
Is that really what it was?

775
00:56:26,555 --> 00:56:28,590
If you have time to ask me questions,

776
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:30,761
act.

777
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:12,960
(National Participation in Kim Choong Sik's Execution)

778
00:58:31,756 --> 00:58:33,681
The time has finally come.

779
00:58:34,055 --> 00:58:35,150
Please get ready.

780
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:48,261
Are you going to take full responsibility?

781
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:51,331
Are you sure nobody ordered you to do this?

782
00:58:51,506 --> 00:58:53,601
I already said so. Why do you keep asking,

783
00:58:54,546 --> 00:58:55,971
you evil jerk?

784
00:58:57,946 --> 00:59:02,581
Very well. Fellow citizens. Please execute his sentence.

787
00:59:32,376 --> 00:59:34,581
Is this fun for you?

788
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:16,081
I'm not going to die.

789
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:17,781
Why would I die?

790
01:00:21,725 --> 01:00:23,621
I didn't do anything wrong.

791
01:00:24,196 --> 01:00:28,031
You're a true patriot, so why are you suffering like this?

792
01:00:28,765 --> 01:00:31,005
You've been through so much. I mean it.

793
01:00:31,006 --> 01:00:32,471
Have a seat.

794
01:00:39,916 --> 01:00:43,241
Why is a man like you crying?

795
01:00:43,785 --> 01:00:45,215
Did you think I'd abandon you?

796
01:00:45,216 --> 01:00:47,154
It's me. I'm Heo Joong Se.

797
01:00:47,155 --> 01:00:50,755
No, sir. I had complete faith in you.

798
01:00:50,756 --> 01:00:54,090
That's right. You just need to trust me.

799
01:00:56,626 --> 01:00:59,331
Have a bit more faith in me.

800
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:02,034
You need to sit...

801
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:04,204
- in that chair for a bit. - What?

802
01:01:04,205 --> 01:01:07,275
That Kang Yo Han is just putting on a show.

803
01:01:07,276 --> 01:01:11,000
He's just threatening you until you say my name.

804
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,145
But still... Are you telling me to die?

805
01:01:14,146 --> 01:01:16,581
Don't be scared.

806
01:01:16,716 --> 01:01:19,610
Just endure it.

807
01:01:19,816 --> 01:01:23,480
If things seem really precarious,

808
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:25,221
I'll stop it.

809
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:28,364
I'll cut off all electricity to the Supreme Court to save you.

810
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:30,090
So don't worry.

811
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,331
This is all for the sake of our nation.

812
01:01:34,495 --> 01:01:35,764
Your wish.

813
01:01:35,765 --> 01:01:38,105
I told you hundreds of thousands of times.

814
01:01:38,106 --> 01:01:40,770
I'll make it come true. I'm serious.

815
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:42,445
Will you do that, sir?

816
01:01:42,446 --> 01:01:44,971
The thing you've dreamt of all your life.

817
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:48,480
An apartment that overlooks the Han River.

818
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:51,480
A permanent position in a state-owned company.

819
01:01:51,486 --> 01:01:55,181
And on top of that, I'll give you a ton of Bitcoins.

820
01:01:56,555 --> 01:01:57,750
Mr. President!

821
01:01:58,126 --> 01:01:59,391
Thank you.

822
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:00,951
You fool.

823
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:02,621
You're so brave.

824
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:09,761
Yes. It's okay. Cry.

825
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:13,831
Who are you to kill me?

826
01:02:17,245 --> 01:02:18,511
Give it a go.

Members of the public.

829
01:02:41,836 --> 01:02:43,701
You are sovereign.

830
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:47,201
That is why you must be responsible.

831
01:02:47,506 --> 01:02:50,800
You are sovereign because you show responsibility.

832
01:02:51,416 --> 01:02:55,241
I need you to exercise your ownership.

833
01:02:59,155 --> 01:03:01,420
"Exercise your ownership"?

834
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:06,621
What a joke.

835
01:03:10,696 --> 01:03:12,565
Will you let him go?

836
01:03:12,566 --> 01:03:15,831
Even so. It's so dreadful.

837
01:03:16,265 --> 01:03:19,174
I can't kill someone myself.

838
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:21,940
He killed once. Won't he kill again?

839
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:24,940
He got up to all sorts of evil.

840
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:26,776
We have to vote.

841
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:28,710
Let's all vote.

842
01:03:28,716 --> 01:03:30,411
- Vote. - Shall we?

Oh, nice. Wow, I'm feeling it.

(What's your choice?)

847
01:03:49,905 --> 01:03:51,630
Hey, it really worked.

848
01:03:51,776 --> 01:03:52,836
It worked?

849
01:03:52,836 --> 01:03:54,745
Did it go up when you voted?

850
01:03:54,745 --> 01:03:57,041
Yes. I wasn't sure, but it really worked.

851
01:03:57,245 --> 01:03:58,411
Did it?

852
01:03:58,745 --> 01:04:00,141
Should I give it a go?

853
01:04:01,416 --> 01:04:02,716
You jerk.

854
01:04:02,716 --> 01:04:05,110
Yes. The law is the law.

855
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:07,911
We should vote.

856
01:04:07,986 --> 01:04:09,626
(What's your choice?)

857
01:04:09,626 --> 01:04:11,655
It actually works.

897

You are just a clown I put here as a puppet.

899
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:18,621
What now?

900
01:08:18,856 --> 01:08:20,056
He's so lucky.

901
01:08:20,056 --> 01:08:21,754
It belonged to Soo Hyun.

902
01:08:21,755 --> 01:08:24,090
It's time you found out the truth.

903
01:08:24,196 --> 01:08:25,821
I saw it clearly.

904
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:27,825
Did you meet Joseph?

905
01:08:27,825 --> 01:08:30,960
This is what the young master did his best to hide.

906
01:08:31,766 --> 01:08:33,460

01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:35,130
