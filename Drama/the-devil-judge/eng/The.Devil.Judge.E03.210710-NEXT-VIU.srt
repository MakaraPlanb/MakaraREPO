00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:13,312
(The Devil Judge)

2
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:16,345
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

3
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:18,981
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

4
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,822
(Episode 3)

5
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,121
Are you looking for this?

6
00:00:29,096 --> 00:00:30,431
You knew.

7
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:33,532
(Safe Korea, it is now a reality.)

8
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:35,801
Why are you doing this?

9
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,032
Why am I doing this?

10
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:40,402
Yes.

11
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:41,872
Because I can.

12
00:00:41,907 --> 00:00:43,041
What?

13
00:00:43,107 --> 00:00:45,012
Possibility is like a drug.

14
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,321
Get down!

15
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,631
(Your judgment brings justice.)

16
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,541
Is he dead?

17
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,081
No.

18
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,252
Did you kill him?

19
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:27,982
No.

20
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,791
Look. He's not dead.

21
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,932
It's not fun at all.

22
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:40,832
Why is it not fun?

23
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:48,372
Where am I?

24
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,342
It's not paradise.

25
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:55,041
I wouldn't push it if I were you.

26
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,022
(Do not enter, Investigation in progress)

27
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:06,821
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

28
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:12,391
Alpha, check in.

29
00:02:14,437 --> 00:02:17,231
(Stop)

30
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:21,541
The nation's in shock after a bomb went off in a judge's office.

31
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:24,616
The public's main focus is the safety...

32
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:25,972
of Judge Kang Yo Han.

33
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,812
When the case was reported,

34
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:29,416
the police started an investigation...

35
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:32,587
and collected the security footage and the visitors' log.

36
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,522
- He's coming out! - It's Kang Yo Han.

37
00:02:34,527 --> 00:02:35,786
He's here!

38
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,321
- Let's get a photo. - Excuse me.

39
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,265
- He's coming out. - There he is.

40
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,706
Judge Kang, are you badly injured?

41
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:49,032
How are you?

42
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,671
- Are you all right? - Are you safe?

43
00:02:52,237 --> 00:02:54,505
I am, thanks to the public's concern.

44
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,141
Are you not badly wounded?

45
00:02:57,916 --> 00:02:59,141
It's bearable.

46
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:00,646
Who's behind it?

47
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,216
We haven't concluded that yet.

48
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:04,515
Could we say it's an act of terror from a party who was...

49
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,921
- upset with the live court show? - That's possible.

50
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,881
Will the live court show be stopped?

51
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:12,992
I have something to say to you.

52
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:15,722
It looks like someone is very scared.

53
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:19,897
An act of cowardly terror cannot halt the public's judgment.

54
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,002
(I will not give in to terror.)

55
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,631
The live court show will go on as planned.

56
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,601
What case will you handle this time?

57
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,436
I'll sentence the child of someone influential...

58
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:34,502
who continuously abused the weak and unfortunate.

59
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:37,073
The defendant is...

60
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:39,442
the VP of Joongwon FNB, Lee Young Min.

61
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:41,473
- Lee Young Min? - Lee Young Min?

62
00:03:41,518 --> 00:03:44,847
Isn't VP Lee Young Min the son of Minister Cha Kyung Hee?

63
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:46,312
- What's he saying? - Yes, that's correct.

64
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:49,687
If you put the Minister of Justice's son on trial,

65
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,726
won't the prosecution retaliate?

66
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,892
Everyone is equal before the law.

67
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:57,523
To me, everyone is just a defendant.

68
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,163
Kang Yo Han, that punk.

69
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:12,642
Still, there will be a lot of retaliation.

70
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:17,312
Even if a dog barks, the train moves on.

71
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,512
A dog?

72
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:22,952
Judge, I have a question!

73
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:24,423
Good for you!

74
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,363
Young Min.

75
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:39,762
Minister. Minister.

76
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:47,773
Let's have a look.

77
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:53,413
I'm with the police.

78
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:56,952
Judge!

79
00:04:58,357 --> 00:05:00,083
Is Judge Kim Ga On okay?

80
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:01,923
Who are you?

81
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:04,093
I'm Yoon Soo Hyun with the RIU in charge of this case.

82
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:06,423
I see. Do your best, please.

83
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:09,293
- Is Judge Kim Ga On okay? - Yes, he's okay.

84
00:05:09,368 --> 00:05:11,438
Do you know him personally?

85
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,802
Are you two dating?

86
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,103
No. We're friends.

87
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:19,142
I didn't know Judge Kim had a cop friend.

88
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:20,673
Where is Ga On?

89
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:24,583
- I'm sorry, but I cannot tell you. - What?

90
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:26,387
His safety is of utmost importance.

91
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:27,817
There could be another attack,

92
00:05:27,818 --> 00:05:30,382
so it's best he focuses on his treatment somewhere safe.

93
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:33,127
Where is he? Let me see him.

94
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:34,353
Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun.

95
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:37,062
I apologize.

96
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,293
Catch the culprit.

97
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:41,492
Leave Judge Kim to me.

98
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:57,642
Who are you?

99
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,213
I apologize.

100
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,283
Why are you so surprised?

101
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,523
Did Master Yo Han not say anything?

102
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,822
What do you mean?

103
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:13,593
Then I have nothing to tell you.

104
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:16,682
I will bring you a fresh tray of food.

105
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,223
What's going on?

106
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:29,922
Rich people...

107
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:35,883
It looks really old. How much is it?

108
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:38,523
It's a national treasure. Put it down.

109
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,133
It was a joke.

110
00:08:44,138 --> 00:08:45,633
You're so stupid.

111
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:48,763
Don't go prying and stay in bed.

112
00:08:50,107 --> 00:08:52,403
Who are you that you're talking to me like that?

113
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:57,613
Elijah.

114
00:08:57,648 --> 00:08:59,672
Eli? Is that your name?

115
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:02,113
The name's Elijah, stupid.

116
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:03,753
Didn't you even read the bible?

117
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,623
Okay, Elijah.

118
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:12,493
By the way, have I done something to upset you?

119
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:18,996
- Your face. - What?

120
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:20,733
I don't like your face.

121
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,733
How dare you...

122
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:25,603
"How dare you"? How can you say that about a person's face?

123
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:28,042
I don't understand why Yo Han brought you here.

124
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:29,346
You're just a fake.

125
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:31,312
Hold on. Wait up!

126
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:33,212
Hey.

127
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,653
What on earth is this place?

128
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:43,797
Dad, what do I do?

129
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:47,422
What did I ever do to be tried in that people's court? Crazy jerk.

130
00:09:47,898 --> 00:09:50,297
I know. He's a complete psycho.

131
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,163
What kind of judge is that?

132
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,866
Don't worry, Young Min.

133
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:57,103
Your mom will protect you.

134
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:00,033
How dare he come after my son?

135
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:11,753
Dad.

136
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,783
There's something I haven't told you.

137
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:15,983
Okay.

138
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:20,493
Kang Yo Han, that psycho, might be coming after me on purpose.

139
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,222
What do you mean?

140
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,663
What I mean is...

141
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:27,332
Young Min.

142
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,302
Young Min.

143
00:10:33,877 --> 00:10:35,503
Oh, hi, honey.

144
00:10:36,707 --> 00:10:37,873
Mom.

145
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:44,017
How can you disappoint me like this?

146
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,212
What is this? Answer me!

147
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:47,722
I'm sorry.

148
00:10:48,587 --> 00:10:50,422
Look me in the eyes.

149
00:10:50,857 --> 00:10:53,092
Right now. Come on.

150
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:56,363
Look me in the eyes. Look.

151
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:01,462
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

152
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,403
Do you understand?

153
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:05,702
Yes.

154
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:16,143
Honey, are you sure everything will be fine?

155
00:11:17,117 --> 00:11:20,182
How could you let this happen to the kid?

156
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:23,557
Well, I've taken care of everything,

157
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,292
but there was just one case...

158
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:27,292
that went a little wrong.

159
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:30,422
Will it be okay?

160
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:32,962
Don't worry.

161
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:40,332
There will be no trial.

162
00:11:52,018 --> 00:11:53,682
Are you going to sit back and watch?

163
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,052
Oh, welcome.

164
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,922
Hello, Minister Cha.

165
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,797
What were you saying?

166
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:03,692
Am I going to sit back and watch? Watch what?

167
00:12:04,398 --> 00:12:06,167
I'll be going then.

168
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:07,267
Already?

169
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,062
Considering my position, it's inappropriate for me...

170
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,072
to come in contact with the defendant's family.

171
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:15,103
This is nothing personal, Minister Cha.

172
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:17,613
We should keep personal feelings separate from work, right?

173
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:23,212
Same here. It's nothing personal...

174
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,812
no matter what I'll do from now on.

175
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,133
Judge Kang?

176
00:12:44,408 --> 00:12:45,503
Ms. Jung.

177
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:49,346
Are you here with a message from the foundation or something?

178
00:12:49,347 --> 00:12:51,873
I have many messages to deliver here and there.

179
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:55,983
Anyway, are you okay? Are you hurt?

180
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,783
There's something interesting about the terror attack.

181
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:01,822
Pardon?

182
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:04,657
It wasn't serious enough to kill anyone,

183
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,496
but it wasn't trivial enough to be ignored.

184
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:08,922
It was just at that perfect level.

185
00:13:09,168 --> 00:13:11,763
As if to warn somebody.

186
00:13:13,237 --> 00:13:16,633
My goodness. That sure is very interesting.

187
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:19,072
Maybe I'm being too imaginative.

188
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:24,777
Then again, there are people who are wise enough to heed warnings...

189
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:27,846
and people who do not, only to regret later.

190
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,616
That's my observation.

191
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:30,853
I totally agree.

192
00:13:31,217 --> 00:13:34,483
There certainly are people who do not heed warnings.

193
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:51,332
Many sponsors of our foundation seem concerned.

194
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,277
With the announcement of the Dream Home plan coming up,

195
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:56,942
they don't want this case to provoke the people.

196
00:13:58,117 --> 00:13:59,743
I'm sorry to say this, Minister Cha.

197
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,946
The privileged class abusing their power...

198
00:14:03,947 --> 00:14:06,952
is a topic that the public feels strongly against.

199
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:11,826
In these important times, you should've kept a closer eye.

200
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,427
Does your son have trouble controlling his emotions?

201
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,363
Does he have mood swings?

202
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,996
Is that because his mom is so aggressive?

203
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:20,363
Does that stress him out and...

204
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:28,507
Minister Cha, there's something I've been meaning to mention.

205
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:32,216
You tend to have this intense look in your eyes.

206
00:14:32,217 --> 00:14:36,712
It's not really a quality appreciated in a woman.

207
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,653
You're out of line, sir.

208
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,653
Should the next live court show handle another case...

209
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:48,422
It's over a million.

210
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,137
The number of people who signed the petition.

211
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:56,332
"Please find out who's behind the attack against Judge Kang."

212
00:14:58,377 --> 00:14:59,937
Isn't it scary?

213
00:14:59,938 --> 00:15:02,376
It took just one day. A million people in one day.

214
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:04,677
If we mess with Kang Yo Han,

215
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:07,442
there will be a riot.

216
00:15:07,918 --> 00:15:09,113
I understand.

217
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,257
If the government feels uncomfortable stepping in,

218
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:13,753
I'll take care of it myself.

219
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:30,802
What are you doing?

220
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,533
What do you think I'm doing?

221
00:15:34,678 --> 00:15:36,003
I'll do it.

222
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:38,643
It's not like I want to do this. Stay still.

223
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:41,442
- I can do it... - I said, stay still.

224
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,413
Let me get you up.

225
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:52,393
Are you okay?

226
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:53,653
Yes.

227
00:16:04,237 --> 00:16:06,007
Where's that lady?

228
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,342
Who? The nanny?

229
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,047
She went home.

230
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,212
A nanny?

231
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,212
What's this?

232
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:21,452
I got it when I was immature.

233
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:23,822
I'm surprised.

234
00:16:24,928 --> 00:16:26,596
- Are you an old fart? - What?

235
00:16:26,597 --> 00:16:29,962
Judging others without knowing them. That's what an old fart does.

236
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:40,106
That hurts.

237
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,942
Exaggerating. That's what a kid does.

238
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:44,242
"Exaggerating"?

239
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,752
Hello, everyone.

240
00:16:51,758 --> 00:16:54,252
I'm Judge Oh Jin Joo of the live court.

241
00:16:54,857 --> 00:16:58,096
Recently, there was a terror attack at the Supreme Court.

242
00:16:58,097 --> 00:17:01,222
I'm sure it left all of you worried.

243
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,967
But Judge Kang Yo Han...

244
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:06,663
will never give in to a threat of this sort.

245
00:17:07,268 --> 00:17:09,037
As you all know,

246
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:13,073
Judge Kang Yo Han is an extremely strong person.

247
00:17:13,508 --> 00:17:16,807
Until Judge Kang Yo Han and Judge Kim Ga On...

248
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:20,143
come back safely to the court, please show support...

249
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:21,583
Who's this woman?

250
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:24,616
She's Judge Oh. We work together...

251
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,457
- Are you two together? - What are you talking about?

252
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,027
She's an associate judge...

253
00:17:28,028 --> 00:17:30,522
- Are you together? - No, we're not.

254
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:34,096
She is just overly dramatic and cries easily, that's all.

255
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:35,396
- So you're not together? - No.

256
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:36,596
Are you serious?

257
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:37,692
Yes.

258
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:40,633
You're boring.

259
00:17:49,177 --> 00:17:50,807
Why did you bring that idiot here?

260
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:53,176
Who? Ga On?

261
00:17:53,177 --> 00:17:54,482
Even his name is pathetic.

262
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,682
Send him away.

263
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,383
Why? Is he bothering you?

264
00:18:01,488 --> 00:18:03,727
Send him away, or I'll kill him.

265
00:18:03,728 --> 00:18:05,022
When you can't even walk?

266
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:07,666
You said, if you can walk again, you'll kill me first.

267
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:10,722
Don't get ahead of yourself. One at a time, okay?

268
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:28,413
Aren't you going to follow her?

269
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:30,742
No?

270
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:48,363
Stay put. Don't wander around.

271
00:18:48,907 --> 00:18:50,633
Is there something I shouldn't see?

272
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:52,732
Curiosity killed the cat.

273
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:55,747
I'm feeling okay now. I'll go home.

274
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:58,413
It's safer here. The terrorist hasn't been caught yet.

275
00:18:58,677 --> 00:19:01,113
By the way, what about the trial?

276
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:05,182
I'll find a substitute judge. Don't worry.

277
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,353
Substitute judge?

278
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:11,422
This is Judge Jung In Seok.

279
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:14,663
He's going to fill in for Judge Kim until he fully recovers.

280
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,093
It's nice to meet you, Judge Oh.

281
00:19:16,528 --> 00:19:19,163
Gosh, you totally look like a judge.

282
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:23,333
- Excuse me? - What? Never mind.

283
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:25,333
- It's nice to meet you. - Oh, right.

284
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:28,147
- Good to see you. - Thank you...

285
00:19:28,147 --> 00:19:30,146
for being brave enough to join us in a crisis like this.

286
00:19:30,147 --> 00:19:32,846
It's an honor to be a part of the live court show.

287
00:19:32,847 --> 00:19:34,043
I'll do my best.

288
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,583
We're lucky to have you.

289
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:37,482
Now if you'll excuse me.

290
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:46,992
- You said you'll do your best. - Excuse me?

291
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,363
Then go do your best.

292
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:54,293
No, wait.

293
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,563
That's Judge Kim's desk.

294
00:19:56,837 --> 00:19:58,403
Then where should I sit?

295
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,242
You can sit over there.

296
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:04,472
Oh, okay.

297
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:05,948
(Associate Judge Oh Jin Joo)

298
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,942
We don't have much time until the next live show.

299
00:20:08,087 --> 00:20:09,282
So we should start working.

300
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,543
Yes, ma'am.

301
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,672
I believe Master Yo Han told you to stay put in bed.

302
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,373
I can't stay put anymore. I'm bored.

303
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:10,573
I'm not Sleeping Beauty, you know.

304
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,813
I can make you stay asleep if you want me to.

305
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,057
Like Sleeping Beauty.

306
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,323
- Excuse me? - It was a joke.

307
00:21:22,758 --> 00:21:25,353
That was a creepy joke.

308
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:40,803
People in this house don't listen to you.

309
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:44,202
(Supreme Court Control Center)

310
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,722
We looked through it, and there was no visitor.

311
00:21:57,728 --> 00:21:59,623
You are so persistent, Detective.

312
00:22:02,627 --> 00:22:04,932
No one from outside visited his office.

313
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:09,063
Do you think someone from the inside could've done this?

314
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,172
Someone from the inside.

315
00:22:13,677 --> 00:22:14,942
That's possible.

316
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:16,603
Right?

317
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:18,873
Judge Kang is doing too well.

318
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:21,682
Maybe one of the judges has a grudge against him.

319
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:25,383
The explosive went off near the painting on the wall.

320
00:22:25,587 --> 00:22:26,717
Yes.

321
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,252
So what if someone didn't sneak in to place it?

322
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:31,393
What if it was planted in the painting from the beginning?

323
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:32,992
From the beginning?

324
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,692
Which company was in charge of the interior design of the office?

325
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:38,962
May I have the number?

326
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,573
I think Detective Yoon got a lead.

327
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:48,972
Follow her.

328
00:22:49,308 --> 00:22:51,942
We should find who's behind before the police do.

329
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:09,163
(Se Eol City)

330
00:23:52,077 --> 00:23:54,032
Sir, may I speak with you?

331
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:56,403
Sir?

332
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:58,873
No, what are you doing!

333
00:24:00,617 --> 00:24:02,482
- No, wait! - Let go of him.

334
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:04,712
Where are you from?

335
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:06,553
We're from the Regional Investigation Unit.

336
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,932
Did you install all the office equipment for the judges...

337
00:24:19,998 --> 00:24:22,502
- on the live court show? - I don't know.

338
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:24,803
Let me see your account book.

339
00:24:25,077 --> 00:24:26,507
Is that the office?

340
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,272
Let me see your warrant first.

341
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:35,212
Gosh, maybe you were too busy to get a warrant.

342
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:37,712
Come back with a warrant.

343
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:40,053
I'll be waiting for you.

344
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:14,053
You're in a good mood.

345
00:25:21,568 --> 00:25:23,262
What the heck.

346
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:25,063
This is an interesting place.

347
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:27,932
This is a furniture plant.

348
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,333
But how come you make small bombs like this?

349
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,272
You little...

350
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,482
You almost got me killed.

351
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,323
You have a death wish.

352
00:26:05,837 --> 00:26:08,032
Don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything.

353
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:09,373
But you know what?

354
00:26:09,508 --> 00:26:11,613
I don't want anything from you.

355
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,186
I'll tell you. I'll tell you everything.

356
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,043
My gosh, you talk too much.

357
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:28,053
I'll... I'll tell you everything.

358
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,298
The foundation...

359
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,067
Someone from the foundation made me do it.

360
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:34,863
They wanted to scare you off.

361
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:37,702
That's enough.

362
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:42,502
Judge.

363
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:51,553
Go back to your master...

364
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,182
and tell him to deal with me himself.

365
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,992
Are you doing this because of Judge Kim?

366
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:34,722
So you've been behaving yourself.

367
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:38,022
You did what I asked so here's a present for you.

368
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,103
Did you get hurt?

It's nothing.

How's the preparation for Lee Young Min's trial going?

371
00:27:58,018 --> 00:27:59,252
What is there to prepare?

372
00:27:59,357 --> 00:28:00,712
It's a simple case.

373
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:02,952
I understand you like to prepare for trials thoroughly...

374
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:05,492
- in every aspect. - Do I?

375
00:28:06,127 --> 00:28:08,262
I don't know what you're talking about.

376
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:12,093
You said that justice doesn't exist in reality, right?

377
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:14,893
You said that all that exists is a terribly unfair game.

378
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,732
So?

379
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:30,883
What is the reason you got involved...

380
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,482
in that terribly unfair game?

381
00:28:34,157 --> 00:28:35,452
The reason...

382
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:43,366
Do I need to have a reason?

383
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:45,836
Is there something you want to make right?

384
00:28:45,837 --> 00:28:47,393
Or perhaps something you regret?

385
00:28:50,137 --> 00:28:52,007
- Are you an old fart? - Pardon?

386
00:28:52,008 --> 00:28:55,403
You said that judging other people was a characteristic of an old fart.

387
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:58,646
- No, it's not that... - Hurry up and get better.

I heard foreign tourists stopped staying there. Am I right?

Also, why are you raising your voice?

489
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,347

509
00:34:49,328 --> 00:34:51,427

523
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:57,222
How you understood how weak citizens and displaced people felt.

524
00:35:57,368 --> 00:36:01,032
Gosh. That's a given.

00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,617
I'm just a mere errand girl.

529
00:36:17,618 --> 00:36:19,916

531
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:24,927

Are you happy?

534
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,902
What did you just say to me?

535
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:44,007
You should massage your face too.

536
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:46,213
Oh, my face?

00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:01,963
Master.

544
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:04,602
I will protect you.

545
00:38:05,547 --> 00:38:07,272
Poor young master.

546
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:09,812
"Master"?

547
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:13,113
Kang Yo Han's not home right now.

548
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:19,022
This house belongs to you.

549
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,223
It doesn't belong to him.

(Request for Summary Order)

551
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:59,066
"Victim Lee Ji Hoon asked defendant Lee Young Min to park."

552
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:02,432
"The defendant slapped the victim's cheek and hit his abdomen."

553
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:08,832
Does Lee Young Min have anger management issues?

554
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:11,033
Why would he do this at a restaurant?

555
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:14,243
I guess he didn't have to curb his anger.

556
00:39:14,677 --> 00:39:16,372
Why would he?

557
00:39:17,317 --> 00:39:19,542
Kim Yeon Hae? Hello.

558
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:20,783
Thanks for waiting.

(Menu)

560
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,423
Why did we come to this dirty place?

561
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:30,926
This place was on TV for being an alley gourmet diner.

562
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:32,662
It's really famous.

563
00:39:32,668 --> 00:39:34,763
It's a hotspot.

564
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:37,763
Sure. You eat all you want.

565
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,807
He can't park here.

566
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:42,702
Who owns car number 0615?

567
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,708

569

- Is 0615 your car? - No.

570
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:51,142
- Is 0615 your car? - It's ours.

571
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,082
It's your car.

572
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:55,816
Do you own the car outside?

573
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:58,482
- So what? - Do you mind moving it?

574
00:39:58,518 --> 00:40:01,426
- Why? - It's in the way,

575
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:02,852
and people complain.

576
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,292
I apologize.

577
00:40:04,927 --> 00:40:06,062
Here.

578
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:08,022
You move it.

579
00:40:08,098 --> 00:40:09,696
- Pardon? - I gave you the key.

580
00:40:09,697 --> 00:40:11,133
You move my car.

581
00:40:12,237 --> 00:40:14,602
I can't drive a customer's car...

582
00:40:14,868 --> 00:40:17,872
Hey. Don't you see I'm drinking?

583
00:40:17,907 --> 00:40:19,973
Will you take the blame if I'm caught drunk driving?

584
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:22,142
- Then can you... - Darn it.

585
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:25,783
Hey. Are you kidding me?

586
00:40:26,518 --> 00:40:30,986
What place doesn't have valet parking these days?

587
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:34,383
You ruined my mood by doing business in a rundown place like this!

588
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:36,553
- Oh, dear. - Stop it!

589
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:37,952
My goodness.

590
00:40:38,098 --> 00:40:40,122
You can't do this.

591
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:42,196
Sir, you can't just hit someone.

592
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:44,133
Oh, can't I?

593
00:40:44,237 --> 00:40:45,763
Oh, dear.

594
00:40:46,107 --> 00:40:47,263
Darn you.

595
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:49,173
You can't do this.

596
00:40:49,438 --> 00:40:51,832
Can you hit me? Hit me, then.

597
00:40:52,137 --> 00:40:55,443
One of the victims, the chef, had a record for assault.

598
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,713
That's why he held back.

599
00:40:57,717 --> 00:41:00,142
Don't do this. Please stop.

600
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:03,113
Why? Do you need money too?

601
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:04,812
Then I'll hit you.

602
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,553
Stop it already.

603
00:41:07,558 --> 00:41:08,723
Why?

604
00:41:09,197 --> 00:41:10,653
Why should I stop?

605
00:41:10,657 --> 00:41:12,693
Why do you keep telling me to stop?

606
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,693
Aren't we having fun?

607
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:17,066
Aren't we? Isn't this fun? Isn't it?

608
00:41:17,067 --> 00:41:19,202
Please stop it.

609
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:22,102
They were so angry, he tried to settle a few times,

610
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:23,303
but they refused.

611
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:24,502
They won't settle.

612
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:26,542
The three victims have each other's backs.

613
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,173
Yes, Minister.

614
00:41:30,418 --> 00:41:37,513
(Cha Kyung Hee, Minister of Justice)

615
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,452
Hello, Chief Justice.

616
00:41:56,507 --> 00:41:58,702
- Hello? - Are you Kim Sung Ho?

617
00:41:58,878 --> 00:42:00,173
Yes.

618
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:02,513
This is the Prosecutors' Office.

619
00:42:05,618 --> 00:42:07,582
I need you to come over.

620
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:08,848
What for?

621
00:42:08,848 --> 00:42:11,682
You were investigated for assault before, weren't you?

622
00:42:11,688 --> 00:42:13,457
I paid the price for that.

623
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:16,792
We decide whether it's over or not.

624
00:42:16,797 --> 00:42:20,162
We got a tip that your investigation wasn't thorough.

625
00:42:20,368 --> 00:42:22,932
Come over, okay?

626
00:42:42,918 --> 00:42:44,982
Kang Yo Han's Certificate of Family Relations?

627
00:42:44,987 --> 00:42:47,252
Yes. There's something to it.

628
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:48,823
Can you find out?

629
00:42:49,558 --> 00:42:51,452
Well, I'm not sure.

630
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:55,392
I'm not sure if it's doable because he's not a suspect.

631
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:56,562
Right?

632
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:58,037
Still, I'll have a look.

633
00:42:58,038 --> 00:43:00,332
- Thank you, Soo Hyun. - Sure.

634
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:01,502
Bye.

635
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:50,182
- Here's the paperwork. - Thank you.

636
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:54,553
What's this?

637
00:43:55,228 --> 00:43:56,392
Not again.

638
00:43:58,328 --> 00:44:00,062
There's another signed agreement?

639
00:44:01,768 --> 00:44:03,497
Yesterday, we got the male server's.

640
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:05,493
Today it's the female part-timer.

641
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:07,106
"We settled amicably,"

642
00:44:07,107 --> 00:44:09,432
"and I don't want the assailant to be criminally punished."

643
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:10,872
What?

644
00:44:11,038 --> 00:44:14,473
This person petitioned that Lee Young Min be punished severely.

645
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:18,276
And the day before the trial,

646
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:19,783
he signs a settlement?

647
00:44:22,518 --> 00:44:25,213
I guess the defendant really showed remorse this time.

648
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,723
How sincerely did he apologize that they changed their mind?

649
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:34,227
- Hey. Young master. - Yes?

650
00:44:34,228 --> 00:44:37,093
Do you think the world is full of flowers?

651
00:44:38,137 --> 00:44:39,932
What do you mean?

652
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:42,133
The powerful don't show remorse.

653
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,272
That's something the powerless do.

654
00:44:45,378 --> 00:44:46,573
Do you get that?

655
00:44:49,148 --> 00:44:50,272
Yes.

656
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,613
I'm sorry.

657
00:44:57,618 --> 00:44:58,883
I'm sorry.

658
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:01,352
Don't be. Why should you apologize?

659
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:02,553
I'll deal with it.

660
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:05,553
Will you attend the trial tomorrow?

661
00:45:07,368 --> 00:45:08,662
I should.

662
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:11,993
To be honest,

663
00:45:12,837 --> 00:45:16,173
I wouldn't feel this wronged if I had punched him at least.

664
00:45:16,177 --> 00:45:17,832
If I had, I'd give up.

665
00:45:17,907 --> 00:45:19,943
But I can't go on like this.

666
00:45:19,947 --> 00:45:22,243
The anger might kill me.

667
00:45:22,717 --> 00:45:23,943
Chef.

668
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:26,513
Leave it. It's not your fault.

669
00:45:27,288 --> 00:45:28,513
Chef.

670
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:35,653
I say this out of concern for you.

671
00:45:36,898 --> 00:45:38,522
At a time like this,

672
00:45:38,598 --> 00:45:41,562
- going against the Prosecution... - Chief Justice.

673
00:45:42,637 --> 00:45:45,693
Do you believe everyone is equal before the law?

674
00:45:47,438 --> 00:45:50,403
I don't know. Why do you ask?

675
00:45:50,438 --> 00:45:51,803
I don't believe that.

676
00:45:52,748 --> 00:45:56,002
It's a sweet story, just like Santa Claus.

677
00:45:56,078 --> 00:45:59,243
But sometimes, don't you want to believe...

678
00:45:59,288 --> 00:46:00,812
such a sweet story?

679
00:46:00,987 --> 00:46:02,316
Listen, Judge Kang.

680
00:46:02,317 --> 00:46:06,653
Consider this trial a movie, a Christmas special.

681
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:09,182
Also,

682
00:46:10,027 --> 00:46:13,193
please pass on the message that they don't have to worry about me.

683
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:16,493
(Chief Justice Ji Yoon Sik)

684
00:47:02,308 --> 00:47:03,912
Why are you up so early?

685
00:47:04,118 --> 00:47:06,113
You usually sleep until midday.

686
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:07,912
It's Lee Young Min's trial today, right?

687
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,053
Do you want to show support or what?

688
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:11,816
There must not be enough evidence.

689
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:13,982
If you need a witness...

690
00:47:14,828 --> 00:47:16,292
Did you see something?

691
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:19,323
I saw him driving in an aggressive way.

692
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:22,863
You did?

693
00:47:24,938 --> 00:47:26,633
Anything else?

694
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:30,932
Hey! Stop it!

695
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:40,513
Don't worry about the trial. Stay put and get some good rest.

696
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:06,403
This is the day you've all been waiting for.

697
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,978
The live court show, which was postponed by an unexpected incident,

698
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:11,213
is finally back.

699
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:15,617
I can't wait for another refreshing trial.

700
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:18,356
Let's welcome the second live court show...

701
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:21,682
with a round of applause!

702
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:34,232
Before we start the trial, I have an announcement to make.

703
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:40,702
Sadly, Judge Kim Ga On could not be with us for today's trial.

704
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:42,978
- What's that? - Please pray for Judge Kim...

705
00:48:42,978 --> 00:48:45,417
so that he can return to the courtroom in good health.

706
00:48:45,418 --> 00:48:47,187
Judge Kim needs your prayers.

707
00:48:47,188 --> 00:48:49,383
Why is he going overboard?

708
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:52,187
There might be people...

709
00:48:52,188 --> 00:48:54,682
who don't want these trials to go on.

710
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:57,653
And some of them might be in positions of power.

711
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,162
The only thing that can protect us...

712
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:03,593
is you, the public.

713
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,232
- We support you! - We're here for you!

714
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:10,776
- We'll protect you! - We root for you!

715
00:49:10,777 --> 00:49:13,303
- Let's do this! - Keep going!

716
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:16,546
- We root for you! - We're here for you!

717
00:49:16,547 --> 00:49:17,946
Let's do this!

718
00:49:17,947 --> 00:49:20,082
(Defendant)

719
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:26,886
(Live Court Show)

720
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:30,327
Now, let's begin today's trial.

721
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:31,397
(Defendant Lee Young Min)

722
00:49:31,398 --> 00:49:33,926
The defendant has been accused...

723
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:37,296
of committing verbal and physical assault against a server, chef,

724
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:39,432
and part-timer of a restaurant.

725
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:42,863
Defendant Lee Young Min, please come forward.

726
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,573
Defendant Lee Young Min.

727
00:49:49,848 --> 00:49:51,312
- Why doesn't he come forward? - What's wrong?

728
00:49:51,317 --> 00:49:52,872
Please come forward.

729
00:49:55,788 --> 00:49:57,013
Why?

730
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:00,323
(Prosecution)

731
00:50:08,268 --> 00:50:09,392
Your Honor.

732
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:12,033
Yes, Mr. Prosecutor?

733
00:50:12,038 --> 00:50:15,732
Before we begin the trial, I'd like to point something out.

734
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:18,736
Is that right? Please go ahead.

735
00:50:18,737 --> 00:50:21,906
As you already know, this is a simple assault case.

736
00:50:21,907 --> 00:50:23,378
If the victims don't want the defendant punished,

737
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:26,073
the defendant can't be punished.

738
00:50:26,447 --> 00:50:29,486
If all the victims settle with the defendant,

739
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:32,113
the prosecution is forced to withdraw all charges.

740
00:50:32,357 --> 00:50:35,522
But there's one victim who hasn't settled yet.

741
00:50:36,427 --> 00:50:37,892
Do you mean him?

742
00:50:38,527 --> 00:50:40,622
(Witness Kim Sung Hoon)

743
00:50:45,137 --> 00:50:46,702
Please have a seat at the witness stand.

744
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:52,502
Please have a seat.

745
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:54,803
(Witness)

746
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:57,113
Is there something you'd like to say?

747
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,452
I don't want...

748
00:51:06,477 --> 00:51:07,873
the defendant punished.

749
00:51:17,517 --> 00:51:20,213
(Petitioner: Kim Sung Hoon)

750
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,757
- Mr. Kim Sung Hoon? - Yes, Your Honor.

751
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:24,626
You've filed a petition many times,

752
00:51:24,627 --> 00:51:26,427
asking the court to severely punish the defendant.

753
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:27,523
I have.

754
00:51:28,758 --> 00:51:31,166
May I ask why you've changed your mind?

755
00:51:31,167 --> 00:51:32,393
I just...

756
00:51:34,337 --> 00:51:35,536
wanted to end it all.

757
00:51:35,537 --> 00:51:36,702
Why?

758
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:41,606
Ma'am, you know you can tell me anything.

759
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:44,273
Just tell me. Did something happen?

760
00:51:45,508 --> 00:51:47,476
- The building has been sold. - What?

761
00:51:47,477 --> 00:51:51,516
This entire building has been sold to a company.

762
00:51:51,517 --> 00:51:54,786
Why would anyone want this run-down building on the outskirts?

763
00:51:54,787 --> 00:51:55,856
They're going to tear it down.

764
00:51:55,857 --> 00:51:57,757
What? Are they going to build a new building or something?

765
00:51:57,758 --> 00:51:59,186
They just want to tear it down.

766
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:01,793
The land will be left empty.

767
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:06,126
They want us to move out before the contract is up.

768
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:08,996
Are they kicking us out without any compensation?

769
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:10,163
Gosh.

770
00:52:10,238 --> 00:52:11,306
Could it be...

771
00:52:11,307 --> 00:52:13,833
Come on. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

772
00:52:15,337 --> 00:52:20,112
In life, all kinds of things happen.

773
00:52:22,477 --> 00:52:25,447
It's not like I got injured. I'll just pretend nothing happened.

774
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:26,782
Is that so?

775
00:52:30,587 --> 00:52:33,456
As none of the victims want the defendant punished,

776
00:52:33,457 --> 00:52:37,262
the prosecution is forced to withdraw all charges,

777
00:52:37,267 --> 00:52:38,362
Your Honor.

778
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:41,793
Excuse me, Your Honor.

779
00:52:44,508 --> 00:52:46,503
Could you give me a second?

780
00:52:46,607 --> 00:52:47,932
Well...

781
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,472
I'm sorry.

782
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:59,913
(Witness Kim Sung Hoon)

783
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:09,722
I'm sorry.

784
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:16,833
My goodness.

785
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:19,233
I'm sorry.

786
00:53:21,837 --> 00:53:24,376
This concludes today's trial.

787
00:53:24,377 --> 00:53:25,447
Mr. Prosecutor.

788
00:53:25,448 --> 00:53:26,572
Yes?

789
00:53:28,948 --> 00:53:31,983
What do you call it when someone repeats the same thing?

790
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:35,483
I don't understand what you're talking about.

791
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:39,822
Didn't you learn about cases where the same crime is repeated?

792
00:53:41,057 --> 00:53:42,193
By any chance,

793
00:53:42,997 --> 00:53:45,163
are you talking about repeat offenders?

794
00:53:45,928 --> 00:53:47,996
If this were a normal assault case, the defendant wouldn't be punished.

795
00:53:47,997 --> 00:53:50,706
But what if this were a repeat case?

796
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:52,532
Then it'd be different.

797
00:53:52,837 --> 00:53:56,606
But there's no evidence he is a repeat offender...

798
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:00,012
How many times has he assaulted someone and settled?

799
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:02,643
Twelve times in total.

800
00:54:02,678 --> 00:54:04,847
- But that's... - Not enough?

801
00:54:04,848 --> 00:54:08,353
The prosecution seems to take human rights very seriously.

802
00:54:09,457 --> 00:54:10,753
That's wonderful.

803
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:12,456
Please go back to your seat.

805
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:23,606
Then I'd like to ask the public a question.

806
00:54:23,607 --> 00:54:26,336
- Pardon? - All viewers of this trial,

807
00:54:26,337 --> 00:54:29,273
don't you find the defendant's face familiar?

808

Zoom in on Lee Young Min's face. Zoom all the way in.

809
00:54:34,078 --> 00:54:36,347
Your Honor, I don't understand where this is going.

810
00:54:36,348 --> 00:54:40,213
On your DIKE app, you can send a video to the court.

811

- I'm giving you a lot. - How's it going?

Okay. Go.

Oh, it's connected.

What is this? Is it really being broadcast all over the country?

Yes, it is. Please go ahead.

831
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:38,847
I'm a huge fan of yours. You're incredible.

832

00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,516
do you find the defendant's face familiar?

836
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,516
Of course. That crazy jerk...

837
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,523
Oh, I'm on the air, right?

838
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:52,827
He's a complete psycho.

839
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:55,492
I used to work part-time at a department store parking lot.

840
00:55:58,127 --> 00:55:59,293
Doing this.

841
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:00,766
I see. And?

842
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,467
One day, that jerk got out of his car and threw a tantrum,

843
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:06,907
complaining about the congestion. He even kicked an attendant.

844
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:08,237
I was so shocked and stared at him.

845
00:56:08,238 --> 00:56:11,003
Then he slapped me in the face.

846
00:56:13,048 --> 00:56:15,618
The department store told me to let it go,

847
00:56:15,618 --> 00:56:17,443
saying he was a VVIP customer.

848
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:20,353
I felt so upset and frustrated.

850
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:28,693
Will you be okay after saying this?

851
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:32,492
Yes. I got fired anyway.

852

Do something.

853
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:37,436
Objection, Your Honor. This hasn't been officially investigated.

854
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:41,637
Are you willing to make an official statement of what happened?

855
00:56:41,638 --> 00:56:44,907
Yes, of course. I'm so glad I can finally talk about this.

856
00:56:44,908 --> 00:56:47,443
Please punish him. I beg you.

857
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,186
He's a regular at our restaurant.

858
00:56:53,187 --> 00:56:55,257
He beats someone every time he comes.

859
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,586
Waiters, bartenders, parking attendants...

860
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:58,786
He beats anyone who he thinks is below him.

861
00:56:58,787 --> 00:56:59,927
It's just not okay.

862
00:56:59,928 --> 00:57:03,126
He once even beat a new female employee.

863
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:05,893
She cried, and I had to comfort her.

864
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,137
Do I have to work like this?

865
00:57:09,138 --> 00:57:10,666
Plus, if something bothers him,

866
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:13,532
he hits people here and there every time something bothers him.

867
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,237
He doesn't even give us money to get treatment,

868
00:57:15,238 --> 00:57:16,673
nor do we have insurance.

869
00:57:16,707 --> 00:57:18,003
I don't care if I get fired.

870
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:20,043
I'll tell you everything!

871
00:57:20,718 --> 00:57:22,673
There is so much more.

872
00:57:22,678 --> 00:57:24,512
- His car... - That punk...

873
00:57:24,747 --> 00:57:27,952
That man is quite old too.

874
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:29,853
He was old enough to be his father,

875
00:57:30,328 --> 00:57:32,152
but he kicked him in the leg.

876
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:35,492
All because his car had a small scratch.

877
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:46,632
Last month, he came into our store and demanded we change the video.

878
00:57:46,707 --> 00:57:48,333
I told him we couldn't do that,

879
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:50,907
and he pushed me out of nowhere and tried to step on me.

880
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:52,302
I was surprised and told him to stop...

881
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:55,373
when he began to break all the screens in our store.

882
00:57:55,377 --> 00:57:57,646
- He said how dare I stop him. - I was very...

883
00:57:57,647 --> 00:57:59,416
- I regretted it so much. - A few days ago,

884
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:01,887
- a yellow sports car hit me. - I own a business, and...

885
00:58:01,888 --> 00:58:03,888
He appeared out of nowhere and almost hit me!

886
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:05,956
I was crossing the street on a bicycle...

887
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:08,322
- He's the worst! - He's terrible!

888
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:14,992
Was this the reason why?

889
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:18,663
The reason why he sent it to be an open trial?

890
00:58:21,037 --> 00:58:23,173
What kind of game are you playing right now?

891
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:27,342
You little...

892
00:59:10,528 --> 00:59:12,152

How would you like a person like this to be punished?

895
00:59:19,997 --> 00:59:21,733
It's like playing a game.

896
00:59:21,937 --> 00:59:23,802

We got it! We did!

903
00:59:42,957 --> 00:59:44,552
Is this not enough for you?

904
00:59:44,758 --> 00:59:46,722
Isn't this plenty of evidence of recidivism?

905
00:59:47,258 --> 00:59:48,753
This Bench...

906
00:59:49,028 --> 00:59:51,063
would like to ask the prosecution to modify the indictment.

907
00:59:51,267 --> 00:59:53,637
This case isn't a simple assault.

908
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:54,932
It is habitual assault.

909
00:59:55,068 --> 00:59:56,467
In order to modify the indictment,

910
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,862
we will resume our trial.

00:59:59,368 --> 01:00:00,873
You should hurry.

913
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,202
If it takes too long, this anger could be pointed at the prosecution.

915
01:00:07,278 --> 01:00:09,773
- Mr. Kim Sung Hoon. - Yes, Your Honor.

916
01:00:09,778 --> 01:00:12,612
Habitual assault can be punishable even after a settlement.

917
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:15,313
Your case will also be but on trial.

918
01:00:15,488 --> 01:00:17,822
Thank you.

919
01:00:21,828 --> 01:00:24,693
I will not allow any case to be buried.

923
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:47,483
What is the reason you got involved...

924
01:00:47,557 --> 01:00:49,382
in that terribly unfair game?

925
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:50,583
The reason...

926
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:53,152
Do I need to have a reason?

927
01:00:54,127 --> 01:00:56,423
Is there something you want to make right?

928
01:00:57,127 --> 01:00:58,722
Or perhaps something you regret?

01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:08,222
Who is this person?

932
01:03:12,328 --> 01:03:13,833
Who is this?

933
01:03:19,968 --> 01:03:21,733
It's Master Isaac.

934
01:03:22,037 --> 01:03:24,643
- Isaac? - Master Yo Han's older brother,

935
01:03:24,807 --> 01:03:26,472
Master Isaac.

936
01:03:27,517 --> 01:03:30,483
The true heir to this mansion.

937
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:39,423
He's Kang Yo Han's older brother?

938
01:03:42,557 --> 01:03:45,963
Does this mean that this man lived in this basement?

939
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:47,762
- No. - Then?

940
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:48,893
This place...

941
01:03:51,868 --> 01:03:55,302
This place is Master Yo Han's bedroom.

942
01:03:55,307 --> 01:03:56,503
Pardon?

943
01:03:59,178 --> 01:04:02,713
Master Yo Han was an abandoned child.

944
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:06,643
He was a child nobody wanted.

945
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:11,652
Kang Yo Han was an abandoned child?

946
01:04:11,658 --> 01:04:13,222
Then he's not blood related to this family?

947
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:14,893
Please be more specific. Please?

948
01:04:14,957 --> 01:04:17,592
The person I suspect is Kang Yo Han.

949
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:21,432
I know that he's someone who can do whatever he sets his mind on.

950
01:04:21,497 --> 01:04:24,003
I heard he already did something incredible in elementary school.

951
01:04:24,138 --> 01:04:26,632
I knew it wasn't just simple curiosity.

952
01:04:27,778 --> 01:04:30,173
Then you should look into it yourself.

953
01:04:34,348 --> 01:04:36,512
This house belongs to Master Isaac.

954
01:04:37,388 --> 01:04:39,143
It doesn't belong to him.

955
01:04:40,917 --> 01:04:43,112
I'm sure the person named Isaac was missing something.

956
01:04:44,457 --> 01:04:45,623
What did you say?

957
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,226
There's no way...

958
01:04:47,227 --> 01:04:49,056
that a family like this would give their entire fortune...

959
01:04:49,057 --> 01:04:50,963
to someone who isn't blood related to them.

960
01:04:52,068 --> 01:04:55,693
Perhaps Kang Yo Han was more qualified.

961
01:04:55,997 --> 01:04:57,503
What do you know?

962
01:05:02,937 --> 01:05:04,202
I'm sorry.

963
01:05:12,017 --> 01:05:14,213
If it's hard for you to talk about it, you don't have to say anything.

964
01:05:16,218 --> 01:05:17,822
You resemble him a lot.

965
01:05:19,357 --> 01:05:20,652
Especially his eyes.

966
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:25,793
Master Isaac lost his mother at a young age.

967
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:31,733
All of this trouble started when Chairman Kang's friends took him...

968
01:05:31,968 --> 01:05:35,302
to a bar after he locked himself up in his home after losing his wife.

969
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:39,742
He was completely drunk and slept with a woman who worked at the bar.

970
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:41,713
She showed up pregnant...

971
01:05:41,718 --> 01:05:44,282
and demanded that she be given money.

972
01:05:45,318 --> 01:05:47,083
The woman who was rejected...

973
01:05:52,888 --> 01:05:54,293
Dad.

974
01:06:12,147 --> 01:06:13,503
Dad.

975
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:25,552
Yes.

01:08:50,097 --> 01:08:54,032
Sir. Why do you hate Master Yo Han so much?

979
01:08:59,778 --> 01:09:01,676
You can kick me out.

980
01:09:01,677 --> 01:09:03,913
What did the child do wrong?

981
01:09:07,288 --> 01:09:08,782
He's a lookalike.

982
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:10,683
He looks...

983
01:09:11,628 --> 01:09:13,022
too much like me.

984
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,862
But Isaac...

985
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:26,602
Isaac's different.

986
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:34,112
Yo Han will kill his brother one day.

987
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:36,642
Why do you...

988
01:09:36,717 --> 01:09:39,383
suspect Kang Yo Han too?

989
01:09:40,517 --> 01:09:41,657
What do you mean?

990
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:44,186
You said Master Isaac is the rightful heir.

991
01:09:44,187 --> 01:09:47,892
Doesn't that mean Kang Yo Han took his place unjustifiably?

992
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:52,067
Is there evidence that makes you suspect him?

993
01:09:52,068 --> 01:09:53,492
There's no such thing.

994
01:09:54,368 --> 01:09:56,037
If what you said is right,

995
01:09:56,038 --> 01:09:58,667
Kang Yo Han's just a victim of his father's abuse.

996
01:09:58,668 --> 01:10:01,373
He is also a child I raised with my own milk.

997
01:10:01,578 --> 01:10:04,207
But Master Yo Han was already capable...

998
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:06,702
of doing something dreadful.

999
01:10:07,147 --> 01:10:08,642
Like you said.

1000
01:10:09,078 --> 01:10:10,516
So why...

1001
01:10:10,517 --> 01:10:12,742
A servant girl had a crush on him,

1002
01:10:12,748 --> 01:10:14,856
and he made her jump from the second floor.

1003
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,318
He also fed weed killer...

1004
01:10:16,318 --> 01:10:19,123
to the Chairman's favorite hunting dog.

1005
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:45,146
We, at Social Responsibility Foundation,

1006
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:47,757
are constructing the Dream Home Village with 30,000 units for...

1007
01:10:47,757 --> 01:10:52,282
those who are weak and ill on the outskirts of Seoul.

1008
01:10:59,328 --> 01:11:01,392
Was there a reason for that?

1009
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:04,562
Something could've irked him,

1010
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,163
or he could've just been having fun.

1011
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:09,602
But...

1012
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:12,846
what child could go that far...

1013
01:11:12,847 --> 01:11:14,442
without hesitation?

1014
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:31,423
Who are you?

1015
01:11:32,168 --> 01:11:33,463
It's been a long time.

1016
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,202
Don't you remember me?

1017
01:11:43,038 --> 01:11:45,272
You... You're...

1018
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:47,742
You're...

1019
01:11:48,378 --> 01:11:49,572
the church...

1020
01:11:50,918 --> 01:11:52,083
fire...

1021
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:27,617
Still, you said his brother Isaac was good to him.

1022
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:30,053
And they got along. Did they not?

1023
01:12:31,158 --> 01:12:34,256
Master Yo Han's the survivor of a fire.

1024
01:12:34,257 --> 01:12:36,157
Don't come closer.

1025
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:37,692
Did you hear of that?

1026
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:39,492
Yes.

1027
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:42,763
It happened just one month after the Chairman died.

1028
01:12:43,967 --> 01:12:47,803
Master Isaac died in that fire.

1029
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:56,873
Go away!

1030
01:13:40,057 --> 01:13:41,753
You didn't sell this.

1031
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,593
Did you like it?

1032
01:13:47,897 --> 01:13:50,763
Please save me.

1033
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:55,102
Hey. Wait.

1034
01:13:55,437 --> 01:13:58,142
Yo Han? Kang Yo Han?

1035
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:04,612
(The Devil Judge)

1036
01:14:32,078 --> 01:14:34,303
Does it have to be Cha Kyung Hee?

1037
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:35,617
Why her?

What are you saying?

1040
01:14:40,088 --> 01:14:42,812
Tell me. What happened in this house?

1041
01:14:42,818 --> 01:14:45,452
How do you think Yo Han became the owner?

1042
01:14:46,187 --> 01:14:49,296
Do you know about the church fire that happened 10 years ago?

1043
01:14:49,297 --> 01:14:51,322
Kim Ga On, what did you find out?

1044
01:14:51,427 --> 01:14:52,667
What do you want from me?

1045
01:14:52,668 --> 01:14:54,123
Strength? Power.

1046
01:14:54,297 --> 01:14:55,796
How can you be so cruel?

1047
01:14:55,797 --> 01:14:56,797
It's fun.

1048
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,963
Is that why you killed your brother too?

1049
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:01,173
Say that again. Say that again!
