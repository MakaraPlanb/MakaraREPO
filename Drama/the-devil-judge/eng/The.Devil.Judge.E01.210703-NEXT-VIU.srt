While a plague never heard of before spreads throughout our country,

5
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:32,522
companies have fallen and people were made homeless.

6
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,423
The groundless instigation against the more fortunate...

7
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,923
led to arson and acts of terrorism.

8
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,022

9
00:01:41,767 --> 00:01:46,162

13

first, we must rectify law and order.

37

Hello. I am Kang Yo Han.

52
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:57,097
Judge Kang, there's concern the live court show is unconstitutional.

53
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,297
What do you think about that?

54
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,497
What about the criticisms...

55
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,367
that it's anti-humanitarian and just for show?

56
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,366
There's also concern that...

57
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,507
you punish too severely and are inconsiderate for the weak.

58
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:08,968
- Who is weak? - Pardon?

59
00:05:08,968 --> 00:05:11,632
Of the people I sentenced, who were socially disadvantaged?

60
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:14,508
There was a young offender.

61
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:17,778
Some were extremely poor and homeless, or mentally disabled.

62
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:19,948
The rapist of a classmate, a happy-slapper thief,

63
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,442
and the killer of a random victim.

64
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:23,388
Are they socially disadvantaged?

65
00:05:23,388 --> 00:05:25,388
Still, the disadvantaged deserve some...

66
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:26,723
They are defendants.

67
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:29,927
I do not care if someone is powerful or not.

68
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:33,293

00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:35,632
There's nothing to worry about. We'll just go by the law.

187
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:40,243
He'll hire the nation's best law firms.

188
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:41,777
I'm sure he will.

189
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,412
Are you aware that barely 10 percent of people show trust in the court?

190
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,312
I am.

191
00:14:49,658 --> 00:14:53,857
It's likely the legal decision will deviate from the people's emotions.

192
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,926
Why do you have to broadcast this difficult case...

193
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,123
Sir.

194
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,223
This isn't the people's court.

195
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,363
We just want to make trials transparent to the entire nation.

196
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:07,902
That's enough for me.

197
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,912
I'm leaving now.

198
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:23,416
Okay. See you tomorrow.

199
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:24,512
See you.

200
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:35,826
Let's cross the street. Hold up your right hands.

201
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:38,233
Follow me. Stay on this side.

202
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,012
Jerks!

203
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,743
(Stop)

204
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,142
What's going on?

205
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,552
- Get ready to shoot. - Emergency. Stand by.

206
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,997
Situation room, a bus 200m ahead is speeding toward the main gate.

207
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,262
The driver is unidentified. Tell us what to do. Over.

208
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,723
What's going on?

209
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,292
Guys, hurry up and cross!

210
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:18,933
Are you okay?

211
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,572
What's the point of having a gun if you don't shoot?

212
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:27,973
I'm sorry, sir.

213
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:37,112
- The driver's still in the bus! - What if the bus explodes?

214
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,213
There's a man in the bus!

215
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,542
Sir, are you okay?

216
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:46,012
- Are you okay? - Call an ambulance!

217
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:00,838
(Punish Chairman Joo Il Do for driving people to death...)

218
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,362
(by discharging toxic wastewater.)

219
00:19:02,368 --> 00:19:04,038
This morning, in front of the Supreme Court...

220
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:06,977
a kindergarten bus exploded.

221
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:09,878
An arrest warrant for the chairman of JU Chemical Joo Il Do...

222
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:11,848
was suspended and the kindergarten driver...

223
00:19:11,848 --> 00:19:13,788
- who was discontented with this... - What is all this?

224
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:14,788
drove the bus to the Supreme...

225
00:19:14,788 --> 00:19:17,383
He did it because they rejected to issue the warrant?

226
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:19,953
It's just a challenge to the authority.

227
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:23,226
With all due respect, I don't think it was a challenge.

228
00:19:23,227 --> 00:19:24,653
It was more like an outcry.

229
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,522
What do you mean?

230
00:19:26,927 --> 00:19:29,128
When you put a rat in a small space and make it starve,

231
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,433
it acts desperately and bangs its head against the wall.

232
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:34,703
Do you think people would be any different?

233
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:40,802
Sir, we need to make ends meet.

234
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,747
So the foundation should help us.

235
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,717
We managed to control the epidemic.

236
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,186
But so many are out of work that we can't collect taxes.

237
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,848
If the drought lasts for too long, a revolt breaks out.

238
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:50,888
You're right.

239
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,957
- Chairman Park. - Yes.

240
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,052
How's the preparation for the live court show going?

241
00:19:55,257 --> 00:19:57,953
You don't have to worry about it. I'm sure it's going to be a big hit.

242
00:19:58,027 --> 00:19:59,852
You have to work hard on it.

243
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,237
Our Minister of Justice is especially interested in the case.

244
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,592
I mean personally.

245
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:41,344
Korea has become a safe country.

246
00:20:41,378 --> 00:20:43,074
Social responsibility...

247
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:48,814
(Social welfare for the poor)

248
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:51,453
(Lucky Loan Assure confidentiality)

249
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:34,974
Are you trying to build a jungle in there?

250
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:36,714
Hey.

251
00:21:36,718 --> 00:21:38,914
I heard there was a terror attack in front of the Supreme Court.

252
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:41,843
You heard that already?

253
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:44,684
I guess it's because you're Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun of RIT.

254
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,684
You didn't get hurt, did you?

255
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,389
Did you jump in with both feet again?

256
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:50,829
Again? Don't worry.

257
00:21:50,829 --> 00:21:52,853
I was so scared that I hid far behind the scene.

258
00:21:52,928 --> 00:21:54,293
Like a real man.

259
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,593
Good. You finally became mature.

260
00:21:57,698 --> 00:21:58,829
Let's go up.

261
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,369
You go ahead. I'll be there after I finish this.

262
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:03,968
Just finish it up and follow me.

263
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:05,738
Okay. But why do you sound angry?

264
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:07,273
Come on. Right now.

265
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,573
Cheers.

266
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,113
Aren't you going to buy me dinner?

267
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,984
- Why should I? - Because you're going to be on TV.

268
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,184
I won't be able to see you if you become a star like Kang Yo Han.

269
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:23,654
I can't wait.

270
00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:25,283
What's with the sarcasm?

271
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,093
Cheers.

272
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:28,793
Drink up.

273
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:33,023
It won't hurt to be around a star like him.

274
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,194
And he has plenty of touching stories.

275
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,533
The heir to a great fortune.

276
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:39,103
A survivor of a tragic accident.

277
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:41,434
People just love those kinds of stories.

278
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:44,773
You're right.

279
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,043
His stories are totally different from mine.

280
00:22:47,418 --> 00:22:48,573
What's wrong with yours?

281
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:54,258
Now that you became a judge after all those years,

282
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:55,684
you should move to a nicer neighborhood.

283
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,089
What's wrong with my neighborhood?

284
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:59,624
Well, things are not what they used to be.

285
00:22:59,988 --> 00:23:02,353
- But it's the only place. - What do you mean?

286
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:05,263
It's the only place that reminds me of my parents.

287
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:12,608
Have dinner with me. I'll cook.

288
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,609
- Dinner? - You've lost weight.

289
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:15,833
You haven't been eating well, have you?

290
00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:18,474
Hey.

291
00:23:19,349 --> 00:23:21,714
If you keep on doing that, I'll ask you out again.

292
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:28,218
You've rejected me five times since kindergarten.

293
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,329
But it never ends until it really ends.

294
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:31,529
I don't want to lose my best friend.

295
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,589
Have dinner with me.

296
00:23:32,589 --> 00:23:34,124
- You finished your beer, right? - Yes.

297
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:36,523
You heartless jerk.

298
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:38,823
I love you.

299
00:23:56,418 --> 00:23:58,788
The point is that we should emphasize that the chairman...

300
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:00,884
didn't know wastewater was being discharged.

301
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:02,384
So the accident was beyond his control.

302
00:24:02,589 --> 00:24:05,853
If we can't obtain public opinion during the trial,

303
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,329
what do you think we should do?

304
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:11,063
We should emphasize the purification facilities have improved.

305
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,668
So let them know everything was beyond his control.

306
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:16,164
- Sir. - Come in.

307
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:20,503
Don't you think public opinion is going against us?

308
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,103
Ungrateful people.

309
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,513
Tens of thousands of people are living off me.

310
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,049
It's hard to get clear evidence...

311
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:31,184
for cases related to environmental issues.

312
00:24:31,188 --> 00:24:34,714
How can a company owner know what's in its industrial waste?

313
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:36,257
We're going to plead not guilty.

314
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:37,954
And even if things don't go well,

315
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:40,124
we'll be charged with professional negligence resulting in death.

316
00:24:40,158 --> 00:24:42,394
Professional negligence resulting in death.

317
00:24:44,869 --> 00:24:46,323
How many years will that give?

318
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:49,293
The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment.

319
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:50,369
Five years?

320
00:24:50,369 --> 00:24:52,967
Well, a few special laws have been legislated.

321
00:24:52,968 --> 00:24:55,308
But the court of law is very conservative.

322
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:58,103
So they won't toughen up prison sentences.

323
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,113
Don't you know I can only sleep well...

324
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,073
on a nice bed?

325
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,313
My goodness, Mr. Chairman.

326
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:08,583
Just read some books and work on your meditation for a year.

327
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,984
Then you'll be released on parole.

328
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:13,583
You'll be healthier than before when you're out.

329
00:25:14,758 --> 00:25:16,224
Can I trust you?

330
00:25:17,069 --> 00:25:18,694
If you can't trust me,

331
00:25:20,768 --> 00:25:22,494
you know who to ask for help.

332
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,533
Of course, I do.

333
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:35,374
Sir.

334
00:25:37,988 --> 00:25:40,583
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

335
00:25:40,758 --> 00:25:41,888
Don't mention it.

336
00:25:41,889 --> 00:25:43,414
You didn't even hesitate to shoot.

337
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:49,424
I didn't?

338
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:52,197
Were you going to kill that man?

339
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:54,134
- If I had to. - If you had to?

340
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:57,464
But the bus would've gone straight even if I had killed that man.

341
00:25:57,468 --> 00:26:00,533
So you wanted him to get scared and steer the wheel.

342
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,773
Even if he smashes his bus and dies.

343
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:04,144
Yes, that's math.

344
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,343
2 is bigger than 1.

345
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:09,674
I guess so.

346
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:11,613
So you met Kang Yo Han.

347
00:26:12,518 --> 00:26:13,884
What's he like?

348
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:18,384
- I don't know. - Well, I'm alive thanks to you.

349
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,684
You're welcome.

350
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:22,624
I guess I shouldn't be the smaller number in front of you.

351
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:25,093
Whatever.

352
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,238
Why do you think he chose Chairman Joo Il Do...

353
00:26:29,238 --> 00:26:32,234
as his first defendant on his first mock trial?

354
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,573
Isn't it because it's the hottest case right now?

355
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:39,543
Yes, that's true.

356
00:26:40,248 --> 00:26:44,313
But he is the biggest donator of Social Responsibility Foundation.

357
00:26:44,988 --> 00:26:47,184
And Kang Yo Han's judiciary reform...

358
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,218
was possible because the Minister of Justice...

359
00:26:49,218 --> 00:26:52,283
and the foundation supported the idea.

360
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:58,298
So he was in an awkward position to take the case...

361
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,823
but he insisted on taking it.

362
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:04,333
That's why I think he has an ulterior motive behind all this.

363
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,944
Chief Kang, about the bus driver from yesterday's incident.

364
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,944
Indict him without detention for now.

365
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,874
Then put him on trial later. How does that sound?

366
00:27:17,889 --> 00:27:19,843
Why do you think that's a good idea?

367
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:21,859
The first live court show is right around the corner.

368
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,823
So we can't afford a scandal that'll draw public attention.

369
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:27,498
Besides, you pulled a stunt yesterday.

370
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:29,523
Giving a nice first impression is important, isn't it?

371
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:35,194
Are you saying I should be nice to a terrorist?

372
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:41,573
No, but you should consider what people would think.

373
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,734
I don't think I looked so bad.

374
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:46,279
It'll only draw more attention.

375
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,043
Haven't you heard of noise marketing?

376
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:51,813
It's only fair to have him incarcerated for a case like this.

377
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:54,583
Excuse me.

378
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:56,884
May I say something?

379
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:00,129
The three-year-old daughter of the bus driver...

380
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,358
is one of the deceased in the JU Chemical Case,

381
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:07,298
and her grandmother committed suicide over that case.

382
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,464
So what?

383
00:28:10,069 --> 00:28:12,737
Despite that, you rejected the warrant for Chairman Joo Il Do,

384
00:28:12,738 --> 00:28:14,803
yet you want to incarcerate the bus driver.

385
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,207
I'm worried that it isn't fair.

386
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:18,343
Judge Kim.

387
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:21,447
If we have a trial for Joo Il Do, he would just be a defendant.

388
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,214
Meanwhile, the bus driver was caught on the scene.

389
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:25,217
Do you not know this?

390
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:27,717
However, we must take into consideration his motive...

391
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:29,888
If you're a victim, do you have the right to hurt others?

392
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:32,227
No, but he's injured right now...

393
00:28:32,228 --> 00:28:34,194
They have doctors at the detention center too.

394
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:39,194
Let's follow the rules.

395
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:50,648
Yu, the child that was receiving treatment due to...

396
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:53,778
the toxic wastewater leakage incident at JU Chemical, has died,

397
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:55,977
and her grandmother, Kim,

398
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:58,917
has tragically chosen to end her life.

399
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:01,687
As a result, there have been 11 deaths due to this incident.

400
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:04,023
The number of victims including those who are receiving treatment...

401
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,487
is a total of 47 people.

402
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:09,227
This particular case is currently being investigated,

403
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:11,624
and Chairman Joo Il Do will be facing trial...

404
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,763
I'm sorry. It's hard for me to watch.

405
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:18,068
It reminds me of where I grew up.

406
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:21,278
I'm from the countryside, although you can't tell from my looks.

407
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,944
I'm from Seoul, as you can see.

408
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:25,744
From a shanty town.

409
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,113
- Is it obvious? - Yes.

410
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,388
I guess those who grew up poor can recognize others who did too.

411
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:34,684
It's like a type of radar.

412
00:29:35,688 --> 00:29:37,654
Then what do you see when you look at Chief Kang?

413
00:29:38,589 --> 00:29:39,984
Our Chief Kang?

414
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,128
I'm not sure.

415
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:44,828
(You can do it, Oh Jin Joo. Let's go!)

416
00:29:44,829 --> 00:29:46,624
(Associate Judge, Oh Jin Joo)

417
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:48,263
I don't see anything.

418
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:51,638
That's the basics of work life.

419
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,934
Useless curiosity about your bosses is forbidden.

420
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:57,474
- Let's get back to work. - Okay.

421
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:01,578
There's a trial statute, so read it.

422
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,747
A trial statute?

423
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:05,048
Yes, the trial statute from our mock trial.

424
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:08,283
You might get a bit annoyed from it.

425
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,704
Sir, you seem to really enjoy playing with numbers.

426
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:28,638
You want to come up with a verdict based on how viewers vote on an app?

427
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:30,437
Do you think that's playing with numbers?

428
00:30:30,438 --> 00:30:32,444
I call it democracy.

429
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:35,648
If you want to hold a democratic trial, why do you need us?

430
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:36,947
I guess you read the trial statute.

431
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,244
Is that really a trial?

432
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:43,788
If you're going to neglect the opinions of the associate judges...

433
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,288
and make your final decision based on the number of votes,

434
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:48,023
then why do you actually need us?

435
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,528
In a state of emergency, we need emergency methods.

436
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:52,624
Also, it won't look good.

437
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,664
It won't look good?

438
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:57,467
It would look empty if there weren't people sitting at each side of me.

439
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,704
It's a TV show after all.

440
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,454
It's me. There's something you need to do for me.

441
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:16,917
Okay. What is it?

442
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,823
The spare key to the Supreme Court Record Storage Room.

443
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:21,858
Hey, do you think that's easy?

444
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:25,164
If you can't even do that, I suggest you quit being the chief justice.

445
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:26,894
Hello?

446
00:31:27,438 --> 00:31:29,964
You're the one who brought me in here.

447
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:31,833
If the case records get damaged,

448
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,303
you'll be incarcerated.

449
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,103
I won't rat out my accomplice, sir.

450
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:04,904
I found it.

451
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:06,664
The tagger.

452
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:17,414
You're so tenacious. Did you look for the records from 20 years ago?

453
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:21,384
It's like how your first love is the dearest to you.

454
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:23,914
First love?

455
00:32:25,829 --> 00:32:28,757
When Chairman Joo caused trouble when he first expanded his business,

456
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:30,928
the person who helped him was the elite prosecutor from Seoul,

457
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:32,063
Cha Kyung Hee.

458
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:34,697
She helped him three times whenever things became quiet,

459
00:32:34,698 --> 00:32:35,994
so you couldn't tell.

460
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:38,103
Of course, it probably wasn't free.

461
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:42,208
When Cha Kyung Hee first ran to become an assemblywoman,

462
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,003
who was the head of her campaign club?

463
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:46,974
Joo Il Do?

464
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,088
So to clarify things,

465
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:54,987
Joo Il Do was Cha Kyung Hee's sponsor when she was a prosecutor.

466
00:32:54,988 --> 00:32:56,487
Cha Kyung Hee is an influential person in this administration,

467
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:58,687
and she has been supporting Kang Yo Han.

468
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,023
But Kang Yo Han...

469
00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,394
has declared that he will put Joo Il Do on trial?

470
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:09,834
And Cha Kyung Hee is not objecting and just watching it?

471
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:12,903
Do you think this is a trial to reveal his crimes...

472
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:15,774
or the opposite?

473
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,803
The problem is that all of this is just speculation.

474
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,584
We should try to do something no matter what.

475
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,414
I feel like I'm standing in the way of my own future,

476
00:33:30,989 --> 00:33:32,684
but I think it's too late to turn back.

477
00:33:43,469 --> 00:33:45,863
A first love that's dear to you.

478
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:49,834
Is Jae Hee doing well?

479
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:56,974
Hey, Ga On.

480
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:58,613
It's fine. Talk to me.

481
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:02,883
A listening device? Why do you need that?

482
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,557
Somebody help me!

483
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:08,198
Be quiet!

484
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,954
Ga On, I'll call you back later.

485
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:11,597
Somebody save me!

486
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:12,763
Stop!

487
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:16,963
I'm a police officer. Step back.

488
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,937
Please save me.

489
00:34:18,938 --> 00:34:20,307
She's my little sister.

490
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,533
Go up against the wall.

491
00:34:23,638 --> 00:34:25,774
I told you she was my sister.

492
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,144
- Are you okay? - Yes.

493
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:39,584
Back off, lady.

494
00:34:58,848 --> 00:35:00,004
Let go.

495
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:13,628
It's okay.

496
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,894
You're okay now.

497
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,633
(A safe Korea will be realized from now on.)

498
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,589
Ma'am, Director Jung Sun Ah...

499
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:42,254
from the Social Responsibility Foundation is here.

500
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,158
Tell her to come in.

501
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,524
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,898
Hello, ma'am.

503
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:57,437
I'm here to run an errand for Mr. Seo.

504
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:58,963
What brings you here?

505
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:04,903
I'm sorry, but may I have a seat?

506
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,613
Thank you.

507
00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:24,827
Mr. Seo, as well as the sponsors of our foundation,

508
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:27,834
are all very worried about this upcoming trial.

509
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:29,763
What are they worried about?

510
00:36:30,799 --> 00:36:35,004
I'm sorry, but let me be frank with you.

511
00:36:35,009 --> 00:36:38,108
The reason why we are holding this mock trial...

512
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:41,513
is to catch petty criminals so that citizens can release their anger.

513
00:36:42,149 --> 00:36:43,247
So?

514
00:36:43,248 --> 00:36:46,318
So we're wondering if it's necessary to put a business person on trial.

515
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:47,918
If he receives a serious punishment,

516
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:50,613
it will become a negative precedent for other business people.

517
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:53,724
This is what they're worried about.

518
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,898
Have you ever seen Kang Yo Han make a mistake?

519
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:58,468
That's true,

520
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,938
but we thought it might be better if you went with an easier case...

521
00:37:00,938 --> 00:37:02,434
for the first trial.

522
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:07,604
Why are you so adamant about this case?

523
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,274
Are you saying I'm being adamant?

524
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:14,173
I'm sorry. I'm just relaying what they have said.

525
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:22,213
Why are people who are in the business of social welfare...

526
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:25,158
No, to be more exact, why is an alliance of the wealthy...

527
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,354
so interested in how the country is being run?

528
00:37:28,629 --> 00:37:31,193
I'm pretty sure I said that I would take care of it.

529
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:32,863
How arrogant.

530
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:46,343
I'm sorry, Minister Cha. I have overstepped.

531
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,994
May I dare say...

532
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:05,794
one more thing that is overstepping my boundaries?

533
00:38:07,899 --> 00:38:11,133
The chair and desk where you sit behind.

534
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:14,573
The painting on the wall and the car you take to and from work.

535
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:18,774
Are you aware all of that was paid for by our foundation?

536
00:38:18,848 --> 00:38:21,144
Because your ministry's budget came short this year.

537
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:22,748
There aren't enough prisons,

538
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:25,613
so we might have to build a private one ourselves.

539
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,754
I wonder, Ma'am.

540
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,323
Who is it...

541
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:36,394
that's serving the country?

542
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,573
What is it?

543
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,744
Why does a judge need a listening device?

544
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:57,474
Do you have a cheating girlfriend?

545
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:00,219
If that's easier to understand, let's go with that.

546
00:39:00,219 --> 00:39:02,058
I understand, but I can't forgive.

547
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:04,053
Even if you can't, let's just go with that.

548
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:07,354
Quit joking around. What is it for?

549
00:39:11,899 --> 00:39:14,193
You'll get hurt if you pry too much.

550
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:17,733
It's not the first time you've been so stubborn.

551
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:20,064
Let's test it. Go on the roof.

552
00:39:20,069 --> 00:39:21,303
- The roof? - Yes.

553
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:24,374
You need to wear this.

554
00:39:34,149 --> 00:39:35,417
What are you staring at?

555
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,414
You can't do anything on your own. Go outside.

556
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:41,153
A martial arts expert shouldn't assault civilians.

557
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:51,303
Do you hear me, Judge Kim?

558
00:39:52,069 --> 00:39:53,434
Will you marry me?

559
00:39:53,509 --> 00:39:55,104
No, I was kidding.

560
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:56,303
I love you.

561
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,314
She has a nice voice.

562
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:05,544
Did you hear that?

563
00:40:06,348 --> 00:40:08,254
- Clearly. - And your answer is?

564
00:40:09,118 --> 00:40:11,454
You're not supposed to show that you heard.

565
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,584
So you won't answer?

566
00:40:13,629 --> 00:40:15,894
Fine. Catch your cheating girlfriend.

567
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:19,327
Hey, I just got called in.

568
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:20,798
- I'll call you. - Again?

569
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:22,598
Yes. See you.

570
00:40:22,598 --> 00:40:24,494
Okay. Take care.

571
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,733
Yes, I'm on my way.

572
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:40,213
Will you marry me?

573
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:41,814
No, I was kidding.

574
00:40:41,888 --> 00:40:43,084
I love you.

575
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:47,954
Will you marry me?

576
00:40:47,998 --> 00:40:49,494
No, I was kidding.

577
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:50,854
I love you.

581

Judge Kim?

582
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:52,145
You're in early.

583
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,540
We have an upcoming trial.

584
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:57,250
What's the occasion?

585
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:00,920
The library is closed.

586
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,621
With the lights off?

587
00:44:03,925 --> 00:44:06,661
I can see pretty well in the dark.

588
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,261
Goodbye, then.

589
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:19,170
What's wrong?

590
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:25,310
- You live alone, right? - Yes.

591
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,650
It's tough, isn't it?

592
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,351
Your shirt's all crumpled up.

593
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:34,451
I have no time to iron it.

594
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:37,420
I see.

595
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:39,920
Get back to work.

596
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:48,971
He's a funny kid.

(Associate Judge Kim Ga On)

599
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:09,920
Yes, Minister.

600
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:14,020
Judge Kang, about the live court show.

601
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,630
I trust in you wholeheartedly.

602
00:45:18,535 --> 00:45:19,761
Don't worry.

603
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:21,701
It'll go the way of the law.

604
00:45:22,506 --> 00:45:24,431
The public won't be that foolish.

605
00:45:26,876 --> 00:45:28,000
It's me.

606
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,540
Is everything ready?

607
00:45:29,976 --> 00:45:31,471
Did you meet the doctor?

608
00:45:32,215 --> 00:45:33,610
And what did he say?

609
00:45:34,215 --> 00:45:36,511
Good. Well done.

610
00:45:37,555 --> 00:45:39,451
I'll meet the lawyer when he's out.

611
00:46:28,436 --> 00:46:30,331
That's Joo Il Do's lawyer.

612
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:40,181
What name is the reservation under?

613
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:41,581
Kang Yo Han.

614
00:47:05,276 --> 00:47:08,574
The presiding judge met with the counsel before the trial...

615
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:12,081
and talked to the Minister, who is suspected to protect the defendant?

616
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:15,011
And who's Mr. Park?

617
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:18,210
It is suspicious.

618
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:22,750
But you do know this doesn't prove anything, don't you?

619
00:47:22,856 --> 00:47:26,025
He could pretend he discussed the procedure with the counsel,

620
00:47:26,026 --> 00:47:27,590
and all he said to the Minister is...

621
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:30,960
that he'd go by the law.

622
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:36,670
The trial's tomorrow.

623
00:47:37,675 --> 00:47:38,840
We'll just have to...

624
00:47:41,146 --> 00:47:43,011
watch him closely at the court.

625
00:47:43,976 --> 00:47:48,685
To attract advanced facilities such as charging stations,

626
00:47:48,686 --> 00:47:50,985
the building classification system needs to be improved,

627
00:47:50,986 --> 00:47:53,424
and the floor plans should be made available to the public.

628
00:47:53,425 --> 00:47:56,324
We should also establish a construction hub...

629
00:47:56,325 --> 00:47:58,694
and develop and BIM roadmaps...

630
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:01,560
to make use of construction information...

631
00:48:03,035 --> 00:48:05,301
Please continue.

632
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:08,101
There's something I must watch.

633
00:48:11,405 --> 00:48:16,040
(The live court show begins shortly.)

634
00:48:17,376 --> 00:48:21,641
Let's see what Judge Kang Yo Han's got.

635
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:51,810
Father, forgive them,

636
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:55,610
for they do not know what they are doing.

637
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:20,301
30 seconds to go.

638
00:49:21,006 --> 00:49:23,011
- Prepare the insert. - Yes, sir.

639
00:49:23,175 --> 00:49:24,770
Sound check.

640
00:49:25,785 --> 00:49:29,951
I'm excited that the public gets to participate in the trial.

641
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:33,554
It'll help achieve public consensus.

642
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:36,895
Whoever commits a crime should be punished.

643
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:39,065
Regardless of the defendant's social status,

644
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,395
the public gets to decide by vote.

645
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:43,935
It feels like the court is finally working properly.

646
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:45,900
It's going to be so fun.

647
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:48,875
The first live court show will air today.

648
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:50,775
With the court having lost public trust,

649
00:49:50,776 --> 00:49:54,344
will the live trial be able to change this reality?

650
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:57,275
Hoping for equality before the law,

651
00:49:57,276 --> 00:49:59,545
the entire nation is waiting for the first live trial.

652
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:01,784
We'll have to wait and see whether Judge Kang Yo Han...

653
00:50:01,785 --> 00:50:04,380
and the other judges will live up to expectations.

654
00:50:23,936 --> 00:50:26,304
Hello, everyone.

655
00:50:26,305 --> 00:50:30,174
This is a historical moment. Coming to you live from the court.

656
00:50:30,175 --> 00:50:32,416
For the first time in history, the entire nation...

657
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,985
will get to participate in the trial.

658
00:50:35,986 --> 00:50:37,851
The process is simple.

659
00:50:39,086 --> 00:50:40,284
As you see here,

660
00:50:40,285 --> 00:50:43,494
install the app, DIKE, the deity of justice.

661
00:50:43,495 --> 00:50:47,025
If you tap the statue, you'll be able to watch...

662
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:49,194
- the ongoing trial live. - Mom!

663
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:51,935
- Hey, come here. - Below, you'll see...

664
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:55,534
two buttons.

665
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:56,904
(What's your choice?)

666
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:59,145
While watching the trial,

667
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:02,670
if you think the defendant should be severely punished,

668
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:04,944
tap the red button.

669
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:09,081
Otherwise, tap the other button.

670
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,355
Your votes will be collected, visualized in graphs,

671
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:15,281
and sent to the court.

672
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:19,065
The judges will be able to see...

673
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:22,864
the people's opinions in real time and make decisions accordingly.

674
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:26,661
Let me introduce today's presiding judge,

675
00:51:27,035 --> 00:51:29,730
Judge Kang Yo Han!

676

677

Welcome to a court owned by you.

678
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,065
There will be no more trials...

679
00:51:54,066 --> 00:51:57,130
that go against common sense.

680
00:51:57,796 --> 00:52:00,165
The entire trial process will be made transparent,

681
00:52:00,166 --> 00:52:02,471
and we will listen to the public.

682
00:52:02,535 --> 00:52:06,101
We will take the people's opinions into account as well as the law.

683
00:52:06,805 --> 00:52:08,304
This court belongs to...

684
00:52:08,305 --> 00:52:10,641
you, the people.

685
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:18,650

686
00:52:24,796 --> 00:52:26,360

(Live Court Show)

688
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:38,074
First, let's hear about the case we'll be handling today.

689
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,944
Prosecution, please go ahead.

690
00:52:39,945 --> 00:52:41,471
(Prosecution)

691
00:52:54,126 --> 00:52:55,721
(Defendant)

692
00:52:57,756 --> 00:53:00,661
There's a town abandoned by young people.

693
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:05,735
Population, 47.

694
00:53:05,736 --> 00:53:07,904
Average age of residents, 72.

695
00:53:07,905 --> 00:53:10,375
Eleven of them have passed away.

696
00:53:10,376 --> 00:53:13,105
Twenty-three of them are still in the ICU.

697
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,915
Thirteen have been discharged, but they're suffering serious...

698
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:19,511
long-term effects including severe respiratory and nerve disorders.

699
00:53:20,445 --> 00:53:23,455
One of the dead victims is only three years old.

700
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:25,951
Another victim is her grandmother.

701
00:53:26,026 --> 00:53:27,486
After losing her beloved granddaughter...

702
00:53:27,486 --> 00:53:29,095
who she looked after while her daughter was working in Seoul,

703
00:53:29,095 --> 00:53:30,951
she took her own life.

704
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:35,690
Her granddaughter was the only child in this town.

705
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:40,235
The person responsible for this tragedy is sitting right there.

706
00:53:40,236 --> 00:53:43,335
He is the owner of JU Chemical Factory Four,

707
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:45,875
which is only 5km away from this town.

708
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:48,944
The factory discharged toxic chemicals into rivers...

709
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:52,045
without treatment.

710
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:54,315
The residents used the water...

711
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:56,511
for drinking, washing, and farming.

712
00:53:58,385 --> 00:53:59,621
Everyone.

713
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:03,520
This is murder.

714
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:08,494
Already? Hey, put it up.

715
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,661
Okay.

00:54:25,175 --> 00:54:28,214
We've now heard the prosecution's defense.

720
00:54:28,215 --> 00:54:32,284
To be more precise, it was incitement rather than defense.

721
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:33,784
Watch your language.

722
00:54:33,785 --> 00:54:38,790
What we just witnessed is the danger of a media trial.

723
00:54:38,865 --> 00:54:42,464
A trial isn't a movie, much less a show.

724
00:54:42,465 --> 00:54:46,764
A trial should only be based on objective evidence.

725
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:49,804
The prosecution just accused the defendant of murder.

726
00:54:49,805 --> 00:54:53,545
What kind of businessman would murder residents on purpose?

727
00:54:53,546 --> 00:54:55,645
Knowing it might kill people,

728
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:58,014
he discharged toxic wastewater into rivers.

729
00:54:58,015 --> 00:55:00,210
That's negligent homicide.

730
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:03,781
Well, please have a look at this.

731
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:09,395
The embankment on a hill l behind the factory collapsed,

732
00:55:09,396 --> 00:55:11,725
damaging the wastewater treatment facilities.

733
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:14,264
Mr. Prosecutor, as far as I know,

734
00:55:14,265 --> 00:55:17,494
embankment maintenance is the government's responsibility.

735
00:55:17,495 --> 00:55:19,705
Correct me if I'm wrong.

736
00:55:19,706 --> 00:55:22,375
It's true that the collapse caused a minor chemical discharge.

737
00:55:22,376 --> 00:55:23,635
However,

738
00:55:23,635 --> 00:55:26,545
the factory was closed down and repaired immediately.

739
00:55:26,546 --> 00:55:29,415
The discharge didn't last longer than an hour.

740
00:55:29,416 --> 00:55:30,610
Your Honor.

741
00:55:31,416 --> 00:55:34,540
What more could my client have done?

742
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,154
This was beyond control.

743
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:39,781
What if chemicals were leaking from the old facilities before too?

744
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:41,625
Do you have evidence?

745
00:55:41,626 --> 00:55:43,951
Using the emergency repair as an excuse,

746
00:55:43,956 --> 00:55:46,025
you replaced and discarded all the faulty parts.

747
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:47,824
And now you ask me for evidence?

748
00:55:47,825 --> 00:55:50,960
So you have no evidence. All right.

749
00:55:50,965 --> 00:55:54,005
The only chemical discharge that's been proven so far...

750
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:57,134
was inevitable and lasted only for a short moment.

751
00:55:57,135 --> 00:56:00,344
There's no evidence that this happened before too.

752
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:03,514
According to an authority's estimate, an hour's discharge...

753
00:56:03,515 --> 00:56:06,540
- couldn't have caused... - Did you say, an "estimate"?

754
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:08,940
Did I hear it wrong?

755
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,284
Is an estimate objective evidence?

756
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,750
He's right.

757
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:15,020
(Defendant)

758
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:17,395
When you don't even have any evidence,

759
00:56:17,396 --> 00:56:20,424
how could you accuse a patriotic businessman of murder?

760
00:56:20,425 --> 00:56:21,865
In this economic crisis,

761
00:56:21,865 --> 00:56:24,735
do you know how many people's lives rely on my company?

762
00:56:24,736 --> 00:56:28,435
JU Chemical employs 17,400 people.

763
00:56:28,436 --> 00:56:31,674
With their families and our subcontractors taken into account,

764
00:56:31,675 --> 00:56:34,045
over 100,000 people's lives depend on my company.

765
00:56:34,046 --> 00:56:37,645
- This media trial... - Please watch your language!

766
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:40,415
I have a right to speak.

767
00:56:40,416 --> 00:56:42,110
Defendant!

768
00:56:44,515 --> 00:56:46,520
(Innocent, Guilty)

769
00:56:49,495 --> 00:56:51,221
Why isn't he saying anything? What is he doing?

770
00:56:51,425 --> 00:56:52,796
This is a broadcasting accident.

771
00:56:52,796 --> 00:56:54,520
Hey. Prepare the commercial.

772
00:56:59,206 --> 00:57:00,960
Counsel, please return to your seat.

773
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:02,161
Yes, Your Honor.

774
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:03,871
Hold on.

775
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:06,371
(Innocent, Guilty)

776
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,310
(Counsel, Defendant)

777
00:57:22,796 --> 00:57:25,150
- Defendant? - Yes.

778
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:26,860
Please have a seat.

779
00:57:27,566 --> 00:57:28,761
Okay.

780
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:31,991
(Counsel, Defendant)

781
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:58,090
Counsel, have you made all your statements?

782
00:57:58,095 --> 00:57:59,621
Yes, that is all.

783
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:02,666
Then we will take a break before we continue.

784
00:58:02,666 --> 00:58:04,130
You should go use the restroom.

785
00:58:26,186 --> 00:58:28,980
Your Honor, may I ask a question?

786
00:58:30,595 --> 00:58:31,750
Go ahead.

787
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:35,626
The embankment collapse you mentioned...

788
00:58:35,626 --> 00:58:36,896
happened at the beginning of this case...

789
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:40,801
on the evening of the day after the first person had passed away.

790
00:58:40,965 --> 00:58:42,161
Is this true?

791
00:58:42,336 --> 00:58:43,701
Yes, it is.

792
00:58:43,976 --> 00:58:46,146
It seems like quite the coincidence.

793
00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:48,206
How could such an accident occur...

794
00:58:48,206 --> 00:58:50,670
as soon as someone passed away...

795
00:58:50,845 --> 00:58:52,885
and get rid of all evidence?

796
00:58:52,885 --> 00:58:54,345
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

797
00:58:54,345 --> 00:58:56,986
but the cause of death for the first person to pass away is uncertain,

798
00:58:56,986 --> 00:59:00,321
so we believe it is unrelated to this case.

799
00:59:01,055 --> 00:59:02,495
Even though according to the medical report,

800
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:04,425
they suffered from vertigo, migraines,

801
00:59:04,425 --> 00:59:06,226
convulsions, and loss of consciousness...

802
00:59:06,226 --> 00:59:09,535
just like the other victims in this case?

803
00:59:09,535 --> 00:59:10,761
It is nothing more than an assumption.

804
00:59:10,796 --> 00:59:12,936
The deceased didn't even get an autopsy.

805
00:59:12,936 --> 00:59:16,670
There is no evidence that they found traces of toxic chemicals.

806
00:59:17,206 --> 00:59:18,431
Your Honor.

807
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:19,904
Please speak.

808
00:59:19,905 --> 00:59:21,905
In order to hear an objective opinion,

809
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,015
I would like to call Dr. Yu Jong Baek,

810
00:59:24,015 --> 00:59:26,440
the leading expert in heavy metal poisoning to the stand.

811
00:59:26,715 --> 00:59:27,940
Okay.

812
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:29,480
Did you get everything ready?

813
00:59:29,515 --> 00:59:31,011
Have you met the doctor?

814
00:59:43,695 --> 00:59:45,764
Thank you so much for coming here...

815
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:48,006
despite your busy schedule.

816
00:59:48,006 --> 00:59:49,161
Not at all.

817
00:59:49,206 --> 00:59:51,836
The sample of stream water submitted for evidence...

818
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:52,971
There it is.

819
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:54,940
Have you analyzed it?

820
00:59:54,945 --> 00:59:57,371
I would like to hear the opinion of an expert.

821
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:01,186
Among the victims, there are many who exhibit symptoms...

822
01:00:01,186 --> 01:00:02,884
of heavy metal poisoning.

823
01:00:02,885 --> 01:00:05,285
However, whether or not the wastewater was the cause...

824
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:06,750
is rather uncertain.

825
01:00:06,856 --> 01:00:09,994
Many people believe that exposure to heavy metals...

826
01:00:09,995 --> 01:00:13,364
come from special environments like factories.

827
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:14,690
But that's not the case.

828
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:17,661
It exists in every part of our daily lives.

829
01:00:17,836 --> 01:00:19,936
It could come from food ingredients grown in contaminated soil...

830
01:00:19,936 --> 01:00:21,106
or makeup.

831
01:00:21,106 --> 01:00:23,031
Don't we encounter these things on a daily basis?

832
01:00:23,405 --> 01:00:25,476
In particular, this area...

833
01:00:25,476 --> 01:00:28,871
is the first to be affected by heavy metals in the fine dust.

834
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,015
As it is a farming village,

835
01:00:30,015 --> 01:00:32,880
it's also severely affected by chemical fertilizers and herbicide.

836
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:34,285
In comparison to that,

837
01:00:34,285 --> 01:00:37,581
with this amount of pollutants in the stream water...

838
01:00:37,986 --> 01:00:39,150
I'm not sure.

839
01:00:39,825 --> 01:00:42,081
Witness, I would like to ask you a question as well.

840
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,821
Yes, go ahead.

841
01:00:43,925 --> 01:00:47,920
You just said that there were pollutants in the stream water.

842
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:49,991
Could you specify what kind of pollutants were in there?

843
01:00:51,736 --> 01:00:53,805
There was a variety of chemicals mixed in...

844
01:00:53,805 --> 01:00:55,860
Among them, which chemical was most prominently found?

845
01:00:58,305 --> 01:01:02,146
Well... It's a chemical called potassium cyanide.

846
01:01:02,146 --> 01:01:03,770
Please make it easy to understand.

847
01:01:05,416 --> 01:01:06,710
Potassium cyanide.

848
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:09,511
What is the common name for this?

849
01:01:10,856 --> 01:01:12,081
Dr. Yu?

850
01:01:16,396 --> 01:01:17,991
It's cyanide.

851
01:01:18,756 --> 01:01:21,125
- Cyanide? The poison? - What did he just say?

852
01:01:21,126 --> 01:01:22,296
Camera number seven.

853
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:24,296
("JU Chemical's Chairman Joo Il Do Knew and Released Cyanide?")

854
01:01:24,296 --> 01:01:26,031
(Prosecutor)

855
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:28,666
I am aware that the term can sound really serious,

856
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:31,135
but this particular chemical is quite common.

857
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:33,500
Yes. If you look into it, it's quite common.

858
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:35,206
It's in almonds,

859
01:01:35,206 --> 01:01:37,415
apple seeds, apricot seeds, and cherry seeds.

860
01:01:37,416 --> 01:01:38,916
It's even peach seeds.

861
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:40,745
It's not always dangerous.

862
01:01:40,745 --> 01:01:43,155
The amount determines how dangerous it is.

863
01:01:43,155 --> 01:01:44,310
Sir.

864
01:01:45,686 --> 01:01:49,155
Near this factory is a village where most of the residents are elderly.

865
01:01:49,155 --> 01:01:51,590
Could you really say that the amount found was insignificant?

866
01:01:51,695 --> 01:01:53,166
I'm sorry, Your Honors...

867
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,420
Well... Your Honor.

868
01:01:55,936 --> 01:01:58,695
You may know the law well,

869
01:01:58,695 --> 01:02:01,435
but don't you think I know this area better than you?

870
01:02:01,436 --> 01:02:03,206
Science is based on facts.

871
01:02:03,206 --> 01:02:05,376
It's not based on the sentiment of the citizens.

872
01:02:05,376 --> 01:02:07,371
- Witness. - Yes, Your Honor.

873
01:02:09,546 --> 01:02:11,971
That's enough. You can stop.

874
01:02:14,646 --> 01:02:16,451
Dr. Yu. Thank you.

875
01:02:16,655 --> 01:02:18,750
- Thank you. - Please have a seat.

876
01:02:19,115 --> 01:02:22,026
He must be exhausted after giving such a long statement.

877
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:23,155
Please give him a glass of water.

878
01:02:23,155 --> 01:02:25,451
- Sir. - Please give him a glass of water.

879
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:32,360
(Witness)

880
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:33,601
Thank you.

881
01:02:39,106 --> 01:02:40,575
Hold on. That water...

882
01:02:40,575 --> 01:02:43,110
Are you sure you didn't mix it up with the stream water sample?

883
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,181
What are you doing?

884
01:02:48,546 --> 01:02:50,380
Your Honor. It's not the same water.

885
01:02:50,686 --> 01:02:52,310
The evidence is right here.

886
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:56,155
It looked similar,

887
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:57,790
so I was mistaken.

888
01:02:58,026 --> 01:02:59,125
I'm sorry, sir.

889
01:02:59,126 --> 01:03:01,195
He said it was okay to drink.

890
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,761
If it's okay, he should be fine drinking too!

891
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:10,170
Gosh, I'm embarrassed.

892
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:13,670
If you're done, you may leave.

893
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,210
Darn it. I shouldn't have done it.

894
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,980
What kind of embarrassment is this?

895
01:03:20,986 --> 01:03:23,281
My gosh, this is all Chairman Joo's fault.

896
01:03:25,356 --> 01:03:27,150
Gosh. What's wrong with me?

897
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,360
Darn it!

898
01:03:44,106 --> 01:03:47,805
Your Honor, our next witness is Jang Ki Young, the caretaker...

899

You worked in this factory for 12 years.

902
01:03:55,646 --> 01:03:57,155
Before the embankment collapse,

903
01:03:57,155 --> 01:03:59,650
were there any issues with the wastewater purification facilities?

905
01:04:03,925 --> 01:04:05,150

906
01:04:05,695 --> 01:04:08,425
Didn't you already testify to that during the investigation?

907
01:04:08,425 --> 01:04:10,331
Why aren't you answering?

908
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:13,500
Right, well... The thing is...

909
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:20,801
I am filled with a lot of thoughts.

910
01:04:20,845 --> 01:04:22,500
- Witness. - Mr. Jang!

911
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:25,141
- Defendant? - Yes?

912
01:04:25,146 --> 01:04:26,380
Please have a seat.

913
01:04:27,015 --> 01:04:28,210
I apologize.

914
01:04:28,785 --> 01:04:30,181
Please continue.

915
01:04:30,655 --> 01:04:32,110
Yes, Your Honor.

916
01:04:32,115 --> 01:04:35,380
To be honest, there is something I would like to say.

917
01:04:36,126 --> 01:04:37,821
- What are you saying? - The waste water...

918
01:04:38,226 --> 01:04:39,860
has been leaking since before then.

919
01:04:41,296 --> 01:04:44,836
I still don't understand how an embankment that was fine...

920
01:04:44,836 --> 01:04:46,701
suddenly collapsed that night,

921
01:04:46,765 --> 01:04:48,566
but one thing is for sure. The waste water...

922
01:04:48,566 --> 01:04:50,730
was leaking since before then.

923
01:04:50,876 --> 01:04:52,471
Since it's an important issue,

924
01:04:53,476 --> 01:04:54,976
I reported this to the chairman.

925
01:04:54,976 --> 01:04:56,810
- Witness! - Counsel.

926
01:04:57,976 --> 01:04:59,241
Please return to your seat.

You can speak comfortably.

929
01:05:09,226 --> 01:05:11,150
I told him that the facilities were severely worn out...

930
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:14,526
and that if they weren't taken care of immediately, it would be serious.

931
01:05:14,526 --> 01:05:15,690
However, the chairman said...

932
01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:17,995
the factory will move next year to Southeast Asia,

933
01:05:17,995 --> 01:05:19,134
so why would waste money?

934
01:05:19,135 --> 01:05:20,565
Why make a fuss over something so insignificant?

935
01:05:20,566 --> 01:05:22,161
- Mr. Jang. - Okay.

936
01:05:22,405 --> 01:05:24,801
What did you say upon hearing that?

937
01:05:25,135 --> 01:05:29,546
I said to him what if something happened to the village elders...

938
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:31,511
- And? - The chairman...

939
01:05:35,546 --> 01:05:39,281
said who cares about old people who already lived full lives.

940
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:41,951
Mr. Jang. When did I say that?

941
01:05:43,626 --> 01:05:45,891
"Who cares about old people who already lived full lives"?

942
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,730
Do you mean to tell me he said that?

943
01:05:51,736 --> 01:05:53,201
I thought to myself,

944
01:05:54,765 --> 01:05:56,431
"Isn't this murder?"

945
01:05:56,976 --> 01:05:59,805
How can a human do such a thing?

946
01:05:59,805 --> 01:06:01,400
No. It's not true!

954
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:28,204
I would like to call Dr. Yu Jong Baek to the stand.

There's no need to keep watching. He should be executed.

You don't deny meeting the witness.

Then you deny it was murder by gross negligence,

but admit to professional negligence resulting in death?

1015

Joo Il Do was Cha Kyung Hee's sponsor when she was a prosecutor.

01:12:53,925 --> 01:12:56,794
the judicial reform bill that was passed last year...

1080
01:12:56,795 --> 01:12:59,294
says I can hand down an accumulated sentence...

1081
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:01,921
to account for all the victims.

1082
01:13:03,635 --> 01:13:04,831

(JU Chemical Sewage Leak, 11 dead, 36 with disabilities)

1106
01:14:53,476 --> 01:14:55,371
Because of your foolish greed,

1107
01:14:56,406 --> 01:14:58,615
you took innocent lives...

1108
01:14:58,616 --> 01:15:02,180
and those who survived will live the rest of their lives in pain.

1109
01:15:03,616 --> 01:15:07,325

01:17:51,085 --> 01:17:53,720
I tried to kill myself many times too,

1144

but dying isn't as easy as I thought.

Then you deny it was murder by gross negligence,

1148

but admit to professional negligence resulting in death?

And you looked hot too.

The rule of law? Do you think the purpose of a trial is justice?

1158
