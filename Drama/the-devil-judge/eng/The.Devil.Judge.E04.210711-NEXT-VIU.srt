00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:22,786
Get us justice!

5
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:24,852
Kang Yo Han was an abandoned child?

6
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:30,486
Still, you said his brother Isaac was good to him.

7
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:32,753
And they got along. Did they not?

8
00:00:33,397 --> 00:00:36,727
Master Yo Han's the survivor of a fire.

9
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:37,892
Did you hear of that?

10
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,163
Yes.

11
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:42,062
It happened just one month after the Chairman died.

12
00:00:42,138 --> 00:00:46,072
Master Isaac died in that fire.

13
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:55,646
Judge! You were awesome today!

14
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:58,013
You got the public to provide the twist.

15
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:01,686
Do you have the rating of that very moment? Look.

16
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,593
Sir, your blood pressure might spike.

17
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,993
Chief Kang. When the agreement came in yesterday,

18
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,293
I thought it was all over.

19
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:13,933
I'm ashamed, as a judge.

20
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,002
Don't be ashamed.

21
00:01:19,577 --> 00:01:20,672
Look up.

22
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:23,142
We are a team.

23
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:24,972
Do you get that?

24
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:26,972
Yes, Chief Kang.

25
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,353
"We are a team."

26
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:39,722
That's the perfect ending to the show.

27
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:41,593
I got that too.

28
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:43,096
We are a team.

29
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:45,466
- Well done, kiddo. - Do you get that?

30
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:46,537
Our ratings will skyrocket.

31
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:47,933
- Let's go! - Let's go!

32
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:51,903
Secretary Jang...

33
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:57,743
Don't worry too much, Young Min.

34
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,316
What is going on?

35
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:02,716
Will I get 100 or 200 years...

36
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,117
and go to prison?

37
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,656
For something like this,

38
00:02:05,657 --> 00:02:08,087
do they think they can take down the Minister of Justice's son?

39
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:10,727
Do you think that crazy judge cares about that?

40
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:14,052
He's doing all he can to gain popularity with commoners.

41
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:17,067
There will be a way.

42
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:19,097
There's still time until the next trial.

43
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,607
So calm down, Young Min. Please.

44
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:23,563
I'll call your mom.

45
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:25,073
Give me my phone.

46
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:29,043
Darn it.

47
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:31,612
Let's go.

48
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,413
(Minister of Justice)

49
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:42,082
Hello?

50
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:45,992
Oh, this is surprising, Minister.

51
00:02:46,358 --> 00:02:49,063
Why are you going this far?

52
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:52,263
I believe you should ask your son that.

53
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,703
Why did he treat all those people like that?

54
00:02:56,068 --> 00:02:58,306
He has been through a lot.

55
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,603
And he failed to control his temper.

56
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:02,902
He's not a bad person.

57
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:06,776
Did you accept such excuses when you were a prosecutor?

58
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,317
Listen, Judge Kang.

59
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:09,543
I'm hanging up.

60
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:11,043
Let's meet.

61
00:03:11,587 --> 00:03:13,082
It won't take long.

62
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,332
Thanks for coming.

63
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:34,332
Isn't this obviously inappropriate?

64
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,203
What do you want?

65
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:42,013
What must I do?

66
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,313
What do you mean?

67
00:03:44,047 --> 00:03:46,913
What must I do to make you let my son go?

68
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:50,326
Your son is only being sentenced by the law.

69
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:51,657
Don't lie.

70
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:54,326
You targeted him from the start just to get to me.

71
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,862
Is that what you think?

72
00:03:57,698 --> 00:03:59,296
What do you want from me?

73
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:01,362
Don't say something obvious like justice.

74
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:03,233
Isn't it strength?

75
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:04,772
Power.

76
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,603
You're doing this to gain popularity.

77
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:11,003
What if I give you a bigger prey?

78
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:13,372
A rich businessman? The president?

79
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,613
19 years ago,

80
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,813
you investigated a young politician with a bright future.

81
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,383
For bribery.

82
00:04:24,057 --> 00:04:25,857
- What does that... - At the time,

83
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:29,667
you knew for a fact that he hadn't taken any bribes,

84
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,392
but you investigated him and got a guilty verdict.

85
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,462
It was impressive.

86
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:37,133
Even those who ordered it said as much.

87
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,306
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:39,307 --> 00:04:41,743
That man was the trademark of morals.

89
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:45,412
He took his own life.

90
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:48,313
Leaving behind a son who was in middle school.

91
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,087
During the 19 successful years of your career,

92
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:54,282
did you...

93
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,957
never think about that even once?

94
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,727
Don't talk nonsense. The investigation was legal.

95
00:04:59,728 --> 00:05:02,222
It was legal? As if.

96
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:04,162
This is my condition.

97
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,696
Tell the media the truth behind that case.

98
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:11,472
If you do that, I'll let your son go.

99
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,243
Give it some thought.

100
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:05,152
People don't change easily,

101
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:07,592
don't you think?

102
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:11,123
Thank you.

103
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,573
Get out.

104
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,342
- I'm sorry. - Get out!

105
00:08:05,747 --> 00:08:07,673
- Butler. - Yes, Master.

106
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:09,842
I'm hungry. Is there something to eat?

107
00:08:10,148 --> 00:08:12,486
- The ingredients you have are... - I'm not going to cook.

108
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:14,082
Is there something I can heat up and eat?

109
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:16,253
You can choose between pizza and beef and rice.

110
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,152
Beef and rice sounds good.

111
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,722
It's in the freezer.

112
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:25,537
Did Elijah have dinner?

113
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,563
Yes, she had beef and rice.

114
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,273
Do we have similar tastes?

115
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,523
Do you eat alone every day?

116
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,962
Does eating with someone change anything?

117
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:02,002
All alone in this huge house?

118
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,033
The most dangerous and harmful things in the world are humans.

119
00:09:09,308 --> 00:09:11,073
Do you have something to say?

120
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:13,773
No, sir.

121
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,193
It was a surprise.

122
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,293
What do you mean?

123
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,732
It was pretty good. The toast.

124
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,403
You've never made it for me before.

125
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:12,137
I just arrived.

126
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,273
What?

127
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,443
I'm glad you liked it.

128
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:27,252
What are you looking at?

129
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:37,092
Maybe you should ask him for help.

130
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:40,262
- Who? That old man? - Yes.

131
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,033
What can he possibly do in this situation?

132
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:46,838
Minister, the entire country is in chaos,

133
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:50,242
but two organizations are trusted by 90 percent of the population.

134
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:52,617
Social Responsibility Foundation.

00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:53,712
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

136
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:57,512
Who would say no to handouts?

137
00:10:57,517 --> 00:10:58,857
What a bunch of beggars.

138
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,653
The other organization is the live court.

139
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:04,653
Ignorant pigs.

140
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,023
I'm sorry to say this, but the prosecution is trusted by...

141
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,992
only 12 percent of the population.

142
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:26,342

143
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:30,143

144
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,293
(Minister Cha Kyung Hee)

145
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,762
Hello, Minister Cha.

146
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:48,602
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,507
He is meditating and can't talk right now.

148
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:53,403
Could you call again later?

149
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:56,073
Pardon?

150
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,943
If you tell me what this is about, I'll relay it to him.

151
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,987
I see. Of course.

152
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:11,657
Any mom would do the same.

153
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,293
I do understand.

154
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:16,023
Yes.

155
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:20,097
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

156
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:23,002
Minister, let's put things right together.

157
00:12:25,037 --> 00:12:26,232
Okay.

158
00:12:30,678 --> 00:12:34,242
My ear hurts. She talks too much, seriously.

159
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:02,376
I think it's time for us to meet, Judge Kang.

160
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,143
(Judge Kang Yo Han)

161
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:08,143
Are you hurt?

162
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:14,413
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:22,862
I'm surprised.

164
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,232
Not by you.

165
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:29,362
The cat doesn't like being around strangers.

166
00:13:30,468 --> 00:13:33,136
I'm very popular with stray cats.

167
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,673
They must be able to tell that I'm a good person. Right?

168
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,102
As if.

169
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:40,842
Only the slow ones can't tell.

170
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,512
What?

171
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,813
I mean cats.

172
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,683
That cat was once a stray cat too.

173
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:52,852
It was?

174
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:54,992
But it looks so expensive.

175
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,327
Yo Han picked it up.

176
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,592
It's out of character, but he keeps doing it.

177
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:02,332
What makes you think it's out of character?

178
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,502
Don't tell me you think he is the person...

179
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:07,002
the people on TV make him out to be.

180
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,342
The fighter for justice who loves the powerless,

181
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,303
the great Judge Kang Yo Han.

182
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,342
He isn't?

183
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,242
You're just as stupid as I thought.

184
00:14:15,987 --> 00:14:19,112
We feed this cat every day, but it still hunts mice.

185
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,153
Can you guess why?

186
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,323
- I'm not sure. - It's because it's fun.

187
00:14:24,358 --> 00:14:27,193
The cat hunts for fun because it's bored.

188
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,222
How do you think Yo Han became the owner of this house?

189
00:14:36,637 --> 00:14:38,002
What do you mean?

190
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,203
It's...

191
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,773
the only thing I think about...

192
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,443
every day.

193
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:03,393
Hey, Soo Hyun.

194
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,862
Could I meet the officer who investigated the fire 10 years ago?

195
00:15:07,397 --> 00:15:08,492
Well, the thing is...

196
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:12,903
Was it an important call?

197
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:16,146
Don't you know you should knock when you go into someone's room?

198
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,947
In case you forgot, this is my house.

199
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:20,677
When are you planning to leave?

200
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:24,347
I want to stay here and take it easy for a few days.

201
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,852
I feel dizzy from time to time.

202
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,512
It seemed like you were moping around the house.

203
00:15:29,008 --> 00:15:30,434
Is it because you're curious?

204
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,874
Or are you trying to find something?

205
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:37,804
I'm not really interested in other people's business.

206
00:15:39,018 --> 00:15:40,213
Is that so?

207
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:44,784
Okay, then.

208
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,583
Shall we choose your outfit now?

209
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:48,558
Choose my outfit?

210
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:50,658
Yes, I'm taking you somewhere.

211
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,754
Come with me.

212
00:15:57,893 --> 00:15:58,998
How's this?

213
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,300
Wear this tie. The shirts are right under there.

214
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,154
Wear this.

215
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,228
Why?

216
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:24,983
Because you're going to have to live in the same time zone as me.

217
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:38,934
What are you waiting for?

218
00:16:41,978 --> 00:16:43,347
Do I have to dress you?

219
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,804
I can get dressed on my own.

220
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,154
What?

221
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,254
That's a first.

222
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:03,894
It healed up.

223
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:30,983
Is this for me too?

224
00:17:31,229 --> 00:17:32,324
Yes, wear it.

225
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:47,374
You look surprisingly good.

226
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,174
Well, I'm still young.

227
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:50,503
Unlike someone.

228
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,713
- What? - Hey, old man.

229
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:55,243
Old man?

230
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:02,053
Elijah, did you have dinner?

231
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:16,963
I don't look like an old man.

232
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,676
You can drive, can't you?

233
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,775
Sure.

234
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,216
What are you doing? Get in.

235
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,106
Welcome, sir. Please come this way.

236
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,085
- Hello, Judge. - It's good to see you, Judge.

237
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,815
- Gosh, he's handsome. - Hello.

238
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:43,426
- He's really good-looking. - It's nice to see you.

239
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,065
Judge.

240
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:57,866
Excuse me.

241
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,949
Nice to meet you.

242
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,081
I work for Mr. Seo, the board chairman,

243
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:07,050
at Social Responsibility Foundation.

244
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:08,545
My name is Jung Sun Ah.

245
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:11,515
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim Ga On.

246
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,285
Nice to meet you too.

247
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,656
My goodness. There you are.

248
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:19,729
- You should become an actor, Judge. - Thank you.

249
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,999
Why don't you make your debut at our station?

250
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,825
You're going to scare him off.

251
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:27,540
The live court show is broadcast by our company.

252
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,636
I see.

253
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:34,409
She's the wife of Chairman Park of Saram Media.

254
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,550
And this is the wife of Chairman Min of Minbo Group.

255
00:20:36,551 --> 00:20:38,575
- I'm Kim Sang Sook. - And I'm Pi Hyang Mi.

256
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,820
I'm Kim Ga On.

257
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:43,149
You've become a rising star.

258
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,889
Why don't you take a picture with me?

259
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,459
Good, good.

260
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,489
- I want to be in the picture too. - Okay. Come closer.

261
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,025
Give me a goddess pose and make a heart shape.

262
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:52,696
Okay.

263
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:54,755
Make a heart shape. Okay.

264
00:20:56,831 --> 00:21:00,639
Don't you think it'd be more stylish if we can see his forehead?

265
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,239
No, this is fine since he has a handsome face.

266
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,310
But his outfit doesn't look good.

267
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:05,939
- You're right. It's too old. - Which brand is it?

268
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,380
It's a grandpa's suit. Can you take it off?

269
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,610
- No, wait. - Which brand is it?

270
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:09,850
Just take it off.

271
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,080
- Take it off for a second. - I'm okay.

272
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,045
- Come on. Take it off. - Excuse me, ladies.

273
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,389
I need to introduce him to many people today.

274
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,055
- Could I borrow him for a second? - Sure.

275
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,116
- Bye. - See you.

276
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:28,760
He's a child.

277
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,295
How long do you think he can last working under Kang Yo Han?

278
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,235
- He's so cute. - Yes, he is.

279
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,166
I like him.

280
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,735
So he's his chaperone.

281
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,745
I don't need a chaperone.

282
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,886
You looked like a fawn surrounded by a pride of lionesses.

283
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,886
- What, a fawn? - Hello, sir.

284
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:55,389
Your dazzle hurts my eyes. Look who's here.

285
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,055
- Hello. - Judge Kang.

286
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,785
Have a seat.

287
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,199
Thanks to these handsome judges,

288
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,426
our broadcasting agency is doing so well.

289
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:06,366
I'm Park Du Man.

290
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,870
You're making a lot of money from their advertising sales, right?

291
00:22:08,871 --> 00:22:10,669
Yes, of course.

292
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,380
Now we can donate more money.

293
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:14,706
You're so vulgar.

294
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,610
The man who's being rude to me...

295
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:18,979
owns Minbo Group.

296
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,749
It's a really small store.

297
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,245
And he's the chairman, Min Yong Shik.

298
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:28,116
- I'm Kim Ga On. - So you're the popular Judge Kim.

299
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,226
Why don't you join our study session?

300
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,399
A study session?

301
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
We just gather together to worry about our country.

302
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,270
People from the financial, political, and academic world...

303
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,295
study about the world.

304
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:41,499
Sometimes we invite great scholars to speak at the session.

305
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,310
That's how we hang out.

306
00:22:43,311 --> 00:22:46,139
Gosh, an ignorant merchant like me...

307
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,005
can't understand a thing they talk about.

308
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:51,245
You know that you are ignorant?

309
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,515
I guess you're smart after all.

310
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,616
Oh, gosh. Mr. President!

311
00:23:02,291 --> 00:23:03,656
Goodness.

312
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:06,896
Let's go.

313
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:09,765
I should go too.

314
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,469
Thank you for taking part in our Dream Home business.

315
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,305
It's an honor to introduce our generous donors.

316
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:19,735
First, here are the donors who donated 100,000 dollars.

317
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,876
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

318
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,120
Now here are the donors who donated one million dollars.

319
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:32,555
Could you please stand up?

320
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,555
- Cheers. - This is so nice.

321
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,025
Cheers.

322
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,866
And there is someone who showed us exceptional love and support.

323
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,429
This person donated 10 million dollars.

324
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,866
Where are you?

325
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:51,335
Please give him a big round of applause.

326
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,116
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

327
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,555
Ladies and gentlemen.

328
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,126
Let me introduce Board Chairman, Seo Jeong Hak.

329
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:12,595
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

330
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,821
Benevolence.

331
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,716
(Benevolence)

332
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,186
The power to overcome rebellion...

333
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,255
ultimately comes from this word,

334
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:43,626
benevolence.

335
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:47,956
All men are born with human nature.

336
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,426
In Mencius' excerpts with Gong Sun Chou,

337
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,095
the foundations of the Four Sprouts,

338
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,565
- compassion. - Goodness.

339
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,376
If you do not take pity on people,

340
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:02,235
you are not human!

341
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,676
You must not forget that this mentality is the basis of...

342
00:25:07,051 --> 00:25:09,216
our foundation!

343
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,896
You're so good at it.

344
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,565
That was funny. Here have a grape.

345
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,676
- Did Mr. Seo donate any money? - I don't know.

346
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,206
Oh, he's here!

347
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,686
That was a great speech.

348
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,116
It was incredible.

349
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:47,055
That was really good.

350
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,755
Sir, your speech today was so moving.

351
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:54,100
Compassion. You're right.

352
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:55,761
We must have compassion for the people...

353
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,765
for the nation to run well.

354
00:25:57,771 --> 00:26:00,199
With that in mind, I will give my soul and body...

355
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,906
to support the Dream Home business...

356
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:07,080
fully and completely to the best of my ability.

357
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:09,280
- Thank you, Mr. President. - You're welcome.

358
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:12,245
Mr. President, you seem like a different person today.

359
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,376
Why?

360
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,250
Whether I'm awake or asleep...

361
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,015
Whether I'm sitting or I'm standing

362
00:26:20,821 --> 00:26:23,926
I'm always worried about our country for the sake of...

363
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,886
my beloved and respectable fellow citizens.

364
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:37,666
Okay. Let's worry about the country after we finish eating.

365
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:39,235
Give us our food!

366
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,206
That was fast.

367
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,946
- Thank you. - Thank you.

368
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:53,886
Thank you.

369
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:56,055
Please, enjoy your meal.

370
00:27:09,271 --> 00:27:10,735
- Goodness. - I'm sorry, sir.

371
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,676
You can take your time. It's okay.

372
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:16,275
This is good.

373
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,275
You can take your time. It's okay.

374
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,856
Slowly.

375
00:27:28,121 --> 00:27:29,555
Slowly.

376
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,636
Mr. Seo.

377
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,065
What is it?

378
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,606
I'm sorry.

379
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:47,206
You have an urgent call.

380
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:49,676
Is that so?

381
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:53,075
Well, then. Please excuse me.

382
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:56,985
Please continue.

383
00:28:35,761 --> 00:28:37,726
Well the thing is...

384
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:44,426
Darn it.

385
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,300
I'm so sorry.

386
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:50,835
I still commit sins in my old age.

387
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:52,106
Old man.

388
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:54,305
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,015
Why can't you behave modestly for even an hour?

390
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:02,916
- What should I do about you? - I apologize.

391
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,856
I apologize.

392
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,985
Repent.

393
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,656
Repent.

394
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,896
Repent!

395
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,595
Repent!

396
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,126
Repent!

397
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,136
Who are you?

398
00:29:25,271 --> 00:29:26,775
I'm a dog.

399
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,976
What are you talking about?

400
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:32,775
You're an advocate for the slums who was nominated for a Nobel Prize.

401
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,580
No, ma'am. I'm just a dog.

402
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:38,085
Why is the great philosopher and national doyen acting so humble?

403
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:40,716
No, ma'am. I've fooled the world my entire life,

404
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,861
and only sought after dirty carnal desires.

405
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:43,555
I'm just a piece of trash.

406
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,886
Hey.

407
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:49,060
Aren't you Mr. Seo, a hidden power that not even the president...

408
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,626
can look down upon?

409
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,896
I hid behind my empty name...

410
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,335
and dirtied weak woman...

411
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,906
I...

412
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,606
I apologize.

413
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:07,376
I apologize. Please kill me.

414
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,196
- Old Man. - Yes, ma'am.

415
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,335
There's something you've been mistaken about.

416
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,206
Just because a dog bites a person,

417
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,111
does the person...

418
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:38,476
get dirty from it?

419
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,476
How dare a dog do that?

420
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:44,946
You're right.

421
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,616
That's true.

422
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,186
Let's repent.

423
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,800
Let's make it a month this time.

424
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,765
I'll just say that you're fasting in prayer for the nation again.

425
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:58,726
Yes, ma'am.

426
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,505
Did it hurt?

427
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,335
Judge Kang, your trials are quite refreshing.

428
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,176
We're all so deeply moved.

429
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,620
You grew up to be so successful...

430
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:16,745
despite the terrible events from 10 years ago.

431
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,815
You're too kind. It was all thanks to you.

432
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:23,585
Right. Whenever I see you, Judge Kang,

433
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,255
I feel bad for you.

434
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:27,325
We especially feel that way.

435
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,166
But after the most recent trial ended,

436
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,805
the people around me... Not me,

437
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:39,775
but the people around me were very worried.

438
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:42,176
Public sentiment is chaotic as is.

439
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,646
Did you have to make such a big fuss over something like that?

440
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,116
Young Min went to school with our kid, so I know him well.

441
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,485
He was very sweet and nice when he was young.

442
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:53,815
It's unfortunate.

443
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,856
I'm sorry, but we can't speak about an ongoing trial...

444
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,456
We're discussing the infringement of judicial independence.

445
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:05,196
The nation is falling apart, perhaps we must worry about that first.

446
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,765
The directors of the foundation have a lot of complaints.

447
00:32:08,101 --> 00:32:10,906
They wonder if the live court show is going according to plan.

448
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,906
What if something happens because you continue to provoke commoners?

449
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,745
Will Judge Kang Yo Han take responsibility for it?

450
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:22,616
Listen here! What are you talking about?

451
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,356
That man doesn't know his place.

452
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,595
Does it have to be Cha Kyung Hee?

453
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:46,706
What do you mean?

454
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,716
As you may all know,

455
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:00,686
Cha Kyung Hee has a lot of enemies and a lot of flaws.

456
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,186
Does Cha Kyung Hee have to be the one...

457
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:07,025
to protect all of your fortunes?

458
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,995
Honey.

459
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,896
This is... Gosh. Hold on.

460
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,140
Judge Kang, you're a strong match.

461
00:33:19,141 --> 00:33:20,209
I'm no match for you.

462
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,575
You're an imaginative lunatic!

463
00:33:23,681 --> 00:33:25,546
You're a creative psycho!

464
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:29,546
You're right.

465
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,615
It doesn't have to be Cha Kyung Hee.

466
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,086
I'm talking about the next presidency, right?

467
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,289
Someone who is popular with commoners...

468
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,896
and has a strong background story.

469
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,365
People like that are more popular in this day and age.

470
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,066
That's how I ended up becoming president!

471
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,776
From the perspective of a businessman,

472
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:59,175
it's better to bet on the one who survives.

473
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,546
Although, it's hard to say who will.

474
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,146
The one who survives?

475
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,420
Chairman Park. If you put it that way,

476
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,030
you're upsetting the listener.

477
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:12,760
Doesn't that make you a jerk too?

478
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:13,829
I think I got it.

479
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,329
You, you, you.

480
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,070
- That's right. - You could rap.

481
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:18,630
You should be a rapper.

482
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:21,736
Look at this. There's a real lime here.

483
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,180
Shall I show you a killer verse?

484
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:28,736
It's killer.

485
00:34:57,737 --> 00:35:02,737

You must feel a little queasy.

487
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,445
Ms. Jung.

488
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,785
The Judge Kang you saw here.

489
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,416
Isn't it an unfamiliar scene?

490
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:49,715
What do you mean?

491
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:53,499
I just run errands for the chairman of the board,

492
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,155
but I unwittingly hear and see things.

493
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,430
It's utterly different from the image that...

494
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:01,066
the outside world knows.

495
00:36:04,511 --> 00:36:06,706
Do you have something to tell me?

496
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:11,506
I will keep it a secret.

497
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,015
You know about the church fire from 10 years ago, right?

498
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,486
- Yes. - It wasn't reported,

499
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:23,256
but there was an event that day.

500
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:27,899
Judge Kang's older brother was to sign a contract stating...

501
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,066
he'd donate all his wealth to our foundation.

502
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,100
Kang Isaac?

503
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,436
A huge fire just happened to break out that day.

504
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:34,899
It was an old building,

505
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,470
so it caved in and people got buried.

506
00:36:37,471 --> 00:36:39,976
Kang Isaac and his wife died that day.

507
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,606
But Judge Kang was found, purely by miracle.

508
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,745
The first thing he did when he left the hospital...

509
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:50,046
What was that?

510
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:54,155
He canceled the donation his brother made.

511
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:57,726
He even brought a doctor's note saying Isaac had a weak mind and...

512
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:59,956
was incapable of making sound decisions.

513
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:05,970
Is that something an average person can do?

514
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:09,595
Right after his brother and his wife died a gruesome death?

515
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,769
Whenever I see the live court show,

516
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,606
I think of that day.

517
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:17,476
It weighs on me.

518
00:37:28,991 --> 00:37:30,325
Why the weird face?

519
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:34,956
Are you going deaf too?

520
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,376
What are you doing?

521
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,075
You should've answered.

522
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,245
What?

523
00:37:56,381 --> 00:37:59,385
Are you disappointed by the sight of the real world?

524
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,885
It's the real side of the rich.

525
00:38:02,861 --> 00:38:04,925
Do you think the poor are any different?

526
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,126
Human beings are equal.

527
00:38:11,431 --> 00:38:12,925
In front of greed.

528
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:25,880
The prosecution still has not modified the indictment...

529
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,575
on Lee Young Min's assault case.

530
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:31,149
The live court show stressed it would be fair,

531
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,360
and criticism is gaining strength that...

532
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:37,390
the court is moving to let off the Minister of Justice's son.

533
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:39,059
Minister of Justice Cha Kyung Hee...

534
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,899
- has not made a statement. - Turn it off.

535
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,555
What she could say soon...

536
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,399
Punish Lee Young Min!

537
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,369
- Punish him! - Punish him!

538
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,410
Minister of Justice, resign!

539
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,439
- Resign! - Resign!

540
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,410
Punish Lee Young Min!

541
00:38:54,411 --> 00:38:56,380
- Punish him! - Punish him!

542
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,349
Minister of Justice, resign!

543
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:00,349
- Resign! - Resign!

544
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,215
Punish Lee Young Min!

545
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,245
(Ministry of Justice)

546
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,495
- Resign! - Resign!

547
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,200
- Stop it. - Resign!

548
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:22,200
Minister of Justice, resign!

549
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,840
- Minister of Justice, resign! - Get them out of here!

550
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:26,006
Let go!

551
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:29,280
- Resign! - Minister of Justice, resign!

552
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:32,149
Hey, you! Resign, Minister of Justice!

553
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,476
- Resign! - Get lost!

554
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,825
Those crazy fools.

555
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:56,836
What?

556
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,066
Fine.

557
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:08,276
What did the foundation say?

558
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:13,015
The sly vipers.

559
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:15,555
They want me to deal with it.

560
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:18,626
It's really bad, ma'am.

561
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:21,030
This is my condition.

562
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:23,399
Tell the media the truth behind that case.

563
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,265
If you do that, I'll let your son go.

564
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,836
What did Kang Yo Han demand?

565
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:34,276
He met with you. That means he wants something.

566
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,905
You can sell my company and give it all to him.

567
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,876
Let's protect Young Min.

568
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,186
It's our fault that he's like that.

569
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,689
We left him alone as a kid...

570
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,186
and kept busy with our own careers.

571
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:55,126
We had no idea how much he was struggling.

572
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,530
Do you remember the day he overdosed?

573
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:00,570
He said he'd rather die.

574
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,566
Why did you bring that up?

575
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:06,236
I don't want to think about that.

576
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,646
Honey. Money and titles aren't important at all.

577
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,776
Let's protect our son.

578
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,316
Okay?

579
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,385
He won't last a day in prison.

580
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,956
The poor thing...

581
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:32,066
Nothing's more important than our son.

582
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:38,566
Honey.

583
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:42,135
I will get Young Min out.

584
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,816
Even if I must sacrifice myself.

585
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:52,546
The next trial is tomorrow.

586
00:41:53,321 --> 00:41:55,316
Everything will be fine, right?

587
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:57,959
- Oh? - What? What is it?

588
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,990
Minister Cha Kyung Hee called an emergency press conference.

589
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:01,095
What?

590
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,726
Dear citizens.

591
00:42:06,841 --> 00:42:10,305
I stand here today with a heart heavy with guilt.

592
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,970
My foolish son...

593
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:15,506
has caused the people much concern.

594
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,776
I apologize sincerely.

595
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,215
It is my failure as a mother for not teaching him better.

596
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,296
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

597
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:43,495
The prosecution...

598
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,669
submitted a request today...

599
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,575
to amend the arraignment of defendant Lee Young Min.

600
00:42:49,011 --> 00:42:51,376
The charge was changed to habitual assault...

601
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,476
and the other incidents discovered were all included.

602
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,245
What?

603
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,720
- What is she saying? - In court tomorrow,

604
00:42:57,721 --> 00:43:00,050
I expect the judges to hand out a severe sentence.

605
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,756
What... Mom.

606
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,356
- I will not ask for forgiveness. - Wow.

607
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,396
Did her political ambitions beat her maternal instinct?

608
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,195
Dad, this isn't right, is it?

609
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:13,869
This isn't what you told me.

610
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:15,200
It's not right.

611
00:43:15,201 --> 00:43:16,700
What is that?

612
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,836
Young Min, calm down. Relax.

613
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,579
Why? What's wrong?

614
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,675
Do you have a migraine?

615
00:43:23,011 --> 00:43:24,376
Where are your pills?

616
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,579
Here. Take a pill.

617
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,519
Anyone who has committed a crime...

618
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,615
Breathe.

619
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,356
must be punished accordingly. I stand strongly behind that.

620
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,726
That is the Korea I dream of.

621
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:46,595
(Chief Judge Kang Yo Han)

622
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:53,976
After all I did to come here.

623
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,305
Nothing comes without a sacrifice.

624
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:30,445
Hi, Soo Hyun.

625
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,046
(The second live trial of Lee Young Min, VP of Joongwon FNB)

626
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:37,785
The defendant admits and deeply regrets what he did.

627
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:41,885
But I'd like you to understand that there were...

628
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,215
mitigating circumstances.

629
00:44:43,261 --> 00:44:45,385
Please elaborate, Counsel.

630
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:49,526
The defendant was always a sensitive, lonely child.

631
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:51,471
All kids are supposed to be raised...

632
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,669
with their parents' love, right?

633
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,865
Of course.

634
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,470
How can it be otherwise?

635
00:44:56,471 --> 00:44:57,610
Exactly.

636
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,669
But sadly,

637
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:03,376
the defendant had to give up his parents for society.

638
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,905
His mother as a public official and father as a pillar of the economy,

639
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,649
they both devoted their lives to this country...

640
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:11,390
and couldn't be there for him.

641
00:45:11,391 --> 00:45:13,816
Oh, my. That must've been hard.

642
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,256
Judge Kang.

643
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:17,555
Your Honor.

644
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,095
All this happened because of his parents' incompetence.

645
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,595
I beg you to take the circumstances into consideration.

646
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:25,770
That's right.

647
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,195
As a result, the defendant grew up alone...

648
00:45:28,241 --> 00:45:30,706
in that huge house with a housekeeper.

649
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,276
With 2 housekeepers, 1 cook, and 1 gardener, to be precise.

650
00:45:34,341 --> 00:45:35,736
Not that it's important, though.

651
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,276
Oh, yes.

652
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,450
Growing up, the defendant witnessed...

653
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:43,445
the housekeepers steal things time and time again.

654
00:45:43,451 --> 00:45:46,515
Naturally, he developed a fear of poor people.

655
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:49,660
That's what became the basis for...

656
00:45:49,661 --> 00:45:51,131
his obsessive and aggressive behavior.

657
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:53,801
I submit renowned child psychology experts and psychiatrists'...

658
00:45:53,801 --> 00:45:56,226
written opinions on this matter.

659
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,495
Please take it into account.

660
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:12,006
It must be hard.

661
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:16,675
Not really. It was much harder being a detective.

662
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,986
You should understand.

663
00:46:20,661 --> 00:46:21,690
Right.

664
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:24,155
Anyway, why are you asking about something that happened so long ago?

665
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:28,026
- The court is just the same. - What?

666
00:46:29,031 --> 00:46:32,595
They're desperate to find ways to raise our chief's popularity.

667
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:34,535
They want to strike while the iron is hot.

668
00:46:39,071 --> 00:46:41,175
I guess the youngest ones must work hardest everywhere.

669
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,550
Then again, the story of a survivor of a horrible fire...

670
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,845
sure sounds intriguing.

671
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,816
The fire was at a church, right?

672
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:57,086
Yes. His father went there too.

673
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:01,856
But it seems like there was no service that day.

674
00:47:01,931 --> 00:47:04,229
There was apparently a charity event of some sort,

675
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,126
but there's no record that shows who attended it.

676
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,135
Well, I don't see...

677
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:16,006
what this has to do with his popularity.

678
00:47:16,241 --> 00:47:18,376
We're just looking for some nice stories.

679
00:47:18,381 --> 00:47:19,976
We might have to do some interviews later.

680
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:24,445
Anyway, the cause of the fire is still unknown, right?

681
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,086
Yes.

682
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,986
The church was in an old school building,

683
00:47:30,321 --> 00:47:32,026
which was made of wood.

684
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,325
The whole building burned down, and there's nothing left.

685
00:47:36,801 --> 00:47:39,995
Maybe the curtains caught fire from a cigarette.

686
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,796
Maybe there was a short circuit.

687
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:45,169
Did you get a statement from Judge Kang?

688
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:47,236
Did he see anything?

689
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,110
I visited him once in the hospital.

690
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:52,606
But he didn't remember much,

691
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:54,950
which is understandable. The roof had come down on him,

692
00:47:54,951 --> 00:47:56,515
and it was chaos.

693
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:01,320
That reminds me. He has another live court show today.

694
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:02,686
I have to watch it.

695
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,425
Excuse me.

696
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,000
I'm not saying the circumstances justify...

697
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,626
everything the defendant did.

698
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:14,896
But we all are parents.

699
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:17,039
Just because a child commits misdeeds...

700
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,166
doesn't mean he should be isolated from society.

701
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:23,439
That's right. My son is still young...

702
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,106
and inexperienced.

703
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,976
He couldn't tell right from wrong.

704
00:48:27,221 --> 00:48:30,075
His parents couldn't care for him properly.

705
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,615
- They couldn't discipline him well. - Exactly.

706
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,086
They say it takes a village to raise a child.

707
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:39,630
The defendant wasn't loved and disciplined by his parents...

708
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:42,026
and committed misdeeds as a result.

709
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:44,769
Shouldn't we be generous and embrace him...

710
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,526
into society?

711
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,265
Young Min.

712
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:52,905
My poor son.

713
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:55,079
I'm so sorry.

714
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,706
If the defendant is put in prison for many years for this,

715
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,816
it's nothing more than emotional populism.

716
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:04,849
Then again, a prison sentence costs money.

717
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:07,416
That's right. It's paid for with tax dollars.

718
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,916
Wouldn't it be better if we let the defendant...

719
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,686
provide the victims with adequate financial compensations?

720
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,695
Let's face it, if we put this young man behind bars,

721
00:49:16,701 --> 00:49:19,425
will it feed his victims?

722
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,465
Everyone is struggling to make ends meet.

723
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,836
That was very well said. Thank you, Counsel.

724
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,675
I apologize if I went overboard, Your Honor.

725
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:30,976
Don't worry.

726
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:34,115
It was logical. It made perfect sense.

727
00:49:34,281 --> 00:49:35,575
And I agree with you totally.

728
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:40,820
Listening to your argument,

729
00:49:40,821 --> 00:49:44,825
I've come up with the most appropriate punishment.

730
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,055
It doesn't cost any tax dollars,

731
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,095
the defendant won't be isolated from society for a long time,

732
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,965
and it'll only inflict temporary pain on him.

733
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,436
It's the most efficient and economical punishment there is.

734
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:02,075
- It's flagellation. - What?

735
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,146
Flagellation?

736
00:50:06,111 --> 00:50:07,816
Hold on. My goodness.

737
00:50:08,721 --> 00:50:11,146
Oh, dear. Unbelievable.

738
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:12,816
- Flagellation? - Just like Counsel argued,

739
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,385
the defendant wasn't loved and disciplined by his parents.

740
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:17,925
Society should give it to him on his parents' behave.

741
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:21,256
"It takes a village to raise a child," you said.

742
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:22,726
Flagellation?

743
00:50:22,801 --> 00:50:25,200
Hey, search for some information on it and put it up on the screen.

744
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:26,365
Yes, sir.

745
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:29,135
This... This is absurd.

746
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:31,166
Tying up and beating a person in the 21st century?

747
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,836
That's too barbaric.

748
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:37,006
That sounds like an insult to many great nations...

749
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,506
that still carry out this punishment today.

750
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:40,916
Also, the verdict is based on...

751
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,320
the Special Act on Strengthening Law and Order, suggested by...

752
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:46,146
the Minister of Justice, who is the defendant's mother.

753
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:48,356
Am I wrong?

754
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,586

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

758
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,135
I'd like to apologize to all the victims as well.

759
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:05,765

760
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:08,376
I apologize. Please let it slide this once.

761

What do you think? Do you think this is...

764
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,586
an appropriate sentence for the defendant?

765
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,785

767
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,391
- Punish him! - Punish him!

Following the public opinion,

Compared to the misdeeds committed by the defendant,

816
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,566
this appears to be the minimum, most humanitarian sentence.

817
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,380
As the sentence was handed down by the public,

818

820

835

847
00:55:23,301 --> 00:55:25,229
You closed a case on the basis that the cause was unknown,

and two months later, you suddenly quit.

849

The foundation acted as though they were moved by his donation,

910
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:22,669
- Thank you! - and they held...

911
01:02:22,903 --> 01:02:25,208
a grand party at the church.

912
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:27,812
It must've been hard to make such a decision.

913
01:02:27,813 --> 01:02:29,042
No, sir.

914
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:31,453
I respect you. It couldn't have been easy.

915
01:02:31,454 --> 01:02:33,453
Sharing and education. Practicing love.

916
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:36,848
This is incredibly difficult and hard, don't you agree?

917
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:40,853
Goodness. You must be Elijah. How cute.

918
01:02:40,854 --> 01:02:44,118
Do you know how great of a man your father is?

919
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:46,393
He's like a saint.

920
01:02:46,394 --> 01:02:47,792
You're being too kind.

921
01:02:47,793 --> 01:02:49,433
You're incredible.

922
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:51,332
Gosh, is this a human or a fairy?

923
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:53,069
Why is she so pretty?

924
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:56,268
Do you want to sign a contract with my company?

925
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,743
Why are you doing this to a child?

926
01:02:57,744 --> 01:03:00,038
- Goodness. - Hey, come here!

927
01:03:00,043 --> 01:03:02,208
- Don't run! - Hey!

928
01:03:04,443 --> 01:03:06,478
(Verena Church)

929
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:08,719
Why did you come outside?

930
01:03:08,923 --> 01:03:10,078
Come in.

931
01:03:11,793 --> 01:03:13,493
I'll come in very soon.

932
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:15,958
Go back inside and stay with Dad, okay?

933
01:03:15,994 --> 01:03:18,558
- You have to come soon. - Okay.

934
01:03:21,293 --> 01:03:22,399
Hey!

935
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,228
Are you back to sign the deal?

936
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:30,239
Let me see you. You're just adorable.

937
01:03:33,874 --> 01:03:38,978
(Verena Church)

938
01:03:52,793 --> 01:03:54,158
How much is that?

939
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:57,158
I don't know. Should be a huge amount.

940
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:01,739
He demanded so much. He's quite particular.

941
01:04:01,874 --> 01:04:04,899
In two hours, the foundation will be tens of millions of dollars richer.

942
01:04:05,443 --> 01:04:06,669
Hang in there.

943
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:11,509
This offering made by Kang Isaac and Yu Hee Jin, Cecilia.

944
01:04:11,583 --> 01:04:15,049
So that the Almighty Lord will accept it,

945
01:04:15,083 --> 01:04:16,518
let us pray.

946
01:04:16,523 --> 01:04:18,719
- Amen. - Amen.

947
01:04:19,054 --> 01:04:21,288
- The body of Christ. - Where's Elijah?

948
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:24,089
The body of Christ.

949
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,658
The body of Christ.

950
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:30,998
The body of Christ.

951
01:04:33,273 --> 01:04:34,899
The body of Christ.

952
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:38,268
The body of Christ.

953
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,038
The body of Christ.

954
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:01,828
Mom!

955
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:13,009
Honey. Honey!

956
01:05:14,414 --> 01:05:15,908
Mom!

957
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:11,828
Mom!

958
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:41,289
Move!

959
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:49,899
- Where is she? - Elijah!

960
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,209
- Elijah! - Move.

961
01:06:52,213 --> 01:06:54,369
Get out of my way. Move.

962
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:03,149
Mom.

963
01:07:04,283 --> 01:07:06,218
You lunatic!

964
01:07:07,253 --> 01:07:09,088
Mom.

965
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,388
Who are you?

966
01:07:16,463 --> 01:07:18,329
Mom.

967
01:07:19,804 --> 01:07:21,168
Mom.

968
01:07:30,814 --> 01:07:32,209
Mom!

969
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:58,069
- Elijah! - Mom.

970
01:08:00,814 --> 01:08:02,638
- You're okay. - Elijah.

971
01:08:02,644 --> 01:08:03,978
- Baby. - Mom.

972
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,548
Let's get out of here.

973
01:08:09,583 --> 01:08:12,224
Get out of my way! Move!

974
01:08:12,224 --> 01:08:13,918
Let go of me!

975
01:08:50,564 --> 01:08:51,789
Yo Han.

976
01:09:13,854 --> 01:09:14,978
Elijah...

977
01:09:15,554 --> 01:09:16,878
Eli...

978
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:57,689
Yo Han.

979
01:10:01,764 --> 01:10:02,928
Go.

980
01:10:05,304 --> 01:10:06,468
Go.

981
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:23,848
I'll come right back.

982
01:11:15,873 --> 01:11:16,999
Isaac.

983
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:21,209
Isaac.

984
01:11:25,383 --> 01:11:26,779
What are you doing?

985
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:33,348
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

986
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:37,819
Isaac.

987
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:45,798
Isaac...

988
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:23,098
Someone's coming out!

989
01:12:25,043 --> 01:12:26,409
Say something!

990
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:27,768
How did you survive?

991
01:12:27,774 --> 01:12:29,239
We have a survivor!

992
01:12:31,644 --> 01:12:34,178
My gosh. You've been through so much.

993
01:12:38,154 --> 01:12:39,649
Look at him.

994
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:29,558
(The Devil Judge)

995
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:45,279
I'm sorry.

996
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:47,609
I was out of line.

997
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:06,369
I knew it.

998
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,138
People love stories like this.

999
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:44,598
Hunters mask their scent completely...

1000
01:15:45,203 --> 01:15:46,943
until the time is right.

1001
01:15:46,944 --> 01:15:47,974
It's going to be so fun.

1002
01:15:47,974 --> 01:15:50,513
I knock people out of my way...

1003
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:52,239
without hesitation.

1004
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:55,279
We'll give Kang Yo Han a little homework.

1005
01:15:55,283 --> 01:15:57,422
I need to find out who's behind Cha Kyung Hee.

1006
01:15:57,423 --> 01:15:58,922
Let's aim for the body first.

1007
01:15:58,923 --> 01:16:00,723
Even if no one else in the world does,

1008
01:16:00,724 --> 01:16:01,989
I understand...

1009
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,518
how it feels.

1010
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:05,018
Anger.

1011
01:16:05,564 --> 01:16:08,058
Make up your mind. Will you stand in my way...

1012
01:16:08,394 --> 01:16:09,798
or next to me?
