1
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,625
Judge Kim. What are you doing?

2
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,524
Good job, Judge Kim.

3
00:00:58,329 --> 00:00:59,725
You too.

4
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,368
- Well done. - I didn't do anything.

5
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:04,835
You did great.

6
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,549
Seeing you did well, how about dinner together?

7
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,645
I'd love it.

8
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,175
Go on.

9
00:01:17,389 --> 00:01:18,845
You can say no if you want.

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:21,884
I'm in.

11
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:34,634
I can finally relax.

12
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:38,065
I was so nervous I thought I'd wet myself.

13
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,404
Judge Kim, were you all right?

14
00:01:41,639 --> 00:01:45,178
There were lights everywhere and cameras were focused on me.

15
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,274
It felt like standing stark naked in the street.

16
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,178
- Judge Oh. - Yes?

17
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,645
Can someone shed a tear as they yawn?

18
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,955
I don't know.

19
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:58,555
I think I shed a tear whenever I yawn.

20
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,085
Why do you ask?

21
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,854
It's nothing.

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,494
So,

23
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,329
didn't you think that was thrilling?

24
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,935
The feel of the whole nation watching you.

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,234
Though of course, they were watching Chief Kang, not me.

26
00:02:15,609 --> 00:02:16,704
Not me.

27
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,379
(Associate Judge Kim Ga On)

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,475
Judge Oh?

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,589
I'm so relieved it was not me.

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,788
If it were me,

31
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,315
I guarantee I'd have messed up majorly with nerves.

32
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,029
So, aren't you excited?

33
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,695
He invited us out to dinner.

34
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,595
- Excited? - Yes.

35
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:41,369
They say our chief's an heir of a great family.

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,634
That means he'll be a gourmet.

37
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:54,008
Chief, what do you do for a hobby?

38
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,345
Do you play golf or tennis?

39
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,319
- I hunt. - You hunt?

40
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,988
The kind of hunting...

41
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:02,089
where you shoot stuff like rabbits with a gun?

42
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,984
No, that's no fun at all.

43
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,324
The stronger the prey, the better.

44
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,565
This looks amazing.

45
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,104
What kind of meat is this?

46
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,074
It's wild boar meat. It was a huge one.

47
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,779
Wild...

48
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,775
I have a hunting permit.

49
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:28,574
No way.

50
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,514
It's truly thrilling.

51
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:33,349
When it rushes at you, with its teeth bared...

52
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,255
and you shoot it between the eyes.

53
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,285
- Is it good? - Pardon?

54
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,698
- The meat. - The taste is new to me,

55
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,424
but it has a deep flavor.

56
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,894
I envy you. I can't taste too well.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,634
To me, food is more about...

58
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,234
the feel of the chew.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,238
"The feel of the chew"?

60
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,978
I cut food with my incisors,

61
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:00,005
crush it with my molars,

62
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,114
and my fangs do the tearing. That feeling.

63
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,918
That's how I feel my food.

64
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,655
Animals have fangs, not humans.

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,918
Aren't humans also animals?

66
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,584
People just call them teeth.

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,095
What's the big deal?

68
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,300
By the way, what do you mean you can't taste anything?

69
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,469
Could it be that your taste buds have become insensitive...

70
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,665
because you've always eaten good food since childhood?

71
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,604
"Since childhood"?

72
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,975
You were a pampered prince...

73
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,434
since birth.

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,015
"Since birth"?

75
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,254
Was I out of line?

76
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,354
No. You're right. I come from a wealthy family.

77
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,095
But you know what?

78
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,424
My late father...

79
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,635
was a loan shark.

80
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,465
He followed in his father's footsteps. Very mean.

81
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,674
So he was a heartless jerk.

82
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,934
Judge Kim.

83
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,874
You seem to understand the essence of the money-lending business.

84
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:09,975
Your family was neck-deep in debt, right?

85
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,519
Have you been checking up on me?

86
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,790
We'll be working together.

87
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,085
We should, of course, learn about each other.

88
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,184
After losing his fortune to a con artist,

89
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,924
your father killed himself, didn't he?

90
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,665
Well, sorry.

91
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:32,205
That came out wrong.

92
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:35,380
Pretending to have a heart when you're a heartless jerk.

93
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,839
That's the essence of the money-lending business, right?

94
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,174
- Judge Kim, Chief is just... - You're on point.

95
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,915
Selling hope and getting paid fear.

96
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,314
My father went to confession...

97
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,120
every time his debtor killed themselves.

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,624
I said, "I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah."

99
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,029
I acknowledged my sin to you and did not hide my iniquity,

100
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:58,924
and you forgave the iniquity of my sin.

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,905
What? You can't imagine being raised by such a person?

102
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:09,939
If you'll excuse me.

103
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,075
Judge Kim.

104
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,975
I'm not feeling so well.

105
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,145
I have a weak stomach.

109
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,694
I'm on safari.

110
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,535
Again? Just hurry up and get over here.

111
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,104
Everything's set.

112
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,635

What a jerk!

118
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,174
Are you okay?

119
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,015
Oh, dear.

120
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:34,245
My goodness.

121
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,184
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,855
You should've been more careful.

123
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,245
To make our society a better place,

124
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,745
the Social Responsibility Foundation...

125
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:05,944
is working together with the government...

126
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:09,584
to help the socially disadvantaged...

127
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,355
who can't financially support themselves.

128
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:25,839
I accumulated the sentence for all 47 victims...

129
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,405
the verdict is a total of 235 years.

130
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:43,660
Is a trial a joke to him?

131
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,385
A sentence of 235 years?

132
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:49,724
Did you plan the whole thing?

133
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:52,395
Kang Yo Han, that jerk,

134
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,299
- teared up while calling... - That's...

135
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,440
That's not so easy.

136
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,810
I tried it many times when I was an actor.

137
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,905
But it's extremely hard to force yourself to tear up.

138
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,135
I wonder...

139
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:06,375
how Judge Kang pulled it off without artificial tears.

140
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,074
Did he use a tear stick or something?

141
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,349
When I was an actor,

142
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,920
I could pull everything else off, but I couldn't force myself to cry.

143
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,184
That's why I never got to play any lead roles.

144
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,724
But now you're playing a lead role.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,594
I'm not sure.

146
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,064
Am I really playing a lead role?

147
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:30,039
The thing is, I'm surrounded by...

148
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,709
such strong characters.

149
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,280
To be honest, I'm still not sure...

150
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,204
what kind of role I should be playing.

151
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:41,745
You should understand it.

152
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,619
Isn't it obvious?

153
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:44,885
You're the leader...

154
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,885
of a country in danger.

155
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,355
By the way, Minister Cha,

156
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,294
I guess Chairman Joo is a big loss for you.

157
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,365
I mean,

158
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,040
you've put countless chairmans behind bars so far.

159
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,204
Why would you get so upset about Chairman Joo going down?

160
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,804
Is there something I don't know?

161
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:12,550
I'm just taking a wild guess.

162
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,848
Letting my imagination run wild.

163
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:15,645
You know I have quite the imagination.

164
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,314
I used to be an actor, an artist.

165
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,684
But the first trial was...

166
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,954
orchestrated by you,

167
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,495
wasn't it?

168
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:33,395
The foundation won't approve.

169
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,735
- One of our biggest donors... - No.

170
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,005
Mr. Seo didn't exactly seem unhappy.

Is Mr. Seo in?

174
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,344
He's meditating.

175
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,814

00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,655
How dare a lowly secretary...

178
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,029
This is inappropriate, Minister Cha.

179
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,194

do you think you're somebody?

183
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,405
I understand.

184
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,165
Can we have a word?

185

Don't you hear me?

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:29,079
Are you upset that things didn't go your way?

187
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,079
What?

188
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,544
Why did you have to show up here unannounced...

189
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,954
and throw a tantrum?

190
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,924
You're one to talk.

191
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,724
Aren't you the one who rained on my parade?

192
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,839
How could you team up with Kang Yo Han behind my back?

193
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,839
I don't understand what you're talking about.

194
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,204
So you want to play dumb.

195
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:01,174
I'm sure Judge Kang had his reason.

196
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,044
Winning over the public using a big case...

197
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,550
might not be a bad idea in the long run.

198
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,259
Are you saying...

199
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,390
Heo Joong Se convinced Kang Yo Han on his own?

200
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,229
Don't jump to conclusions.

201
00:14:12,229 --> 00:14:14,084
Think carefully.

202
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,698
Do you think getting me in trouble...

203
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:18,269
and joining hands with Heo Joong Se will be good for you?

204
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,464
I'm not going to sit back and do nothing.

205
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,334
If you're done talking, you may leave.

206
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,155
Wicked old man.

207
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,294
Do you think the result of the first trial...

208
00:14:55,099 --> 00:14:57,265
is that terrible?

209
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,235
What's that?

210
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:04,078
17 percent.

211
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,748
We just got the results of the survey.

212
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:09,245
The ruling party's approval rating went up 17 percent.

213
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,049
You're the Minister.

214
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,054
A top candidate to be the next president.

215
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:20,584
I'm sure many companies will want to support a presidential candidate.

216
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:23,924
Many firms that are more powerful than JU Chemical.

217
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,365
What?

218
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:30,765
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. I crossed the line...

219
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,135
when I'm just a mere secretary.

220
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,550
Professor.

221
00:15:51,114 --> 00:15:53,050
How many times do you have to send me to get the ball?

222
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:54,579
I'm sorry.

223
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,400
Are you okay?

224
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,380
Yes.

225
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,309
Gosh, I can't believe you did that.

226
00:16:23,355 --> 00:16:25,723
How can you cheat your own student...

227
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:27,324
when you're the chief justice?

228
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,650
I was faking, not cheating.

229
00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm kind of confused.

230
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,100
I thought he was going to let him off the hook.

231
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:48,469
But he didn't.

232
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:55,150
Now it's going to be harder to find out their motive.

233
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:58,279
The president's approval rating went up.

234
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:04,219
I'm sure they were involved in some kind of a deal.

235
00:17:05,694 --> 00:17:09,360
But I guess everything turned out well.

236
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:10,660
It turned out well?

237
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:12,559
Do you think that's what's important in trials?

238
00:17:12,735 --> 00:17:14,459
Can you really be satisfied when everything turns out well?

239
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,569
No, we can't mess with trials.

240
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,370
I'll look into it...

241
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,910
to find out what they're up to.

242
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,620
I'm so sorry, Judge Kim.

243
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:34,819
You don't have to be sorry.

244
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:39,519
But I can't stand you calling me "Judge Kim".

245
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:43,133
"You little punk. Do you want me to kill you?"

246
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:44,334
This is what you used to say.

247
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:47,504
That's when you were a troubled kid.

248
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,700
You mean when you were a thug professor?

249
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:50,934
What else did you say?

250
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:52,340
"Like the smell of the ground?"

251
00:17:52,444 --> 00:17:53,844
"Then you should be buried under it."

252
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:56,340
Was that really the right thing to say to the poor kid?

253
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:59,015
How dare you try to ruin the chief justice's reputation...

254
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:00,979
by spreading false information?

255
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,489
Did you get everything ready?

256
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,190
Have you met the doctor?

257
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,999
My nickname is Dr. Safety.

258
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,729
Maybe this doctor isn't Yu Jong Baek.

259
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:25,200
What if it's Jang Ki Young?

260
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:30,209
Come in.

261
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:31,979
Good job.

262
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,440
Thank you, sir.

263
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:36,979
Judge Kim.

264
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm here to return the book.

265
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,450
You came during the day this time.

266
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,090
(Environmental Crime)

267
00:18:44,154 --> 00:18:45,623
Something's bothering me.

268
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,163
Is that so? You can't let anything bother you.

269
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:51,690
Because you're my precious sidekick who sits at the left.

270
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,903
What did you just call me?

271
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,100
Have a seat.

272
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,709
So what's on your mind?

273
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,354
It's about Jang Ki Young, the witness in the trial.

274
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:11,984
You mean Dr. Safety.

275
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,084
- Yes. - What about him?

276
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,450
Do you trust what he said?

277
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:16,794
What do you mean?

278
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:19,764
I've never seen a witness spontaneously change...

279
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:21,123
such an important statement.

280
00:19:21,124 --> 00:19:23,090
Maybe he had a guilty conscience.

281
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,393
A guilty conscience?

282
00:19:24,394 --> 00:19:25,630
Why?

283
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:28,969
Don't you believe people can have a guilty conscience?

284
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,943
Well, I just wasn't convinced because it seemed...

285
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:34,104
- he had another intention. - Another intention?

286
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:37,469
He made it look like the defendant deliberately murdered the victim.

287
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:39,085
And you were happy to go along with him.

288
00:19:39,085 --> 00:19:40,085
"Happy to?"

289
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,180
It was the first time you had ever reacted positively.

290
00:19:42,184 --> 00:19:43,814
You were quiet up until then.

291
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,984
I said to him what if something happened to the village elders...

292
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,383
- Then... - And?

293
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:50,854
The chairman said who cares about old people...

294
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:52,064
who already lived full lives.

295
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,423
Do you mean to tell me he said that?

296
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:57,090
I thought to myself, "Isn't this murder?"

297
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:58,959
Murder.

298
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:03,430
It seems you were only looking at me the whole time.

299
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,539
- No, I wasn't. - Did I say it was intentional?

300
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,943
- No, you didn't but... - Then what's the problem?

301
00:20:10,944 --> 00:20:13,245
Because of him, the defendant changed his statement...

302
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,383
and admitted professional negligence.

303
00:20:14,384 --> 00:20:16,009
Then it turned out well.

304
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,623
Is it okay if the result is good?

305
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:19,953
Do we need to go through the process righteously?

306
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:22,489
Of course. All trials need to be based on constitutionalism.

307
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:25,420
Constitutionalism? Judge Kim.

308
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,190
Do we conduct trials to serve justice?

309
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:29,959
Is there another reason?

310
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:33,299
It's like playing a game.

311
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,469
And if you can't prove anything, you lose the game.

312
00:20:35,805 --> 00:20:37,799
It's not a fair game from the start.

313
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:40,574
They fabricate, hide things, and buy out investigators.

314
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,670
Men with power would do anything to get away.

315
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,173
And on the other side,

316
00:20:44,174 --> 00:20:46,979
there are people who are mourning with anger.

317
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,754
When you don't even have any evidence,

318
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:52,054
how could you accuse a patriotic businessman of murder?

319
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:53,554
In this economic crisis,

320
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:56,590
do you know how many people's lives rely on my company?

321
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,559
I know it's sad but there's no justice in reality.

322
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:03,630
There's only a game.

323
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:05,860
A dreadful unjust game.

(Live Court Show)

325

(Recording)

326
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:27,580
He looks just like him.

327
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:31,489
He looks exactly like him.

328
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:39,130
Ga On.

329
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:41,630
It's okay. I can talk.

330
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,330
You want to see me?

331
00:21:47,045 --> 00:21:48,640
I'm kind of busy.

332
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:52,713
No, you don't have to do that.

333
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,809
I'll spare some time for you.

334
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,410
Okay.

335
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:02,920
Are you going out on a date?

336
00:22:04,495 --> 00:22:06,620
Please be quiet.

337
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:08,690
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,069
Have you met the doctor?

339
00:22:16,605 --> 00:22:19,499
Well done. I'll meet the lawyer when he's out.

340
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,713
So this is why you wanted to see me.

341
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:24,809
Yes.

342
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,244
Are you going undercover tonight?

343
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,880
Yes, I'm going to catch a nasty jerk. Why do you ask?

344
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,180
You look nice.

345
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:35,180
I always look nice.

346
00:22:35,724 --> 00:22:38,254
I got it. So your ex was cheating on you with a guy.

347
00:22:38,255 --> 00:22:40,420
And it turned out that guy was Chief Kang, right?

348
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:42,534
Gosh, you have a bad taste in women.

349
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,633
It's a strange way to interpret it.

350
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:45,663
Well, that's what you said.

351
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,933
It's pathetic to eavesdrop on someone else's call.

352
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,999
I told you I have a reason to suspect him.

353
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:53,044
Anyway, nothing seemed strange to you?

354
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:55,200
I mean about the plant manager who was at the trial as a witness.

355
00:22:57,815 --> 00:22:59,883
You interrogate suspects all the time.

Well, sometimes...

359
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:09,423
people just feel guilty so they try to be honest.

360
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:10,920
Come on. Are you kidding me?

361
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,559
He confessed so that he can live.

362
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:16,989
Why are you asking when you know this?

363
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:22,400
What if the doctor Chief Kang is talking about is that witness?

364
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:27,640
Are you suggesting that your chief manipulated the witness?

365
00:23:27,904 --> 00:23:30,809
I'm not sure. He would do such a thing.

366
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:34,610
Hey. He's a national hero now.

367
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,580
He's the nation's judge.

368
00:23:37,954 --> 00:23:40,450
Don't say that somewhere else. You'll get stabbed.

369
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:56,729
Darn it. They're in my way.

370
00:24:03,515 --> 00:24:05,069
(Share love and hope.)

371
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:07,940
- Thank you. - Keep up the good work.

372
00:24:08,684 --> 00:24:10,954
Your warm helping hand can become...

373
00:24:10,954 --> 00:24:12,525
the hope to many people.

374
00:24:12,525 --> 00:24:14,384
You keep doing things that Ji Hyun hates...

375
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:17,049
which is why he keeps picking fights with you.

376
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,090
How many times is this?

377
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:25,289
Mom!

378
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,769
You should learn to yield when driving.

379
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:43,180
Hey! Drive properly!

380
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:44,880
Are you okay?

381
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,150
I've seen that car before!

382
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:49,954
Why are you getting in my way while driving?

383
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:51,150
That jerk.

384
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,819
Hey! You crazy idiot!

385
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,059
Hey!

386
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,269
Be careful!

387
00:25:37,275 --> 00:25:38,430
A little bit faster.

388
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:45,209
- I think we're going to lose him. - How can we catch up to that?

389
00:26:11,704 --> 00:26:12,900
What is that?

390
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,380
What is that?

391
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,979
What is going on?

392
00:26:25,855 --> 00:26:27,180
That crazy idiot.

393
00:27:39,795 --> 00:27:41,390
That crazy idiot.

394
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:46,160
Hey, you crazy idiot!

395
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:47,900
Get lost!

396
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,319
Darn it!

397
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,340
Hey, you crazy idiot!

398
00:28:59,374 --> 00:29:01,039
Do you have a death wish?

399
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,539
- There they are. Stop over here. - Hey.

400
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,739
Do you want to die?

401
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,509
He's a complete lunatic.

402
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:11,680
Hey. Get over here! You lunatic.

403
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,950
Hey.

404
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:17,120
Who are you? Hey.

405
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,120
- Hey! - Isn't that him?

406
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:21,765
- Kang Yo Han? - What are you doing?

407
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:23,459
- Yes. - Hey!

408
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,499
You punk. You're a complete lunatic.

409
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:28,660
What are you doing right now?

410
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:43,950
What are you doing?

411
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:46,620
What are you doing, you punk?

412
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,153
Don't come near me.

413
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,950
Don't come close!

414
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,850
Put that down.

415
00:29:52,095 --> 00:29:54,160
Don't come near me. Hey!

416
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:57,930
You punk. Who are you?

417
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:01,459
Hey.

418
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,430
Hey.

419
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:20,719
What is he doing?

420
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:33,830
Aren't you that judge that's on TV?

421
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,469
Why are you doing this to me?

422
00:30:36,874 --> 00:30:38,330
Because you're annoying me.

423
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,940
Gosh. You punk.

424
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:47,640
You're nothing but a judge. How dare you?

425
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:49,450
Do you know who I am?

426
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,779
Just wait. I won't let this go.

427
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:53,880
Wait right there.

428
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:01,059
Hey. That's...

429
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:03,464
This isn't mine.

430
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:05,130
Where did you find that? It's not mine.

431
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:08,660
What's important is that I found this in your car.

432
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:10,370
This has your fingerprints on it.

433
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,630
I'll take this with me.

434
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:16,269
Also, if you don't have the money, just ride the subway.

435
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,325
What is this?

436
00:31:26,325 --> 00:31:28,620
(Public transportation card)

437
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:33,519
Hey.

438
00:31:34,694 --> 00:31:35,959
Hey!

439
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:41,900
You...

440
00:31:42,005 --> 00:31:44,370
Hey. Hey!

441
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:46,400
Darn it!

442
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,650
What did I just see?

443
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,580
Do you believe in what I said now?

444
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,039
Hey.

445
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:27,440
Did you stay up all night?

446
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,779
If you're not good enough, you need to try your best.

447
00:32:30,414 --> 00:32:32,110
What are you saying?

448
00:32:32,485 --> 00:32:34,019
I know that...

449
00:32:34,154 --> 00:32:35,719
I was chosen for my looks.

450
00:32:36,325 --> 00:32:38,890
But people have expectations from me.

451
00:32:38,954 --> 00:32:41,890
I really want to do a good job.

452
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:50,575
- Hello? - Hey, I'm checking that witness.

453
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,130
- Mr. Jang Ki Young. - Why?

454
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,304
"Why"?

455
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,940
We should check the details of his testimony to see if anything's off.

456
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:57,969
This is none of your business. I'll take care of it.

457
00:32:58,075 --> 00:33:00,410
You're being so cold again.

458
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:03,380
I'm the Regional Investigation Unit ace, Yoon Soo Hyun.

459
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:07,519
I won't stand by and watch a judge cheat.

460
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:11,520
Kang Yo Han got on the radar of the wrong person.

461
00:33:14,695 --> 00:33:15,790
Hello.

462
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:18,194
Who are you?

463
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:20,763
I'm Lieutenant Yoon Soo Hyun, Regional Investigation Unit.

464
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:22,834
Did you come to help me find a job...

465
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,730
because I lost mine blowing the whistle?

466
00:33:25,105 --> 00:33:27,174
- Pardon? - If not, please leave.

467
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:30,069
My family might starve because I had a conscience.

468
00:33:31,215 --> 00:33:32,640
Excuse me. Mr. Jang.

469
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:49,390
She went to talk to Jang Ki Young.

470
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,029
As you thought.

471
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,060
Kim Ga On came to see me.

472
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:57,830
He said he suspected Jang Ki Young.

473
00:33:59,474 --> 00:34:01,299
But then, he would.

474
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:04,815
Who'd think there'd be such a courageous witness...

475
00:34:04,815 --> 00:34:06,214
in this day and age?

476
00:34:06,215 --> 00:34:09,239
(Associate Judge Kim Ga On)

477
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:15,379
I was very surprised.

478
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:19,890
The water?

479
00:34:20,295 --> 00:34:23,390
Yes. There was definitely something in the water.

480
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,464
I coughed like crazy and felt dizzy.

481
00:34:25,465 --> 00:34:27,604
I almost caused a car crash.

482
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:30,299
But you're just fine now?

483
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,504
I made a full recovery after a while.

484
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,114
I even had some blood drawn and tested, just in case.

485
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,469
Nothing showed up.

486
00:34:37,545 --> 00:34:38,574
(Professor Yu Jong Baek)

487
00:34:38,574 --> 00:34:40,739
Something was really off.

488
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:44,450
Different witnesses can have different stances.

489
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,779
It's not a huge problem.

490
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:49,719
It was Joo Il Do who threw in the towel out of fear.

491
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:52,790
I must do something...

492
00:34:53,164 --> 00:34:55,960
in this grossly unfair game.

Okay. Good job, Soo Hyun.

495
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,359
Hey. What's that?

496
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:32,763
It's to thank you for seeing the witnesses.

497
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:34,304
That's not like you to prepare that.

498
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,270
Isn't it usually a jjigae or stir-fried pork?

499
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,643
- Leave it, then. - No, no. The coffee smells great.

Ask me five more times.

503
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,140
- Who will you marry? - It's getting cold.

504
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:50,049
Okay, fine.

505
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,719
Still, something's not right.

506
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,180
I should look into them a bit more.

507
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,154
I'm looking up all I can find.

508
00:35:59,155 --> 00:36:01,089
- Soo Hyun. - What?

509
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:08,600
A while ago, I met some people by chance.

510
00:36:09,335 --> 00:36:11,930
They all grabbed both my hands.

511
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:14,640
They thanked me for the trial.

512
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,270
They're happy they found someone they can trust.

513
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,279
So?

514
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:24,509
That doesn't mean a judge can act out like Kang Yo Han.

515
00:36:24,655 --> 00:36:27,750
What you heard and saw are weird enough.

516
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:29,919
He broke the rules.

517
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,049
That's also a crime.

518
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,689
Yes. You're right.

519
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:41,004
Tell me if you find something.

520
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:42,100
Sure.

- Why? - Why else?

526
00:36:55,144 --> 00:36:57,480
You fought so hard to get to where you are.

527
00:36:57,755 --> 00:37:00,879
You owe your life and career to Professor Min, that is true.

528
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,750
But I think he gave you too big a task.

529
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,120
A wiretapping judge who does background checks?

530
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,319
That's bad.

531
00:37:08,565 --> 00:37:11,330
It's not all because of Professor Min.

532
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:13,200
Even so.

533
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:44,460
Is this...

00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,060
your best effort?

535
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,430
Pardon?

536
00:37:48,605 --> 00:37:51,600
We scouted their head chefs despite the threat of a lawsuit...

537
00:37:52,835 --> 00:37:54,774
So despite the threat of a lawsuit,

538
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:58,410
you hired important people and all you could make...

539
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,214
- is this? - I'm sorry, sir.

540
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:01,580
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

541
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:04,310
It doesn't taste the same.

542
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,379
The taste of their dessert!

543
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:09,893
Why can't I get the exact recipe when I'm spending my own money?

544
00:38:09,894 --> 00:38:12,524
Do you think we'll become the market leader?

545
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:15,263
Our opinion is that we copied it almost completely.

546
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:18,230
What did you say? "Almost"?

547
00:38:18,434 --> 00:38:23,060
How many times must I tell you the devil's in the details?

548
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:25,270
Darn you.

549
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,910
Come in. Get it.

550
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,939
Darn it.

551
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:36,609
- Eat. - Pardon?

552
00:38:36,985 --> 00:38:38,810
Eat it.

553
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,783
Eat what your team made.

554
00:38:40,784 --> 00:38:42,223
Who else can eat it?

555
00:38:42,224 --> 00:38:45,549
As you know, Director Yoon has diabetes...

556
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,089
You have diabetes?

557
00:38:51,965 --> 00:38:53,404
Then quit.

558
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:55,464
Quit and starve to death.

559
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:57,529
No, sir. I'll eat.

560
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:14,279
Eat it all up.

561
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:17,049
Darn you all!

562
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,020
I hate you.

563
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:31,700
That darn judge is giving me a headache.

564
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:34,799
I'm surrounded by morons.

565
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:08,770
This isn't mine.

566
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:16,680
- Yes, sir. - Hey.

567
00:40:17,355 --> 00:40:19,214
Where's my mom?

568
00:40:19,215 --> 00:40:21,319
She stepped out.

569
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:32,060
I can't go to my mom about this.

570
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,399
Darn!

571
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:38,629
That crazy...

572
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,815
That crazy...

573
00:40:43,815 --> 00:40:45,739
She's good for nothing.

574
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:49,210
Why do you keep hitting her?

575
00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:51,254
She should make what I can drink.

576
00:40:51,255 --> 00:40:53,250
This is like raw sewage.

577
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,149
Hey!

578
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,620
Yes, sir.

579
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:01,189
Come closer.

580
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:05,029
Come closer. Come on, closer.

581
00:41:05,135 --> 00:41:07,734
Make something I can drink.

582
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,834
- How do you train your staff? - I'm sorry, sir.

583
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,834
She ran off because I tried to lecture her.

584
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:14,743
Is it that easy to make a living?

585
00:41:14,744 --> 00:41:17,174
No, sir. I'll get another bartender right away.

586
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,469
Leave it.

587
00:41:19,045 --> 00:41:21,609
You can drink all this.

588
00:41:22,385 --> 00:41:24,149
I lost my appetite for drinks.

589
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,480
Move.

590
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,750
- Goodbye, sir. - Also,

591
00:41:29,124 --> 00:41:31,189
fire that girl.

592
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,350
Yes, sir.

593
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:34,460
Where are you going?

594
00:41:36,835 --> 00:41:38,694
Manager. I apologize.

595
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,200
It's fine.

596
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,689
Darn it. This is so annoying.

597
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,439
Roll down your window.

598
00:42:22,905 --> 00:42:24,009
Hey.

599
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:29,580
Where's your public transport card?

600
00:42:32,414 --> 00:42:34,819
Are you following me around?

601
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:36,989
I wonder.

602
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,694
You must think I'm your prey.

603
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,930
I'm not that easy to catch.

604
00:42:46,034 --> 00:42:47,734
Touch me and I will fight back.

605
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:51,169
So let's not meet again, okay?

606
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:54,169
Let's not meet.

607
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:57,770
Darn it.

608
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,750
Darn that psycho.

609
00:43:12,324 --> 00:43:13,589
"Prey"?

610
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,319
You're just bait.

611
00:43:17,565 --> 00:43:18,930
Fresh bait.

612
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:27,540
That's strange.

613
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:30,439
What's wrong?

614
00:43:30,914 --> 00:43:34,184
I thought our next case was an economic crime case,

615
00:43:34,184 --> 00:43:37,109
but Chief transferred that case to a regular court.

616
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,250
He wants this case instead.

617
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,219
After I pulled an all-nighter to go over that complicated case.

618
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:45,020
What's the case about?

619
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:46,419
This case...

620
00:43:48,394 --> 00:43:50,930
will result in a fine of 1,000 dollars, at best.

621
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,589
Just 1,000 dollars?

622
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:56,675
Yes. The prosecution requested a summary order.

623
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,500
A young guy got drunk and beat up some people.

624
00:43:58,505 --> 00:44:00,074
The victim couldn't even get a diagnosis.

625
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,739
It's a simple assault case.

626
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:05,169
Who's the offender? Can I have a look?

627
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:09,310
A 28-year-old unemployed man.

628
00:44:09,784 --> 00:44:11,250
Nothing really stands out.

629
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:15,350
That's why the prosecution requested a summary order right away.

630
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:16,755
I wonder...

631
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:20,120
why Chief is interested in this specific case.

632
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:23,020
This is a little odd. Have a look.

633
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:27,029
He's a first-time offender, but he's been questioned many times.

634
00:44:27,405 --> 00:44:29,005
Every time he got in trouble,

635
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:30,700
he must've settled with the victims.

636
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:32,299
You're right.

637
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,739
He's a simple assault expert.

638
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,410
He must have some delicate fists.

639
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:40,779
How could he stop just before the injury got too serious?

640
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,980
Let's see here.

641
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:49,620
This time, he didn't settle.

642
00:44:51,324 --> 00:44:53,250
He probably couldn't.

643
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:56,319
- What? - Maybe the victim was out of reach?

644
00:44:57,365 --> 00:44:59,759
Come to think of it, it's strange that he's unemployed.

645
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:02,700
It must've cost him a fortune to settle with all these people.

646
00:45:02,764 --> 00:45:03,969
You're right.

647
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:07,100
Then again, if the police were letting him off the hook...

648
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:09,899
They wouldn't have written down his real occupation.

649
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:12,640
Exactly.

650
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,640
Still, it's just a simple assault case.

651
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:18,879
As the live court judges, we have our pride.

652
00:45:18,954 --> 00:45:21,350
Should we really be handling a case like this?

653
00:45:21,824 --> 00:45:23,419
- We shouldn't. - Exactly.

654
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,594
(Associate Judge Oh Jin Joo)

655
00:45:25,594 --> 00:45:26,989
I'm disappointed in Chief.

656
00:45:27,664 --> 00:45:29,663
He must be the timid type.

657
00:45:29,664 --> 00:45:33,489
After just one case, how could he...

658
00:45:33,735 --> 00:45:35,600
Excuse me.

659
00:45:35,905 --> 00:45:37,270
I have to take this one.

660
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:42,739
You found what?

661
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:45,310
- Traces of Kang Yo Han. - What do you mean?

662
00:45:45,374 --> 00:45:46,710
Didn't I tell you?

663
00:45:46,784 --> 00:45:48,710
The process is too complicated.

664
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:52,379
I've checked all news articles about Kang Yo Han,

665
00:45:52,514 --> 00:45:54,424
and all the comments are praising me...

666
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:55,750
like he's some cult leader.

667
00:45:55,824 --> 00:46:00,049
But I found a rather odd comment in one online community.

668
00:46:00,764 --> 00:46:02,564
The person claims to know Kang Yo Han well.

669
00:46:02,565 --> 00:46:05,529
I messaged the person and got the phone number.

670
00:46:05,565 --> 00:46:06,759
What does the comment say?

671
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:09,029
"Kang Yo Han is..."

672
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:12,175
"the devil."

673
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:15,169
(Kang Yo Han is the devil.)

674
00:46:28,184 --> 00:46:30,549
Judge Kim. What are you doing here?

675
00:46:33,255 --> 00:46:34,489
Chief wants to see us.

676
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,100
- Come in. - Chief, did you want to see us?

677
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,434
Oh, my. Hello, Judges.

678
00:46:46,434 --> 00:46:47,644
Hello, sir.

679
00:46:47,644 --> 00:46:51,215
It's been chaos since the show.

680
00:46:51,215 --> 00:46:52,215
Why?

681
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:54,379
Chief Kang was a celebrity even before the show,

682
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,879
but you two are the talk of the town now.

683
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,655
- Us two? - Yes.

684
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:02,419
When the verdict was delivered,

685
00:47:02,425 --> 00:47:05,649
your eyes turned slightly red, and you wiped them.

686
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:07,525
That was so beautiful to watch.

687
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:11,160
All the comments are saying you're such a humane judge.

688
00:47:11,264 --> 00:47:13,034
They got that on camera?

689
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:14,865
I tried to hide my tears because I was worried...

690
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,135
people would criticize me.

691
00:47:16,135 --> 00:47:18,969
See? You're a natural. You understand TV.

692
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,000
What brings you here?

693
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,644
Judge Kim doesn't disappoint.

694
00:47:23,644 --> 00:47:26,014
"The textbook example of a stuck-up, good-looking guy."

695
00:47:26,014 --> 00:47:28,580
- All the girls are... - What brings you here?

696
00:47:28,585 --> 00:47:29,910
He'd like to invite us.

697
00:47:30,385 --> 00:47:32,410
Invite us? To what?

698
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:39,255
Our show and Social Responsibility Foundation...

699
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:41,390
are co-hosting a charity fashion show.

700
00:47:41,494 --> 00:47:42,594
- A fashion show? - Yes.

701
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:46,264
All the members of the foundation have donated millions of dollars.

702
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,405
I know that.

703
00:47:47,405 --> 00:47:50,259
The chairman of the board is famous.

704
00:47:50,275 --> 00:47:53,270
- Is he a philosopher? - He's the nation's advisor.

705
00:47:53,744 --> 00:47:55,040
I have to say no.

706
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,870
Why would a judge go to a place like that?

707
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:03,014
You know what the atmosphere in society has been like lately.

708
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,049
We need events that give hope to the people.

709
00:48:07,324 --> 00:48:09,219
If the three of you participate,

710
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:11,695
it'll really cheer up the viewers.

711
00:48:11,695 --> 00:48:14,719
If it's such a meaningful event, I'd love to attend.

712
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,989
But what should I wear?

713
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:19,964
I don't have any fancy clothes.

714
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,460
I can take care of that.

715
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,770
- You will? - If that's okay.

716
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:28,169
That'd be great.

717
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,299
What about you, Judge Kim?

718
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:32,310
Come on, let's go.

719
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:37,009
I'm fine. I have a lot to do.

720
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,450
All right. Suit yourself.

721
00:48:53,654 --> 00:48:55,659
I feel like Cinderella.

722
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:59,358
Even celebrities rarely get to wear dresses from this brand.

723
00:48:59,493 --> 00:49:00,959
I appreciate it.

724
00:49:00,964 --> 00:49:03,604
I'll make sure to return it clean.

725
00:49:03,604 --> 00:49:04,829
There's no need.

726
00:49:05,073 --> 00:49:07,028
- Pardon? - There's no need to return it.

727
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:09,539
But this is super expensive.

728
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:11,639
There's no one who can wear it anyway.

729
00:49:12,314 --> 00:49:13,508
You can keep it.

730
00:49:14,513 --> 00:49:16,079
Still, I couldn't...

731
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:18,349
- Throw it away if you want. - What?

732
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:23,953
Bringing light to the darkness.

733
00:49:23,953 --> 00:49:27,559
Welcome to a charity fashion show...

734
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,993
co-hosted by Saram Media Group and Social Responsibility Foundation.

735
00:49:30,993 --> 00:49:35,059
Many honored guests are arriving.

736
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:42,398
I see over there...

737
00:49:42,404 --> 00:49:44,309
a man the entire nation is talking about.

738
00:49:44,343 --> 00:49:47,143
Judge Kang Yo Han of the live court...

739
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:48,738
just arrived.

740
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:55,579
- Are you okay? - Yes.

741
00:49:56,524 --> 00:49:57,718
Judge Kang Yo Han is here!

742
00:49:59,694 --> 00:50:01,119
Judge Kang, please look over here!

743
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:02,789
Look over here!

744
00:50:02,993 --> 00:50:04,533
- Judge Kang, you look great! - Can you look over here?

745
00:50:04,533 --> 00:50:06,329
- Can you give us a comment? - Please wave at the camera.

746
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:07,999
- Judge Kang! - Please look over here!

747
00:50:12,774 --> 00:50:16,444
The two star judges of the live court just arrived.

748
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:17,869
Can we talk for a moment?

749
00:50:18,174 --> 00:50:20,938
Judge Oh, you look...

750
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,309
like a different person today.

751
00:50:24,053 --> 00:50:26,683
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to be here.

752
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:28,418
Can you strike a pose?

753
00:50:31,323 --> 00:50:33,119
Please look at this camera too!

754
00:50:33,123 --> 00:50:34,993
She seems so comfortable.

755
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:37,758
I don't think I have to worry about Judge Oh.

756
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:39,864
Let me ask Judge Kang a question.

757
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:42,364
The public is showing strong trust in you...

758
00:50:42,364 --> 00:50:43,604
and is watching you closely.

759
00:50:43,604 --> 00:50:46,099
Can you say something to the public?

760
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:48,269
I appreciate your support and encouragement.

761
00:50:48,544 --> 00:50:51,869
I do understand where your enthusiastic support comes from.

762
00:50:52,143 --> 00:50:53,738
No matter what obstacles come in my way,

763
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:57,682
I'll keep on fighting for a just society...

764
00:50:57,683 --> 00:50:59,148
with my life on the line.

765
00:50:59,584 --> 00:51:02,249
Thank you, Judge Kang.

766
00:51:28,944 --> 00:51:30,513
Have a look around.

767
00:51:30,513 --> 00:51:32,583
- I have to greet some people. - Hello, Judge Kang.

768
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:33,749
Hello.

769
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:36,878
Welcome.

770
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:39,754
I'm Jung Sun Ah of Social Responsibility Foundation.

771
00:51:39,754 --> 00:51:41,424
Hello.

772
00:51:41,424 --> 00:51:43,418
Thank you so much for coming.

773
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:46,758
You look gorgeous today.

774
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:48,959
You flatter me.

775
00:51:49,004 --> 00:51:50,234
I'm embarrassed.

776
00:51:50,234 --> 00:51:52,628
In the live court show,

777
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,838
you shined more brightly than anyone.

778
00:51:57,143 --> 00:51:58,369
No way.

779
00:51:59,814 --> 00:52:01,809
Let me introduce you to our chairman.

780
00:52:06,384 --> 00:52:07,584
Ms. Jung.

781
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:10,823
This is Judge Oh Jin Joo of the live court.

782
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:12,349
This is Chairman Seo Jeong Hak.

783
00:52:12,354 --> 00:52:15,088
Hello. It's an honor to meet you.

784
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:21,229
You're quite the beautiful woman.

785
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:24,798
- She's a judge. - I saw that trial as well.

786
00:52:25,033 --> 00:52:27,099
During turbulent times,

787
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:29,372
the legal system inevitably rises in power.

788
00:52:29,373 --> 00:52:30,938
But it's only temporary.

789
00:52:31,343 --> 00:52:34,642
In the end, everything that's a mess must return to its place...

790
00:52:34,643 --> 00:52:37,139
for public sentiment to get domesticated.

791
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,849
Right. I'll bear that in mind, sir.

792
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:43,418
I think you'll do a good job.

793
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,809
Yo Han was very different from the other students.

794
00:53:05,774 --> 00:53:07,539
From the first day he came to the school.

795
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:10,438
How was he different?

796
00:53:11,953 --> 00:53:15,048
(Kang Yo Han)

797
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:19,889
He had a dark expression on his face,

798
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,289
and he didn't speak much.

799
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,128
Can you introduce yourself?

800
00:53:26,334 --> 00:53:28,699
I'm sure your friends want to know more about you.

801
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:30,499
(Kang Yo Han)

802
00:53:35,703 --> 00:53:38,608
Okay then. Who wants to be his partner?

803
00:53:38,614 --> 00:53:41,008
(Kang Yo Han)

804
00:53:45,584 --> 00:53:47,878
Sae In. Do you want to be his partner?

805
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,048
Okay, sure. I'd like that.

806
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:57,023
We're going to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.

807
00:53:57,024 --> 00:53:59,659
Don't joke around and take notes.

808
00:53:59,933 --> 00:54:01,199
First.

809
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:04,003
The width plus the width...

810
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:06,773
plus the height plus the height.

811
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:08,443
- Second. - It's a bird!

812
00:54:08,444 --> 00:54:10,369
Add... Stop.

813
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:12,369
Kids. Calm down!

814
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:16,738
Get out!

815
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:20,682
- Get it! - Kids, be quiet!

816
00:54:20,683 --> 00:54:21,778
Get it!

817
00:54:22,723 --> 00:54:24,218
Be quiet. Sit down.

818
00:54:26,354 --> 00:54:27,459
Kids!

819
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,103
Are you crazy? Why would you kill it?

820
00:54:35,104 --> 00:54:37,572
We were trying to get it out alive!

821
00:54:37,573 --> 00:54:40,403
- Are you crazy? Why'd you kill it? - What did you just do?

822
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:43,903
- How could you do that? - Why did you kill it?

823
00:54:43,904 --> 00:54:47,072
- That's insane! - What did he just do?

824
00:54:47,073 --> 00:54:48,209
He's a monster.

825
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:56,949
From that day, the kids called Yo Han a monster.

826
00:54:57,493 --> 00:54:58,918
They didn't talk to him either.

827
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,119
You could say they treated him like he was invisible.

828
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:08,858
I see.

829
00:55:10,334 --> 00:55:13,099
Is that why you left that comment? That he's the devil?

830
00:55:13,473 --> 00:55:17,568
No. That was nothing compared to...

831
00:55:17,743 --> 00:55:19,309
what would happen next.

832
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:23,013
Back then, our school was divide by kids...

833
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:25,278
from the upper neighborhood and kids from the lower neighborhood.

834
00:55:25,814 --> 00:55:27,619
The kids from the upper neighborhood were rich,

835
00:55:27,823 --> 00:55:29,679
and the kids from the lower neighborhood were poor.

836
00:55:30,924 --> 00:55:32,619
But they had one thing in common.

837
00:55:32,924 --> 00:55:35,722
They all treated Yo Han like a monster.

838
00:55:35,723 --> 00:55:37,789
- Shoot him in the head. - Should I?

839
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,729
Shoot him in the head.

840
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:42,229
- What is that? - Guys.

841
00:55:44,104 --> 00:55:47,028
- Hey. Shoot him in the eye next. - The next target.

842
00:55:49,904 --> 00:55:51,309
Nice!

843
00:55:55,614 --> 00:55:58,209
- Did you just see his face? - He's so mad.

844
00:55:58,884 --> 00:55:59,979
Right.

845
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:02,878
- Kang Yo Han looks really mad. - He is so mad.

846
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:10,289
Minister Cha.

847
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,833
Congratulations Judge Kang.

848
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:16,063
Thank you for coming.

849
00:56:16,064 --> 00:56:19,032
You showed that justice is still alive in this nation.

850
00:56:19,033 --> 00:56:20,898
You are incredible.

851
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,139
Thank you.

852
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:25,912
- I was a bit surprised though. - Thank you.

853
00:56:25,913 --> 00:56:27,979
Could you pose for the cameras?

854
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:34,878
Do you plan to do that again?

855
00:56:35,823 --> 00:56:37,179
No way.

856
00:56:38,154 --> 00:56:39,749
- Please look over here. - Of course.

857
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:43,389
Ladies and gentlemen.

858
00:56:43,964 --> 00:56:48,028
We have a special event tonight.

859
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,039
I believe it's starting.

860
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:03,813
Enjoy yourself.

861
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:05,353
Of course. I'll see you later.

862
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:06,449
I'll see you later.

863
00:57:09,924 --> 00:57:11,423
You must get rid of your greed,

864
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:12,992
and be compassionate...

865
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:15,392
It's been a while, Mr. Seo.

866
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:16,619
Excuse me.

867
00:57:41,354 --> 00:57:44,648
Place your hand in mine like this, and have your thumb rest here.

868
00:57:44,823 --> 00:57:46,148
Place your left hand...

869
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:47,988
Like this.

870
00:57:48,564 --> 00:57:49,659
Let's dance.

871
00:57:58,073 --> 00:57:59,168
You're good.

872
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:04,769
May I cut in?

873
00:58:06,944 --> 00:58:08,108
Ms. Jung.

874
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:42,409
Then one day,

875
00:58:43,283 --> 00:58:44,749
that incident began to happen.

876
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,749
Where did it go?

877
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,659
Did you see my pencil case?

878
00:58:55,763 --> 00:58:57,019
I didn't see it.

879
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,863
My dad bought it for me in the States.

880
00:58:59,864 --> 00:59:01,528
Where did it go?

881
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:06,298
At first, we just let it go.

882
00:59:06,634 --> 00:59:07,738
The source of trouble was...

883
00:59:08,573 --> 00:59:10,343
that many of the kids from the upper neighborhood...

884
00:59:10,343 --> 00:59:12,572
were partnered up with the kids from the lower neighborhood.

885
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:14,909
The teacher intended it as a means for them to get along.

886
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:19,179
What are you looking at?

887
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:25,349
Why are you looking at me?

888
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:30,758
- Why are you crying? - But...

889
00:59:31,064 --> 00:59:32,693
the belongings of kids from the upper neighborhood...

890
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,533
who sat with kids from the lower neighborhood...

891
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,432
began disappearing one at a time.

892
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:38,599
Oh, right. I bought new shoes.

893
00:59:41,303 --> 00:59:42,398
Ta-da.

894
00:59:44,303 --> 00:59:45,468
It's ripped.

895
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,209
Darn it.

896
00:59:54,484 --> 00:59:56,322
Hey. You ripped it, didn't you?

897
00:59:56,323 --> 00:59:58,523
- It wasn't me. - Stop lying.

898
00:59:58,524 --> 01:00:00,019
It really wasn't me!

899
01:00:00,024 --> 01:00:01,662
You're his partner!

900
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,722
Just because I'm his partner, it doesn't mean I ripped it.

901
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:06,389
Ultimately, that day came.

902
01:00:07,464 --> 01:00:10,358
I enjoyed the first trial.

903
01:00:12,774 --> 01:00:13,999
Was it fun?

904
01:00:14,004 --> 01:00:16,099
What do you mean by fun?

905
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:17,938
The genre is different.

906
01:00:18,373 --> 01:00:21,438
It was moving. I even teared up.

907
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:25,278
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Ms. Jung.

908
01:00:30,183 --> 01:00:31,648
But here's the thing.

909
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:35,059
The sponsors of the foundation hate...

910
01:00:35,123 --> 01:00:36,659
unexpected twists the most.

911
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:46,929
That's how old men are.

912
01:00:47,843 --> 01:00:51,472
They like the obvious and the predictable.

913
01:00:51,473 --> 01:00:53,342
The more they have, the more they feel this way.

914
01:00:53,343 --> 01:00:57,409
It's hard to satisfy everyone's preferences.

915
01:01:06,154 --> 01:01:09,258
Men who enjoy things alone aren't charming.

916
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:13,429
They're not useful either.

917
01:01:20,234 --> 01:01:21,438
That's unfortunate.

918
01:01:22,544 --> 01:01:23,869
I'm having...

919
01:01:24,944 --> 01:01:26,738
a lot of fun right now.

920
01:01:28,444 --> 01:01:31,378
Where is it? Where's my game console?

921
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:35,423
Why are you looking at me?

922
01:01:35,424 --> 01:01:37,353
Hey. Let me look in your bag.

923
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:38,519
Why?

924
01:01:38,794 --> 01:01:40,218
Let me look in it.

925
01:01:40,553 --> 01:01:42,822
Give it to me. Give it to me!

926
01:01:42,823 --> 01:01:45,258
- Give it to me! - Let go!

927
01:01:47,493 --> 01:01:49,798
No. It wasn't me. It really wasn't me.

928
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:54,103
This is why I didn't want to be partners with a poor kid.

929
01:01:54,104 --> 01:01:56,842
What? You punk. You put it in there, right?

930
01:01:56,843 --> 01:01:58,872
- Let me look in your back! - Give it back!

931
01:01:58,873 --> 01:02:01,313
- Let me look in there. - Stop it!

932
01:02:01,314 --> 01:02:02,878
Give me back my stuff!

933
01:02:32,843 --> 01:02:34,068
Judge Kang.

934
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:44,119
I brought my family today. I'd like you to say hello.

935
01:02:44,183 --> 01:02:45,918
- Honey? - What?

936
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:49,688
Oh, my gosh. Judge Kang.

937
01:02:49,823 --> 01:02:51,789
Hello, Mr. Lee.

938
01:02:52,864 --> 01:02:55,798
Hey, son. Young Hoon. Young Hoon.

939
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,199
Come and say hello.

940
01:03:02,604 --> 01:03:03,938
What...

941
01:03:05,444 --> 01:03:08,179
You... What's going on?

942
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:12,579
Nice to meet you,

943
01:03:12,884 --> 01:03:14,309
Mr. Lee.

944
01:03:15,183 --> 01:03:16,349
What...

945
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:13,769
He was the devil.

946
01:04:34,763 --> 01:04:38,269
My late father was a loan shark.

947
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:41,999
He followed in his father's footsteps. Very mean.

948
01:04:42,904 --> 01:04:46,608
From that day, the kids called Yo Han a monster.

949
01:04:46,843 --> 01:04:50,039
What? You can't imagine being raised by such a person?

950
01:04:58,493 --> 01:04:59,718
Mr. Seo.

951
01:05:00,754 --> 01:05:02,059
Yes.

952
01:05:06,864 --> 01:05:09,628
He might not be tame enough.

953
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:31,488
Are you looking for this?

954
01:05:44,004 --> 01:05:45,369
You knew.

955
01:05:56,783 --> 01:05:58,648
Why are you doing this?

956
01:05:59,884 --> 01:06:01,979
Why am I doing this?

957
01:06:02,154 --> 01:06:03,349
Yes.

958
01:06:03,884 --> 01:06:06,048
- Because I can. - What?

959
01:06:06,794 --> 01:06:08,818
Possibility is like a drug.

960
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,028
Get down!

961
01:07:29,204 --> 01:07:34,268
(The Devil Judge)

962
01:07:55,904 --> 01:07:57,864
The only thing...

963
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:00,699
that can protect us is you, the public.

964
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:03,303
This was why.

965
01:08:03,303 --> 01:08:07,313
There are people who do not heed warnings only to regret later.

966
01:08:07,314 --> 01:08:09,143
The painting on the wall blew up.

967
01:08:09,143 --> 01:08:11,213
It was set in the painting from the start.

968
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,709
We must find it before the police do.

969
01:08:12,883 --> 01:08:15,249
I don't have any personal feelings.

970
01:08:15,253 --> 01:08:16,524
Go and tell him...

971
01:08:16,524 --> 01:08:17,923
he'd better come himself.

972
01:08:17,923 --> 01:08:20,688
I think we need to meet, Your Honor.

973
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:23,488
The person I suspect is Kang Yo Han.
