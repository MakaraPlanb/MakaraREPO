Coming.

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,520
Mr. Lin.

18
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:21,720
Uncle Duan, how are you doing?

19
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:23,919
Come in, please.

20
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,800
Mr. Lei.

21
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,360
How are you doing?

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Xiao Lin, there you are!

23
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,119
It seems you have just recovered.

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,960
Please do take care of yourself.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm getting old.

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,479
Without exercise,

27
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,759
I'm going to rust.

28
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,399
Xiao Lin.

29
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,360
You're so unexpected.

30
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,600
What can I do for you today?

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
I've been deeply concerned about you.

32
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,839
So I just stop by.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,600
I appreciate it. Thank you.

34
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:53,360
Here.

35
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,520
This club

36
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:55,800
is a global limited edition.

37
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,479
I especially

38
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,440
asked my friend
to send it from America.

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,960
Only the professional player like you

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
can recognize it.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
This is a little bit of my regard.

42
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,880
Please accept it.

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
A club.

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,479
Let me have a look.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
It's great.

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
What a good club!

47
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,080
Great！

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,639
As long as you like.

49
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
We're on the same boat.

50
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,199
Let's get this straight.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,080
No big deal actually.

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,000
It's for the
Entertainment Center project.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,000
Mr. Jiang always asks me

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,679
to help Mr. Lei
as much as possible.

55
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,279
It's just...

56
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,320
Just say it.

57
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,839
It's just
Mr. Lei has been busy recently.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,199
Besides, he is very prudent at work.

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,039
Our Letter of Content

60
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:46,759
has been provided long time ago,
but still no response.

61
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,880
The worst thing is
we can't find him recently.

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,520
Mr. Lei, you know that

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,279
opportunities don't wait.

64
00:03:57,399 --> 00:04:00,119
Xiao Lin,
your concern is highly appreciated.

65
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm telling you, Yuzheng is still young.

66
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,880
Please help him more in this project.

67
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,240
It's my duty to help Mr. Lei.

68
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,279
Xiaosu, have a seat please.

69
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,760
How great you are!

70
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,399
Teacher Sun,

71
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,880
the children have been studying
in such an environment?

72
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,559
There isn't even a reading lamp.

73
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
Yes.

74
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,519
Only one generator was bought
for the island last year.

75
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,040
So the children can only depend on it.

76
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,679
You still laugh!

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,160
The power is out again.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Hold on one second.
I'll go and find some candles.

79
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,279
Wait.

80
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
Where is the generator?

81
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,920
Why don't you show me?

82
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,119
Uncle Shao.

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,279
You're a doctor.

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
You can repair the generator?

85
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,000
Let me give it a try.

86
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,600
Uncle Shao, you're so capable!

87
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,480
Can you really repair a generator?

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,600
Why can't I?

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,279
Shine the flashlight inside.

90
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,320
I saw it.

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Did you see it?

92
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:53,799
Just like this one.

93
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,000
When I used to climb,

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,040
in the camp,

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,440
there were also old-style generators
like this.

96
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:11,880
I still remember

97
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,600
we ran into a storm at that time.

98
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,679
I and another teammate

99
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:18,959
were in charge of fixing this.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Done.

101
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,000
How is it?

102
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,799
Miss Xiaosu.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,160
You look down on me, don't you?

104
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,239
Xiao Shanwa.

105
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,160
Are you still blaming me
for sending your father away?

106
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,079
Actually, I'm not Dr. Shao.

107
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
I apologize to you.

108
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,600
Then, who are you?

109
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,720
I am Lei Yuzheng,

110
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,760
a friend of

111
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,480
Shao Zhenrong, Dr. Shao.

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,320
Dr. Shao has been to faraway places.

113
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,640
He asked me to come to see you.

114
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,720
But, don't worry, Shanwa,

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,239
I'll find the best doctor

116
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,679
for your father.

117
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,239
Really?

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,760
Sure.

119
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,839
If you don't believe me,

120
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,480
let's make a promise.

121
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,440
Ok.

122
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,760
Siqi!

123
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,280
Honey!

124
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,039
Here you are finally!

125
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,599
I've been waiting for hours.

126
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,520
My heart is dying.

127
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
Isn't the traffic terrible?

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Are you saying I'm late?

129
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,719
No.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
It's my greatest honor
to be waiting for you.

131
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,479
What happened?

132
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,039
You won the lottery?

133
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:10,479
Why are you so generous today?

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,840
Without winning the lottery,

135
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,359
can't I

136
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,559
just be romantic with my beloved woman?

137
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
Make sense.

138
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,239
But, He Qunfei,

139
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,799
I am warning you.

140
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,679
Don't mess around,

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,359
or I'll slap you to death!

142
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,039
What mess can I make?

143
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,000
I just wanna have dinner with you.

144
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,679
Really?

145
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,280
You have sweaty palms!

146
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,840
What are you nervous about?

147
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,640
Anything you failed me?

148
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm not nervous.

149
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,679
I'm just excited to meet you!

150
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,200
Excited?

151
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,559
It doesn't matter anyway.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,919
Today I'm not in mood

153
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,599
to talk nonsense with you.

154
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,119
Today,

155
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,520
I have something important
to talk with you.

156
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,559
I'm listening.

157
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,559
Do you have 100 thousand yuan?

158
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:00,520
50 thousand yuan is ok.

159
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,039
Why do you want so much money?

160
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:03,559
Anything happened to your family?

161
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,799
For God's sake!

162
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,320
Can't you wish me good?

163
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,880
Then what is the money for?

164
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
I'll leave out the details.

165
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,000
It won't be long

166
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,440
before I can count money in bed.

167
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,919
Wait a minute. Siqi.

168
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,280
We can't take advantage of nothing.

169
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,239
Besides, my mother once said,

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,080
there was no free meal.

171
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,640
Even though there is,
you can't compete with a dog.

172
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,599
What are you talking about?

173
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:28,840
Only 100 thousand yuan, lend it or not!

174
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,039
Come on. At least you should tell me

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
what do you want the money for?

176
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,159
Lend it or not? One word!

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,039
No. No. That's not what I mean.

178
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,280
I just wanna remind you

179
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,400
when Xiaosu made the down payment,

180
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,840
we offered our help
in every possible way.

181
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,599
And there are also daily expenses.

182
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm running out of money.

183
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,000
Look.

184
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,400
Look.

185
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,559
He Qunfei. Are you bluffing me?

186
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,559
This wine. This place. This service.

187
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,919
Which one of them is cheap?

188
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,280
I'm telling you!

189
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,880
I'll make this investment!

190
00:11:07,119 --> 00:11:08,599
You're in or not, I don't care!

191
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,640
Siqi, I can do something about it.

192
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,359
I didn't say no!

193
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
I'm telling you, He Qunfei,

194
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:15,479
you'd better think it over!

195
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,520
No dating before you figure it out!

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,400
Siqi!

197
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,520
Hello. Welcome!

198
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,919
How much is such a beautiful ring?

199
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,280
This ring is so expensive!

200
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,440
So beautiful!

201
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,200
Shall we try it on?

202
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,200
No.

203
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,159
If I'm wearing it,

204
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,119
I'm not willing to take it off.

205
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,760
If one day,

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,799
you give it to me out of surprise,

207
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,119
perhaps, I'll marry you.

208
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,640
Assistant He.

209
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,039
What a coincidence! Mr. Lin.

210
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,640
Coincidence? I specially came for you!

211
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,640
What? For me? Why?

212
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,080
I wanna have a word with you.

213
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,559
May I have the honor?

214
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,520
Qunfei. I'm wondering

215
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,679
where Mr. Lei has been these days.

216
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,799
Mr. Lei?

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,119
He seems to be on holiday these days.

218
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,880
It is so weird.

219
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,840
Over all these years,

220
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,679
it's the first time for him
to be away on holiday.

221
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,119
What's this?

222
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,280
Recently,

223
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,440
there are
several big investment companies

224
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,919
that have been keeping a close eye on
the Entertainment Center project.

225
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,280
Now that Mr. Lei is away,

226
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,359
you are his personal assistant,

227
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,119
how about

228
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,679
you

229
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,359
sign this proposal for him?

230
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
Teather Sun told me that

231
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,479
because of you,

232
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,960
Shanwa seems to have changed
into another person.

233
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,080
I really can't figure it out why

234
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,039
he likes you so much.

235
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
Do you still remember

236
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,919
I had a dream that night?

237
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,840
That dream, I only told you half of it.

238
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,400
The person I dreamed about that night

239
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,559
was actually my mother.

240
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
She left me long time ago.

241
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,200
My memories of her stay

242
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:44,359
when I was five or six years old.

243
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,280
Like Shanwa,

244
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,039
I don't remember her looks
for a long time.

245
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
I've dreamt of

246
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,840
meeting with my mother for many times.

247
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,960
But even I have no idea that

248
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,440
what if one day my mother suddenly
stands in front of me,

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
what should I do?

250
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,400
Should I give her a hug?

251
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,919
Forgive her?

252
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,159
Or ask her

253
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,280
where she has been
all these years?

254
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
All these years

255
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,719
have you ever been looking for her?

256
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,760
No.

257
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,000
I shouldn't have told you this.

258
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,119
Perhaps she left you

259
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,239
for a reason.

260
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:41,599
Did she?

261
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
What do you think

262
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,280
can be the reason for a mother

263
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,119
to abandon her own son?

264
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,320
You're willing to share your experience

265
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,760
and your story with me.

266
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,559
I'm very glad.

267
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,239
Xiaosu.

268
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,400
Actually, I really want to thank you.

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,280
For what?

270
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,640
Thank you for listening to me.

271
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,359
Over all these years,

272
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,280
I've never told anyone

273
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,760
about this.

274
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,400
You're the first.

275
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:30,840
We're going back tomorrow.

276
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,760
I hope this trip

277
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,320
can leave you a good memory.

278
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,080
The memory is not only beautiful,

279
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:42,280
but also unforgettable.

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Lei Yuzheng!

281
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,119
Lei Yuzheng! Come out!

282
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,880
Are you hiding from me on purpose!

283
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,160
Fanlv, here you are!

284
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,400
Uncle Duan.
Yuzheng doesn't answer my call.

285
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,800
He is not in the company.
So I come to check on him.

286
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,000
Yuzheng left for business.

287
00:18:04,439 --> 00:18:05,520
Business?

288
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,880
Where?

289
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,000
He said nothing.

290
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,199
When?

291
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,599
Two days and two nights if today counts.

292
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,199
It's weird.

293
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,920
He has never been away from the company
for so long.

294
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
Indeed.

295
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:23,719
Then I'm leaving.

296
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,119
I'll let you know.

297
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,079
Thanks.

298
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,439
What?

299
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,760
I have to take a good look at you.

300
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,319
For what?

301
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,839
I'm starving.

302
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,400
Any food?

303
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,439
You!

304
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,079
You didn't answer my call

305
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,959
or reply to my WeChat!

306
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,439
What have you been doing these days?

307
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,920
And you act like nothing happened.

308
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,760
Tell me!

309
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,880
What?

310
00:19:29,239 --> 00:19:31,160
What have you been doing these days?
Be honest.

311
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,199
I'll tell you when I am full.

312
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
He Qunfei also called for you.

313
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,599
He mentioned that
your boss was also absent.

314
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,680
What happened?

315
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Really?

316
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,800
It seems that we two

317
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,520
do have strong sense of being.

318
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,800
You two?

319
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,199
You mean

320
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,119
you have been with him these days?

321
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,599
Yes.

322
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,760
How can I forget this?

323
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,160
Stop eating!

324
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,439
He didn't do anything to you, did he?

325
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,119
What can he do to me?

326
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,680
But I have found out that

327
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,599
Lei Yuzheng also has another side.

328
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,000
Another side?

329
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,319
What side?

330
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,920
Lei Yuzheng,

331
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,959
he is actually a pretty nice person.

332
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,400
Well, I am full.

333
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,479
I'm going to take a break.

334
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,760
No way!

335
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,520
You have to make it clear to me!

336
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,280
Don't keep me guessing!

337
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,280
Sit down!

338
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,760
Aren't you short of money recently?
(Project Collaboration Agreement)

339
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:00,719
It's no big deal.

340
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,119
Only for the formality.

341
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,000
There is no risk.

342
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,199
If you sign this project proposal

343
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,920
for Mr. Lei,

344
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,839
as for the benefits,

345
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:11,640
you know.

346
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,199
I'm telling you！

347
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,760
I'll make this investment!

348
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,359
You're in or not, I don't care!

349
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,099
(Project Collaboration Agreement)

350
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh my God!

351
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,199
The boss of Yutian

352
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,040
went fishing with you
on a desert island.

353
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,560
He also fixed the generator!

354
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,000
Did I get it right?

355
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
No, you didn't.

356
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,199
I'm surprised, too.

357
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,439
When he is in the company,

358
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,079
nobody dares to make a noise
when they meet him.

359
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,119
But these two days on the island,

360
00:21:53,439 --> 00:21:54,319
I don't think

361
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,439
he is distant.

362
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,199
He is pretty considerate.

363
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,880
And he's also good at
taking care of children.

364
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,680
No wonder.

365
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,199
He Qunfei is so supportive of him.

366
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:07,400
It seems Lei Yuzheng

367
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,640
indeed has another unknown side.

368
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,040
Du Xiaosu.

369
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,520
What's that look on your face?

370
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,160
The look is not right.

371
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,280
What look?

372
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,959
Aren't you...?

373
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:37,640
What are you thinking about?

374
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:40,560
We are different people.

375
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,719
We'll never be crossed.

376
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,319
Fine.

377
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,359
Xiao Lin.

378
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,959
Have you solved the problem of funds?

379
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,599
Mr. Jiang.

380
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,760
I was just about to report it to you.

381
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,640
At this point,

382
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,359
The fact that
Lei Yuzheng left for business

383
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,239
is really strange.

384
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,959
Why?

385
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,000
These days I've been promoting

386
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:13,160
the financing of
the Entertainment Center.

387
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,520
I handed in the project proposal
as early as possible.

388
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,800
I also asked his father to
advance the project personally.

389
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,959
What about Mr. Lei!

390
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,400
He didn't give me a definite answer,

391
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,479
and also avoided me.

392
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,599
Do you think it's normal?

393
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,439
Xiao Lin.

394
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,400
I appreciate your prudence.

395
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,359
But,

396
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,160
it's not as serious as you think.

397
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,160
As the deputy,

398
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,199
you have to do your best
to help Yuzheng.

399
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,800
Don't worry about anything else.

400
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,880
But Mr. Jiang...

401
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,079
I understand your concern
about Xinsheng.

402
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,400
But it came to my mind recently,

403
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,359
it's no good for us
to make things difficult for Yutian.

404
00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:02,439
Think about it.

405
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,959
If Yuzheng becomes my son-in-law,

406
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,079
then Yutian and Xinsheng

407
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,520
will be one family.

408
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,880
The Entertainment Center project

409
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,760
will progress naturally.

410
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:14,199
Fanlv is my beloved daughter.

411
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,239
Lei Yuzheng is a good man.

412
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,959
If they can be together,

413
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,640
that'll be the best.

414
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,719
Xiao Lin, what do you think?

415
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,719
You're right. Very good.

416
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,560
Dad. Why did you call me back

417
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,000
in hurry?

418
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,959
Yuzheng.

419
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,959
Where have you been these days?

420
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,400
Now is the crucial moment

421
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,000
for the promotion of
the Entertainment Center project.

422
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,319
Everyone is looking for you.

423
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,319
Xiao Lin even came home
to ask about you.

424
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,439
The Entertainment Center project
is my wish.

425
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,800
It is also a very good project for you

426
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,319
since you took over Yutian.

427
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,040
If it's done,

428
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:01,280
you'll be more convincing
in front of the shareholders.

429
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,000
Do take it seriously!

430
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,400
Dad. This project is too big,

431
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,479
and also needs a large
amount of investment.

432
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,880
The investment of Xinsheng

433
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:11,640
might be far from enough.

434
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,040
So,

435
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:15,400
I've been working on financing

436
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,640
these days.

437
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:18,359
But don't worry.

438
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,000
I've already had solutions.

439
00:25:20,239 --> 00:25:21,160
Good.

440
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,760
Now that you're confident,
I won't interfere much then.

441
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:27,400
But you have to remember

442
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,439
both courage and strategy are required
for great achievements.

443
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,160
Only in this way
can you convince others.

444
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,199
Of course, strategy comes first.

445
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,319
Fine. Dad.

446
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,719
I won't let you down.

447
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,920
Don't worry.

448
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,119
One more thing,

449
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,359
I wanna ask you.

450
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,839
Yes?

451
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,560
Don't you think

452
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,760
it is too quiet for your dad

453
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,439
to be alone at home?

454
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,800
Quiet?

455
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,199
Isn't Uncle Duan around?

456
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,239
Well, I know what is in your mind.

457
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,719
You want a partner.

458
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,959
You brat. You dare make fun of your dad.

459
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,040
I mean,

460
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:11,400
you should make schedule

461
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,199
for your marriage now.

462
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,319
Now I can tell, if I don't push you,

463
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,719
you want me

464
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,760
to take my wish to be a grandfather

465
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
to the coffin, don't you?

466
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,560
How is everything going
between you and Fanlv?

467
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,479
It's fine.

468
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,719
Fine? Tell me then,

469
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,959
what is your plan?

470
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:34,640
What plan?

471
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,280
When are you going to get married?

472
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,479
Dad...

473
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,439
Our Entertainment Center project
has just started.

474
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,280
And it is in the difficult time.

475
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,880
Fanlv also just came back.

476
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,040
Besides,

477
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,280
it's not as easy as looking for clothes
or shopping for cabbages.

478
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,959
Take it easy.

479
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,000
Take it easy?

480
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:54,599
Look at me now.

481
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,280
Perhaps, someday I got sick again.

482
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
By then I can't even

483
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,800
hold my grandson!

484
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,000
How can I take it easy?

485
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,239
Take it Easy. Dad.

486
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,680
You'll have you grandson
as well as your granddaughter.

487
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:08,439
You always make a fool of me.

488
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:10,599
Just go!

489
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,599
By the way,

490
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,439
when you're available,
check on your Auntie Shao.

491
00:27:17,199 --> 00:27:17,920
I'm wondering

492
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,760
how she is doing on her own now.

493
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:21,160
It's been difficult for her.

494
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,359
I'll check on her in a couple of days.

495
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,319
Good afternoon, Mr. Lei.

496
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,880
Good afternoon, Mr. Lei.

497
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,280
Is it available here?

498
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,800
Mr. Lei?

499
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,280
Why are you here for dinner?

500
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,319
Private visit?

501
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,920
Why can't I come here for dinner?

502
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,839
Mr. Lei, are you here for dinner?

503
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,359
Why do I feel that

504
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,719
you're here to let me offend others?

505
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
What do you mean?

506
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,439
Look around.

507
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:17,280
Are you worried about this?

508
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,000
Then, what are you going to do
to protect yourself?

509
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,520
I dare not provoke, but I can run away.

510
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:26,680
I'll take the exit strategy.

511
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,079
Wait.

512
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,199
For the children on the island,

513
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:32,079
I've ordered a generator made abroad.

514
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,479
Give a call to Teather Sun

515
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,239
and let him know.

516
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,359
Really?

517
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,640
I know
you're the most kind-hearted person!

518
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,520
I know it!

519
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,359
Allow me to thank you for the children.

520
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,359
Wait.

521
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,119
You wanna pull me off with one word?

522
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,319
What else do you want?

523
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,280
Sit down.

524
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,000
Finish this meal with me.

525
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,280
Isn't this too much?

526
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,479
Xiaosu.

527
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,359
Can't I have the honor?

528
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,079
You two seem having fun.

529
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:14,800
Fanlv.

530
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:21,400
Yuzheng.

531
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,520
Where have you been exactly these days?

532
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,280
You didn't answer my call
or reply to my WeChat.

533
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,680
I've been worried about you.

534
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,719
Excuse me, Mr. Lei, Miss Jiang.

535
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,560
You must have a lot to talk.

536
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,599
I still have work to do. I'm leaving.

537
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,119
Still not enough? She's gone.

538
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,119
Fanlv. Why are you here?

539
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,800
I want to ask you about it, Yuzheng.

540
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,319
As the boss of Yutian,

541
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,560
why do you suddenly come
to the staff canteen?

542
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,560
Can't you just be caring the staff?

543
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,839
Or is there another reason?

544
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:57,560
What's the matter that
I come to the staff canteen? It's mine.

545
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,719
What's wrong with me

546
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:01,239
having lunch with my staff?

547
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:04,239
Fine. I'm your staff.

548
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,280
Can I have the honor

549
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,079
to have dinner with you?

550
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,079
I haven't seen you for days.

551
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:11,280
There is a lot work

552
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:13,479
I need report to you.
How about tonight?

553
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,520
Fanlv. I'm not available tonight.

554
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,079
How about another day?

555
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:19,880
I know you'll pull me off.

556
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,359
Come on.
I'm really not available tonight.

557
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:25,479
Next time. Ok?

558
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,920
Yuzheng!

559
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,719
Zhenrong, if time could go back,

560
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,560
I would like to exchange my life
for yours.

561
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
I've been thinking these days.

562
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,000
What if I tried my best to stop you

563
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,599
from leaving for Yunnan,

564
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,000
and would you still be able to

565
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,920
stand in front of me, safe and sound?

566
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,359
We can do fencing again as usual,

567
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,319
drink,

568
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:28,000
and imagine our future under this tree.

569
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,959
Imagine the picture
that we grow old together.

570
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,319
Yuzheng is here!

571
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,400
Mrs. Zhao.

572
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,000
Is Aunt Shao at home?

573
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,319
She's in there.

574
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,680
Aunt Shao. Aunt Shao.

575
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,599
Yuzheng.

576
00:31:58,479 --> 00:31:59,199
Come here.

577
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,880
Let me have a look at you.

578
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:03,400
You're not going anywhere today.

579
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,119
I'll cook your favorite steamed perch!

580
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,160
Mrs. Zhao.

581
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,959
Go get some vegetables
and a fresh perch.

582
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:14,560
I'll cook, Yuzheng

583
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,680
his favorite steamed perch

584
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,160
and the hairy crab.

585
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,280
Yes, ma'am.

586
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,199
Thank you, Mrs. Zhao.

587
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,479
Is this

588
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,920
you home?

589
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:04,439
Yes. Let's go inside.

590
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,560
Come on.

591
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:08,719
Why don't you tell me in advance?

592
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,359
Yuzheng,
I haven't cooked for a long time.

593
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,959
I don't know whether it's the taste.

594
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,640
All of these are your favorite.
Help yourself.

595
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,839
Thank you Aunt Shao.

596
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:36,199
I've been around all day.

597
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,959
I miss this taste.

598
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,040
Compared to the fish at any restaurant,

599
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,319
your steamed perch is always the best.

600
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,199
You two

601
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,199
scrambled for the fish

602
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,239
every time you ate at the table.

603
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,520
I remember that Zhenrong

604
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,719
put all the fish bones on the table,

605
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
pushed them in front of me,

606
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,479
and ran to tell you that

607
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,520
I had eaten up everything available

608
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,000
and he had nothing.

609
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,119
You two were just like monsters

610
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,119
when you were kids.

611
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,600
All neighbors were scared of you.

612
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,520
You two really caused me
a lot of troubles.

613
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,760
Aunt Shao. You've just recovered

614
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:20,919
and you can't stand the cold.

615
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,360
Take care of yourself.

616
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,439
I'll come by when I am available.

617
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,800
Bye bye.

618
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,679
Yuzheng, I know you're busy.

619
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,719
But come by when you're available.

620
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,320
Zhenrong is gone.

621
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,399
It's more or less a comfort for her
to see you.

622
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,239
I got it. I'll come by often.

623
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,879
I'm leaving.

624
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,520
Did you order the flowers?

625
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:07,280
No. It has been a while.

626
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,479
Every few days,

627
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,719
someone will leave carnations
at the door.

628
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,159
Do you know who sent the flowers?

629
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:16,679
I've never seen anyone but flowers.

630
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:30,919
Miss Du.

631
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,360
What a coincidence!

632
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,199
Mr. Lei? Why are you here?

633
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,840
If I'm right,

634
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,199
shouldn't your home be
far away from here?

635
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,040
I'm just hanging around.

636
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,159
I came here before I knew it.

637
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,040
Did you send the flowers?

638
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:02,919
Yes.

639
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,520
Then I'm right.

640
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,760
I don't know why.

641
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,000
When I see the carnations,

642
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,600
I guess they should be from you.

643
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,840
I don't remember

644
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,560
how many times I've sent flowers.

645
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,840
I seem to be used to it.

646
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,479
I'll think of this place every few days.

647
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,320
I just put the flowers at the door.

648
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,159
And then look at them far away.

649
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,320
Every time as long as
I saw someone take the flowers away,

650
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:40,479
I felt a lot more peace in my heart.

651
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,679
I know it's stupid.

652
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,239
But I've been used to it.

653
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,040
I can understand you.

654
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,760
Really?

655
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,120
Can you really understand me?

656
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,879
Actually it's not only for Zhenrong,

657
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,600
but also for me.

658
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,399
I'm afraid
Aunt Shao doesn't want to see me.

659
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,479
I know both of us need time.

660
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
But anyway,

661
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,360
she is Zhenrong's mother.

662
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:28,479
In my heart,

663
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,879
she is my mother.

664
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:35,879
I hope
every time she sees the carnations,

665
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,199
she can be reminded that

666
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,120
there is another child
who loves her as much as Zhenrong

667
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:43,639
and is still loving her.

668
00:37:45,439 --> 00:37:47,120
I'll be pretty content this way.

669
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,120
There's one place,

670
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:57,959
if you like, I'd like to take you there.

671
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,199
Let's go.

672
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,600
Who is that?

673
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,399
I've never seen such a knock!

674
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:08,919
Aren't you tired?

675
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,399
Dear landlord!

676
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,120
Come in!

677
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,520
Come in, please!

678
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,439
Why do you visit in person?

679
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,879
Did we just pay the rent?

680
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,639
It's not about the rent.

681
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,000
In what way can I put this...

682
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,399
I wanna tell you that...

683
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,080
Mr. Li,
please don't raise the rent anymore.

684
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:30,520
This is already our limit.

685
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,280
I understand.

686
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:34,879
You young girls left home for living.

687
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,120
It is pretty difficult for you,
isn't it?

688
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Yes...I know you're a good person.

689
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:39,919
I promise!

690
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:42,000
If one day I and Xiaosu become rich,

691
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,479
we will pay you back!

692
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,639
I appreciate it.

693
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,199
Miss, about the apartment,

694
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,600
we still need a discussion.

695
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,320
About the apartment...

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,679
You still want a raise?

697
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm not talking about the rent.

698
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,120
What I wanna say is...

699
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:03,919
Stay out of it!

700
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,000
One beautiful girl

701
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,600
made you lost for words.

702
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:09,959
Ma'am.

703
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,320
Why are you here?

704
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,639
That's it. Miss.

705
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:14,280
Let's get this straight.

706
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,120
We're going to sell this apartment.

707
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,399
Sell it?

708
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,199
Are you kidding?

709
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,639
We have been behaving ourselves.

710
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,439
How can you just sell it?

711
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,280
Xiao Zou, I'm going to divorce her.

712
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:27,360
This apartment has to be sold,
doesn't it?

713
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,199
Divorce?

714
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,439
Who is divorcing?

715
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,679
It's still a divorce though it is fake.

716
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,239
I'm telling you that
I'm going to sell this apartment.

717
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,800
And then I'll buy another one.

718
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,639
The price of the apartment
along Huangpu River

719
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,239
has increased a lot,
are you aware of that?

720
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,439
Move out!
I'll take the apartment back in three days!

721
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:50,040
You always keep looking.
What're you looking at?

722
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,000
Still not enough?

723
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,120
Have never seen a pretty girl?
Come with me!

724
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,159
Come on. Ma'am.

725
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,360
You made her cry...

726
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,439
You did!

727
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,679
What's wrong with you?

728
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,000
What does your divorce

729
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,560
have to do with this apartment?

730
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:03,719
He Qunfei!

731
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:06,399
