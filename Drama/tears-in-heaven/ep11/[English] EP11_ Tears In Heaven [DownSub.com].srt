Let's buy an apartment.

and build a swing there.

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,880
Is the swing built for me?

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,919
Yes.

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,240

this is a birthday present
from the children.

62
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,519
Happy birthday.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,480
It would be great if you can come.

64
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,279
The children want to meet
their Uncle Zhenrong.

65
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,600
Be sure to bring Miss Du.

66
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,640
Xiaosu,

67
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,839
I want to take you to a place.

68
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,079
A nice island.

69
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,559
There is a primary school on the island.

70
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,519
In the school, there is Teacher Sun

71
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,799
and many lovely children.

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,200
Let's visit them together.

73
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,920
But what a pity that

74
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,799
they haven't seen me.

75
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,600
It should be me who can go with you.

76
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,320
Mr. Lei!

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,640
Miss Du!

78
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,559
You always surprise me
with your way of showing up.

79
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,440
What is it about this time?

80
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,200
Mr. Lei, I come for a reason.

81
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,559
Do you have time?

82
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,040
I want to treat you to a meal.

83
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,559
Would I have the honor?

84
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,959
All right, get into the car.

85
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,440
Here we are.

86
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,920
Miss Du, you do have a unique taste.

87
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,399
Mr. Lei, this is a small restaurant.

88
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,480
It does not look as fancy as

89
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,720
the restaurants you usually go to.

90
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,799
But once you try it,

91
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,480
you'll be amazed.

92
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,559
The noodles here

93
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,760
are something you will never forget.

94
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Really?

95
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,519
Let's get inside.

96
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,679
Let's go.

97
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,480
Mr. Lei, come and sit.

98
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,399
Madam,
could you please clear the table for us?

99
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,440
No problem.

100
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Thank you.

101
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,160
Please hurry up.

102
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,920
Alright.

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,359
What do you think , Mr. Lei?

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,119
Do you like this place?

105
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:54,640
It feels nice, doesn't it?

106
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,359
Not bad.

107
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,679
Mr. Lei,
since you gave my apartment back,

108
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:09,320
I should show my gratitude.

109
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,079
Inside this envelope is a deposit book

110
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,799
with all my savings.

111
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,079
Should be enough
to cover the first installment.

112
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,480
There's also a note

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,640
specifying how much I owe you.

114
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,679
I'll pay you back every month.

115
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,640
And I'll pay you the interest
at bank rates.

116
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,440
Please take the deposit book.

117
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,000
Great.

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,799
You are all prepared.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,960
But you need to think it over.

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,280
It's like you're selling yourself to me.

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,919
Selling myself?
You have a good sense of humor.

122
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,799
But Mr. Lei,

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,960
even if I am selling myself,

124
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,119
I do it on my free will.

125
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,520
Thank you.

126
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Miss, are you busy with work lately?

127
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
I haven't seen you for a long time.

128
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,400
Yes, I'm too busy

129
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,320
to visit your restaurant.

130
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:01,239
Many young people like you

131
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,799
don't take care of themselves.

132
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,559
You almost have a pointed chin now.

133
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,400
By the way,

134
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,159
why haven't Dr. Shao come with you?

135
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,479
He...has a lot of work at the hospital.

136
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,679
But he needs to eat, right?

137
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,119
You will have the shredded eel noodles
as usual, right?

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
What about this gentleman?

139
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:21,080
Noodles with chicken and coriander.

140
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,960
I'll have what she said.

141
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,119
Okay.

142
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,479
Here are your noodles.

143
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,719
Noodles with chicken.

144
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,000
Here you are.

145
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,559
Have a try.

146
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,760
I haven't come here for a long time.

147
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,359
You are right. The noodles taste good.

148
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,479
I told you.

149
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,159
To step out from your paradise

150
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,119
and see the life of ordinary people

151
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,440
is quite nice, right?

152
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,000
All trivial matters

153
00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:12,520
make up our lives.

154
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,880
I can't believe that

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
you can nag when you're having noodles.

156
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,080
What?

157
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,119
Sorry.

158
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,559
I would usually order meals for others.

159
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,719
I should have asked you.

160
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,799
It's okay.

161
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,440
I didn't ask you but

162
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,520
why did you give me back my apartment?

163
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,799
I lost the bet.

164
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,159
Was it out of sudden?

165
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,760
Just think of me of being kind for once.

166
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,599
You have to pay me back sooner or later.

167
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,440
So it's a fair trade.

168
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,039
Can you do me another favor?

169
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,039
I knew it.

170
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:12,119
There is no free meal in the world.

171
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,679
I don't have the heart to refuse you.

172
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:16,119
Go ahead.

173
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,599
Wait.

174
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,039
What is it?

175
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
A ship ticket.

176
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,320
Zhenrong supported some poor children

177
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,640
who live on a remote island

178
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,320
and write to him almost every month.

179
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Zhenrong promised

180
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,880
to visit them before the new year.

181
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,479
You want me to go with you

182
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,919
to visit the children, right?

183
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,880
Yes.

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,000
You have a lot of work on your hands.

185
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,599
Except you,

186
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:57,280
I don't know who else I can turn to.

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,280
There are a lot of tricky things

188
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,719
that I need to deal with at the company.

189
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm afraid I don't have the time.

190
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,719
Can you please think about it?

191
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,799
Because this is

192
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,760
very important to the children.

193
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,359
It means a lot to them.

194
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,960
I can donate money
on behalf of Zhenrong.

195
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,960
I can build a school.
I can do things like that.

196
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,200
Does it matter
whether I visit in person?

197
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,719
There are things money can't buy.

198
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,039
Sometimes,

199
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,280
company is more important than money.

200
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,039
Mr. Lei,

201
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,599
the revenue of the mall in this month

202
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,039
has reached 1.087 billion so far.

203
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,440
Compared to the entire last month,

204
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
it upped by 20%.

205
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,119
About the rent,

206
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,640
it takes up 30% of the revenue.

207
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,239
And self-operating business

208
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,760
takes up 70%.

209
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,599
Anything else you want to add?

210
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,640
Mr. Lei, Mr. Lei,

211
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:04,479
do you have any request?

212
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,880
No.

213
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,440
That's all for today.

214
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,559
The meeting is dismissed.

215
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,559
I though they weren't anxious.

216
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,840
Mr. Lin thought the negotiation

217
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,320
on the Entertainment Center

218
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,719
has dragged too long.

219
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,039
They won't drop their claim.

220
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,479
Mr. Lin asked if he can push ahead

221
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,840
and urged us to reply him quickly.

222
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,640
Wait and see.

223
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,880
Qunfei,

224
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,239
prepare a car.

225
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,479
You want me to go with you

226
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,840
to visit the children?

227
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,840
Except you,

228
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,840
I don't know who else I can turn to.

229
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,719
I can donate money
on behalf of Zhenrong.

230
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:48,919
I can build school.
I can do things like that.

231
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,119
Does it matter
whether I visit in person?

232
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
Why are you walking so fast?

233
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,199
Why…

234
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,560
are you here?

235
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,599
Why can't I be here?

236
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,319
You bought me ticket.

237
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,359
Did you forget?

238
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,599
I thought you wouldn't come.

239
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Surely I didn't wanna come.

240
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,560
But it can't be helped.

241
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,280
You treated me to that meal.

242
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,839
Let's go.

243
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,560
It's still early.

244
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,760
Mr. Lei!

245
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,239
Mr. Lei!

246
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,280
Mr. Lin,

247
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
are you looking for Mr. Lei?

248
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,000
Or what?

249
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,959
Looking for you?

250
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,119
An urgent document.

251
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:30,040
Can you sign on it?

252
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,199
Of course I can't.

253
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:31,880
Why not

254
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:32,920
leave the document to me?

255
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,239
I'll have it signed.

256
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,800
Don't be ridiculous.

257
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where is Mr. Lei?

258
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:40,199
I don't know.

259
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,800
You must be joking.

260
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,719
You're his assistant.

261
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,000
You must know where he is.

262
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,560
Mr. Lin,

263
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
I really have no idea.

264
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,160
Qunfei,

265
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,199
Be a stand-up guy,

266
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,439
and don't trick me.

267
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,040
OK. I will not push you.

268
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,319
But tell me when Mr. Lei is back.

269
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:06,640
Everyone is looking for him.

270
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:07,839
Sure, no problem.

271
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,719
See you later, Mr. Lin.

272
00:19:17,308 --> 00:19:17,740
(Lei Yuzheng)

273
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,839
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,599
The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

275
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,160
Is that where we're going?

276
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,239
Xiaosu.

277
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:30,719
Teacher Sun.

278
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,640
Are you

279
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,719
Miss Du?

280
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,719
Then this gentleman must be

281
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,119
Dr. Shao.

282
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,079
Hello, Mr. Sun.

283
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:43,640
Hello.

284
00:20:43,719 --> 00:20:44,920
Just call me Xiaosu.

285
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,040
OK.

286
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,359
Teacher Sun, right?

287
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,359
Dr. Shao.

288
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,599
Nice to meet you, Dr. Shao.

289
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
Kids,

290
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:53,400
what did I tell you

291
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,000
back at school?

292
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Hello, Sister Du, Uncle Shao.

293
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,079
Sister Du, Uncle Shao.

294
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,119
Sounds like two generations.

295
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,199
So lovely are they.

296
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:09,319
When I got your call

297
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:10,479
hearing that you were coming,

298
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,119
they were so excited

299
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,520
and asking when you would arrive.

300
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,079
I couldn't stop them.

301
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,800
Are you Mei?

302
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,680
Yes.

303
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,680
I saw you on a photo.

304
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,119
Sister Du, Sister Du!

305
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,199
I'm Doudou.

306
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,560
I know you.

307
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,439
You are the

308
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,599
naughty boy.

309
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:30,920
Am I right?

310
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,839
Left, right, left…

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,280
It's a small island.

312
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,319
But it was quite bustling.

313
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,239
Before local fishermen went to the sea,

314
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,239
they would hold a ritual.

315
00:21:58,439 --> 00:22:00,040
Everyone in the village would come.

316
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:02,079
These customs are less popular now.

317
00:22:02,479 --> 00:22:04,119
The world outside has changed.

318
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,640
Many people in the village

319
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,880
have moved to cities,

320
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,760
living an urban life.

321
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,719
So the parents of these children
are working in the cities?

322
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Not all of them.

323
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,640
The parents of Mei and Doudou

324
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,079
went fishing a year ago

325
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,800
and never came back.

326
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,880
Then who is taking care of them?

327
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,920
We lied to them

328
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,160
and told them

329
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,239
that their parents were also
working in cities.

330
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,319
Now they stay at school,

331
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:33,680
and we are taking care of them.

332
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,800
Haven't you thought of

333
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:38,119
hosting families?

334
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,719
They won't leave the island.

335
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:44,079
They are waiting for their parents
to return.

336
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,199
It makes my heart ache.

337
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,560
Teacher Sun,

338
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,479
is the weather here

339
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,760
usually like this?

340
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,359
It looks like almost raining.

341
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,599
But now it's sunny.

342
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,880
Yes, Xiaosu.

343
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,359
The weather on the island

344
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,920
is whimsical.

345
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,640
You can see the sea from the village.

346
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,400
It feels like paradise.

347
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,800
Yes.

348
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,520
A lot of people say that the island

349
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,000
has great views
but no great things to do.

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
Let's go.

351
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,421
(Mongolia Village  Dream Primary School)

352
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:32,800
Kids,

353
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,800
come here.

354
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,479
We have guests.

355
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,880
Hurry up. Come here.

356
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,760
Kids.

357
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,719
Hello, everyone.

358
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,760
Kids.

359
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,199
Kids,

360
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,880
let me introduce the guests.

361
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,719
This is Teacher Xiaosu from the city.

362
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,160
That is

363
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,959
Dr. Shao, or Uncle Shao.

364
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:59,839
Hello, Teacher Xiaosu.

365
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,839
Teacher Xiaosu and Uncle Shao
have come to visit.

366
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,280
Are you happy?

367
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,000
Yeah!

368
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,359
Shall we show them

369
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,319
around our school?

370
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,280
Yeah!

371
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,439
Let's go.

372
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,800
Hurry up!

373
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,880
Go back to the classroom.

374
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,439
Feier, let's go back to the classroom.

375
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,760
Let's go.

376
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,439
My dear daughter,

377
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,680
what's wrong with you?

378
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:43,319
Dad,

379
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,239
yuzhen treats me bad.

380
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,160
He doesn't answer my call.
I can't find him,

381
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,800
as if he had suddenly disappeared.

382
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,839
Is he hiding from me?

383
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,199
Fanlv,

384
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:54,640
you're acting like a child again.

385
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:57,160
You know

386
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,959
that Lei Yuzheng has to

387
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,000
manage a big company.

388
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:03,400
With so many things going on,

389
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,359
his hands are tied.

390
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,000
You need to understand that.

391
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:10,959
Understand?

392
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,800
Dad, you didn't know.

393
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,040
He refuses to meet me

394
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,640
with all kinds of excuses every time,

395
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,560
either at a meeting
or on a business trip.

396
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:18,920
Is he that busy?

397
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,359
He is obviously hiding from me.

398
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,800
How dare he?

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,760
He doesn't have the guts

400
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,119
to refuse you.

401
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,640
After all,

402
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,119
it's a blessing

403
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,319
that he is liked by my daughter.

404
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,319
Lei Yuzheng is smart.

405
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,800
He knows that.

406
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,280
But Fanlv,

407
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,239
most men pay great attention to work.

408
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,239
The busier he is,
the more considerate you should be.

409
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,959
And he will love you more.

410
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,599
Do you understand?

411
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:52,880
In this way,

412
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,839
he will think you are a thoughtful woman

413
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,599
and will never leave you.

414
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,119
Come, Xiaosu, here.

415
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,439
This way.

416
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,400
OK.

417
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:24,000
Come inside, Xiaosu.

418
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,520
This is my dorm room.

419
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,640
I just changed the bed sheet and quilt.

420
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,560
The bed is a little small.

421
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,479
Sorry that
you have to bear with this situation.

422
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,719
No, Teacher Sun.

423
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,920
You've done so much for us.

424
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,000
We can't

425
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
take your dorm room.

426
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,520
We can

427
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,239
sleep with the children tonight.

428
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,599
No, I would feel very sorry.

429
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,800
I think this is a nice room.

430
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:54,959
You can see the sea from the window.

431
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,280
It's like a sea-view hotel room.

432
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,680
Dr. Shao, you are humorous.

433
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,319
Alright.

434
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,479
I'll leave now.

435
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,680
Have an early rest.

436
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,560
The oil price has risen recently.

437
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
The engine may not be able to
work for long.

438
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,359
So you need to hurry up.

439
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,760
OK.

440
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,079
Thank you.

441
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,920
Why did you close the door?

442
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:22,479
Because we will go to sleep.

443
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,680
What are you thinking?

444
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,800
This place rains a lot.

445
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,599
We should keep the rain
out of the room, right?

446
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,319
Do you intend to sleep here?

447
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,280
Du Xiaosu,

448
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:37,280
what do you mean?

449
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,119
Do you want me to sleep outside?

450
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,239
You really wanted me to sleep outside?

451
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,800
Come on, Du Xiaosu.

452
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,959
There is strong wind outside.

453
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,119
The lightning and the thunder.

454
00:27:53,479 --> 00:27:54,680
The weather here is whimsical.

455
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,079
It can rain anytime.

456
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,760
Also,

457
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,719
you invited me here.

458
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:03,119
But you are treating me so cruelly.

459
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,719
I didn't mean that.

460
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,560
I mean,

461
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,640
I'll sleep on the floor
and you can sleep in the bed.

462
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,520
You sleep in the bed.
I'll sleep on the floor.

463
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,079
You'll feel cold on the floor.

464
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,599
Actually I can go downstairs
and sleep with the children.

465
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,560
Don't worry.

466
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,680
When I used to go hiking,

467
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,079
I slept on the ground with my teammates.

468
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,079
Why are you staring at me?

469
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,319
Unpack and go to sleep.

470
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,599
Thank you.

471
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,880
Thank you for coming with me.

472
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,400
You don't need to thank me.

473
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,079
I come here for Zhenrong.

474
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,000
It's late.

475
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
We should go to sleep.

476
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,599
Mom, don't go.

477
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,119
Yuzheng, Yuzheng.

478
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:23,680
I'm begging you to stay.

479
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,160
Mom, please don't go.

480
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Go to sleep upstairs.

481
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,760
Let me go.

482
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,160
Mom!

483
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,520
Be good!

484
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,119
Du Xiaosu,

485
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,400
what are you doing at this time?

486
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,119
Do you think you're in a horror film?

487
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,719
The lightning and thunder
didn't scare me.

488
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,719
But you did, by crouching here silently.

489
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,880
You are mean.

490
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,719
Don't be sarcastic.

491
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,599
I have been really scared of thunder
since I was a child.

492
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,640
I didn't expect this.

493
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,800
You look quite bold usually.

494
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,160
Stand up.

495
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,920
You're scaring yourself.

496
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:10,839
No.

497
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:13,520
I feel safe staying down here.

498
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
Safe?

499
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,199
Your hands are cold. Stand up!

500
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,359
The temperature in the room
is low at night.

501
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,719
And it is humid on the floor.

502
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,599
You can get sick sitting on the floor.

503
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
Stand up.

504
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,280
Why are you staring at me?

505
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,199
Feeling warmer?

506
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,199
Thank you.

507
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,040
Do I look

508
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,920
that scary?

509
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,319
Of course not.

510
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,640
I scared myself.

511
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,119
You…

512
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,760
had a nightmare just now, right?

513
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,160
Do you want to talk about it?

514
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,199
You look sad.

515
00:32:48,479 --> 00:32:49,959
You were so scared

516
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,040
that you sat on the floor.

517
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,119
And now,
you're asking about my nightmare?

518
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,319
I was just asking.

519
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,800
It's okay if you don't want to tell.

520
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
I dreamed of a woman.

521
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,839
I tried to see her face clearly,

522
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,040
but no matter how hard I tried,

523
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,280
I couldn't.

524
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,160
There were also

525
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,719
thunders and lightning like this

526
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,760
in my dream.

527
00:33:24,439 --> 00:33:25,400
Is she

528
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,119
your family?

529
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,079
Yes.

530
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
But she left me long ago.

531
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,959
She passed away?

532
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,119
Then she...

533
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:50,839
Alright, that's it.

534
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
It was quite a long time ago.

535
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,199
Go to sleep.

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,479
Let's go and find Uncle Shao.

537
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,439
Hurry up!

538
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:37,760
Dr. Shao.

539
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,080
-Dr. Shao.
-Uncle Shao.

540
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,479
-Dr. Shao.
-Uncle Shao.

541
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,000
Shanwa's father is having
a rheumatic heart attack.

542
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,159
He can't breathe now.

543
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
You are a doctor.

544
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,719
Can you please go and check on him?

545
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:47,520
Uncle Shao,

546
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,879
please help my father.

547
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,399
Help my father!

548
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,040
It's okay, it's okay.

549
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,679
Let's go.

550
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,159
I'll go over.

551
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,199
Hurry.

552
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,679
Be careful, Dr. Shao.

553
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,600
Be careful.

554
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,679
Watch the slope.

555
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:17,919
Slowly.

556
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,040
Dad,

557
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,439
Dad, please wake up.

558
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,959
Wake up.

559
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,439
What time did the pain start?

560
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,199
Five o' clock.

561
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,560
Around five.

562
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,639
Who is the family of the patient?

563
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,560
Come out with me.

564
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,040
This is his child.

565
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,159
But he's too young.

566
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,639
You can tell me the situation.

567
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,959
OK.

568
00:35:46,919 --> 00:35:47,719
Dr. Shao,

569
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,320
would you please

570
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,679
come out with me as well?

571
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,159
Just in case I don't understand
what the doctor says.

572
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,399
You will understand as a doctor.

573
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,919
OK.

574
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,080
Alright.

575
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,239
This way.

576
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,479
Shanwa,

577
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,120
you stay with your dad.

578
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,520
The patient

579
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,520
has a typical rheumatic heart disease.

580
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,760
The fishermen here

581
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:08,919
work at sea most of the time

582
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,320
and are likely to get the disease.

583
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,679
The patient's vital signs are stable.

584
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,600
Tonight,

585
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,159
he should stay here for observation.

586
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,320
But this is only a small clinic.

587
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,399
You need to

588
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
transfer the patient tomorrow

589
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,879
to a big hospital in the city.

590
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,800
OK.

591
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,719
We get it, doctor.

592
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,679
Thank you very much.

593
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,159
Teacher Sun,

594
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,280
since Shanwa's father is so sick,

595
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,000
why isn't his mother here?

596
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,719
Dr. Shao,

597
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:36,840
in fact,

598
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,280
Shanwa

599
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,439
is a miserable kid.

600
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,919
His father had this disease
a few years ago.

601
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,040
And life on the island is difficult.

602
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:46,399
So his mother went to work
in the city two years ago,

603
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,000
but never came back.

604
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,040
What the school can do is limited.

605
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,239
We can only take care of the orphans.

606
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,479
How about this?

607
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,360
Take this card,

608
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,600
and please transfer Shanwa's dad

609
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,120
to a big hospital in the city.

610
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,159
Dr. Shao,

611
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,080
you have helped the school so much.

612
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,520
I can't accept this.

613
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,159
Teacher Sun,

614
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,360
I must help Shanwa.

615
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,520
Thank you, Dr. Shao.

616
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:37,080
Why are you here?

617
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm worried about Shanwa.

618
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,360
After I ensure the kids were okay,

619
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,000
I came here as soon as possible.

620
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:49,800
The first time I saw Shanwa,

621
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:51,159
I felt that

622
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,800
he was different from other kids.

623
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:56,000
He played with himself

624
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,959
and didn't talk too much.

625
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,560
There must be something on his mind.

626
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,239
I didn't know
what a tragic life he lives.

627
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:11,159
A boy abandoned by his mother.

628
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,520
Nobody cares about him when he is sad.

629
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,479
So he matures quickly
and keeps a lot of things to himself.

630
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:25,679
The adults on the island

631
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,360
sympathize with what Shanwa
has been through,

632
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:30,919
and try to take care of him.

633
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,360
But Shanwa is stubborn.

634
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,639
He doesn't accept others' favors.

635
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:40,439
I didn't expect him
to trust you so much.

636
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
He trusts me,

637
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,560
probably because

638
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,080
I know him better than others do.

639
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:56,800
Even his own mother didn't want him.

640
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,679
Whom else in this world

641
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,320
can he trust then?

642
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,120
When other children are hurt,

643
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,760
they can seek consolation
from their mothers.

644
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
But Shanwa

645
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,399
can only hide in the corner

646
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,280
to lick his wound.

647
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,120
Why did you put it
like you've had that experience.

648
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,479
I just have more imaginations.

649
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,560
It's like sailing in the dark.

650
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,560
You will never know
when you'll bump into rocks,

651
00:39:31,159 --> 00:39:32,600
or when there will be storms.

652
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,040
But no matter
what difficulties you meet,

653
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,120
you have to

654
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,080
bear them all by yourself.
