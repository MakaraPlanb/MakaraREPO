16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,839
Xiangyuan, how come you are here?

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,080
You're having reexamination tomorrow.

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,279
I'm a little worried.

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,199
So, I stopped by to see
how you are doing.

20
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,960
How about I call the day off tomorrow

21
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,199
and come with you?

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
It's okay.

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,559
My dad will go with me tomorrow.

24
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:21,479
You should go focusing on your work.

25
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,759
There's nothing to focus on.

26
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,000
The most important thing
I want to focus on right now

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,240
is you.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,960
Xiangyuan,

29
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,839
do you think I will get better?

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,279
Of course you will.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Fanlv,

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
don't think too much.

33
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,960
Don't worry.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,479
No matter what happens,

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
I will be with you

36
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,679
until you get better.

37
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,399
So,

38
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,600
don't be stressful.

39
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,039
Sleep well.

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,839
The sun will rise as always tomorrow.

41
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,839
Good girl. Sleep.

42
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,079
Xiangyuan.

43
00:03:59,279 --> 00:03:59,920
Dad.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,920
Did Fanlv fall asleep?

45
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,880
Yes, she did.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,880
It's pretty late already.
You should sleep soon too.

47
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,040
Did you see Yuzheng

48
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,399
at the company these days?

49
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,679
Yes, I did.

50
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,359
Did he

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,279
say anything to you?

52
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,559
Xiangyuan,

53
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,440
now Yuzheng is back to Yutian.

54
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,320
Besides the Entertainment Center,

55
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,480
there are also many other
reformations that Yutian

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
is planning to do.

57
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,839
Now, it's the time that Yutian needs
as many talents as possible.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,279
I hope that you could

59
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,119
let go of what's on your mind

60
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,640
and dedicate in your work.

61
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,320
Dad,

62
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,880
I also want to dedicate in work.

63
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
But now Lei Yuzheng is back,

64
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,040
do you think that he wants me to stay?

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,320
Xiangyuan,

66
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,559
I understand your worries.

67
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,279
If you don't feel comfortable
staying at Yutian,

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,079
come to Xinsheng.

69
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,600
You are familiar with our business

70
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,880
after all.

71
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,239
It's also easy for you to

72
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,079
achieve your goals.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,519
Dad,

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
I can't answer it now.

75
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,959
Xiangyuan,

76
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,000
are you still worrying about that?

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,000
If it's hard for you to say,

78
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,640
I can go for you

79
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,200
and beg Lei Yuzheng to let you off.

80
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:31,760
Dad,

81
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,119
please don't do that.

82
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,320
Under the current circumstances,

83
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,600
I deserve however Lei Yuzheng

84
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,279
plans to do with me.

85
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,839
But...

86
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,839
Dad,

87
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,480
Fanlv needs to do
reexamination tomorrow.

88
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,239
You should rest early.

89
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,239
Siqi.

90
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,880
What happened? You seem so down.

91
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,359
Tell me.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,359
Huanhuan,

93
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,959
why hasn't Qunfei proposed to me yet?

94
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Still not?

95
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,959
He's acting so slow.

96
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,880
He wouldn't run away, would he?

97
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,160
Well, there's no woman
who wants to be left single.

98
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,640
But men don't want to

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
settle down too soon.

100
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,200
It's not always like that.

101
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,239
I feel that He Qunfei

102
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,720
is not one of them.

103
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,359
He wants to settle down
much more than I do.

104
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:32,000
He has prepared the
ring a long time ago.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's just that

106
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,720
I don't know what he's afraid of.

107
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,200
Is he afraid that
I spend money too recklessly

108
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:41,839
or that I won't treat his parents well?

109
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
It's pointless for us to make guesses.

110
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,640
If you really want to know,

111
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,399
you need to test him.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,399
Test him?

113
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,839
How?

114
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,279
Have you heard of Linton?

115
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:00,239
He's one of the top management
at the famous S.G. company,

116
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,600
and he has been working at Wall Street
since he was in his twentieth.

117
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,480
Have you heard of Hengshan Funds?

118
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,119
Let me tell you, darling.

119
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:10,839
The managers there have

120
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,720
achieved financial
freedom earlier than others.

121
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,959
However, those people combining together

122
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
won't be a match of our Mr. Lei.

123
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,600
Siqi,

124
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,119
after this hard fight,

125
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,000
I, He Qunfei, will be noted

126
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,760
on the acquisition-resistance
history in China.

127
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,600
That's fantastic.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
Now, I finally know why

129
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,440
you won't want to leave Yutian.

130
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,040
Every time you talk about Yutian,

131
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,399
you look so different.

132
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,279
So handsome and so cool.

133
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,640
Darling, don't praise me please.

134
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm not used to it.

135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Please keep cursing me.

136
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,959
Why would I curse you?

137
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:48,519
My He Qunfei is so good.

138
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,920
I won't curse you.

139
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,040
Because behind
every single successful man,

140
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:54,839
there's a woman

141
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,359
who keeps nagging.

142
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,039
Then, would this successful man

143
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:01,440
abandon this woman behind him?

144
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,559
How come?

145
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,320
Am I that kind of person?

146
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,320
I don't think you are.

147
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,799
Then, since we have decided to

148
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,919
walk together with each other,

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,760
shall we start planning

150
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,919
our future?

151
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,159
What future?

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,640
Our future!

153
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,880
He Qunfei, it's so hard
to understand your thoughts.

154
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:26,840
Why?

155
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,280
You're so bad at picking places.

156
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,640
BBQ restaurant is not suitable for this.

157
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:34,239
Sir, here's the wine that you ordered.

158
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,359
Sorry, but I didn't order it.

159
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,239
What?

160
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,400
You didn't order it?

161
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm sorry, sir and madam. It was my mistake.

162
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,840
Over there.

163
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,760
Sorry about that.

164
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,320
Do you want to marry me?

165
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,359
Yes, I do.

166
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:13,320
How happy they are.

167
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,200
Yeah.

168
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,559
What do you think
these people are thinking

169
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,159
when they propose at a BBQ restaurant?

170
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,119
Do you think they lost their mind?

171
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,239
Such idiots.

172
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,239
They are not idiots.

173
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,719
I am.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,520
Hold on. We are just having meal.

175
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,039
Why do you start talking
bad about yourself?

176
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,200
What's wrong with that?

177
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:31,119
I'm the most stupid idiot in the world

178
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,119
to know you.

179
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,200
Wait, Siqi, what's about me?

180
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,719
Look at them.

181
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,960
Eating BBQ while listening to music.
How happy are they.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,359
If you like violin, we can order it too.

183
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,880
It's not violin that I like.

184
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,719
It's the atmosphere.

185
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,479
Vibe. Alright?

186
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,320
But violin doesn't really match

187
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,640
BBQ restaurant, right?

188
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,440
It's so oily and loud everywhere.

189
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,880
There's also this BBQ sound.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,159
Even if the violin sounds so nice,

191
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,200
can you hear it?

192
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,239
I would still enjoy it even
if I can't hear it.

193
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,159
What? Look at them.

194
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,400
How happy they are!

195
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,520
Because I measured
the size of your hand.

196
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:08,760
Do you like it?

197
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,760
Are they happy? I don't see it.

198
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,119
Although she looks

199
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,919
quiet and low-key,

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,799
I can tell from her face that

201
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:19,919
she's eager to get married.

202
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,880
Look at that guy.

203
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,599
Although his appearance is average,

204
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,080
he has high EQ.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,039
One proposed and the other answered.

206
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,159
What a connection! So enviable.

207
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:30,239
Come on, darling.

208
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,799
Eat meat. It's just cooked.

209
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's not look at other places
when we eat.

210
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,280
In case it will affect our appetite.

211
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,799
All you think about is eating.

212
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Look. This little face has gotten even
thinner because you starved yourself.

213
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,599
You're so annoying.

214
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,520
Wait. Why are you mad again, Siqi?

215
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,280
I'm done. I'm full. Leaving now.

216
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:50,400
Come on.
We haven't finished the meat, darling.

217
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,719
Siqi.

218
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,719
Siqi.

219
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,440
What's wrong, Siqi?

220
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,760
I just want to know

221
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,599
what I am to you.

222
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:03,919
You are the most important woman

223
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,719
to me in my life.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
There're so many important women,

225
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:08,520
including your mom.

226
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,119
This is so vague.

227
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,119
Siqi,

228
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,640
I know what you are trying to say.

229
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,760
You know?

230
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,359
Then, why don't you do anything?

231
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:17,880
Of course I understand you.

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,880
But just because I do,

233
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,200
I don't want to say it easily.

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,479
He Qunfei,

235
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,239
did you have a change of heart?

236
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,280
How could I, Siqi?

237
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,799
I love you too much.

238
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:35,599
So,

239
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,679
I cannot say it easily

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,719
or promise anything.

241
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,919
If I cannot even buy a house for you,

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,840
how can I propose to you?

243
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:45,679
House?

244
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,159
Your biggest dream

245
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,840
is to own a house in Shanghai.

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,599
If I cannot even offer you

247
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,719
a place to stay,

248
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,640
how can I bring you happiness?

249
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:02,039
I've finally understood

250
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
what house means to you.

251
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,080
When a woman marries to a man,

252
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:09,359
the most important
thing is the sense of safety.

253
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,919
Having a house

254
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,719
will give you at least half of it.

255
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,039
Even if you don't mention it now,

256
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,200
I still can't easily

257
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
propose to you.

258
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:25,039
What do you think?

259
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,168
(Teacher Sun)

260
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Teacher Sun,

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
it's been a while.

262
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,479
How are you and the kids?

263
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,960
We are all doing good, Xiaosu.

264
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm calling to share a great news.

265
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,919
Our school has been moved to the town.

266
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,320
Kids were so happy

267
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,599
when they heard about this.

268
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,799
That is awesome!

269
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,039
Then kids can

270
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,200
focus on studying now.

271
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,080
There's one more thing.

272
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,400
My tenure will end soon.

273
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,239
You may not be able to see me

274
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,679
next time when you come to the island.

275
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,520
What do you mean?

276
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,239
Are you going back to your hometown?

277
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,159
Yeah.

278
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,679
I plan to be a civil servant.

279
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,559
My girlfriend has also come back to me.

280
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:17,320
We plan to get married next year.

281
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,239
I see. Congratulations!

282
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,599
You will be the bridegroom.

283
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,719
Thank you, Xiaosu.

284
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,280
I assume you
and Yuzheng are also getting married soon.

285
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,960
What happened on the island
was so memorable.

286
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,679
It was really nice to

287
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,119
know you and Yuzheng.

288
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,640
Xiaosu,

289
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,280
don't forget to come to
my wedding ceremony

290
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,679
together with Yuzheng.

291
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,799
Okay.

292
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,159
No problem.

293
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,760
We will be there for sure.

294
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,719
Doctor,

295
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,559
how is it?

296
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,719
Based on the current condition,

297
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:03,520
Miss Jiang is basically recovered.

298
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,559
Doctor, thank you so much.

299
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,039
It's our responsibility
to cure patients.

300
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,000
But seeing that Miss Jiang can recover

301
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,400
in such short period of time,

302
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,479
the caring from family
made a huge contribution,

303
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,080
especially Mr. Lin.

304
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:20,760
It's Miss Jiang's luck to

305
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
have him who can persist until now.

306
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,640
Thank you so much, doctor.

307
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,520
You're welcome.

308
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,440
Thank you!

309
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,799
Now, you've recovered.

310
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,039
My mission has been completed.

311
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,359
I want to pack my stuff and move back.

312
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,400
Xiangyuan,

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,280
actually, you don't have to move.

314
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,119
Fanlv, it makes me very happy

315
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,080
to see you recover.

316
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,039
I want to go back home to check my mom,

317
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,880
and then

318
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,280
go to where I belong to.

319
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,239
Now, it's time for me to pay the debt.

320
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,640
Do you have to do this?

321
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,960
Is there any other way?

322
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,760
I can ask Yuzheng for help.

323
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,719
No, it's ok.

324
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,239
If we are still husband and wife,

325
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,200
please don't do that.

326
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,159
Let's go back home first.

327
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:38,400
Have a dinner before you leave.

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,799
Let's go.

329
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,119
Mr. Lei, here's the list
for the victory banquet.

330
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,719
Excuse me.

331
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,679
Hello.

332
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,840
No, no, no. It's too expensive.

333
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:19,880
Please let me know
when there's cheaper one.

334
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,400
Ok. Thanks!

335
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,239
Are you buying a house?

336
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,200
Do you need my help?

337
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,160
Mr. Lei, I'm not buying it.

338
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm just checking the price.

339
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:34,439
Are you still blaming me

340
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,479
for not helping you
buy the house last time?

341
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:38,199
No.

342
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:40,079
I know that,

343
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:41,400
as your assistant,

344
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,359
I shouldn't make this exemption.

345
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,040
I should be the model for others.

346
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,560
Ah right, Mr. Lei.

347
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,119
Have you checked the list?

348
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,560
We can just invite a few friends.

349
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,640
There doesn't have to be
a lot of people.

350
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,400
Ok.

351
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,000
Then,

352
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,719
shall we invite Xiaosu?

353
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:14,359
I can tell that you've been having hard
time concentrating on work recently.

354
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,760
Do I look distracted?

355
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,000
No, that's not what I mean.

356
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
So,

357
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,599
shall we invite Du Xiaosu?

358
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,959
Ok, I see. I will do it right away.

359
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,400
Fanlv,

360
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,479
are you full?

361
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,719
You should get rest if you are full.

362
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,680
There's something
I'd like to talk with dad.

363
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:00,959
Ok.

364
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,520
Xiangyuan,

365
00:18:10,199 --> 00:18:12,920
what can't you say in front of Fanlv?

366
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,280
Dad,

367
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,400
Fanlv's illness has just recovered.

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,520
I don't want her to worry about me.

369
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,880
I've made up my mind.

370
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
For what?

371
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,920
I'd rather quit myself

372
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
and undertake the responsibility
for my mistakes,

373
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:36,000
than being chased away by Lei Yuzheng.

374
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,319
It's easy to quit.

375
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,920
But regarding undertaking
the responsibility,

376
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,280
how do you plan to do that?

377
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,079
Don't you know that

378
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,359
you need to go to jail

379
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,199
if you want to do it.

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,599
Fanlv has just recovered,

381
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,640
and she cannot be irritated more.

382
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,239
You are the only one

383
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:59,160
who she cannot live without

384
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,239
besides me.

385
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,079
If you go to jail,

386
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,040
she will get hurt.

387
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,640
Dad,

388
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,160
I've been living in fear every day.

389
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,479
Every time I see Lei Yuzheng,

390
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,000
I couldn't even look at his eyes.

391
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,719
I'm a culprit to him.

392
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,920
But it's been a while already.

393
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,920
If Lei Yuzheng wants you to pay for it,

394
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,560
he would've done it already.

395
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,560
He wouldn't have waited this long.

396
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,280
It doesn't matter what he thinks.

397
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,359
I have to undertake the responsibility

398
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,439
for what I have done.

399
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,199
Please don't try to change my mind.

400
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,599
I have decided.

401
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,520
Xiangyuan,

402
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,680
I'm happy that

403
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,319
you choose to do this,

404
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,760
because it means that

405
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,000
you've become mature.

406
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:53,800
A man should be responsible

407
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,239
for his own actions.

408
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,199
But

409
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,719
you are my son-in-law,

410
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,400
and I cannot watch

411
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,199
you go through it.

412
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,680
I cannot just let you be.

413
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
I've fought my life just to

414
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,719
see you two happy together.

415
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,760
I was hoping that one day
I could embrace my grandson.

416
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,040
Dad,

417
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,520
I'm sorry to you,

418
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,359
and I'm sorry to Fanlv.

419
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,479
No,

420
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,479
I have to talk to Lei Yuzheng.

421
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,560
Dad, please.

422
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,680
Let me handle this myself.

423
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,439
I will walk you out.

424
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,160
Xiangyuan,

425
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,959
have you really made up your mind?

426
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,040
Actually, everyone makes mistakes,

427
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,280
and you should give yourself a chance.

428
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,280
Fanlv,

429
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,280
you don't need to persuade me.

430
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:16,680
I've decided.

431
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,160
Not just you,

432
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,400
I'm also talking about myself.

433
00:21:22,719 --> 00:21:23,640
You?

434
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,000
What did you do?

435
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,239
I've been spoiled since I was a kid.

436
00:21:29,239 --> 00:21:30,800
No one dared to violate my wills.

437
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,479
At that time,

438
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,119
I've let off all the emotions

439
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,839
on you.

440
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:36,880
All on you.

441
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,599
I've done a lot of stupid things.

442
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
You didn't blame me and

443
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,160
you still gave me chances.

444
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,359
I promised you that

445
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,719
I would spoil you.

446
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,839
It's unfortunate
that I didn't keep my promise.

447
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,719
Even if you torture me,

448
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,599
I would be happy to take it.

449
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,160
Just because you were too good to me,

450
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,400
I was spoiled like that.

451
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,680
I wanted to keep spoiling you

452
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
and be next to you.

453
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:10,880
But I broke my promise.

454
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,920
I am not a good husband.

455
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,160
You just recovered,

456
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,760
and I shouldn't have

457
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:19,680
mentioned about this to you.

458
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,439
What is it?

459
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,719
Before I confess to Lei Yuzheng,

460
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,599
let's get divorced.

461
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:31,959
Xiangyuan…

462
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,119
If you are done with thinking,

463
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,520
let me know any time.

464
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,359
Xiangyuan,

465
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,439
do you regret marrying me?

466
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,319
Of course not.

467
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:00,959
Although we've fought and argued,

468
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,560
strangely every time when

469
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,319
I close my eyes,

all I see is our best memories.

471
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,119
I still remember how you looked like
in the wedding dress.

472
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,719
You were so stunning,

473
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,760
and you were willing to marry me.

474
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,920

if there's such exciting thing

492
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,760
you have to let me know.

493

I haven't had this much fun in a while.

This time, thanks to you,

Si Yang and Ye.

496
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,400
Yuzheng,

497
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,680
if you want to thank people,

498
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,520
leave Shangguan out of it.

499
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,040
I would move faster

500
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:30,319
without this guy.

501
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,359
Ye has got the point.

502
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,640
By having him,

503
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,880
we have significantly improved

504
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,560
the IQ level of our think tank.

505
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,359
Come on. Cheers!

00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,959
Wait. You jerk!

508
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:46,920
Mr. Lei, here's the gift from Xu You.

509
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,680
(Congratulations. Congratulations
to Yutian. Wish you all the best!)

510
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,160
Xu You has really
put a lot of thought into this.

511
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:04,239
She has saved Yutian

512
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
in the hardest time.

513
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,640
She's such a hero with soft heart.

514
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,719
Such a pity.

515
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:12,520
Bro, Xu You is such a

516
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,079
good match with you.

517
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,479
If I were you,
we would have married her already.

518
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,319
Just because she's a nice person,

519
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:21,160
I don't want to hurt her again.

520
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,599
Actually,

521
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,239
Xu You and I are more like comrades

522
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,680
who are still friends
after the war is finished.

523
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,280
I feel that my bro

524
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,599
is truly himself when

525
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,520
he's with Xu You.

526
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
What made you say that?

527
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
Because he has the

528
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,439
aura of coldness

529
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,319
at that time.

530
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,959
But when he's with Du Xiaosu,

531
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,640
he seemed to be

532
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,239
not like himself.

533
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,599
What?

534
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Warmth.

535
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,680
What's wrong with warmth?

536
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,000
It's so much better than coldness.

537
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,160
There's this saying, "lonely at the top".

538
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:00,319
Let me tell you all.

539
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,400
In every man's heart,

540
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,000
there's an ideal type.

541
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,479
Look, Yuzheng has changed. Why?

542
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,640
Because he met the right person.

543
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,920
Xu You. Right.

544
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,880
She is elegant, wise and attractive.

545
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:17,119
But Du Xiaosu sometimes

546
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,160
acts dumb.

547
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,520
What do you call it? Innocent.

548
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,439
If I were him, I would like it too.

549
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,160
Wait, Yuzheng.

550
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,400
I'm just drawing an analogy.
Don't get mad.

551
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,319
This kind of stuff

552
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:29,760
can only be perceived by

553
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,280
mature men like Yuzheng and me.

554
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,839
Shangguan,

555
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,199
you're still young
and you need to learn more.

556
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:39,040
Women like Xu You

557
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,680
will never place her future

558
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,880
on some men.

559
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,560
She would only give hints and run away.

560
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,599
What do you call it?

561
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,359
One sets up the trap
while the other falls into the snare.

562
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,319
Such push-and-pull in relationships

563
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,000
is so much fun.

564
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,520
Are you coming to celebrate?

565
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,640
Especially you, Shangguan.

566
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
You're so talkative today.

567
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,520
Haven't you drunk enough?

568
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,359
Of course I haven't.

569
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,040
Come on.

570
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,000
Come on.

571
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,040
Cheers.

572
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,839
Why does this wine from 1982

573
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,040
taste so sour?

574
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,640
Thank you for the gift you
sent the other day.

575
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,439
I really appreciate it this whole time.

576
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,239
We don't have to be
so polite to each other.

577
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,079
There's one thing
that I've been curious about.

578
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,760
We've seen each other
so often these days,

579
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
but I've never seen your girlfriend

580
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,719
called you or

581
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,040
texted you.

582
00:27:40,719 --> 00:27:42,319
Can I take it as

583
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,880
that your girlfriend doesn't exist?

584
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:46,640
I was too busy

585
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,000
to contact her proactively.

586
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:54,319
We seem more like a couple

587
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,040
since we are together every day.

588
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Yeah.

589
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,599
It's not right for me

590
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,599
to spend every day with you.

591
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,079
It's preventing you
from meeting the right person.

592
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,719
Laurence Bloch has said that,

593
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,400
even the richest person and

594
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:13,400
the most successful person in this world

595
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,959
might run into a woman
who doesn't love him

596
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,680
and a mountain
that he would never be able to climb up.

597
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
Are you trying to suggest that

598
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,719
my affection
for Du Xiaosu is one-sided love?

599
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,920
I'm not talking about you.

600
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,479
I'm talking about myself.

601
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,800
Actually, I came here today

602
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,560
to get an answer.

603
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,319
Xu You,

604
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:36,880
my choice has never changed
from the beginning.

605
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,959
It seems like I have misunderstood it.

606
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,160
We've been together often
during this whole time.

607
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:46,439
I thought

608
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,199
we might be possible.

609
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,400
Xu You,

610
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,280
when I was at my worst time,

611
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,079
you helped me unconditionally.

612
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,839
I really appreciate your help.

613
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,119
It's my honor to have

614
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
a friend like you.

615
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,920
In future, we will
always be good friends.

616
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,119
It's just that I've never imagined that

617
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,359
this person would be Du Xiaosu.

618
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,719
Goodbye.

619
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,160
I've thought about it for a long time.

621
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,760
Getting divorced is for your best.

622
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,839
Since now you've recovered,

623
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,640
there's no reason for me to stay.

624
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,839
I should give your freedom back.

625
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:48,040
Why did Xiangyuan move out?

626
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:49,400
I've tried to persuade him,

627
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,479
but I couldn't refute

628
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,719
what he said.

629
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,760
It's time to let go of him.

630
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
Let go of him?

631
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,680
Daughter,

632
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,160
are you two getting divorced?

633
00:30:11,439 --> 00:30:14,479
Is it his idea or it's yours?

634
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,839
It's a decision of both of us.

635
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
My girl,

636
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,239
dad can also see that

637
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,280
you don't want to let him go.

638
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,680
You too, right?

639
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:36,359
But now I get it.

640
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,839
Loving someone

641
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:41,520
means respecting his choice.

642
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,599
Since you've made up your mind,

643
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,520
then let him go.

644
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,479
I've done everything

645
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,719
that I could.

646
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:55,239
Dad,

647
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,359
did you go to beg Yuzheng?

648
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,160
I went to talk to him,

649
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,400
but

650
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,359
he didn't feel like talking about it.

651
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,880
Does he want to revenge?

652
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,319
I am getting old,

653
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,319
and I couldn't really tell

654
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,640
what you young people are thinking.

655
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,359
Under the current situation,

656
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,560
we could only follow the fate.

657
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,520
This friend of mine

658
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,800
has very high standard of vision.

659
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,119
There's never been any designer

660
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,439
who could satisfy him.

661
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,359
But after he saw your project,

662
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,800
he appointed you for the design.

663
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,239
I don't know whether it's good

664
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,640
for you or not.

665
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,199
As long as the project can get started,
of course it's good.

666
00:31:58,239 --> 00:31:59,839
I've even handled difficult client

667
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,160
like you.

668
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,079
Don't worry.

669
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,719
There's no problem
for me to handle your friend.

670
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:05,359
Thank you so much.

671
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,599
You've really been a great help.

672
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Do you know each other?

673
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,079
No.

674
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,359
Do you want to go to
another restaurant?

675
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,199
It's Ok. We can eat here.

676
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
The meeting lasted a long time
and you must be hungry.

677
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,280
What would you like to eat?

678
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:31,479
Your friend has been looking at you.

679
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,920
Aren't you going to say hi?

680
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,319
How about ordering a bottle of wine

681
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,400
to celebrate?

682
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,439
Waiter, a bottle of wine.

683
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:42,239
Why are we drinking wine
in the middle of the day?

684
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,280
Is it too much?

685
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:45,079
Why?

686
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,640
Can't we even celebrate
by drinking some wine?

687
00:32:48,439 --> 00:32:49,719
Please fill for us.

688
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,880
Mr. Liu, the first glass

689
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:58,640
is to thank you
for introducing me this business.

690
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,760
I will drink first.

691
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,920
Slow down.

692
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,640
Come on.

693
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,119
The second glass

694
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,920
is to thank you for

695
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,079
your support in this whole time.

696
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:20,560
Hi,

697
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,000
my name is Lei Yuzheng

698
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:23,280
and I'm her boyfriend.

699
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,199
What?

700
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:27,439
Can I sit there?

701
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,040
Excuse me, Mr. Liu.
Don't misunderstand it.

702
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,120
He's just a friend of mine.

703
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,520
It seems like you just knew each other.

704
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,679
You have no idea that

705
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,399
Du Xiaosu has really low tolerance

706
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,959
and very bad temper after getting drunk.

707
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,520
If she's drunk,

708
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,080
she might do something

709
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,520
that you wouldn't imagine.

710
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:57,879
We are talking about business today.
This is work.

711
00:33:58,199 --> 00:33:59,919
Haven't we talked about this?

712
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,919
No matter where you are,

713
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,080
as long as you are drinking,

714
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,399
I need to be there.

715
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,080
Please don't interrupt us.

716
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:07,000
You need to be more careful
when you work.

717
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,399
I'll be here today.

718
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,919
Go ahead and drink as much as you want.

719
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,840
If you get drunk and act stupid,

720
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,159
I will handle it.

721
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,239
Excuse us, Mr. Liu.

722
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,239
Excuse my absence.

723
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,879
Lei Yuzheng,
I'm having meal with my friend.

724
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,879
Why did you come to sit next to us?

725
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,919
What are you trying to do?

726
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,959
I have very important
thing to say to you.

727
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,439
You have very important
thing to say to me?

728
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,719
Do I have to listen?

729
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:40,520
You don't have to.

730
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,760
But you cannot use the time
that you were supposed to meet me

731
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:42,879
to meet other people.

732
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,520
Who are you to me?

733
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,399
Why would you care who I meet?

734
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,800
Who am I to you?

735
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:49,080
Follow me if you want to know.

736
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
I don't want to go with you.

737
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,280
Let me go.

738
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,919
Please let her go.

739
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:55,919
Didn't you hear that

740
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,280
she doesn't want to leave with you?

741
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:58,959
Please let her go.

742
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:03,959
Sir,

743
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,399
I haven't asked you.

744
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,479
How did you two know each other?

745
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,840
For how long?

746
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you know who I am to her?

747
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,479
If you want to be responsible for her,

748
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,560
you shouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

749
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,760
I don't have to explain it to you.

750
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,840
It has reached my limit that

751
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,520
you got close to her while I was gone.

752
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,120
Hope that you know the limitations.

753
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,080
Lei Yuzheng, who do you think you are?

754
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,239
You come and leave whenever you want.

755
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,280
What do you think of me as?

756
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:29,600
Your toy?

757
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,879
Does it have anything to do with you

758
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,840
that I meet other people?

759
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,320
Why did you query my friend?

760
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,959
You're looking for excitement? Fine.

761
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,560
Go find other people instead of me.

762
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:39,280
Excuse me, Mr. Liu.

763
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,360
It must be ridiculous to you.

764
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,719
Let's go and continue the meal.

765
00:35:41,959 --> 00:35:42,919
Bye, friend.

766
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,399
What are you doing?

767
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,239
Lei Yuzheng!

768
00:35:50,479 --> 00:35:51,520
Lei Yuzheng, let me go!

769
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,000
What are you doing, Lei Yuzheng?

770
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,560
Let me go!

771
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,399
Du Xiaosu,

772
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,719
calm down and listen to me.

773
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,760
What do I need to listen?

774
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:03,639
Are you trying to apologize to me?

775
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,479
What do you think of me as?

776
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,360
Your toy?

777
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
Do I have to accept if you apologize?

778
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,239
I've been waiting for you every day

779
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,360
and I was so scared.

780
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,080
I wanted to call you so bad,

781
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,560
but every time I made the call,

782
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
I was so afraid.

783
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,520
I was afraid
that you were with other people.

784
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,600
What do you want me to do?

785
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,239
If you want to break up, just say it.

786
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,159
Just tell me.

787
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,760
I'm not a hard case,

788
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:34,320
and I will agree.

789
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,399
But you made me wait

790
00:36:37,919 --> 00:36:39,320
and you made me guess.

791
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,239
I'm not you and

792
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:43,760
there's no way that
I would know what you're thinking.

793
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,159
It doesn't seem like

794
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:48,800
you are trying to apologize today,

795
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,639
right?

796
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,159
You just want to

797
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,639
make yourself feel better.

798
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,280
You have no idea what I've been through

799
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,520
or what's so painful for me.
