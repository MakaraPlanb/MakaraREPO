16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,839
Xiangyuan, how come you are here?

17
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,080
You're having reexamination tomorrow.

18
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,279
I'm a little worried.

19
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,199
So, I stopped by to see
how you are doing.

20
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,960
How about I call the day off tomorrow

21
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
and come with you?

22
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
It's okay.

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,559
My dad will go with me tomorrow.

24
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,479
You should go focusing on your work.

25
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,759
There's nothing to focus on.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
The most important thing
I want to focus on right now

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,240
is you.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,960
Xiangyuan,

29
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,839
do you think I will get better?

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,279
Of course you will.

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,880
Fanlv,

32
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,880
don't think too much.

33
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,960
Don't worry.

34
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,479
No matter what happens,

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,000
I will be with you

36
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,679
until you get better.

37
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:39,399
So,

38
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,600
don't be stressful.

39
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,039
Sleep well.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,839
The sun will rise as always tomorrow.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,839
Good girl. Sleep.

42
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,079
Xiangyuan.

43
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:34,920
Dad.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
Did Fanlv fall asleep?

45
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,880
Yes, she did.

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,880
It's pretty late already.
You should sleep soon too.

47
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,040
Did you see Yuzheng

48
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,399
at the company these days?

49
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,679
Yes, I did.

50
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,359
Did he

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,279
say anything to you?

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,559
Xiangyuan,

53
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,440
now Yuzheng is back to Yutian.

54
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,320
Besides the Entertainment Center,

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,480
there are also many other
reformations that Yutian

56
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
is planning to do.

57
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,839
Now, it's the time that Yutian needs
as many talents as possible.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,279
I hope that you could

59
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,119
let go of what's on your mind

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,640
and dedicate in your work.

61
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,320
Dad,

62
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,880
I also want to dedicate in work.

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,440
But now Lei Yuzheng is back,

64
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,040
do you think that he wants me to stay?

65
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Xiangyuan,

66
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,559
I understand your worries.

67
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,279
If you don't feel comfortable
staying at Yutian,

68
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,079
come to Xinsheng.

69
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,600
You are familiar with our business

70
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,880
after all.

71
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,239
It's also easy for you to

72
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,079
achieve your goals.

73
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,519
Dad,

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,320
I can't answer it now.

75
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:53,959
Xiangyuan,

76
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
are you still worrying about that?

77
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,000
If it's hard for you to say,

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,640
I can go for you

79
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,200
and beg Lei Yuzheng to let you off.

80
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,760
Dad,

81
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,119
please don't do that.

82
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,320
Under the current circumstances,

83
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,600
I deserve however Lei Yuzheng

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,279
plans to do with me.

85
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:15,839
But...

86
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,839
Dad,

87
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,480
Fanlv needs to do
reexamination tomorrow.

88
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,239
You should rest early.

89
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,239
Siqi.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,880
What happened? You seem so down.

91
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,359
Tell me.

92
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,359
Huanhuan,

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,959
why hasn't Qunfei proposed to me yet?

94
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,320
Still not?

95
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,959
He's acting so slow.

96
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:47,880
He wouldn't run away, would he?

97
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:51,160
Well, there's no woman
who wants to be left single.

98
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,640
But men don't want to

99
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
settle down too soon.

100
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,200
It's not always like that.

101
00:06:58,359 --> 00:07:00,239
I feel that He Qunfei

102
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,720
is not one of them.

103
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,359
He wants to settle down
much more than I do.

104
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:07,000
He has prepared the
ring a long time ago.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's just that

106
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't know what he's afraid of.

107
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,200
Is he afraid that
I spend money too recklessly

108
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,839
or that I won't treat his parents well?

109
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,000
It's pointless for us to make guesses.

110
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,640
If you really want to know,

111
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,399
you need to test him.

112
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,399
Test him?

113
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,839
How?

114
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,279
Have you heard of Linton?

115
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,239
He's one of the top management
at the famous S.G. company,

116
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:39,600
and he has been working at Wall Street
since he was in his twentieth.

117
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,480
Have you heard of Hengshan Funds?

118
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,119
Let me tell you, darling.

119
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,839
The managers there have

120
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,720
achieved financial
freedom earlier than others.

121
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,959
However, those people combining together

122
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,200
won't be a match of our Mr. Lei.

123
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,600
Siqi,

124
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,119
after this hard fight,

125
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,000
I, He Qunfei, will be noted

126
00:08:01,239 --> 00:08:03,760
on the acquisition-resistance
history in China.

127
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,600
That's fantastic.

128
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Now, I finally know why

129
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,440
you won't want to leave Yutian.

130
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,040
Every time you talk about Yutian,

131
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,399
you look so different.

132
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:16,279
So handsome and so cool.

133
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:17,640
Darling, don't praise me please.

134
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,200
I'm not used to it.

135
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Please keep cursing me.

136
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:21,959
Why would I curse you?

137
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,519
My He Qunfei is so good.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
I won't curse you.

139
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,040
Because behind
every single successful man,

140
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,839
there's a woman

141
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,359
who keeps nagging.

142
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,039
Then, would this successful man

143
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:36,440
abandon this woman behind him?

144
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,559
How come?

145
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,320
Am I that kind of person?

146
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't think you are.

147
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,799
Then, since we have decided to

148
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,919
walk together with each other,

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,760
shall we start planning

150
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,919
our future?

151
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,159
What future?

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,640
Our future!

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,880
He Qunfei, it's so hard
to understand your thoughts.

154
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:01,840
Why?

155
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,280
You're so bad at picking places.

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,640
BBQ restaurant is not suitable for this.

157
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,239
Sir, here's the wine that you ordered.

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,359
Sorry, but I didn't order it.

159
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,239
What?

160
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,400
You didn't order it?

161
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm sorry, sir and madam. It was my mistake.

162
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:17,840
Over there.

163
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,760
Sorry about that.

164
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,320
Do you want to marry me?

165
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,359
Yes, I do.

166
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:48,320
How happy they are.

167
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,200
Yeah.

168
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,559
What do you think
these people are thinking

169
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,159
when they propose at a BBQ restaurant?

170
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,119
Do you think they lost their mind?

171
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,239
Such idiots.

172
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,239
They are not idiots.

173
00:09:58,359 --> 00:09:59,719
I am.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,520
Hold on. We are just having meal.

175
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,039
Why do you start talking
bad about yourself?

176
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:04,200
What's wrong with that?

177
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,119
I'm the most stupid idiot in the world

178
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,119
to know you.

179
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,200
Wait, Siqi, what's about me?

180
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,719
Look at them.

181
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,960
Eating BBQ while listening to music.
How happy are they.

182
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,359
If you like violin, we can order it too.

183
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,880
It's not violin that I like.

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,719
It's the atmosphere.

185
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,479
Vibe. Alright?

186
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,320
But violin doesn't really match

187
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,640
BBQ restaurant, right?

188
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
It's so oily and loud everywhere.

189
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,880
There's also this BBQ sound.

190
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,159
Even if the violin sounds so nice,

191
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,200
can you hear it?

192
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,239
I would still enjoy it even
if I can't hear it.

193
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,159
What? Look at them.

194
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,400
How happy they are!

195
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,520
Because I measured
the size of your hand.

196
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:43,760
Do you like it?

197
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,760
Are they happy? I don't see it.

198
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,119
Although she looks

199
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,919
quiet and low-key,

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,799
I can tell from her face that

201
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,919
she's eager to get married.

202
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,880
Look at that guy.

203
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,599
Although his appearance is average,

204
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,080
he has high EQ.

205
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,039
One proposed and the other answered.

206
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,159
What a connection! So enviable.

207
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,239
Come on, darling.

208
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,799
Eat meat. It's just cooked.

209
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's not look at other places
when we eat.

210
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,280
In case it will affect our appetite.

211
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,799
All you think about is eating.

212
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
Look. This little face has gotten even
thinner because you starved yourself.

213
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,599
You're so annoying.

214
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
Wait. Why are you mad again, Siqi?

215
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,280
I'm done. I'm full. Leaving now.

216
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,400
Come on.
We haven't finished the meat, darling.

217
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,719
Siqi.

218
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,719
Siqi.

219
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,440
What's wrong, Siqi?

220
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,760
I just want to know

221
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,599
what I am to you.

222
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,919
You are the most important woman

223
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,719
to me in my life.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,400
There're so many important women,

225
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,520
including your mom.

226
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:45,119
This is so vague.

227
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,119
Siqi,

228
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,640
I know what you are trying to say.

229
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
You know?

230
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,359
Then, why don't you do anything?

231
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,880
Of course I understand you.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,880
But just because I do,

233
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't want to say it easily.

234
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,479
He Qunfei,

235
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,239
did you have a change of heart?

236
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,280
How could I, Siqi?

237
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,799
I love you too much.

238
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,599
So,

239
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:12,679
I cannot say it easily

240
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,719
or promise anything.

241
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,919
If I cannot even buy a house for you,

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,840
how can I propose to you?

243
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,679
House?

244
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,159
Your biggest dream

245
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,840
is to own a house in Shanghai.

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,599
If I cannot even offer you

247
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,719
a place to stay,

248
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:31,640
how can I bring you happiness?

249
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,039
I've finally understood

250
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
what house means to you.

251
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
When a woman marries to a man,

252
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,359
the most important
thing is the sense of safety.

253
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,919
Having a house

254
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,719
will give you at least half of it.

255
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,039
Even if you don't mention it now,

256
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,200
I still can't easily

257
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
propose to you.

258
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:00,039
What do you think?

259
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,168
(Teacher Sun)

260
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Teacher Sun,

261
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
it's been a while.

262
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,479
How are you and the kids?

263
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,960
We are all doing good, Xiaosu.

264
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,280
I'm calling to share a great news.

265
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,919
Our school has been moved to the town.

266
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,320
Kids were so happy

267
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,599
when they heard about this.

268
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:30,799
That is awesome!

269
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,039
Then kids can

270
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,200
focus on studying now.

271
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:36,080
There's one more thing.

272
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,400
My tenure will end soon.

273
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,239
You may not be able to see me

274
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,679
next time when you come to the island.

275
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,520
What do you mean?

276
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,239
Are you going back to your hometown?

277
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,159
Yeah.

278
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,679
I plan to be a civil servant.

279
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,559
My girlfriend has also come back to me.

280
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,320
We plan to get married next year.

281
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,239
I see. Congratulations!

282
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,599
You will be the bridegroom.

283
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,719
Thank you, Xiaosu.

284
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,280
I assume you
and Yuzheng are also getting married soon.

285
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,960
What happened on the island
was so memorable.

286
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,679
It was really nice to

287
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,119
know you and Yuzheng.

288
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,640
Xiaosu,

289
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,280
don't forget to come to
my wedding ceremony

290
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,679
together with Yuzheng.

291
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,799
Okay.

292
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,159
No problem.

293
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,760
We will be there for sure.

294
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,719
Doctor,

295
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,559
how is it?

296
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,719
Based on the current condition,

297
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,520
Miss Jiang is basically recovered.

298
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,559
Doctor, thank you so much.

299
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,039
It's our responsibility
to cure patients.

300
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,000
But seeing that Miss Jiang can recover

301
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,400
in such short period of time,

302
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,479
the caring from family
made a huge contribution,

303
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,080
especially Mr. Lin.

304
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,760
It's Miss Jiang's luck to

305
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,840
have him who can persist until now.

306
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,640
Thank you so much, doctor.

307
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,520
You're welcome.

308
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,440
Thank you!

309
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,799
Now, you've recovered.

310
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,039
My mission has been completed.

311
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,359
I want to pack my stuff and move back.

312
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,400
Xiangyuan,

313
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,280
actually, you don't have to move.

314
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,119
Fanlv, it makes me very happy

315
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:41,080
to see you recover.

316
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,039
I want to go back home to check my mom,

317
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,880
and then

318
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,280
go to where I belong to.

319
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,239
Now, it's time for me to pay the debt.

320
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
Do you have to do this?

321
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,960
Is there any other way?

322
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
I can ask Yuzheng for help.

323
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,719
No, it's ok.

324
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,239
If we are still husband and wife,

325
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,200
please don't do that.

326
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,159
Let's go back home first.

327
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,400
Have a dinner before you leave.

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,799
Let's go.

329
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,119
Mr. Lei, here's the list
for the victory banquet.

330
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,719
Excuse me.

331
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,679
Hello.

332
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,840
No, no, no. It's too expensive.

333
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,880
Please let me know
when there's cheaper one.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,400
Ok. Thanks!

335
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,239
Are you buying a house?

336
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,200
Do you need my help?

337
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
Mr. Lei, I'm not buying it.

338
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm just checking the price.

339
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:09,439
Are you still blaming me

340
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,479
for not helping you
buy the house last time?

341
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,199
No.

342
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,079
I know that,

343
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,400
as your assistant,

344
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,359
I shouldn't make this exemption.

345
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,040
I should be the model for others.

346
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Ah right, Mr. Lei.

347
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,119
Have you checked the list?

348
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,560
We can just invite a few friends.

349
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,640
There doesn't have to be
a lot of people.

350
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,400
Ok.

351
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,000
Then,

352
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:39,719
shall we invite Xiaosu?

353
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,359
I can tell that you've been having hard
time concentrating on work recently.

354
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,760
Do I look distracted?

355
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,000
No, that's not what I mean.

356
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,319
So,

357
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,599
shall we invite Du Xiaosu?

358
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,959
Ok, I see. I will do it right away.

359
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,400
Fanlv,

360
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,479
are you full?

361
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,719
You should get rest if you are full.

362
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,680
There's something
I'd like to talk with dad.

363
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:35,959
Ok.

364
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,520
Xiangyuan,

365
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,920
what can't you say in front of Fanlv?

366
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,280
Dad,

367
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,400
Fanlv's illness has just recovered.

368
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,520
I don't want her to worry about me.

369
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,880
I've made up my mind.

370
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,560
For what?

371
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,920
I'd rather quit myself

372
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,000
and undertake the responsibility
for my mistakes,

373
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:11,000
than being chased away by Lei Yuzheng.

374
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,319
It's easy to quit.

375
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,920
But regarding undertaking
the responsibility,

376
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
how do you plan to do that?

377
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,079
Don't you know that

378
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,359
you need to go to jail

379
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,199
if you want to do it.

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,599
Fanlv has just recovered,

381
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
and she cannot be irritated more.

382
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,239
You are the only one

383
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:34,160
who she cannot live without

384
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,239
besides me.

385
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,079
If you go to jail,

386
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,040
she will get hurt.

387
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,640
Dad,

388
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,160
I've been living in fear every day.

389
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,479
Every time I see Lei Yuzheng,

390
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,000
I couldn't even look at his eyes.

391
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,719
I'm a culprit to him.

392
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:56,920
But it's been a while already.

393
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,920
If Lei Yuzheng wants you to pay for it,

394
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,560
he would've done it already.

395
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,560
He wouldn't have waited this long.

396
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,280
It doesn't matter what he thinks.

397
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,359
I have to undertake the responsibility

398
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,439
for what I have done.

399
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,199
Please don't try to change my mind.

400
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,599
I have decided.

401
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,520
Xiangyuan,

402
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,680
I'm happy that

403
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,319
you choose to do this,

404
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,760
because it means that

405
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,000
you've become mature.

406
00:20:27,719 --> 00:20:28,800
A man should be responsible

407
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,239
for his own actions.

408
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,199
But

409
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,719
you are my son-in-law,

410
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,400
and I cannot watch

411
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,199
you go through it.

412
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:43,680
I cannot just let you be.

413
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,400
I've fought my life just to

414
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,719
see you two happy together.

415
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,760
I was hoping that one day
I could embrace my grandson.

416
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,040
Dad,

417
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,520
I'm sorry to you,

418
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,359
and I'm sorry to Fanlv.

419
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:01,479
No,

420
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,479
I have to talk to Lei Yuzheng.

421
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,560
Dad, please.

422
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,680
Let me handle this myself.

423
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,439
I will walk you out.

424
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:35,160
Xiangyuan,

425
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,959
have you really made up your mind?

426
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,040
Actually, everyone makes mistakes,

427
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,280
and you should give yourself a chance.

428
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,280
Fanlv,

429
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,280
you don't need to persuade me.

430
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,680
I've decided.

431
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,160
Not just you,

432
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
I'm also talking about myself.

433
00:21:57,719 --> 00:21:58,640
You?

434
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,000
What did you do?

435
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,239
I've been spoiled since I was a kid.

436
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,800
No one dared to violate my wills.

437
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,479
At that time,

438
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,119
I've let off all the emotions

439
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,839
on you.

440
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:11,880
All on you.

441
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,599
I've done a lot of stupid things.

442
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
You didn't blame me and

443
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,160
you still gave me chances.

444
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,359
I promised you that

445
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,719
I would spoil you.

446
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,839
It's unfortunate
that I didn't keep my promise.

447
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,719
Even if you torture me,

448
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,599
I would be happy to take it.

449
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,160
Just because you were too good to me,

450
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
I was spoiled like that.

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,680
I wanted to keep spoiling you

452
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
and be next to you.

453
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:45,880
But I broke my promise.

454
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
I am not a good husband.

455
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,160
You just recovered,

456
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:52,760
and I shouldn't have

457
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,680
mentioned about this to you.

458
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,439
What is it?

459
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,719
Before I confess to Lei Yuzheng,

460
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,599
let's get divorced.

461
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,959
Xiangyuan…

462
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,119
If you are done with thinking,

463
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,520
let me know any time.

464
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,359
Xiangyuan,

465
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,439
do you regret marrying me?

466
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,319
Of course not.

467
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,959
Although we've fought and argued,

468
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,560
strangely every time when

469
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,319
I close my eyes,

all I see is our best memories.

471
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,119
I still remember how you looked like
in the wedding dress.

472
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:45,719
You were so stunning,

473
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,760
and you were willing to marry me.

474
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,920

if there's such exciting thing

492
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,760
you have to let me know.

493

This time, thanks to you,

Si Yang and Ye.

496
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,400
Yuzheng,

497
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,680
if you want to thank people,

498
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,520
leave Shangguan out of it.

499
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
I would move faster

500
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,319
without this guy.

501
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,359
Ye has got the point.

502
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:09,640
By having him,

503
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
we have significantly improved

504

the IQ level of our think tank.

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,359
Come on. Cheers!

Wait. You jerk!

508
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,920
Mr. Lei, here's the gift from Xu You.

509
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,680
(Congratulations. Congratulations
to Yutian. Wish you all the best!)

510
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,160
Xu You has really
put a lot of thought into this.

511
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,239
She has saved Yutian

512
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
in the hardest time.

513
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,640
She's such a hero with soft heart.

514
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,719
Such a pity.

515
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,520
Bro, Xu You is such a

516
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,079
good match with you.

517
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,479
If I were you,
we would have married her already.

518
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,319
Just because she's a nice person,

519
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,160
I don't want to hurt her again.

520
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,599
Actually,

521
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,239
Xu You and I are more like comrades

522
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:03,680
who are still friends
after the war is finished.

523
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,280
I feel that my bro

524
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:07,599
is truly himself when

525
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,520
he's with Xu You.

526
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
What made you say that?

527
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
Because he has the

528
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,439
aura of coldness

529
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,319
at that time.

530
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,959
But when he's with Du Xiaosu,

531
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:23,640
he seemed to be

532
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,239
not like himself.

533
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,599
What?

534
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,920
Warmth.

535
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,680
What's wrong with warmth?

536
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,000
It's so much better than coldness.

537
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,160
There's this saying, "lonely at the top".

538
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,319
Let me tell you all.

539
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,400
In every man's heart,

540
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,000
there's an ideal type.

541
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,479
Look, Yuzheng has changed. Why?

542
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,640
Because he met the right person.

543
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,920
Xu You. Right.

544
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,880
She is elegant, wise and attractive.

545
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,119
But Du Xiaosu sometimes

546
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:53,160
acts dumb.

547
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,520
What do you call it? Innocent.

548
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,439
If I were him, I would like it too.

549
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,160
Wait, Yuzheng.

550
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm just drawing an analogy.
Don't get mad.

551
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:03,319
This kind of stuff

552
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:04,760
can only be perceived by

553
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,280
mature men like Yuzheng and me.

554
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,839
Shangguan,

555
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,199
you're still young
and you need to learn more.

556
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,040
Women like Xu You

557
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,680
will never place her future

558
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,880
on some men.

559
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,560
She would only give hints and run away.

560
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:22,599
What do you call it?

561
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:25,359
One sets up the trap
while the other falls into the snare.

562
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,319
Such push-and-pull in relationships

563
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,000
is so much fun.

564
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,520
Are you coming to celebrate?

565
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,640
Especially you, Shangguan.

566
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,040
You're so talkative today.

567
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:36,520
Haven't you drunk enough?

568
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,359
Of course I haven't.

569
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,040
Come on.

570
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,000
Come on.

571
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,040
Cheers.

572
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:45,839
Why does this wine from 1982

573
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:49,040
taste so sour?

574
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,640
Thank you for the gift you
sent the other day.

575
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,439
I really appreciate it this whole time.

576
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,239
We don't have to be
so polite to each other.

577
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,079
There's one thing
that I've been curious about.

578
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,760
We've seen each other
so often these days,

579
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,680
but I've never seen your girlfriend

580
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,719
called you or

581
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,040
texted you.

582
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:17,319
Can I take it as

583
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:19,880
that your girlfriend doesn't exist?

584
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,640
I was too busy

585
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,000
to contact her proactively.

586
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,319
We seem more like a couple

587
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,040
since we are together every day.

588
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Yeah.

589
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,599
It's not right for me

590
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,599
to spend every day with you.

591
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,079
It's preventing you
from meeting the right person.

592
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,719
Laurence Bloch has said that,

593
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,400
even the richest person and

594
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,400
the most successful person in this world

595
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,959
might run into a woman
who doesn't love him

596
00:28:51,199 --> 00:28:52,680
and a mountain
that he would never be able to climb up.

597
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,400
Are you trying to suggest that

598
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,719
my affection
for Du Xiaosu is one-sided love?

599
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm not talking about you.

600
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,479
I'm talking about myself.

601
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,800
Actually, I came here today

602
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,560
to get an answer.

603
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,319
Xu You,

604
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,880
my choice has never changed
from the beginning.

605
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,959
It seems like I have misunderstood it.

606
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,160
We've been together often
during this whole time.

607
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,439
I thought

608
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,199
we might be possible.

609
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,400
Xu You,

610
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,280
when I was at my worst time,

611
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:28,079
you helped me unconditionally.

612
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,839
I really appreciate your help.

613
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:32,119
It's my honor to have

614
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,520
a friend like you.

615
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,920
In future, we will
always be good friends.

616
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,119
It's just that I've never imagined that

617
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:40,359
this person would be Du Xiaosu.

618
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,719
Goodbye.

619
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,160
I've thought about it for a long time.

621
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Getting divorced is for your best.

622
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,839
Since now you've recovered,

623
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,640
there's no reason for me to stay.

624
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,839
I should give your freedom back.

625
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,040
Why did Xiangyuan move out?

626
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,400
I've tried to persuade him,

627
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,479
but I couldn't refute

628
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:29,719
what he said.

629
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
It's time to let go of him.

630
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
Let go of him?

631
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,680
Daughter,

632
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,160
are you two getting divorced?

633
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,479
Is it his idea or it's yours?

634
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,839
It's a decision of both of us.

635
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
My girl,

636
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,239
dad can also see that

637
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,280
you don't want to let him go.

638
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,680
You too, right?

639
00:31:09,719 --> 00:31:11,359
But now I get it.

640
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:13,839
Loving someone

641
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,520
means respecting his choice.

642
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,599
Since you've made up your mind,

643
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,520
then let him go.

644
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,479
I've done everything

645
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,719
that I could.

646
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,239
Dad,

647
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,359
did you go to beg Yuzheng?

648
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,160
I went to talk to him,

649
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,400
but

650
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,359
he didn't feel like talking about it.

651
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,880
Does he want to revenge?

652
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,319
I am getting old,

653
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,319
and I couldn't really tell

654
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,640
what you young people are thinking.

655
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:02,359
Under the current situation,

656
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,560
we could only follow the fate.

657
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,520
This friend of mine

658
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,800
has very high standard of vision.

659
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,119
There's never been any designer

660
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,439
who could satisfy him.

661
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:25,359
But after he saw your project,

662
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,800
he appointed you for the design.

663
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,239
I don't know whether it's good

664
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,640
for you or not.

665
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,199
As long as the project can get started,
of course it's good.

666
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,839
I've even handled difficult client

667
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,160
like you.

668
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,079
Don't worry.

669
00:32:37,239 --> 00:32:38,719
There's no problem
for me to handle your friend.

670
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,359
Thank you so much.

671
00:32:40,479 --> 00:32:41,599
You've really been a great help.

672
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
Do you know each other?

673
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,079
No.

674
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,359
Do you want to go to
another restaurant?

675
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,199
It's Ok. We can eat here.

676
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,880
The meeting lasted a long time
and you must be hungry.

677
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,280
What would you like to eat?

678
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,479
Your friend has been looking at you.

679
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,920
Aren't you going to say hi?

680
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,319
How about ordering a bottle of wine

681
00:33:11,479 --> 00:33:12,400
to celebrate?

682
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,439
Waiter, a bottle of wine.

683
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,239
Why are we drinking wine
in the middle of the day?

684
00:33:17,439 --> 00:33:18,280
Is it too much?

685
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,079
Why?

686
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,640
Can't we even celebrate
by drinking some wine?

687
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,719
Please fill for us.

688
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,880
Mr. Liu, the first glass

689
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,640
is to thank you
for introducing me this business.

690
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,760
I will drink first.

691
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,920
Slow down.

692
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
Come on.

693
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,119
The second glass

694
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,920
is to thank you for

695
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:50,079
your support in this whole time.

696
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,560
Hi,

697
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,000
my name is Lei Yuzheng

698
00:33:57,199 --> 00:33:58,280
and I'm her boyfriend.

699
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,199
What?

700
00:34:01,479 --> 00:34:02,439
Can I sit there?

701
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,040
Excuse me, Mr. Liu.
Don't misunderstand it.

702
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,120
He's just a friend of mine.

703
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,520
It seems like you just knew each other.

704
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,679
You have no idea that

705
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,399
Du Xiaosu has really low tolerance

706
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,959
and very bad temper after getting drunk.

707
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,520
If she's drunk,

708
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,080
she might do something

709
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,520
that you wouldn't imagine.

710
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,879
We are talking about business today.
This is work.

711
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,919
Haven't we talked about this?

712
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,919
No matter where you are,

713
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,080
as long as you are drinking,

714
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,399
I need to be there.

715
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,080
Please don't interrupt us.

716
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,000
You need to be more careful
when you work.

717
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,399
I'll be here today.

718
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:46,919
Go ahead and drink as much as you want.

719
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,840
If you get drunk and act stupid,

720
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,159
I will handle it.

721
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,239
Excuse us, Mr. Liu.

722
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,239
Excuse my absence.

723
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,879
Lei Yuzheng,
I'm having meal with my friend.

724
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,879
Why did you come to sit next to us?

725
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,919
What are you trying to do?

726
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,959
I have very important
thing to say to you.

727
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:13,439
You have very important
thing to say to me?

728
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,719
Do I have to listen?

729
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:15,520
You don't have to.

730
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,760
But you cannot use the time
that you were supposed to meet me

731
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:17,879
to meet other people.

732
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,520
Who are you to me?

733
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,399
Why would you care who I meet?

734
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:22,800
Who am I to you?

735
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:24,080
Follow me if you want to know.

736
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,159
I don't want to go with you.

737
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
Let me go.

738
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,919
Please let her go.

739
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:30,919
Didn't you hear that

740
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,280
she doesn't want to leave with you?

741
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:33,959
Please let her go.

742
00:35:37,959 --> 00:35:38,959
Sir,

743
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:41,399
I haven't asked you.

744
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,479
How did you two know each other?

745
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,840
For how long?

746
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,000
Do you know who I am to her?

747
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,479
If you want to be responsible for her,

748
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,560
you shouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

749
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
I don't have to explain it to you.

750
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,840
It has reached my limit that

751
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,520
you got close to her while I was gone.

752
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,120
Hope that you know the limitations.

753
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,080
Lei Yuzheng, who do you think you are?

754
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,239
You come and leave whenever you want.

755
00:36:02,439 --> 00:36:03,280
What do you think of me as?

756
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,600
Your toy?

757
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,879
Does it have anything to do with you

758
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,840
that I meet other people?

759
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,320
Why did you query my friend?

760
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,959
You're looking for excitement? Fine.

761
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:11,560
Go find other people instead of me.

762
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,280
Excuse me, Mr. Liu.

763
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,360
It must be ridiculous to you.

764
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,719
Let's go and continue the meal.

765
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,919
Bye, friend.

766
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,399
What are you doing?

767
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,239
Lei Yuzheng!

768
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:26,520
Lei Yuzheng, let me go!

769
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,000
What are you doing, Lei Yuzheng?

770
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,560
Let me go!

771
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,399
Du Xiaosu,

772
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,719
calm down and listen to me.

773
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,760
What do I need to listen?

774
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:38,639
Are you trying to apologize to me?

775
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,479
What do you think of me as?

776
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:44,360
Your toy?

777
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,320
Do I have to accept if you apologize?

778
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,239
I've been waiting for you every day

779
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:50,360
and I was so scared.

780
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:53,080
I wanted to call you so bad,

781
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,560
but every time I made the call,

782
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,120
I was so afraid.

783
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,520
I was afraid
that you were with other people.

784
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,600
What do you want me to do?

785
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,239
If you want to break up, just say it.

786
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,159
Just tell me.

787
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,760
I'm not a hard case,

788
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,320
and I will agree.

789
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,399
But you made me wait

790
00:37:12,919 --> 00:37:14,320
and you made me guess.

791
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,239
I'm not you and

792
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:18,760
there's no way that
I would know what you're thinking.

793
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,159
It doesn't seem like

794
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,800
you are trying to apologize today,

795
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,639
right?

796
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,159
You just want to

797
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,639
make yourself feel better.

798
00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:30,280
You have no idea what I've been through

799
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,520
or what's so painful for me.
