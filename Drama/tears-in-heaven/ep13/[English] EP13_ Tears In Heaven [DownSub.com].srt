Be careful!

Jump!

18
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,679
I will catch you!

19
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,119
Get out of the way! Watch out!
I might hurt you!

20
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,800
Try me.

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
I didn't expect this.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,839
You must have done this a lot
when you were a kid, right?

23
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,679
Same to you.

24
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,080
This is our primary school.

25
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:55,759
The lawn in front of you

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,839
was a bike shed.

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,080
All the teachers' bikes were
parked over there.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,600
If criticized by the teacher,

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,199
we would sneak into the shed,

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,119
and deflate all the tires of his bike.

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,199
You and Shao Zhenrong were so naughty
when you were kids.

32
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,559
You two

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,720
must have messed around, right?

34
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,880
Same to you.

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,759
What are you doing?

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Treasure hunt.

37
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,440
Treasure hunt?

38
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:45,880
When we were at school,

39
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:49,360
it was very popular among the students
to bury the time capsule.

40
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,880
Zhenrong and I

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
also buried one here
just like they did.

42
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:19,799
You wanna give it to me?

43
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,559
This is the memory of Zhenrong and me.

44
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,880
Take a look.

45
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,440
We used to agree that when we were old,

46
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,839
we would come to this tree
and dig it out.

47
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,519
We'll never

48
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,720
be able to keep the promise.

49
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,519
I knew

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,559
you two were naughty boys.

51
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:10,320
Why are you laughing?

52
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,320
What is this?

53
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:15,839
Zhenrong won it.

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,239
I didn't know

55
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,359
Zhenrong could swim.

56
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,880
The last thing he could do was swimming.

57
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,519
He couldn't swim at all.

58
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,519
Then how did he swim
and even win a medal?

59
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:37,399
He should thank me for kicking him out.

60
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,760
You were so mean to him.

61
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,000
As long as we were back home,

62
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,640
he complained to Aunt Shao and my dad.

63
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,640
My dad gave me a very good lesson.

64
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,799
You didn't see that.

65
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,359
He was just hiding behind my dad.

66
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,760
You have no idea how happy he was.

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,000
Because of that kick,

68
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,480
he didn't talk to me for a month.

69
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,799
Since then he's never afraid of water.

70
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,760
It took him six months
to get admitted into the school team,

71
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,679
and won this medal.

72
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,079
So sorry for Zhenrong

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,959
to have you as his elder brother.

74
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:36,279
Miss Jiang,
we've been around this big mall

75
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,000
for two or three times.

76
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,559
My legs are getting thin already.

77
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,440
Isn't there any dress you like?

78
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,200
It's for the annual
convention of the group.

79
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,320
How can I just dress up carelessly

80
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,040
for attendance?

81
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,440
Either I don't show up,

82
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,079
or I shall be the focus
of the party.

83
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,959
Especially the attention of Yuzhen

84
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,279
has to lock on me and can't move away.

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,959
We haven't been to that store yet.

86
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,200
Hurry up!

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,640
Good for you! To be a brother.

88
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,559
You must've bullied

89
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,399
Shao Zhenrong a lot when you were kids.

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
We boys

91
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:21,119
fought for our relationship with fists.

92
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Besides,

93
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,920
the slightest disagreement
could make us fight.

94
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,959
I won every time.

95
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,839
Are you proud of bullying
your younger brother?

96
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,799
"I won every time". Come on!

97
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,720
He was my younger brother,
and I couldn't help with it.

98
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:42,559
I was the only one who
could bully him behind doors.

99
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:42,640
I was the only one who
could bully him behind doors.

100
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,119
In public,
nobody dared even try to touch him!

101
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:46,320
In public,
nobody dared even try to touch him!

102
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,880
Thank you for telling me all of this.

103
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,959
I can have the luck
to hear so much about his past.

104
00:07:58,239 --> 00:08:00,600
It's been a luxury for me.

105
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
A luxury?

106
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,399
I think

107
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
I should be the least qualified person

108
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,359
to hear about him.

109
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:15,600
If you're not qualified,

110
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,760
who else would care about the past.

111
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
I've always believed in that

112
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,119
energy is conserved in this world.

113
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,119
Time will make up for the pain of loss

114
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,640
in another way.

115
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,960
There is no pain that can't be healed.

116
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,760
And all the pains will end.

117
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,000
This remark.

118
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:48,080
Let's encourage each other.

119
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,479
Give me a hand.

120
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,280
Why?

121
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,159
Don't you want to keep it?

122
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,280
Just leave it here.

123
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,159
What if Zhenrong recollects the past
just like you,

124
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,760
and wanna come back
and have a look.

125
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,159
Let's go.

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Nice dress.

127
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,440
Sexy, elegant, and eye-catching.

128
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,320
It's definitely the focus.

129
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,799
But Yuzheng likes demure style.

130
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,239
This dress is too exposed.

131
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,239
No.

132
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,919
This one. This one is nice.

133
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,280
High-end and classy.

134
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:59,080
I think it's dull and old-fashioned.

135
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:01,440
If I stand next to him wearing this,

136
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,919
people might recognize me as his mother.

137
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,239
Forget it.

138
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,159
This one is nice.

139
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
Low-profile, luxurious,
but with connotation.

140
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
Lin Xiangyuan.

141
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,000
Lin Xiangyuan.

142
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,599
Only the lady as noble as Miss Jiang,

143
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,119
deserves this high-end evening dress.

144
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,679
Don't you think so, Mr. Lin?

145
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,239
Yes, you're right.

146
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,760
Miss Jiang, to be honest,

147
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,280
there are only two of this dress
in our store.

148
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,320
I'll take it.

149
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,280
Lin Xiangyuan, pay the bill.

150
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,520
What a robbery! 27,500 for one dress!

152
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,880
Mr. Lin,

153
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,320
this is a high-end dress,

154
00:12:42,599 --> 00:12:43,799
and the price is marked clearly.

155
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,719
No matter how high-end it is,
it can't be that expensive!

156
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,039
Can I have the invoice?

157
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,119
No problem.

158
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,119
Make the invoice to Yutian Group.

159
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,840
Office supplies for the content.

160
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,599
Lin Xiangyuan.

161
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Miss Jiang.

162
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,359
Miss Jiang?

163
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,799
Miss Jiang!

164
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,440
Miss Jiang!

165
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,359
Is everything ok?

166
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,239
Why are you angry suddenly?

167
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Lin Xiangyuan,

168
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
you've worked for my dad for years.

169
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,799
You are the company executive after all.

170
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,719
No matter what,
you shouldn't violate the principle.

171
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,280
Miss Jiang,

172
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,880
if you think I did something wrong,

173
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,880
just tell me, and I'll fix it.

174
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,960
Fix it? Don't you understand me?

175
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,479
Stop following me!

176
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,080
Go back!

177
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,520
How about this dress?

178
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,200
Didn't you just request an invoice?

179
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,799
Only the invoice.

180
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,880
What if the financial personnel
asks to look at the real item?

181
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,599
Besides, if I accept this dress,

182
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,239
is it from you or by myself?

183
00:13:58,479 --> 00:14:01,200
Because of this? You misunderstood me.

184
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,679
The invoice is to strike a balance.

185
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,799
It's also for the good of the company.

186
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,919
What? Not for rent?

187
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,840
Didn't we make a deal
during the daytime?

188
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,280
Why not?

189
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:20,799
What a bully you are!

190
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:23,359
I'm telling you! We'll see.

191
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,119
I will complain to Administration
for Market Regulation tomorrow!

192
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,640
Siqi, what happened?

193
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,000
Why are you packing?

194
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,960
The landlord came to inform us

195
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,840
this apartment is not for rent anymore.

196
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:38,080
The couple is going to
fake their divorce,

197
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,359
and sell this apartment.

198
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,799
So I called Qunfei,

199
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,960
and asked him to accompany me
to the agency for an apartment.

200
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
It went well,

201
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,080
and we had a deal that we could move in.

202
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,640
Then the agency called me
to break the deal.

203
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
What the hell!

204
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,200
With our budget,

205
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,239
where can we move, the suburbs?

206
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,359
Otherwise we can only
share room with others.

207
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
For God's sake!
What's wrong with all these people?

208
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,679
The landlord can't bully us like this!

209
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,960
The contract hasn't expired yet.

210
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,440
How can he just ask us to leave?

211
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,880
We're not moving!

212
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,119
No!

213
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,159
He owns the apartment.

214
00:15:17,359 --> 00:15:19,520
He asks you to leave tomorrow. Can you
stay till the day after tomorrow?

215
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
Take it easy, Siqi.

216
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,719
Don't worry.

217
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,000
Let me figure it out.

218
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,919
I still remember

219
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,960
when I go to college in Shanghai,

220
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,559
I honestly believed that

221
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:31,880
as long as I worked hard,

222
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:34,320
I could buy a big apartment of my own

223
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,559
next to Huangpu River.

224
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
But now,

225
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,840
it's been even a luxury

226
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,799
to rent my own home.

227
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,159
I'm listening.

228
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,440
Mr. Lei,

229
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:08,919
the thing is...

230
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,919
I'm going to propose to my girlfriend
this year.

231
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,760
Although we have a good relationship,

232
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,840
the apartment isn't ready yet.

233
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,280
Her family has been complaining
about this a lot.

234
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Besides,

235
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,359
the apartment is

236
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,400
more and more expensive.

237
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,280
I just want to ask you

238
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,840
whether our Yutian's property has

239
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,599
discount for the staff.

240
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,960
Have a seat.

241
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:38,479
Qunfei,

242
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,479
your girlfriend thinks

243
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,119
you won't get married
without an apartment?

244
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,320
It can't be put in that way.

245
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,440
Everyone wants to pursue
better material conditions.

246
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,400
When is marriage equal to an apartment?

247
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,640
You're such a man of integrity.

248
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,239
In her eyes,

249
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:57,719
aren't you even as good as an apartment?

250
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,960
If you marry a woman like this,

251
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,679
can you live a good life in the future?

252
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,479
I'm telling you,

253
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,199
love and money
don't conflict with each other.

254
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,560
However, as long as one party thinks

255
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,280
money is the decisive factor,

256
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,920
this relationship won't last long.

257
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,119
Just like the housing price now,

258
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,680
nobody knows when it'll change.

259
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,959
So I can't help you with this.

260
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,479
It's not because I'm inconsiderate.

261
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,719
It's because

262
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,239
I hope you go back and think about it.

263
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,040
Qunfei,

264
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,079
what happened?

265
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,199
Criticized by the boss?

266
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,280
Or in trouble at work?

267
00:17:55,439 --> 00:17:56,359
Family business.

268
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,160
No bright future for me.

269
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,000
Don't be upset in the early morning.

270
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,520
No big deal!

271
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,199
Have a coffee.

272
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,560
Perhaps I can help you out.

273
00:18:08,199 --> 00:18:08,959
Come on.

274
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Brother,

275
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,880
I have to speak for you.

276
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,400
Lei Yuzheng has been so unfair to you.

277
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,199
Isn't this

278
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,800
simple for him?

279
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,400
We can't put it this way.

280
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,719
I'm not capable enough.

281
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,599
I can't blame others.

282
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,000
How about Xiaosu?

283
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,359
Mr. Lei has returned her
that apartment, hasn't he?

284
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,119
Xiaosu,

285
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,800
she refused to live in that apartment.

286
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:39,959
Fine.

287
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,199
Why don't you go back

288
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,119
and tell your girlfriend and Xiaosu
not to worry.

289
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,239
I'll see what I can do.

290
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,439
Mr. Lin. It's...

291
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,280
It's not good.

292
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,599
Brother,

293
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,160
you can't ask this favor of Mr. Lei.

294
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,479
I can understand.

295
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,920
As a man,

296
00:18:55,479 --> 00:18:57,239
you shall keep the final bottom line

297
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,839
and dignity.

298
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
I have endured the pain

299
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,359
of no response to my call for help.

300
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,400
I don't care you laugh at me.

301
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,359
I used to be driven away
by the landlord.

302
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,439
Where did I sleep?

303
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,680
In the park.

304
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
We're on the same boat.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Take it easy.

306
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:17,560
Mr. Lin.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I... Come on.

308
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,999
(Zou Siqi)

309
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,199
Siqi.

310
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
He Qunfei, come over here right now!

311
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,119
Hurry up! Hurry up...

312
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,719
Fine, I get it.

313
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,359
Don't give me this.

314
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm telling you.

315
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,439
It's no use running out of your words.

316
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,199
We're divorcing!

317
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,760
The apartment is going to be sold!

318
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
Move out in three days!

319
00:19:55,479 --> 00:19:56,400
Not negotiable!

320
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,160
Mrs. Li,

321
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,479
you think it's for my own sake?

322
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,839
This is for the sake of you two.

323
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,239
I'm also doing a favor for both of you.

324
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,400
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,560
You haven't watched
any social news now, right?

326
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,439
So many people have faked their divorce
to buy a department.

327
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
You two have figured this out.

328
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,719
Abuse the system for formality.

329
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,640
But as long as it is sealed
by the office,

330
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
who can make it clear?

331
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,439
You are not a couple

332
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,479
any more.

333
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,439
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li.

334
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,640
The currently valid marriage law

335
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:30,280
has clarified the prenuptial property.

336
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,479
It's not relevant.

337
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,640
Dear Mrs. Li,

338
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,359
you really have to think about it.

339
00:20:35,719 --> 00:20:36,680
What if at the end,

340
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,439
you lose both your husband and money,

341
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,719
who are you turning to?

342
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,599
He?

343
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,839
He wouldn't dare even if I allow him.

344
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,719
Darling.

345
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,000
I think we should think it over.

346
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,040
She has made the point.

347
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,560
We've been living such a good life.

348
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,599
Why make a fuss

349
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,719
for an apartment? Don't you think so?

350
00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:02,079
Who are you with?

351
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,880
Look at yourself!

352
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
Can't you stare blankly
as long as there is beauty?

353
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,119
Don't you know what to do?

354
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,359
Who's the boss of this family?

355
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:11,199
I am!

356
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,359
We're divorcing!

357
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,439
Fuck off!

358
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,239
So disgraceful!

359
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,920
I've been used to you for so many years.

360
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,760
You're getting more and more ungrateful!

361
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,680
Don't you really think

362
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,400
I am a coward?

363
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,880
Look at this apartment!

364
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,400
It has become like a refugee camp.

365
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,400
Our son can't come back.

366
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:29,680
I have to cooperate with you to play.

367
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,439
The neighbours are all laughing at us.

368
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:33,319
For an apartment,

369
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,040
you campus belle has turned into

370
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,560
a domineering woman!

371
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:38,719
You want a divorce?

372
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:39,920
Fine!

373
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,839
Divorce!

374
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
Go to the office now!

375
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,000
If you're not coming,

376
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:45,119
you are

377
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,239
the domineering woman!

378
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,079
How dare you swear at me!

379
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:53,520
How dare you direct your anger at me!

380
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,719
How dare you get mad at me?

381
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,719
Divorce!

382
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,239
I can't live this anymore!

383
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,439
Oh, my!

384
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,000
Who's this for?

385
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,040
What's going on, baby?

386
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,599
What's going on? Baby. Let's go.

387
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,199
Go divorce! Who cares!

388
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,560
Well, well...

389
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:15,079
She's gone.

390
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:15,920
The lady has gone.

391
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,000
I thought
you really wanted to divorce me.

392
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,239
I was freaked out!

393
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,079
Have been acting with you, holy.

394
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
My husband is the best!

395
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
Shanghai's housing price
has been rising like looting.

396
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
I've checked around.

397
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:39,400
The one we're living now
is the best choice.

398
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,079
However,

399
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,479
we have to move out in three days.

400
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,439
Today I went to

401
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,119
the landlord to beg.

402
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,280
I saw Mr. Li

403
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,920
having a big fight with Mrs. Li.

404
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,680
Their fake divorce

405
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,079
may probably become true.

406
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,319
There is always a way.

407
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,800
It's not the third day yet.

408
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,280
There will be a way.

409
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,599
Right, Du Xiaosu has a good attitude.

410
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,160
Leave the well-furnished apartment there
as a decoration.

411
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:12,319
Live in the basement with others.

412
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,959
And play bitterness.

413
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,640
Awesome!

414
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,839
Fine. I know you have principles.

415
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:20,959
I know you have principles.

416
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:23,479
Who is it?

417
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,640
Siqi, where are you?

418
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,800
Why? Just say it, I'm upset!

419
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm also asking the people I know

420
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,839
about the apartment.

421
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:35,760
Just now Mr. Lin told me

422
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,079
his friend's apartment is available.

423
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,680
And he is looking for the tenant.

424
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:48,599
Where is that apartment?

425
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,560
It's in the city center,

426
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,040
where you can see the
whole Huangpu River.

427
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,359
The location is pretty good.

428
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,040
Fine, I got it.

429
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm leaving.

430
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,079
Qunfei needs me. Something emergent.

431
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,959
What? Is everything ok?

432
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,959
Everything is fine. Don't worry.

433
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,880
I'm leaving.

434
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,479
Be careful!

435
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,359
I will!

436
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,199
-Siqi, here you are.
-Lin Xiangyuan?

437
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,000
What are you doing here?

438
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,479
Show you around the apartment.

439
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,479
Come on.

440
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,079
Don't you rush to make the call.

441
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
Listen to me, please.

442
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,599
One of my very good friends.

443
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,359
He is abroad all the year round.

444
00:24:47,439 --> 00:24:49,000
This apartment has been not occupied.

445
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,439
He Qunfei is eager to rent an apartment,
right?

446
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:51,760
I just asked about it.

447
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,520
On the one hand, I'm wondering

448
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,599
whether I can help.

449
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,199
On the other hand,
I want to find a tenant

450
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
for this apartment.

451
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:58,800
You know.

452
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,239
If the apartment isn't
occupied for long,

453
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,280
it will be aging.

454
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,079
What?

455
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:03,560
The apartment will be aging?

456
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,000
It's the first time
I've ever heard about it.

457
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:08,599
The most important is that

458
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,160
my friend is very rich.

459
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,959
This apartment is free for you to live.

460
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,800
Free?

461
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:16,800
Free.

462
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,319
Lin Xiangyuan.

463
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,079
What are you up to?

464
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,880
What do you have in your mind?

465
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,319
Siqi, you misunderstood me.

466
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,319
I, Lin Xiangyuan,

467
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,079
swear to the God,

468
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,479
I'm really just doing a favor.

469
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,599
Absolutely no other purpose or thoughts.

470
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,160
How about this?

471
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,079
Since we're here already,

472
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,000
let's go and have a look.

473
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,119
If you don't like it,

474
00:25:39,199 --> 00:25:40,079
I won't force you.

475
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,199
Fine, let's go. Just take a look.

476
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,199
OK, get in the car.

477
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:01,880
Come in, I'll show you around.

478
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:05,920
How do you like it?

479
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,599
Do you like it?

480
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:10,319
It's too luxurious!

481
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,280
Your friend is so rich!

482
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,479
You provide us with such
a luxurious apartment

483
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,839
for free.

484
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,000
Are you sure?

485
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,079
Because we're friends.

486
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,359
Lin Xiangyuan,

487
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,439
I know you help us out of good will.

488
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,119
But I'm really sorry.

489
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,880
I don't know your friend.

490
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
I can't accept it.

491
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,959
In this case,

492
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,280
I should go.

493
00:26:36,439 --> 00:26:37,680
No, no. Siqi,

494
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,319
don't get me wrong.

495
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,079
I swear to God,

496
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,079
this apartment really
belongs to my friend.

497
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,880
I'm just offering you a favor

498
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,199
incidentally.

499
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,520
I absolutely have nothing in my mind.

500
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,520
You've made the swear your mantra.

501
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,079
As far as I can see, the God

502
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:56,199
has been drown by your vows.

503
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,839
It'll be much easier for you to
go to the street,

504
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,040
and beguile those ignorant girls.

505
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,839
Fine, I know

506
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,839
in your mind, I am

507
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,119
a person to sail with the wind,

508
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,719
and sacrifice principle for profit.

509
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:13,199
Yes, you're right.

510
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,920
I wanna be a good person too.

511
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,359
I also wanna be a great person.

512
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:21,479
I'm fighting every day.

513
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,880
We came to live in this city.

514
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,000
If I don't work hard like this,

515
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,239
don't fight like this,

516
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,119
what can I do about it?

517
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,599
Do I have a choice?

518
00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:36,199
Am I qualified to make the choice?

519
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm just like you.

520
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,199
We are the people who come to
this city to work hard.

521
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,839
No connections.

522
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,599
Have no one to rely on.

523
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,000
We can only rely on ourselves.

524
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,280
Since we're all in the same dilemma,

525
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,119
we're in the same boat.

526
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,040
Siqi,

527
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,560
sometimes I'm wondering

528
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,719
what we're fighting for in this city.

529
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,880
Why are we working so hard?

530
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:09,719
When is the end of all of these?

531
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,400
Sometimes I'm too lonely.

532
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,160
I don't even have someone to talk to.

533
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,719
Can you understand?

534
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You're right.

535
00:28:30,479 --> 00:28:31,640
But I wanna ask you,

536
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,239
this apartment,

537
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,119
why don't you just give it to Xiaosu?

538
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,800
Siqi, do you think I don't want to?

539
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,560
You know what she's like.

540
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,359
It's impossible for her
to accept any help from me.

541
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:48,800
That's why I'm asking you.

542
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,640
Siqi,

543
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:04,719
please.

544
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,599
Will you?

545
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,359
Thank you.

546
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,560
Why are young and beautiful girls

547
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,239
like you so shameless?

548
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,760
Didn't you get me?

549
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,319
I'll give you another half a month.

550
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,800
I'll call police if you are still here.

551
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,599
Mrs. Li, it's not we don't wanna move.

552
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,599
It's just...

553
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,199
we haven't found a good apartment yet.

554
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,040
We'll move as soon as we find one.

555
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,520
Could you please excuse us?

556
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,760
Who are shameless?

557
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:42,719
Who are you scolding?

558
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,520
Siqi,

559
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,439
what's wrong with you?

560
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,079
You're begging me!

561
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,199
You cannot take advantage of us.

562
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,880
Besides,

563
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,319
the contract we assigned,

564
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,839
it clearly states that

565
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,640
if there is any change,

566
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,359
it is required to give one-month notice.

567
00:29:56,479 --> 00:29:57,719
Are you able to read the contract?

568
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,000
Are you being unreasonable?

569
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,400
I'm unreasonable?

570
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,040
How?

571
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,680
This house is mine.

572
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,119
I told you last time

573
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:07,599
to move out within three days.

574
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,800
You didn't.

575
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,079
Now I'm giving you another half a month.

576
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Am I unreasonable?

577
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,760
Who is unreasonable?

578
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,319
I'm not asking you to move right away,

579
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:18,920
considering it is nice to you.

580
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,199
Mrs. Li, calm down, please.

581
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm not moving! I won't!

582
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,719
You wanna call the police? Go ahead!

583
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Let's see if police help you

584
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,160
or us, the vulnerable group!

585
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,560
Siqi, save your words.

586
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
I'm sorry, Mrs. Li. My friend,

587
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,400
she's shot-tempered.

588
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
All right, I get it.

589
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,400
Half a month.

590
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,160
We will move out in half a month.

591
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,359
Hard day for you.

592
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,439
Don't be so angry!

593
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,119
This young lady is so sharp-tongued.

594
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,640
We got it. We'll move in half a month.

595
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,439
Bye.

596
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,359
I'm not done yet!

597
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,119
I'm having a headache,

598
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,079
and you really gave me a headache.

599
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,839
Why did you stop me?

600
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
Is there anyone like her?

601
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:57,359
Just come in and ask us to move out.

602
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:02,680
But it is her house after all.

603
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,160
That's why
we have to have our own apartment.

604
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,439
If you rent someone else's apartment,

605
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,319
you'll always have to
look at other people's face.

606
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,000
Half a month, what can we do?

607
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,400
Come on.

608
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,599
Don't be so sad.

609
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,280
I have a good news for you.

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,520
I went to see an apartment today,
and it was very good.

611
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,160
One staircase for one apartment,
with two bathrooms and two rooms.

612
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,719
Really?

613
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,160
Where is it?

614
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,160
City center.

615
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:36,839
We could just move there
for the time being.

616
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,079
And then we could spend more time
on apartment-hunting.

617
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:39,319
You got rich?

618
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,920
No, it's rent for free.

619
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,599
For free？

620
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,119
How is it possible?

621
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:52,079
It belongs to one of my relatives.

622
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,079
He just wants someone to look after it.

623
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,560
Come on.

624
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,160
Xiaosu, think no more.

625
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:01,479
I'm on it!

626
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:03,040
Just follow me!

627
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,760
We'll move there tomorrow.

628
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,680
OK, stop.

629
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,839
Three, two, one.

630
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,439
You can open your eyes.

631
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,920
Do you like it?

632
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,680
This is the place
we're going to move in.

633
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:28,560
Isn't it luxurious?

634
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,920
Look!
The french window with a full view.

635
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,119
The kitchen.

636
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,040
How is it?

637
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:37,880
From now on,

638
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,800
you can make breakfast for me here.

639
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,839
You're so mean.

640
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,880
Look over here.

641
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,640
Look, the chandelier! How beautiful!

642
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,800
It's beautiful.

643
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:50,359
Isn't the place we've been dreamt of?

644
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,640
Here is the bathroom.

645
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I finally have my own bathroom!

646
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,439
What about it? Do you like it?

647
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:04,800
I've made up my mind.

648
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,280
This is for you.

649
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,520
This apartment is great. But...

650
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,439
We two

651
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,560
diligent and beautiful girls

652
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
help him look after the apartment.

653
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:18,680
He can't be happier, can he?

654
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,079
But we live in such a great apartment.

655
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,719
What a big favor it is!

656
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,119
Don't worry too much.

657
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,239
He's rich,

658
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:31,520
and money can be spent for years.

659
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,160
You mentioned it belongs to
your relative,

660
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,439
who's that?

661
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,400
It's...It's my...

662
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,160
It's my little aunt.

663
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,560
Her cousin,

664
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,599
and her colleague's friend

665
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,359
who works as engineer in Huawei.

666
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,000
You have no idea about his job.

667
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,239
He won't come back for years
when he's away for business.

668
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,719
Come on, think no more.

669
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
There's some place for you to live,

670
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,079
why do you care so much?

671
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,959
How about this?

672
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,239
You and Qunfei move in together.

673
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,479
It's your relative, not mine.

674
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,399
I'd better go back.

675
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,199
No, don't. Xiaosu.

676
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,479
It doesn't suit me.

677
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Come on, he can't live here!

678
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,679
You cannot feed wolf

679
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,600
with lamb?

680
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,000
You're my friend.

681
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,159
If he lives here with me,

682
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,199
he'll try to take advantage of me.

683
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,000
I haven't made up my mind
to live with him.

684
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,639
I don't think it is right.

685
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:35,919
Cone on, Xiaosu.

686
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,239
I agree with Siqi.

687
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,040
I can't live here.

688
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,320
If Siqi lives here alone,

689
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,040
I'll be worried, right?

690
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,919
Stop thinking! Stop talking!

691
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,639
Bring in your luggage!

692
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,199
That's it. Hurry up!

693
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,399
Is it here?

694
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,360
Yes! Hurry!

695
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,600
I promise you.

696
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,679
There is absolutely no problem
with this apartment.

697
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,320
Make yourself at home.

698
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,000
How about this?

699
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,360
If the landlord

700
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,320
is unhappy,

701
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,919
we'll move out right away.

702
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,199
Great! Let's go!

703
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,000
Mr. Lei asks for our advice,

704
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,199
I'll make one point.

705
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,120
I still believe
the Global Entertainment Center

706
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,760
is a project with high risk.

707
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,120
As a real estate enterprise,

708
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,120
I admit that we can only accept it
with a certain reluctance.

709
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,399
But if we're going to launch
such a big project

710
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:38,320
of the Global Entertainment Center,

711
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:39,520
where does the money come from?

712
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:42,439
I hereby earnestly assure the board

713
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,760
the capital of this project

714
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,360
does not need additional investment
from shareholders.

715
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,919
After the project starts,

716
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,560
it will not be fully carried out
at one time.

717
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,800
If so,

718
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,479
there won't be
a large amount of money required.

719
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,120
The risk is also controllable.

720
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,120
Mr. Lei, are you saying

721
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,399
the project will be carried out
in stages?

722
00:35:57,479 --> 00:35:59,040
Open the ones when they are ready.

723
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,280
If the profit is good,

724
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,040
we'll carry on the next stage,
aren't you?

725
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,479
Yes, that's more or less what I mean.

726
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
But I wanna blame myself for

727
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:07,919
not planning enough for this.

728
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,280
The staging plan of the project

729
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,479
is not completed yet.

730
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,040
I apologize for this.

731
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,479
But I also would like to ask

732
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,120
all the directors present today.

733
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,280
The Global Entertainment Center project

734
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:19,280
has been approved through voting
by the Board of Directors.

735
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,679
I wanna show my respect to you

736
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,560
to ask for your opinions again today.

737
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:26,280
So, I hope all of you can respect

738
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,280
the decision made by
the Board of Directors.

739
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:29,439
Anyway,

740
00:36:29,959 --> 00:36:31,320
Uncle Li, thank you again.

741
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,520
I

742
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,679
grew up

743
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,080
under the watch of all of you.

744
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,679
I can benefit from

745
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,120
each of your suggestions and reminders.

746
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,840
Therefore,
I hope all of us can work together,

747
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,000
just like before,

748
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,840
lead Yutian to a next level.

749
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:47,639
Thank you all.

750
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Is it Xiao Zhang
from the Financial Department?

751
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:19,959
Yes, it's me.

752
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,399
You're pretty efficient in

753
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,959
the reimbursement of
office supplies last time.

754
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,439
I'm gonna give you a like.

755
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,919
OK, I'll come over when I'm available.

756
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,080
Who is there?

757
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,239
Lin Xiangyuan?

758
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,639
What are you doing here?

759
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,199
What? I can't come, can I?

760
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,280
Not afraid to run into Du Xiaosu?

761
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,239
I know Xiaosu is at work today.

762
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,560
Siqi, who's that?

763
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,560
Qunfei, you are here too.

764
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,840
Hello, Mr. Lin.

765
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,199
Siqi, I wanna talk to you.

766
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,959
Qunfei, stop cooking

767
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,919
and prepare some fruit.

768
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
Mr. Lin and I have something to discuss.

769
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:20,800
OK.

770
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,199
Come in, Mr. Lin.

771
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,360
Siqi,

772
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,159
I know

773
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,639
I'm a little bit rude this time.

774
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,520
Yutian's annual convention is tomorrow,

775
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
I know

776
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,000
Xiaosu is too busy to prepare

777
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,199
the clothes for the annual convention.

778
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,479
I, according to her figure,

779
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,120
help her make the choice of clothes.

780
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,439
You know that

781
00:38:43,479 --> 00:38:44,399
if it's me to give it to her,

782
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,639
she will say no.

783
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,719
So

784
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:49,600
I wanna ask you for a favor,
please give it to her.

785
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:52,560
Don't tell her it's from me.

786
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,879
Xiaosu is my junior fellow
in the school.

787
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,959
She has a character.

788
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:01,239
She will say no if I give it to her,

789
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,679
Siqi, please, give it to her for me.

790
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,479
Dad, are you sure you're not going?

791
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,560
Yes.

792
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,399
You represent me with full authority.

793
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,800
Have you picked your dancing partner?

794
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,840
Not yet.

795
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,879
I think Fanlv is a good choice.

796
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,719
Is it Manager Zhu?

797
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:41,959
Few days ago, I tried on

798
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,120
an evening dress, do you remember?

799
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,639
That'll be great!

800
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,879
I'll have it picked up now.
