Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

17

Mr. Lin.

18
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,199
Now you don't even knock.

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

20
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,119
I just got the news.

21
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,440
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Lei
are going to hold a press conference

22
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,759
in order to
respond to the acquisition.

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,119
It's been a while since Hengshan Fund has

24
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,279
announced to acquire Yutian.

25
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,559
How will Yutian respond to that?

26
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,440
What actions will Yutian take?

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
Will Yutian accept
the acquisition or not?

28
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:32,279
Thank you for your concern for Yutian.

29
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:35,440
About how Yutian will
deal with the acquisition,

30
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,800
my assistant Lei Yuzheng

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,839
will tell you more details.

32
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,240
Why is Lin Xiangyuan not here?

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,720
As far as we know,

34
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,240
Lin Xiangyuan, the CEO of Yutian,

35
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,360
supports the acquisition.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Can he represent the board?

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,679
(Friends from the media,)

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
(I think you all want to know)

39
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,240
(the attitude of Yutian
toward this acquisition.)

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,399
Mr. Lin,

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,600
why didn't you go to
the press conference?

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
If I went there, what shall I say?

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,759
Right.

44
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,839
You could not say
you support the acquisition.

45
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,880
You could not say
you're against the acquisition either.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,399
It's good for you to be absent.

47
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,600
(In simple words,)

48
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,520
(the attitude of the board is...)

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,679
The attitude of the Board of Yutian

50
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,000
is to accept the acquisition.

51
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,919
What? Accept?

52
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,320
(But)

53
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:37,039
(we only accept the acquisition)

54
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,279
(that is good to
Yutian's future development.)

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,479
(If the acquirer
wants to use the acquisition)

56
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:42,960
(to cover their malice,)

57
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:46,479
Yutian will take legal action.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Lei Yuzheng

59
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,160
acknowledged failure.

60
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,880
But look at him.

61
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,559
In such a cocky way,

62
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,720
he is still pretending.

63
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,800
Stop annoying me. Will you get out?

64
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,119
(Yutian is a good listed company.)

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,279
(Since Yutian was listed,)

66
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
(the achievements of Yutian)

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,880
(have been seen by all of you.)

68
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,960
(Someone wants to acquire Yutian today.)

69
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,080
(What does it mean?)

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
(I advise you to think about it.)

71
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,600
(It means Yutian has great value.)

72
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,600
(Right.)

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,160
(This exactly means
Yutian has great value)

74
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,440
(and good development in future.)

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,799
Who

76
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:23,519
will acquire

77
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,040
a company which is weak.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
(So,)

79
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,559
(this is the reason
of Yutian being acquired.)

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Thank you for your concern for Yutian.

81
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,799
Acquisition?

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,119
Why is it being acquired?

83
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,359
Go. Let's ask.

84
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,920
Mr. Jiang, do you mean that
Yutian will accept the acquisition?

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,320
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Lei, please reply.

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
Acquisition will take quite a long time.

87
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,519
No one can know the result yet.

88
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,720
Yutian will not be thrown to the wolves.

89
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,200
You will see!

90
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,640
Mr. Lei. Mr. Lei...

91
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,640
Can you please tell more, Mr. Lei?

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,320
Tell us more...

93
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,936
(Mr. Yu)

94
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,440
Mr. Lin, what does Lei Yuzheng mean?

95
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,399
We're in the same boat.

96
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,480
You can't get away from it either.

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,239
We have invested
more than a billion yuan.

98
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,480
We will not give up.

99
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,079
You can't act as nothing happened.

100
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,480
About what you should do,

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,239
I think we don't need
to remind you, right?

102
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Besides, your town fellow,

103
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,440
is controlled by us.

104
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,679
About the consequence,

105
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:34,959
you should think twice!

106
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,720
Don't talk to me like that.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
Cooperate or not, and how to cooperate,

108
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,320
that's up to me.

109
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
You don't need to tell me.

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,480
Mr. Lin, you have to think it over.

111
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,040
This is all because of you.

112
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,359
Is this what I wanted it to be?

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,119
I've done my best.

114
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
What else do you want me to do?!

115
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,640
Now,

116
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
you insist to do the acquisition.

117
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,359
You guys are really greedy!

118
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,959
Let me tell you.

119
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,880
Now it is you beg me, not I beg you.

120
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,239
What do you mean?

121
00:06:10,679 --> 00:06:12,600
Do you want to get rid of all of it?

122
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,880
We are not the same kind of person.

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,279
I will be more than happy
to break off with you.

124
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,239
Remember that you are
the one who is begging me.

125
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,480
In the future, I hope

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,760
you do not teach me what to do.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,839
Buddy,

128
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,480
I watched the press conference.

129
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,559
Well done!

130
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,959
What you said is awesome!

131
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,519
After your mom passed away, your dad

132
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,480
had been feeling sorry to you.

133
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,559
He had always been thinking about
how to make up for you.

134
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:56,399
That's why he set up
this trust fund for you.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,320
When I was little, I thought it was fun

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,040
and once stole it from my dad's office.

137
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,279
Why was it kept by you?

138
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,320
It was kept by Zhenrong's dad.

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
After he passed away, it was kept by me.

140
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,359
But what's this?

141
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,559
This is the proof of your identity.

142
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,600
By the way, for this trip,

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
don't tell anyone.

144
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,480
Don't worry. I know what to do.

145
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,880
Uncle Lin, I am Yuzheng.

146
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,119
Yuzheng.

147
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:41,920
I haven't seen you for many years.

148
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,959
Same as you were little!

149
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,040
After all these years, you've grown up

150
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,760
and I'm getting old.

151
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,679
Let's go inside.

152
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:52,559
OK.

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,640
This is what your father gave to me.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,359
Now it's time to return it to its owner.

155
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,720
Uncle Lin, please have a check.

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,032
(Trust Fund Plan.
Consignor: Yutian Group)

157
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,520
I remember that

158
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,679
your dad is a few years
younger than I am.

159
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
But he passed away ahead of me.

160
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,520
Uncle Lin, that was because of me.

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,520
It's OK. I know

162
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,719
it was not all your fault.

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,400
Things keep changing, so does life.

164
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,919
After a few years,
I think I can't work anymore.

165
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,280
The hope will be placed on you.

166
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
Don't say that, Uncle Lin.

167
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,840
You look really well.

168
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,799
But the inside is the cotton waste.

169
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm getting older and older.

170
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,039
In all my life,

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,880
there are not many people I respect.

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,239
Your dad was one of them.

173
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,799
Yuzheng,

174
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,640
you are now in charge of Yutian.

175
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,400
I can't teach you how to manage it.

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,159
But I have to tell you.

177
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
You should learn from your dad.

178
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,280
A man who does great things
should be tolerant of others.

179
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,799
One thing that I respect most of him is

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,359
that your dad was tolerant,

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,400
even of the opponents.

182
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,599
It is really hard to do that.

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,840
I watched the news of China.

184
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,080
I know that Yutian

185
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:52,280
is facing a big crisis.

186
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,679
I hope you can overcome it very soon.

187
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,239
Thank you, Uncle Lin.

188
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,280
Mr. Lin, the documents are OK.

189
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,479
OK.

190
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,280
All these documents are checked.

191
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,200
Now, this trust fund

192
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,640
can be deployed at your disposal.

193
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,799
What do you want to do with it?

194
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Do you want to use it to save Yutian?

195
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,880
To be honest,
I haven't made the decision.

196
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,599
Think before you do. That's correct.

197
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,599
I believe that you will
spend the money wisely.

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,840
After making a decision,

199
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,400
I will email you.

200
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Would you want me to show you around
in Malaysia for a few days?

201
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,479
That's very kind of you.

202
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,400
But I have to go back today.

203
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,640
Such a hurry.

204
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,719
Yes.

205
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,679
You know, it is so urgent.

206
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,359
I can understand.
It's quite a hard time.

207
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,719
Then I won't keep you.

208
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,640
Wish you all the best!

209
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,359
I will wait for your good news here.

210
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,039
Two glasses of water, please.

211
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Yuzheng,

212
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,119
you are so melodramatic.

213
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Please enjoy it, sir.

214
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,559
Thank you.

215
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,200
Having dinner in a suit.

216
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,719
I feel very uncomfortable,
wearing this suit.

217
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Do you know

218
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,640
that Mark Zuckerberg,
the founder of Facebook

219
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,359
wears the same clothes every day?

220
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,080
Only one T-shirt.

221
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,520
Please have a look at the menu, sir.

222
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,440
Take a bite of his meal,

223
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:32,840
and then go to work.

224
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,799
But you,

225
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,799
even for a dinner,
you have to make it quite formal.

226
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,880
I think

227
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,400
you are already used to
the clothes in the jail,

228
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,599
the yellow one?

229
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,559
Do you know why you are still single?

230
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,719
You are too boring.

231
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,599
Too boring?

232
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,520
I just don't want to
waste time and money

233
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,960
on such kind of trivia,
like eating and getting dressed.

234
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,039
Waste?

235
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,599
In my world,

236
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,119
I have no idea on "waste".

237
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,840
To me, all kinds of
waste are reasonable.

238
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,679
OK. OK. OK.

239
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,400
I give up.

240
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,679
Siyang.

241
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,840
I keep thinking about one thing.

242
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,919
Do you still remember that Vodafone

243
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,799
acquired their

244
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,559
third largest telecom provider

245
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,000
Orange?

246
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,599
It was the one that owned
by Li Jiacheng.

247
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:25,760
Orange Telecom?

248
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:27,559
Yes, exactly.

249
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,520
I remember.

250
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,919
I was studying abroad at that time.

251
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,559
For this acquisition,

252
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,520
the two foreign companies

253
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:36,520
took a long time for the dispute.

254
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,239
The famous company Vodafone

255
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,799
wanted to acquire the telecom company.

256
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,559
But

257
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,599
it was acquired by Germany's Mannesmann.

258
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,359
Vodafone was infuriated

259
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,640
and acquired Mannesmann.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,080
Do you think

261
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,919
who was the winner?

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,159
That should

263
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:57,960
be Li Jiacheng.

264
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,679
After the acquisition,

265
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,919
he could earn a billion euros more.

266
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,159
That was a lot!

267
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:07,200
Yuzheng,

268
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,159
are you planning to turn Yutian

269
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,119
into "Orange"?

270
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,760
We'll see.

271
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,679
Order, please.

272
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,919
I forgot my purse.

273
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280
You did it on purpose!

274
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,239
Every day, you

275
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,359
control tens of billions of shares.

276
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,159
You still care about this small money?

277
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,159
OK. OK. It is your treat.

278
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,479
I will pay the bill. OK?

279
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
Pick the most expensive one, please.

280
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,880
Sure, sir.

281
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,840
What time is it?

282
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:59,200
It's three o'clock in the morning
Beijing time.

283
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,919
The foreign stock markets

284
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,840
should start business now.

285
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,760
What do foreign stock markets
have to do with us?

286
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,960
Why are you checking on S.G's share?

287
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,119
S. G and Hengshan are collaborators.

288
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,840
It's called "knowing yourself
and knowing your enemy".

289
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
What is happening?

290
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,440
Why is the stock of
S.G raising so weird?

291
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,000
Why are you looking at me?

292
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,039
You did it?

293
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,200
I just want S.G to know

294
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,200
acquisition is not that fun.

295
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,159
And not everyone can have fun.

296
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,799
Now, this trust fund

297
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,239
can be deployed at your disposal.

298
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,960
You are now diverting their attention,

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,200
directly attacking the backer of
Hengshan Fund.

300
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,280
To Hengshan,

301
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,599
this is to take away the "fuel".

302
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,239
So much fun.

303
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:13,679
I haven't seen
such interesting show for a long time.

304
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,440
And I didn't expect that
I am also involved.

305
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,320
Yuzheng,

306
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,599
S.G is the backer of Hengshan.

307
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,239
You have done such a thing.

308
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,000
S.G should definitely know it's you.

309
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
In this way, Linton

310
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,119
can't stand it anymore.

311
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,328
(Jiang Jin)

312
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
It is so late. Who are you calling?

313
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,880
Uncle Jiang.

314
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,200
Yuzheng.

315
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,440
I have an urgent thing
to communicate with you.

316
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,239
Speak, please.

317
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,039
Would you please

318
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
tell our company's security agent that

319
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,840
if Yutian's stock
drops sharply tomorrow,

320
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,000
they shall

321
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:59,119
not buy in at this critical moment?

322
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,640
Why?

323
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,159
I can't tell you now.

324
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,640
Please wait for two more days.

325
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,400
You'll know after two days.

326
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yuzheng,

327
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:09,960
have you found out any solution?

328
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,239
Mr. Lin, the stock of Yutian...

329
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,479
What?

330
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,520
I got it.

331
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:24,119
What the hell is going on?

332
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:26,200
It raised well yesterday.

333
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,239
Today, why did it suddenly

334
00:16:27,359 --> 00:16:28,520
drop like this?

335
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,000
The rise and drop of Yutian's stock
has nothing to do with you!

336
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
What are you worrying about?

337
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,640
Isn't it about to be acquired?

338
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,119
Acquisition?

339
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,479
Yutian is a large company.

340
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:44,000
Is it that easy to be acquired？

341
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,880
OK. I go back.

342
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,039
Where are you going?

343
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,119
Go back to my office.

344
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,199
Mr. Lin,

345
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
what else do you want to say?

346
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,439
Tell me the truth.

347
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Did you secretly buy Yutian's stock?

348
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,800
No.

349
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,760
Really?

350
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,280
Mr. Lin,

351
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,839
you seriously told me before.

352
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,520
How could I possibly buy it?

353
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,640
OK, I believe you.

354
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,920
Go.

355
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,400
Mr. Lei has meetings in the afternoon.

356
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,119
Can you please wait?

357
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,520
Did anyone call me this morning?

358
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,439
The phone has been ringing
the whole morning.

359
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,079
All from aboard.

360
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,599
OK. I see.

361
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,359
Take your lunch.

362
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,880
Appreciate your hard work these days.

363
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,319
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

364
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:02,432
(Linton)

365
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,040
Hello.

366
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:07,439
Hey, buddy.

367
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,199
You finally picked up my phone.

368
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,079
Yeah, Linton.

369
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,839
I've canceled all my meetings.

370
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,160
And I'm flying to Beijing tomorrow.

371
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,880
How about we sit down there and talk?

372
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,760
You're flying to Beijing tomorrow?

373
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm afraid I will not be available.

374
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,920
Why don't we just talk over the phone?

375
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,719
Then I'll be straight forward.

376
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,599
There is an oversea
company acquiring S.G.

377
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,280
I believe

378
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,719
you also know it clearly.

379
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,119
I have heard of it.

380
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:32,760
I know

381
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,719
you are the one behind.

382
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,000
For my sake,

383
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,439
give S.G a chance.

384
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,880
You are beginning to speak
more and more like a Chinese.

385
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,920
But I'm sorry. There is no turning back.

386
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:46,319
S.G,

387
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,280
I will definitely get it!

388
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,608
(Mr. Yu)

389
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,719
The stock of Yutian has dropped sharply.

390
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,319
Tell me

391
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,000
what's going on?

392
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,479
The stock market is risky.

393
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,280
It's normal that the stock price drops.

394
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,319
You should be very experienced.

395
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,839
You should know more than I do.

396
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:19,839
Mr. Lin,

397
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,560
if you sell all your shares of Yutian

398
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,599
and cooperate with me

399
00:19:23,719 --> 00:19:25,680
to make sure the
acquisition is successful...

400
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,880
I guarantee you that

401
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:29,199
if you don't give up Hengshan
as soon as possible,

402
00:19:29,479 --> 00:19:31,040
you will lose more.

403
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,439
It could be ten times more.

404
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,520
Yuzheng,

405
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,719
I chose Hengshan,

406
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,959
just to make Yutian better.

407
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,479
I think

408
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,880
you know Hengshan better than I do.

409
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:45,479
Hengshan always does
things by unfair means.

410
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,000
Among the companies
acquired by Hengshan,

411
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,119
which one was not torn to pieces?

412
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,319
Besides,

413
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,439
I invited you in,

414
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,199
expecting for a rescue,

415
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,520
not destruction.

416
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:56,800
Unfortunately,

417
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:57,920
Linton.

418
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,800
You have abused my trust on you.

419
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,439
Sorry.

420
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,160
As for what you want,

421
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,680
I'm afraid that I can't provide.

422
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,680
Mr. Lin,

423
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,680
my last advice.

424
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,959
If you don't want to
lose everything you've got,

425
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,359
just show me your sincerity.

426
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,479
Sincerity?

427
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,920
You don't have to threaten me
again and again.

428
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,319
You are abusing my sincerity.

429
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,400
What do you mean?

430
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,400
You are now telling me that

431
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,439
you want to share weal

432
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,520
and woe with Yutian.

433
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,560
Yes.

434
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,680
Do you think you can?

435
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:29,439
I gave you money. I gave you dignity.

436
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,800
I gave you everything.

437
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Now you're trying to betray me.

438
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,079
Without me,

439
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,640
even for another ten years,

440
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,319
you will still be nobody.

441
00:20:37,479 --> 00:20:39,040
I can be on this position,

442
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,839
not because you helped me.

443
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,599
It's Lei Yuzheng who helped me.

444
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,439
Linton,

445
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm now answering your call.

446
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
It means we still
have good relationship.

447
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,920
Yuzheng,

448
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:55,520
if we break the contract now,
we will lose a lot of money.

449
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,880
After tomorrow,

450
00:20:58,959 --> 00:20:59,959
I can't guarantee

451
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,319
what will happen.

452
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,319
Xie Li.

453
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,839
This is Lin Xiangyuan.

454
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,079
Where is Xie Li?

455
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,040
Where is he?

456
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:23,439
You don't know?

457
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,239
What are you doing?

458
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,520
I haven't finished yet.

459
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,680
Why are you watching news?

460
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,920
It's boring.

461
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,560
I have to watch the series.

462
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,760
You can watch it at any other time.

463
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,400
Time doesn't matter.

464
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Give it to me. Give it to me.

465
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,479
Just let me watch for a while, OK?

466
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,880
Du Xiaosu!

467
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,280
You promised that

468
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,400
you will forget about Lei Yuzheng.

469
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,719
Why do you still care about Yutian?

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,280
I care about the stock market.

471
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,079
Do you think I can't see that?

472
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,400
If you are worried about him,

473
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,719
contact him.

474
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,599
We're already separated.

475
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,599
Moreover,

476
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
he has someone else to be with him.

477
00:22:17,959 --> 00:22:19,199
By the way,

478
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,160
I have to tell you seriously.

479
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:23,680
I heard from my colleague

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,319
that Lei Yuzheng is going to
marry Xu You. Do you know that?

481
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,439
Really?

482
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,959
If it is true,

483
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,199
congratulations to them.

484
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,439
I really doubt that
I am behind the times.

485
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,479
Congratulations to them?

486
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,920
Lei Yuzheng will get married

487
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,439
and you will not be his bride.

488
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,959
And you are like

489
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,000
his happiness is your sunshine.

490
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,560
If I were you,

491
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:53,520
that would be a bolt from the blue, OK？

492
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I have done with him a long time ago.

493
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,640
He is with someone else now,

494
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,040
which is normal.

495
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,640
I doubt

496
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,719
whether you really loved each other.

497
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,400
You're so generous.

498
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,079
You also congratulate him!

499
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,680
Siqi, love is the
decision of two persons,

500
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,479
but separation is the
decision of one person.

501
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,439
I chose to leave

502
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,839
and forget him.

503
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,920
I was only being responsible for him.

504
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,040
I just think that

505
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,839
you have experienced a lot together.

506
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,800
If you can get married,

507
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,239
that would be so nice.

508
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,000
For now, I just want to
run my studio well.

509
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,560
If he is happy,

510
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,199
I can do anything.

511
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
There are many ways to leave someone.

512
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,040
But for me, I will choose
to leave quietly

513
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,160
and silently.

514
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,479
We are really not
the same kind of people.

515
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,640
I can't understand you at all.

516
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Why are you being sad and hurt alone,

517
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,079
and choosing to heal yourself quietly.

518
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Xiaosu,

519
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,959
I really hope that
you can make the first move.

520
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,079
You have to ask Lei Yuzheng
and get a clear answer.

521
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,479
Is it fate

522
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,959
or just misunderstanding?

523
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,760
You two have experienced so much.

524
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,800
If you can't be together,

525
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,400
that would be a pity.

526
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,032
(Zou Siqi)

527
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:41,439
Siqi.

528
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,560
What are you doing?

529
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,319
What else can I do?

530
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,319
I'm working.

531
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
Sun, come. Here is the document.

532
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,439
OK.

533
00:24:46,439 --> 00:24:46,959
Tonight? No.

534
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,359
Mr. Lei has a meeting tonight
and I have to be there.

535
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,239
Always Mr. Lei.

536
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,959
I just feel that

537
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,920
I am the third wheel of you two.

538
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,839
Come on. I want to see you.

539
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
When are you free?

540
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,439
When am I free?

541
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
How about now?

542
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,359
Is Mr. Lei very busy recently?

543
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,839
So busy.

544
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,439
Meetings every day.

545
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
He hasn't had a rest for a few days.

546
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,319
I am not asking about this.

547
00:25:10,439 --> 00:25:11,839
I want to ask

548
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,560
how he is with Xu You.

549
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,239
Xu You?

550
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,800
They're getting in touch pretty closely
these days.

551
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,160
Besides,

552
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,959
Xu You tried

553
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:25,479
many of her contacts

554
00:25:25,479 --> 00:25:26,880
and helped Mr. Lei a lot.

555
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,319
Oh, I get it.

556
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,479
I heard that

557
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:36,079
she forced Mr. Lei to marry her.

558
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,560
Forced Mr. Lei?

559
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:41,719
They are getting married?

560
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,239
That's impossible.

561
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,839
Mr. Lei didn't mention that to me.

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,680
What a man

563
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:48,719
fears most is debt of love.

564
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,800
Xiaosu is so pitiful.

565
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,680
She loves Lei Yuzheng so much.

566
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,119
But now Xu You took away Lei Yuzheng.

567
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,680
I'm so angry.

568
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,479
So what's Xiaosu's reaction?

569
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,119
What reaction can she have?

570
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,760
You know her well.

571
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,839
She just

572
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,959
bears all of these by herself,

573
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,959
and pretends to be strong.

574
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,520
You're right.

575
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,199
Why don't you ask Mr. Lei

576
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:12,560
about his feelings about Xiaosu?

577
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,680
No way.

578
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,319
If I ask Mr. Lei
such kind of private things,

579
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,319
I will lose my job.

580
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,959
Then, let's talk about us.

581
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,719
What's your plan for the future？

582
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,040
What? What plan?

583
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,359
Just a second.

584
00:26:26,272 --> 00:26:27,456
(Lei Yuzheng)

585
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,479
Hello, Mr. Lei.

586
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,359
OK. I will be back soon.

587
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:33,959
Honey, I am so sorry.

588
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,160
I have to go.

589
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,800
He Qunfei.

590
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,640
He Qunfei.

591
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,239
Mr. Lei,

592
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,439
you called me back in such a hurry.

593
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,160
Is there any news from Hengshan?

594
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:45,439
Yes.

595
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,920
I just got the news that

596
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:48,839
they are going to announce
the final decision.

597
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Today?

598
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,760
They get the final decision so soon.

599
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,439
S.G is being silent for quite a while.

600
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,640
They won't change, right?

601
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,599
Mr. Lei,

602
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:00,479
are we really going to win?

603
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,079
Qunfei,

604
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,800
we have tried our best.

605
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,400
Then,

606
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,839
leave it to God.

607
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
OK.

608
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,199
Lin Xiangyuan. If you don't help me,

609
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
just a call,

610
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,520
I can send you to jail.
(Mr. Yu)

611
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,599
Yuzheng,

612
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,560
thank you for your hard work these days.

613
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:45,640
No matter what the result is,

614
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,239
all the shareholders
and I will stay with Yutian.

615
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,599
We will not give up.

616
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,359
Mr. Lei,

617
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,880
no matter what the result is,

618
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,520
I will lead all the staff of Boyuan

619
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,560
to support you.

620
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Thank you.

621
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,400
Uncle Jiang, where is Xiangyuan?

622
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,520
He said he would not come.

623
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,040
Yuzheng,

624
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,839
this position

625
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,439
is always for you.

626
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,640
Mr. Lei, take the position, please.

627
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,599
It should be yours.

628
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,839
I believe

629
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,640
we will know the result very soon.

630
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,160
We're going to break in
with a piece of news

631
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,199
regarding Yutian's
(Hengshan abandoned acquisition plan)

632
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,680
acquisition.

633
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,680
Private equity giant company
Hengshan Fund

634
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,280
accepted an interview recently.

635
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:42,160
In the process of acquiring Yutian,
(Hengshan abandoned acquisition plan)

636
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,920
they encountered unprecedented pressure
and obstruction.

637
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,520
There is no turning back.

638
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,760
S.G, I will definitely get it!

639
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,599
Cut the loss,

640
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,839
and cut the capital with Hengshan;

641
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,520
otherwise, that will be
lose-lose situation.

642
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,800
It's up to you.

643
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,640
They will give up

644
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,160
the whole acquisition plan on Yutian.

645
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,839
Although the acquisition failed,

646
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,359
Hengshan mentioned that,

647
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
in the process of confrontation with
the top management of Yutian,

648
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,079
they have gained rich experience
and learnt lessons.

649
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,520
Lei,

650
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,280
I've made my decision.

651
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,119
You win.

652
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,199
We won!

653
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,760
If you come to Shanghai again,

654
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,280
I will treat you personally.

655
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,760
OK. Deal.

656
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,760
Hengshan finally
withdrew its acquisition plan.

657
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,079
It was not easy.

658
00:29:48,439 --> 00:29:50,719
Yutian is safe now.

659
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,479
Everyone,

660
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,719
the difficulties we experienced
were unprecedented.

661
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,239
Yutian can go as far as today.

662
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,040
Thank you for all of your support.

663
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,719
Because of all of you,

664
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,040
I have the courage and faith to move on.

665
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
From now on,

666
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,000
we should put all our efforts to

667
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,040
the Entertainment Center project.

668
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
I hope

669
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,599
we can still work together

670
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,160
to fight for Yutian

671
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,560
and make joint efforts.

672
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,359
Yutian will also be reformed

673
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,599
and developed

674
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,439
to be a more powerful company.

675
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:29,760
Today, we want to thank Mr. Lei

676
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,599
for what he has done for us.

677
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,040
We're going to open
a bottle of champagne.

678
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,319
Excuse me.

679
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,119
Mr. Lin.

680
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,599
Everyone is celebrating.

681
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,800
Don't you want to join?

682
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,400
You go ahead.

683
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm not going in.

684
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,319
Today is the rebirth day of Yutian.

685
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,719
You are part of Yutian.

686
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,079
Wouldn't you
like to join us for a drink?

687
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,959
Yutian is safe now.

688
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,719
Congratulations to you from my heart.

689
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,760
Enough.

690
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,479
You see how generous Mr. Lei is.

691
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,880
You and I do not dare to imagine it,

692
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,520
and even can't imagine it.

693
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,880
How generous and compatible he is!

694
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,479
You're right.

695
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,560
Otherwise, how can I spend so many years

696
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
to work for Mr. Lei?

697
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,400
From Mr. Lei,

698
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,119
I learn that

699
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,479
a person

700
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,199
may have limited luck

701
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,439
and limited wisdom,

702
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,040
but should have unlimited
breadth of mind.

703
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,240
(Loving Father, the Tomb of Lei Ting,
1957-2017. Dutiful Son, Lei Yuzheng)

704
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,880
Mr. Lei,

705
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,280
I'm here to see you.

706
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:37,239
You used to call me daughter-in-law.

707
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:40,199
I knew you were sick at the time.

708
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,040
It was easy to talk nonsense.

709
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,880
But when I heard you said that.

710
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:46,640
I was so happy.

711
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,760
But fate

712
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,160
is hard to say.

713
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,280
I thought

714
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:59,800
Lei Yuzheng is the one in my life.

715
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,319
But fate has not been so kind to me.

716
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,776
(Loving Father, the Tomb of Lei Ting,
1957-2017. Dutiful Son, Lei Yuzheng)

717
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,400
I think

718
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,599
it is time to let it go.

719
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:24,239
Yuzheng should have got married already.

720
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,479
He will be happy.

721
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,599
Mr. Lei.

722
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,560
Bye.

723
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
Buddy, besides us,

724
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,760
it seems there was
someone else visiting Uncle Lei.

725
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,680
Guess who it was?

726
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,832
(Loving Father, the Tomb of
Lei Ting, 1957-2017)

727
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,520
Dad, I'm here to see you.

728
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,839
I haven't been here for a long time.

729
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,640
Don't you blame me?

730
00:34:04,719 --> 00:34:05,599
Recently, I've been thinking
about one thing quite often.

731
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,839
It is what you said.

732
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,080
God is watching your every move.

733
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,399
If you had a soul in heaven,

734
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,439
you would be comforted.

735
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:25,952
(Loving Father, the Tomb of Lei Ting,
1957-2017. Dutiful Son, Lei Yuzheng)

736
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,040
Buddy,

737
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,520
I think the flowers are from Du Xiaosu.

738
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,600
Such kind of lady who is
infatuated and willing to love you

739
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,120
is hard to find.

740
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,199
I'm really so touched.

741
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:45,439
It is obvious that

742
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:47,840
Du Xiaosu has always
loved you in her heart.

743
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,399
So many things happened these days.

744
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,320
These things have been kept from her.

745
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,199
She must be very sad.

746
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,719
So she treats you so cold.

747
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,280
It is understandable.

748
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,719
Buddy,

749
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,560
whether or not you two will be together,

750
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,760
you owe her an explanation.

751
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,520
I went to see her.

752
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,000
She refused to see me.

753
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,280
About love,

754
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,919
men should always be more proactive.

755
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,479
If a man is not proactive,

756
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,479
a lady will always keep her words
in her heart.

757
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,239
I really want to ask you.

758
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:21,639
Are you planning to never

759
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,159
see Du Xiaosu again?

760
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,600
You two are planning to contact

761
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,919
each other by those dried flowers?

762
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,760
If you really don't make the first move,

763
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,399
I'll go.

764
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,280
To me,

765
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,560
in the world,

766
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,040
only beauty and wine

767
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,399
cannot be resisted.

768
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,120
I think you deserve a beating.

769
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,280
How about we go to the
fencing club tonight?

770
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,239
Let's fight.

771
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,040
No. No. Buddy.

772
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:47,320
Last time I hurt my back.
I haven't recovered yet.

773
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,120
Besides,

774
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,040
it's for your own good.

775
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:53,840
Buddy,

776
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,320
you're going to ignore Du Xiaosu.

777
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,919
And you don't want
anyone else to love her.

778
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,439
That's ridiculous, right?

779
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,679
OK, fine.

780
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,120
I know you're here to irritate me.

781
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,360
I am clear about my own things.

782
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,439
Don't talk about it.

783
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,879
Today is the rebirth day of Yutian.

784
00:36:24,879 --> 00:36:26,320
You are part of Yutian.

785
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,879
Wouldn't you
like to join us for a drink?

786
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,360
Xiangyuan,

787
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,239
you have never been away from mom.

788
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,000
Mom doesn't want you to leave.

789
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,679
Out there,

790
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:49,280
you have to learn well from others

791
00:36:49,879 --> 00:36:51,639
and work hard.

792
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,800
Mom, I got it.

793
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Go back.

794
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,959
Mom, I have to go.

795
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,479
Go.

796
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,959
Xiangyuan, take care.

797
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,800
Is that Xiangyuan?

798
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,639
Mom, it is late.

799
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,280
You must be on the bed now.

800
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:39,800
Not yet.

801
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,320
Xiangyuan, how are you doing?

802
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:43,639
The weather report says

803
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,399
Shanghai is getting colder these days.

804
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,040
Have you put on more clothes?

805
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,360
Are you cold?

806
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,760
Mom, don't worry.

807
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,280
It is not cold here.

808
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,120
Xiangyuan,

809
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,080
you called me at this hour.

810
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,040
What happened?

811
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,280
Mom,

812
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,320
nothing.

813
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,040
I miss you.

814
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,199
I'm going back to see you
in a couple of days.

815
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:07,800
Xiangyuan, it is OK that

816
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,840
you don't come back if you're busy.

817
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,000
I know that

818
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,560
you want to fight for your career.

819
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,879
I can understand.

820
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,919
Mom is very good by myself.

821
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:23,520
Xiangyuan. Xiangyuan. What's going on?

822
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,679
Nothing. I have a cold.

823
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:28,760
I miss you so much.

824
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,320
I'll buy tickets soon.

825
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:32,199
Then I'll go home this weekend.

826
00:38:32,879 --> 00:38:34,719
Xiangyuan, this time,

827
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:37,040
can you come with my daughter-in-law?

828
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,679
I haven't met her before.

829
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,120
When you got married,

830
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
I wasn't there.

831
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,120
The things I want to
give to my daughter-in-law

832
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,479
is not sent yet.

833
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,959
Mom,

834
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:52,760
I promise that

835
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,280
I will be back home with Fanlv.

836
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,399
Xiangyuan, mom doesn't want to push you.

837
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,840
One last word from mom,

838
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,639
alone and away from home,

839
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,800
you have to take good care of yourself.

840
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
OK, mom.

841
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,879
