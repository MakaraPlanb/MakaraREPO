1
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:31,055
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,390
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,135
(A new leap for the people,)

4
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:38,830
(The hopeful Dream Home Village becomes a reality.)

5
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,265
The Social Responsibility Foundation is accepting donations...

6
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,631
for their Dream Home Village project.

7
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:50,971
But I received a tip that the money is being used elsewhere.

8
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,810
These are the people running the project.

9
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:58,281
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

10
00:01:06,726 --> 00:01:09,491
Where the donations are being used,

11
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:12,436
and what the real purpose of this project is.

12
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:13,961
To anyone who gives us a tip,

13
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,870
I will compensate you with my own money.

14
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:18,630
That's my promise to you.

15
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:19,840
Thank you.

16
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:31,211
Kang Yo Han, that punk.

17
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:35,220
Did he just put a bounty on the head of state?

18
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:38,151
My own TV station broadcasted my face...

19
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:39,321
because of something like this?

20
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:41,395
Chairman Park, that's not the issue here.

21
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:44,195
He just declared war against his country.

22
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:46,835
This is a rebellion. It's civil war!

23
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,434
He slandered his head of state?

24
00:01:48,435 --> 00:01:51,005
Did we take the working class' hard-earned money?

25
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:52,744
That doesn't make sense.

26
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,905
In order to save the poor,

27
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,346
I donated my precious money.

28
00:01:57,346 --> 00:01:59,946
And this is what I get for being nice?

29
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,181
What's with Kang Yo Han? Is he a communist?

30
00:02:02,215 --> 00:02:04,116
What's Mr. Seo doing?

31
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,786
He just sent his secretary here.

32
00:02:05,786 --> 00:02:08,651
What is he going to do about this?

33
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,491
With all due respect,

34
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:14,360
I think you're too infuriated.

35
00:02:14,366 --> 00:02:16,560
It's a groundless accusation, right?

36
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,431
Am I wrong?

37
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,100
Of course, it's groundless.

38
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,970
There's a bite in your words.

39
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,340
Watch it.

40
00:02:29,646 --> 00:02:31,744
How could he think we would do that?

41
00:02:31,745 --> 00:02:34,681
Right. We wouldn't dare to touch that money.

42
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:49,491
You kidnapped Jang Ki Young, didn't you?

43
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:51,530
I had to talk to him.

44
00:02:51,636 --> 00:02:54,064
"We should put up a show in front of the whole nation."

45
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:57,030
"Or you'll be in trouble, too." Is this what you told him?

46
00:02:57,535 --> 00:02:58,901
You should talk nicely.

47
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:01,641
I explained it differently but it was the gist.

48
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:05,141
Differently?

49
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:09,111
Did you really help him because you felt so sorry for him?

50
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,116
You told him you'd pay him afterward...

51
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,120
if he testifies as you wanted, didn't you?

52
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:17,090
It's possible I felt bad for him from the beginning.

53
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,021
So don't jump to a quick conclusion.

54
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:24,491
Then you weren't the one who attacked Soo Hyun.

55
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,761
Can you believe it now...

56
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,660
that I'm not that kind of person.

57
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,801
I think you are that kind of person.

58
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,244
- But I guess you didn't have to. - I didn't have to?

59
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:38,515
You figured out Cha Kyung Hee got the account details.

60
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:40,511
So you kidnapped Jang Ki Young in a hurry.

61
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:44,410
And it didn't matter if Soo Hyun takes the bankbook or not.

62
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,551
That's why you didn't touch her.

63
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:50,551
You're such a smart guy...

64
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,261
so why were you so furious that day?

65
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:56,535
I only took Elijah out for a moment.

66
00:03:56,535 --> 00:03:58,195
And you went furious too.

67
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,231
So I don't think it's your place to judge me.

68
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,570
Then who attacked Soo Hyun?

69
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:12,570
At the least, it wouldn't be someone who favors me.

70
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:24,951
What do you think Chief Kang is up to?

71
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:30,765
Isn't the foundation one of the good guys?

72
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:32,761
They help the poor and do volunteer work.

73
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,800
Judge Oh, there's something I forgot to tell you.

74
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:41,600
What?

75
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,871
How could you not take me with you?

76
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:48,211
A secret party with the key members of the foundation?

77
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:51,410
You two went to a party like that without me?

78
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:54,980
Chief Kang even got me a nice dress for that charity event.

79
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm really sorry.

80
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,125
Is that the only thing you're mad about among all the other things?

81
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,595
Of course, interfering with the trial...

82
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:03,765
is very inappropriate.

83
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,660
Should we just release it to the press?

84
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:07,205
There's a reporter I know well.

85
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:08,205
A reporter?

86
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:10,901
Yes, she works for a fashion magazine called "Bling Bling".

87
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:15,371
No, never mind.

88
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:21,040
Okay. Let's calm down and think about this.

89
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:24,716
So you're saying the president and the rich people were there...

90
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,954
trying to interfere with Lee Young Min's trial, right?

91
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:29,220
And it seemed they were sharing information for profit.

92
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:30,550
Yes.

93
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:35,061
- I'm sorry I didn't tell... - What about Chief Kang?

94
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,790
- What? - What did he say to them?

95
00:05:38,195 --> 00:05:40,561
Do you think he's with them?

96
00:05:41,135 --> 00:05:43,100
Why aren't you saying anything about Chief Kang?

97
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:47,644
I can't be sure.

98
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:49,641
He didn't say anything at the party.

99
00:05:49,645 --> 00:05:52,571
But considering how he declared war against them...

100
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:54,480
I don't know...

101
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,081
if he's really cool or if he's trying to look cool.

102
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,415
It's true that he gave money to the witness.

103
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:00,656
How can a judge do that?

104
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,990
He was just putting on a show in front of the reporters.

105
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:05,151
Then he suddenly asked people to vote on whether they trust him.

106
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:08,961
It feels like he's deceiving people.

107
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:15,300
I was a really big fan of his.

108
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:17,771
He was confident and righteous.

109
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,170
And he seemed so shinny to me.

110
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,970
But I'm not sure he still does.

111
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:32,811
You should be ambitious.

112
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:35,381
On the live court show that I watched,

113
00:06:35,585 --> 00:06:37,856
you were the biggest star.

114
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,160
Twinkle, twinkle.

115
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,871
If you want a bright star shining in the sky...

116
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:02,910
If you desperately...

117
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:04,381
want it,

118
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:10,391
you should change yourself first.

119
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,490
In order to reach the star,

120
00:07:19,036 --> 00:07:20,660
become a bigger...

121
00:07:21,565 --> 00:07:22,961
person.

122
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,271
I'm perfect.

123
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,571
- Sun Ah. - Yes.

124
00:08:03,676 --> 00:08:06,240
Your skin is gorgeous today.

125
00:08:06,546 --> 00:08:09,416
A compliment coming from you? What a surprise?

126
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,251
Is it because you have a guilty conscience?

127
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,050
It's because I'm jealous.

128
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,350
By the way, what should I do with this?

129
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,490
It's the bankbook I took from Yoon Soo Hyun.

130
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,961
Oh, the bankbook?

131
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:24,090
Get rid of it.

132
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:27,230
Gosh, you're such a nasty witch.

133
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,366
Why would you make me take it if you don't need it?

134
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:30,901
Who says I don't need it?

135
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:34,040
I needed it to create a story.

136
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:35,470
A story?

137
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,811
Enough of that.

138
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,881
What comes next is more important.

139
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,685
Watch every move of the old guys from the foundation.

140
00:08:45,685 --> 00:08:47,021
Not Kang Yo Han?

141
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:51,496
Unexpectedly, the wolf broke into the ranch...

142
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:54,721
in a very violent way.

143
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:58,631
The sheep will get scared and go violent too.

144
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:00,001
Okay.

145
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,601
Oh, by the way.

146
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,835
I think you'll be giving the Healing Mentor Lecture...

147
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,231
that will be posted on the website.

148
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:08,141
Me?

149
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:11,645
Kang Yo Han put Mr. Seo's face on the screen...

150
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:14,841
saying he embezzled the donations for the people.

151
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:18,511
If he gives the lecture, it'll only draw the reporters' attention.

152
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:23,021
Gosh, I feel awkward to give a cheesy lecture.

153
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,721
Jae Hee.

154
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:28,560
Yes?

155
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:34,761
If you were a little faster, we would've taken Jang Ki Young.

156
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,300
Right?

157
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:43,910
I didn't know the judge was going to take him.

159
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:01,960
Do it right.

160
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:05,160
You can, can't you?

161
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:09,560
Yes.

162
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,430
I won't make a mistake.

163
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,841
We are almost done.

164
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:19,881
You know that, right?

165
00:10:29,286 --> 00:10:32,521
If I see you dozing off while Mr. Seo gives the lecture,

166
00:10:32,556 --> 00:10:33,991
you'll be in trouble.

167
00:10:34,225 --> 00:10:35,296
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,565
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of you girls.

169
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:39,131
Hello, Director.

170
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:41,905
Are you from the foundation?

171
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:44,330
Why is Mr. Seo so late?

172
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,641
Hello, I came here on behalf of Mr. Seo today.

173
00:10:48,676 --> 00:10:50,810
She is Jung Sun Ah, the executive director of the foundation.

174
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,910
Oh, she is?

175
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:54,440
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

176
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,416
You're so pretty.

177
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,651
How old are you?

178
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,690
I'm 18 years old.

179
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,521
She is pretty, isn't she?

180
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,021
Go up now.

181
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,665
Come on. Go.

182
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,160
Excuse me, ma'am.

183
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,536
They're all orphans or teenage runaways.

184
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,300
So they're troubled kids.

185
00:11:18,506 --> 00:11:22,101
Be careful when you get closer. They might steal your valuables.

186
00:11:24,575 --> 00:11:26,511
They're troubled kids?

187
00:11:28,315 --> 00:11:29,440
Excuse me?

188
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,780
You must go through a lot.

189
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:39,021
Not really. Shall we go upstairs?

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

191
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:46,660
(Sun)

192
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:59,011
Gosh, I have no idea.

193
00:12:04,585 --> 00:12:07,080
(Sun Ah)

194
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,055
That's my name.

195
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:11,221
"Sun" means "good", and "Ah" means a "child".

196
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,361
I'm a grown-up, but I still have to be a good child.

197
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:19,030
My mom must've hoped...

198
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:22,330
that I'd grow up to be an ordinary, good person.

199
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,741
Then why did she do that to me?

200
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,641
If that was her wish, why did she beat me up...

201
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,481
every time she was drunk?

202
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm sorry, guys.

203
00:12:42,556 --> 00:12:46,056
Seeing you guys brings back memories.

204
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,320
But I should stop being silly.

205
00:12:47,426 --> 00:12:49,591
My mom did that too.

206
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,030
She did?

207
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:55,434
Usually, she was nice like an angel.

208
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:57,930
But she changed completely when she was drunk.

209
00:12:58,536 --> 00:12:59,771
She'd start crying and...

210
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,210
It must've been tough for her.

211
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,241
She must've been going through a lot.

212
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:10,710
I didn't understand back then, I do now.

213
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,484
Her husband abandoned his wife and children.

214
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:17,820
She had to work her bottom off to make ends meet.

215
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,621
Still, she shouldn't have done that.

216
00:13:22,296 --> 00:13:25,991
She shouldn't have treated her child that way no matter what.

217
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,104
I believed my mom hated me...

218
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,871
because I was a bad kid.

219
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:34,074
I swore, got in fights,

220
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:36,074
and got in trouble for stealing.

221
00:13:36,075 --> 00:13:38,641
But I had no choice back then.

222
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,844
Everyone around me insulted,

223
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:44,310
teased, and beat me.

224
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:50,151
And I was always hungry.

225
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:53,991
But the thing is,

226
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:56,721
when I was 12,

227
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:59,830
I started working for a wealthy family.

228
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:06,101
The boys in that house were so adorable and nice.

229
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,905
They smelled good and never swore.

230
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:11,810
They glowed from head to toe.

231
00:14:13,715 --> 00:14:16,080
If I'd been as good as them,

232
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,710
would my mom not have beaten me?

233
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,481
Would she have loved me?

234
00:14:28,396 --> 00:14:30,830
Well, anyway,

235
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:37,401
what can you do to be a good child then?

236
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:43,040
You have to become rich.

237
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,814
You can only be nice if you can make ends meet.

238
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,344
The world is a jungle.

239
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,555
When you have to prey on others to survive,

240
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,550
how can you possibly be nice?

241
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:57,151
First, survive by all means.

242
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,655
If others hit you, bite them.

243
00:14:58,656 --> 00:15:00,391
If you need something, steal it.

244
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:02,820
In addition,

245
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:06,790
the world is a tougher place for lonely girls like you.

246
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,434
Beasts are everywhere.

247
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:12,474
No matter how educated and respected they are,

248
00:15:12,475 --> 00:15:14,771
all men are the same.

249
00:15:18,815 --> 00:15:21,614
When those scumbags come on to you,

250
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:23,040
what are you supposed to do?

251
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:25,950
Report to the police.

252
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:29,651
Wrong answer. Take advantage of it.

253
00:15:32,126 --> 00:15:36,295
The law is never on our side.

254
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:37,891
So secure evidence by all means.

255
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,761
Record it if you can.

256
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:45,700
And then...

257
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,871
torment him until the day he dies.

258
00:15:50,246 --> 00:15:53,611
Threaten to destroy everything he has...

259
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:57,310
until he becomes as tame as a dog.

260
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:04,790
Do you understand?

261
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,121
- Yes. - Yes.

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

263
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,290
Yes, go ahead.

264
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:16,460
You've become such a great person.

265
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:21,271
Does your mom love you now?

266
00:16:23,975 --> 00:16:26,474
She passed away when I was 12.

267
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,145
She got completely drunk...

268
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:30,251
and fell down some stairs in the neighborhood.

269
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:36,280
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

271
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:42,521
Your lecture was so refreshing and realistic.

272
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:45,290
It really touched me, Ms. Jung.

273
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:50,131
I haven't given many lectures.

274
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,604
I'm sure it showed.

275
00:16:51,605 --> 00:16:55,405
Not at all. You were amazing.

276
00:16:55,406 --> 00:17:00,341
Speaking of which, please give another touching lecture soon.

277
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:01,540
Sure.

278
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:06,385
I'd love the opportunity.

279
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:08,180
Of course.

280
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,260
How did you find me?

281
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,591
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

282
00:17:54,065 --> 00:17:56,331
I know you already found it. Why are you even asking?

283
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:04,275
I get to decide where I go and who I meet.

284
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,215
Who gives you the right?

285
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:08,410
I'm your guardian whether you like it or not.

286
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,910
A guardian? You treat me like some animal you keep.

287
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:14,354
Haven't you learned a lesson yet?

288
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:17,051
No one approaches a person without a motive.

289
00:18:18,026 --> 00:18:19,225
Aren't you tired yet?

290
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:21,064
You always act like you're the smartest one,

291
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,364
but you follow anyone who shows the slightest kindness...

292
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,634
and end up being used and even kidnapped. You're such a fool.

293
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:26,730
Stop it.

294
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:38,341
Is it her fault to feel lonely?

295
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,581
You shouldn't talk to her like that.

296
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:45,351
Are you teaching me how to talk?

297
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:47,124
She's under my protection.

298
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,250
Exactly. You're the only one she has.

299
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,861
Can you be a little more honest?

300
00:19:03,036 --> 00:19:04,301
This is funny.

301
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,445
How long have you even been here?

302
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:10,710
Stop talking like you know everything.

303
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,381
I apologize if I was out of line.

304
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:20,281
Let's go.

305
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:43,601
Secretary.

306
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:45,041
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:56,485
How am I supposed to talk to a teenage girl?

308
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,591
Let me see.

309
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:01,624
Experts say you should listen from the other person's perspective.

310
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,864
Also, use positive language to improve the self-esteem of...

311
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:05,960
Forget it.

312
00:20:09,466 --> 00:20:12,031
Just order some books on the subject for me.

313
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:13,371
Yes, sir.

314
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:38,435
You asked me why I was a restaurant owner's son for 16 years,

315
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:39,531
remember?

316
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,670
That's when my parents...

317
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:46,770
passed away.

318
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:49,071
When I was 16.

319
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:52,071
Oh, is that right?

320
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:57,311
Why? Did they have an accident?

321
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:01,824
They got conned by a horrible con artist...

322
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,420
and lost everything they had.

323
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:06,450
My father took his own life.

324
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,720
My mom collapsed from the shock and eventually...

325
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:12,061
I see.

326
00:21:13,395 --> 00:21:16,531
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

327
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,531
I don't know what to say in a situation like this.

328
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:22,371
It's okay. It's been a long time.

329
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:27,311
But it's not something you can forget easily.

330
00:21:28,716 --> 00:21:30,081
You're right.

331
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:37,591
It was very hard, wasn't it?

332
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,051
It was the same for me.

333
00:21:39,395 --> 00:21:41,265
I hated being home alone.

334
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,720
So I slept anywhere and hung out with anyone.

335
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:45,331
I was lonely.

336
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:46,891
Like some stray dog.

337
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:55,541
You're strong, Elijah.

338
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:00,440
- I am? - Of course.

339
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:02,910
You endured everything alone in this big house.

340
00:22:05,585 --> 00:22:06,950
You're an incredible person.

341
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,855
What are you saying?

342
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,924
It doesn't suit you to say such cringy things.

343
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,861
Aren't you usually cynical?

344
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:16,490
Was it obvious?

345
00:22:17,595 --> 00:22:20,960
It's not easy to say things I don't mean.

346
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:24,131
Do you want to die?

347
00:22:26,306 --> 00:22:27,901
You pack a hard punch.

348
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,341
I wonder who you take after.

349
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:30,770
Good night.

352
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:12,235
I have to smile while I speak.

353
00:23:12,441 --> 00:23:14,006
I'm going to smile while I talk to her.

354
00:23:17,011 --> 00:23:18,175
Smile.

355
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:25,475
What is this? It was you?

356
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,445
What's with that face?

357
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:30,286

- How was your day? - What?

361
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:50,806
So did you have a good day?

362
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:53,705
Or did you have a bad day?

363
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:57,776
Is there anything you want to discuss with me?

364
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:09,725
Well... So...

365
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,356
What is it?

366
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,800
Who is the evil jerk who conned...

367
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,266
Ga On's parents?

368
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,566
You want to talk about Ga On again?

369
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:22,405
Right. I have to smile while I talk.

370
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,211
He scammed poor people out...

371
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:29,405
of hundreds of millions of dollars through a pyramid scheme.

372
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,751
There were over ten victims who committed suicide from it.

373
00:24:31,751 --> 00:24:33,675
- Really? - Yes.

374
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,445
I see.

375
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,256
Right, so...

376
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:42,826
My gosh. Secretary!

377
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,955
Secretary. Are you playing with me right now?

378
00:24:45,761 --> 00:24:47,501
All I need to do is follow what the book says?

379
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:50,965
Sir. Stress is bad for your health.

380
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,241
In the kitchen...

381
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,735
- What are you talking about? - Make sure you take one pill a day.

382
00:24:55,741 --> 00:24:58,576
You must take care of yourself at your age.

383
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,175
Forget it. Get lost.

384
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,485
(Multivitamins)

385
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,300
(Blue House)

386
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,195
I will get started now.

387
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:29,511
Regarding the unexpected remark...

388
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,411
that Judge Kang Yo Han made during the last live court show,

389
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:34,781
we are carefully looking into it from all perspectives...

390
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,506
It's fake news!

391
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:41,921
Hello. I, Heo Joong Se,

392
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:44,820
overcame all sorts of slanderous tricks to get to this position.

393
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,730
Now, a judge is spreading false rumors about me.

394
00:25:48,731 --> 00:25:50,695
How can our country run like this?

395
00:25:50,701 --> 00:25:53,971
Can Kang Yo Han, a man who spreads wild rumors during difficult times,

396
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:58,395
truly call himself a citizen of our great nation, Korea?

397
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:01,506
To be honest,

398
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:05,735
I have been receiving a lot of reports about Judge Kang.

399
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,810
I was told that Judge Kang...

400
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,309
is conspiring with a foreign nation to put our society in disarray.

401
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,220
That he's not a pure-blooded Korean.

402
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,320
In other words, he's different from us.

403
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,090
On top of that, I received reports...

404
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,816
that Judge Kang has been receiving funds from foreign countries.

405
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,530
For the sake of national security, if anyone gives us...

406
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:24,860
any information about Judge Kang Yo Han,

407
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,261
depending on the quality of the tip,

408
00:26:26,261 --> 00:26:29,296
we will provide you with a significant reward.

409
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,665
We'll be sure to reward you heavily.

410
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:35,070
Will the reward come out of your own pocket?

411
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,866
- That is all. - Please answer our questions.

412
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,036
He's going to go that far to get information on Judge Kang?

413
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,506
We will organize the contents of his speech and announce it later.

414
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:47,715
Are you sure you're not going too far?

415
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,685
It's not like politics is a comedy.

416
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,319
People will have something to say about it.

417
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,415
The more comedic it is, the better.

418
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,830
- What? - If they get used to...

419
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,261
the comedy and competition,

420
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,296
they won't see the complicated things in front of them.

421
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:03,495
Remember how I said that I would reward depending on quality?

422
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,635
That's creating competition.

423
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,905
I'm just adding entertainment to it and moving forward.

424
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:14,145
My gosh. Who can stop you?

425
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,576
I'm going to get them, so they can't come to their senses.

426
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,776
Will it be okay?

427
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:21,945
What?

428
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:24,960
Ten years ago, he was a famous actor who was known for his blunt remarks,

429
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:26,191
but now he's the president.

430
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:27,431
Yes, that's right.

431
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,556
Now it's the president, Minister of Justice, media, and conglomerates.

432
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,556
That's pretty much all of Korea.

433
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,995
Right. You just picked a fight with the country.

434
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,326
Are you okay with that?

435
00:27:37,501 --> 00:27:40,135
Do you know how they ended up gaining their power?

436
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:43,735
Through hypocrisy.

437
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:45,981
(Your help will create a happy Korea.)

438
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:49,306
When in trouble, people are moved by the smallest kindness.

439
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:53,245
After the pandemic, the foundation began expanding its charity.

440
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,485
But they didn't spend the most money on disaster relief.

441
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,455
What did they spend it on?

442
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,485
Advertisement.

443
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:06,526
They used all sorts of media outlets to advertise and exaggerate.

444
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,165
Noblesse oblige.

445
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,266
They created an image of the wealthy taking social responsibility.

446
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,511
They used that as a weapon to take over the administration.

447
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:16,435
What do you think they can do now?

448
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:18,205
Collect their capital.

449
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,635
No, it goes beyond that.

450
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:23,506
The Dream Home Village that they've been working extensively on...

451
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,046
is just a means of creating a large asylum using citizens' donations...

452
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:30,050
to put the homeless, the poor, and those with social discontent...

453
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,155
all in one place and get them out of sight. After that...

454
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:38,225
they will start a widespread redevelopment of the city.

455
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,366
I bet they purchased the land for it for cheap under a borrowed land.

456
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,165
Did you get your hands on definitive evidence?

457
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,110
You know that isn't easy.

458
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,511
Those people would easily blow up my judge's chambers without hesitation.

459
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:55,380
And yet you blew up the issue in front of the entire nation?

460
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,445
- It's fun. - What?

461
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:00,016
It should at least be fun...

462
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,645
if I'm standing at the edge.

463
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,161
Is this fun for you?

464
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:08,556
(It will be realized now.)

465
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,326
Don't you think it's irresponsible?

466
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:13,425
What about Elijah?

467
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,395
Did you even think about her?

468
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:22,235
Always.

469
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:25,235
Constantly.

470
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:34,691
Give me all the information you have on the foundation.

471
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:35,985
Are you going to help me?

472
00:29:37,661 --> 00:29:39,356
Just promise me one thing.

473
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:40,660
What is it?

474
00:29:40,661 --> 00:29:43,526
Subornation of perjury, abduction, blackmail,

475
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,296
and making of a fool of good citizens with your lies.

476
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,695
I can't become a shady law-breaker.

477
00:29:51,201 --> 00:29:54,435
Not in front of my parents who died because of a conman,

478
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:56,905
nor in front of Soo Hyun.

479
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,751
A judge...

480
00:30:00,751 --> 00:30:02,106
(It will be realized now. A just Korea.)

481
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:06,876
has the most power when they do what the law says, sir.

482
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,915
"You can't become a shady law-breaker."

483
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,356
"A judge has the most power when they do..."

484
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,655
"what the law says."

485
00:30:20,661 --> 00:30:21,925
Okay then.

486
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,165
(It will be realized now. A just Korea)

487
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,106
You gained the public's interest by raising doubt,

488
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,435
so what's your next plan?

489
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,640
Division.

490
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,376
(Minbo Group)

491
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,286
There's nothing we can do if those who have power stick together.

492
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:46,215
We need to shake them up.

493
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,695
Can't we start with something like this?

494
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,639
(Minbo Group)

495
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,006
(Lowest income, extra work, Minbo Group is evil)

496
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:24,955
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

497
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,596
Okay, I understand. Bye.

498
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,205
What floor is the chairman's office?

499
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:37,836
Judge Kang?

500
00:31:38,781 --> 00:31:39,975
It's the 20th floor.

501
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:47,985
(Lowest income, extra work. They kill you.)

502
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,385
This is the first floor.

503
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,586
Judge Kang Yo Han suddenly...

504
00:31:57,231 --> 00:32:00,629
Sir. The chairman is in a meeting.

505
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,369
- I'll wait. - Oh, will you?

506
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,336
Then come this way.

507
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,705
- You can return to your work. - Thank you.

508
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:42,336
Seven minutes and 30 seconds.

509
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:51,180
You're leaving, sir?

510
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:53,145
- I got what I needed. - I see.

511
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,856
(Minbo, 297-6 Namsandae-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul)

512
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,296
Goodbye.

513
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:26,676
You told me to call if something happened.

514
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:35,926
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

515
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,836
Five, four,

516
00:33:48,311 --> 00:33:51,176
three, two, one.

517
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,106
And a half, and a quarter.

518
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:59,180
(HMBN Chairman Park Du Man)

519
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:00,615
Hello, sir.

520
00:34:04,391 --> 00:34:06,656
Come on, talk to me, Judge Kang.

521
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:11,926
Is there something I don't know?

522
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,325
You know I'm always on your side, right?

523
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,566
That thing about buying witnesses.

524
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,305
It was Cha Kyung Hee's idea.

525
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,415
Can you handle this?

526
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,946
You made an enemy out of the foundation.

527
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:40,790
Do you have any questions for me?

528
00:34:40,791 --> 00:34:42,886
I can tell you everything I know.

529
00:34:50,971 --> 00:34:52,736
You're sucking your fingers.

530
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,435
You're hungry, aren't you?

531
00:34:57,641 --> 00:35:00,376
I was inconsiderate. Get something nice to eat.

532
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,205
Get out!

533
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:03,876
Eat something expensive!

534
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,046
We all work for a living, don't we?

535
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:10,886
You can go ahead.

536
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,185
It's me.

537
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,926
My chairman is with someone.

538
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,395
So,

539
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,740
everything you talked about with Park Du Man.

540
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:28,240
Everything he said is best to assume is a lie.

541
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:31,140
Whatever he gave you, it's fake.

542
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:33,006
He opens his mouth to lie.

543
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:34,850
Anything he says is a lie.

544
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,180
Since he was a kid...

545
00:35:36,181 --> 00:35:39,519
All day long, he'd think of ways to beat me.

546
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,249
This happened in middle school.

547
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,620
When he was in middle school, he told people he was in college.

548
00:35:44,621 --> 00:35:46,216
Think about it.

549
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,185
Why would I have to spend the foundation's money?

550
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:54,126
If anyone in the world did that, it would be Min Yong Shik.

551
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:56,799
Do you know how he nabbed his wife?

552
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,439
Ms. Pi.

553
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,939
He took her to a club, got her drunk, and then...

554
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,506
Minbo Group right now...

555
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,106
has a huge financial problem.

556
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:18,160
I'll get you the foundation's financial documents.

557
00:36:18,161 --> 00:36:20,689
I have it prepared already.

558
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,390
You don't have to worry. Everything is ready.

559
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,430
I'll give it all to you.

560
00:36:25,431 --> 00:36:29,365
Whatever Min Yong Shik gave you, you need to know they're fake.

561
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,026
Don't fall for it.

562
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:35,935
- Should I not? - No.

563
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:41,010
Eat up. Let's talk as we eat.

564
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:42,906
Try this. The food here's good.

568
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,580
Judge Kang, can you come with us?

569
00:37:51,581 --> 00:37:53,475
The VIP wishes to see you.

570
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:30,185
I'm surprised, Mr. President.

571
00:38:33,121 --> 00:38:34,216
About what?

572
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,986
I didn't think you'd invite me in that manner.

573
00:38:38,161 --> 00:38:39,495
It was scary.

574
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,830
They acted like they could've buried me.

575
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:43,700
Why would you say that?

576
00:38:43,701 --> 00:38:47,399
You put my photo up for the world to see...

577
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,169
and ruined my reputation.

578
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,906
It would be too hard to do something to you.

579
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,805
But the thing is,

580
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,245
that is why...

581
00:38:59,451 --> 00:39:02,749
people would think there's no way I'd touch you.

582
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,319
Would the head of state...

583
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,760
take action during an uproar?

584
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,359
Wouldn't that be fun?

585
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,495
While people wonder, time will pass.

586
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,129
If I were to release a few celebrity scandals,

587
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:18,640
people will forget about it in no time.

588
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:20,196
Like goldfish.

589
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:23,106
It's a reasonable scenario.

590
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,319
You're nervous.

591
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,915
The great Judge Kang Yo Han.

592
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,356
You look good in a suit.

593
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,220
You seem to be busy these days,

594
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:42,530
meeting this fool and that.

595
00:39:42,531 --> 00:39:44,656
I am. Just like right now.

596
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:52,236
This fool and that fool.

597
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:55,765
What on earth did they give you?

598
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:01,406
The scenario I just mentioned.

599
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:02,950
Doesn't it sound fun?

600
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:07,245
I could make that scenario happen right this moment.

601
00:40:10,891 --> 00:40:12,156
If that's the case...

602
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,586

603
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:20,395
Oh? What...

604
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,395
Greetings, subscribers of Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing.

605
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,470
It's a pleasure to meet you. Today, Mr. President invited me.

606
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:29,836
- Thank you, Mr. President. - Is this live?

607
00:40:30,141 --> 00:40:33,339
Wow, so many people joined and we just got started.

608
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,805
We're getting lots of comments too.

609
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,645
Yes, I am Kang Yo Han the judge.

610
00:40:39,181 --> 00:40:41,890
Thank you, Mr. President, for changing your mind.

611
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:45,086
You promise to take a close look into the foundation's corruption?

612
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,160
He invited me to the Blue House...

613
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:50,955
and suggested we give a joint statement.

614
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,196
- I appreciate it, Mr. President. - Well, Judge Kang...

615
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:57,900
Mr. President and I will find out...

616
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,895
how every dollar of your donations is being used.

617
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,810
That's it for today.

Wave at the camera.

624
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:17,915
Put on a smile.

625
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:21,415

Wow, is your analysis already over?

628
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:39,535
- Impressive. - It looked complicated at first,

629
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,845
- but I've found a weak spot. - A weak spot?

630
00:41:41,951 --> 00:41:44,250
PR. They've been doing too much PR.

631
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,581
They've been pouring out articles saying the foundation has donated...

632
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,015
10, 20 million dollars to the Dream Home project,

633
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,685
but the amount is just too big.

634
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,190
The project should be able to be covered...

635
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,086
solely by the donations from the public so far.

636
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,931
They've been advertising about their donations...

637
00:41:58,931 --> 00:42:01,225
while the project is covered by donations from the public?

638
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,696
It's just my suspicion.

639
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:06,296
We'll need the foundation's financial data to be sure.

640
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,636
The data from Park Du Man and Min Yong Shik...

641
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,365
are fake, aren't they?

642
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:12,340
Yes, they both fabricated the data...

643
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,075
so it'd look like the other embezzled money.

644
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,546
I didn't expect those sly dogs to give up data easily anyway.

645
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,245
Did we get any tip-offs?

646
00:42:19,681 --> 00:42:20,851
Nothing useful.

647
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:23,915
They were all pranks or lies from people who are after the reward.

648
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,356
We should still pay them.

649
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:28,015
- Pardon? - I mean the reward.

650
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:30,285
Why should we?

651
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,595
What's important is the number, not the content.

652
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,196
Put up the number of tip-offs all over the Internet.

653
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:39,495

657
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,216
You sound like an experienced con artist.

658
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,515
It slipped my mind.

659
00:43:02,761 --> 00:43:04,555
You've been personally affected by a con artist.

660
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:11,696
But isn't this a little different?

661
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:15,935

He's here!

Don't do it.

688
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,316
Don't ruin your life over a crook like him.

689
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,955
He's not worth it, Ga On.

690
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,406
- Thank you. - Thank you.

691
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:49,710
I'm being discharged soon. You don't have to come every day.

692
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:51,345
It's a hassle.

693
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:55,586
Weren't you complaining all morning that he wasn't here?

694
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:59,790
Shouldn't you protect a patient's privacy?

695
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:01,185
Maybe it was someone else.

696
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,785
You did that?

697
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:10,895
Anyway, what on earth is Kang Yo Han up to?

698
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:13,296
This looks like a total fraud to me.

699
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,606
What?

700
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,035
You should rest up.

701
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,081
Your recovery is more important.

702
00:48:20,081 --> 00:48:22,776
How can I rest up? I've got so much digging to do.

703
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:24,180
The false testimony,

704
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:25,915
the church fire,

705
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,575
and Elijah. Is she doing okay?

706
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:33,216
It must've been too much to deal with...

707
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,256
at such a young age.

708
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:39,756
Did she remind you of me when I was little?

709
00:48:41,971 --> 00:48:43,426
You're shameless.

710
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,371
How could you compare yourself to that adorable girl?

711
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,900
Can't you look at yourself more objectively?

712
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:49,006
Yes, ma'am.

713
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:51,035
You're obviously fine. I'll get going.

714
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,136
I can't stand you, but you're still my guest.

715
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,506
Do you want some apples?

716
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,475
I can't believe you, Soo Hyun.

717
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,115
Show me how well you can peel an apple.

718
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:09,185
All right. Let's see here.

719
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:18,696
What's wrong?

720
00:49:40,161 --> 00:49:42,386
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

721
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:46,796
I'll do it.

722
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:49,066
If you peel it, there won't be anything left to eat.

723
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:53,836
Gosh, you're one cold punk.

724
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:12,684
Judge Kang Yo Han has received...

725
00:50:12,685 --> 00:50:15,013
over 20 tips regarding the corruption...

726
00:50:15,014 --> 00:50:17,553
of Social Responsibility Foundation.

727
00:50:17,554 --> 00:50:20,724
Other than stating that they are all false,

728
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:23,693
the foundation has not released any other official statements.

729
00:50:23,694 --> 00:50:26,463
Over 100,000 petitions to reveal the truth have been submitted...

730
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:28,120
to the Blue House National Petition.

731
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:30,959
Don't get distracted and get back to work.

732
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:40,769
I heard you can say anything, and they'll give you money.

733
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:43,544
I heard it's a lot of money too.

734
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:44,669
It's true.

735
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:47,740
I have a lot of expenses next month, should I try it too?

736
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:50,180
No way. What if you get caught?

737
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:56,320
They actively support Kang Yo Han? Those jerks in the opposition party.

738
00:50:57,324 --> 00:50:59,763
"The live court show was a means to distract the citizens."

739
00:50:59,764 --> 00:51:01,823
"It could violate human rights."

740
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:04,763
That's what they said as they tried to act so high and mighty.

741
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,859
That's what politics is like.

742
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,700
The enemy of your enemies is an ally.

743
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:09,899
More importantly,

744
00:51:10,875 --> 00:51:14,939
what did you two give Kang Yo Han?

745
00:51:17,214 --> 00:51:19,084
It's nothing. It really isn't.

746
00:51:19,085 --> 00:51:21,439
I gave him something to mess with him and confuse him.

747
00:51:21,585 --> 00:51:23,084
While you're at it, were you hoping it messed with me too?

748
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,350
Gosh, what do you take me for?

749
00:51:25,654 --> 00:51:27,185
In any case, Kang Yo Han...

750
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:28,820
will just dig himself into a deeper hole by looking into it.

751
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,294
What about you, Chairman Min? What did you give him?

752
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,224
Are you planning on getting into the broadcasting business with me gone?

753
00:51:33,225 --> 00:51:34,559
That's a good idea.

754
00:51:35,264 --> 00:51:37,863
- You punk. What are you saying? - Let go.

755
00:51:37,864 --> 00:51:39,300
Who do you think...

756
00:51:40,634 --> 00:51:42,970
would like what's going on here?

757
00:51:45,844 --> 00:51:48,573
The walls of a castle are broken from the inside out.

758
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:50,673
Fix it before it gets too late.

759
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:54,079
Kang Yo Han will keep going without giving you a chance to breathe.

760

(Sir, Judge Kang is holding a press conference and airing it live.)

761
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,390

We keep getting tips.

765
00:52:18,174 --> 00:52:20,340
Many people are being courageous and stepping up...

766
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:22,244
to help reveal the truth.

767
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:24,244
Thanks to the courageous informants,

768
00:52:24,245 --> 00:52:26,180
the behavior of the foundation is changing too.

769
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,684
Did you all watch the president's YouTube video?

770
00:52:28,685 --> 00:52:30,354
Korea's Total Change.

771
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,320
- Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing. - How refreshing!

772
00:52:36,525 --> 00:52:38,689
There's something that's even more surprising.

773
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:45,903
Two executive directors of the foundation gave me something...

774
00:52:45,904 --> 00:52:47,329
and said it was their financial records.

775
00:52:49,475 --> 00:52:51,374
- What is that? - What did he give him?

776
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,100
- What's in the envelopes? - What could it be?

777
00:53:15,324 --> 00:53:17,959
- What is that? - He gave him something too?

778
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:28,870
It's very interesting.

779
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:31,769
They gave a subcontract to a company run by a family member,

780
00:53:31,944 --> 00:53:34,309
and they bought a site for a future business venture in advance.

781
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:38,950
As it happens, the documents they gave me had opposing information,

782
00:53:38,984 --> 00:53:41,019
so I need to look into it further.

783
00:53:41,355 --> 00:53:44,254
However, this isn't the only problem. Let's have a look.

785
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:48,664

(Status of Donations)

787
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:57,570
Where is all of the money that the directors have donated...

788
00:53:57,804 --> 00:53:59,200

(Status of Donations)

790
00:54:05,014 --> 00:54:07,184
According to Judge Kim Ga On,

791
00:54:07,185 --> 00:54:10,649
who has gone through all of the foundation's financial records,

792
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:12,625
the amount that they claimed to have donated,

793
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:14,579
and the amount that was received by the foundation...

794
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,990
don't add up.

795
00:54:22,335 --> 00:54:25,359
Did you really get your hands on the foundation's financial records?

796
00:54:27,034 --> 00:54:28,129
Yes.

797
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:31,169
A courageous person on the inside sent it to us.

798
00:54:32,134 --> 00:54:33,744
If the amounts don't add up,

799
00:54:33,745 --> 00:54:35,439
does that mean someone embezzled that money?

800
00:54:35,614 --> 00:54:36,814
If they didn't embezzle it,

801
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,609
then they never donated anything from the beginning.

803
00:54:44,654 --> 00:54:48,419
Did Judge Kim Ga On participate in revealing this as well?

804
00:54:52,594 --> 00:54:53,789
Yes, that's right.

805
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:57,229

(I am against it.)

807
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:03,899
Judge Kim Ga On is known as an uptight man of principle.

808
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:07,570
But I'm sure you were unaware of this.

809
00:55:08,344 --> 00:55:09,570
Oh, my.

814
00:55:41,745 --> 00:55:44,439
Judge Kim overcame such hardship.

00:55:44,714 --> 00:55:47,443
That's why he couldn't stand by and watch...

After we take all measures to protect the people who sent us tips,

818
00:56:00,165 --> 00:56:03,390
we will reveal all of the contents of the reports we received.

819
00:56:03,665 --> 00:56:06,363
It'll take place in one week right here.

820
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:07,459
Thank you,

821
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,343
Do you have an informant from the foundation?

822
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:20,783
Do you know the informant?

823
00:56:20,784 --> 00:56:22,954
Judge Kim. Is that article really about your parents?

824
00:56:22,955 --> 00:56:24,814
- Could you tell us more? - Is it true?

825
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,883
- Would you like to add anything? - Please give us a statement.

826
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:27,979
Judge Kim.

827
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:32,363

- Judge Kim? - Judge Kim!

829
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,689
- Judge Kim. - Excuse me.

830
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:40,334

Was this your plan all along?

834
00:56:53,145 --> 00:56:55,140
Was I just a tool for your scheme?

835
00:56:55,614 --> 00:56:57,213
How are you any different from them?

836
00:56:57,214 --> 00:56:59,919
Is it okay to use whatever you want to achieve your goal?

00:57:00,324 --> 00:57:03,024
"You can't become a shady law-breaker."

838

"A judge has the most power when they do what the law says."

Don't you think you're being a bit naive?

840
00:57:10,734 --> 00:57:12,459
This is a war.

841
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:15,729
What are you going to reveal next week?

842
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:18,669
The financial records you perjured? The tips that don't exist?

843
00:57:18,975 --> 00:57:21,039
Even if it takes time and is hard,

844
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:24,240
we should punish them properly according to the law.

845
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,280
Really? I guess you were satisfied.

846
00:57:27,714 --> 00:57:31,283
I guess you were really moved by the strict punishment...

847
00:57:31,284 --> 00:57:33,450
the fraud who killed your parents received.

848
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,724

849
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:38,224
they followed all the principles and processes...

850
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:41,024
and endured the tricks laid out by the expensive lawyers.

851
00:57:41,025 --> 00:57:43,064
They endured the trial as it got drawn out,

852
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:45,193
and the sentence he received was 17 years in prison.

853
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:48,463
Is that it? Is that what justice is to you?

854
00:57:48,464 --> 00:57:50,300
Don't talk like that!

855
00:57:54,674 --> 00:57:57,340
Ordinary citizens like my parents...

856
00:57:58,014 --> 00:58:00,939
were a part of the jury and they contemplated it for a long time.

857
00:58:01,844 --> 00:58:03,713
Despite all the tricks,

858
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:06,419
they came to a conclusion in accordance with the law.

859
00:58:07,054 --> 00:58:08,419
That's the system.

860
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:11,820
Even if we hate it, that's the system.

861
00:58:14,295 --> 00:58:17,090
Is that what you had to believe in order to live?

862
00:58:19,534 --> 00:58:21,204
Is that what Yoon Soo Hyun and Min Jung Ho...

863
00:58:21,205 --> 00:58:24,700
the two people you have left in your life told you?

864
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:29,004
Did you suppress your desire to stab and kill him and end your life...

865
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,309
by holding onto that belief?

866
00:58:34,214 --> 00:58:35,979
Is that it? Is it?

867
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:40,019
Don't come to your own conclusions.

868
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,289
Who do you think you are?

869
00:58:47,395 --> 00:58:48,820
Who do you think you are?

870
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:04,870
There's something I want to show you.

871
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:15,280
What... What happened? What is going on?

872
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,990
That's impossible.

873
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:19,320
It's impossible to take out the financial records.

874
00:59:19,895 --> 00:59:22,559
Chairman Min. Can you take responsibility for this?

875
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:25,289
What if all of this is true?

876
00:59:25,534 --> 00:59:27,834
He said he'd reveal it in a week.

877
00:59:27,835 --> 00:59:30,870
The entire nation will be watching. What are you going to do?

878
00:59:31,105 --> 00:59:33,600
The viewership ratings will be off the charts.

879
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:36,939
That's enough!

880
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:38,510
My gosh, you punk!

881
00:59:40,214 --> 00:59:42,140
I'm pretty good at playing cards,

882
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,213
and I can tell Kang Yo Han is bluffing.

883
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,320
He doesn't have anything, so he's coming out stronger.

884
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,749
Excuse me.

00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:53,795
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

886
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:57,930
Kang Yo Han is capable of making cards if he doesn't have any.

887
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,100
Without batting an eyelid.

888
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:01,864
Then we must cut off his hands!

889
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,403
It's a huge game and the whole nation's watching.

890
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:07,070
You three voluntarily upped the stakes.

891
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,410
To reveal that Kang Yo Han is bluffing,

892
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:12,879
you must show your hands.

893
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,280
Are you okay with that?

894
01:00:16,214 --> 01:00:19,050
Your trumped up donations aren't the only problem.

895
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:22,153
Every detail on how the Dream Home project funds were spent.

896
01:00:22,154 --> 01:00:24,820
Future spending plans and...

897
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:29,430
the project's real purpose.

898
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:31,459
Ms. Jung.

899
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:33,399
I apologize.

900
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:36,370
I spoke out of line.

901
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:40,269
So what? What are you saying?

902
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:42,039
What will you do about this?

903
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:45,169
We have...

904
01:00:46,614 --> 01:00:49,209
Mr. Seo, don't we?

905
01:01:06,105 --> 01:01:09,700
(Fasting and Praying for Korea, Do Not Enter)

906
01:01:23,455 --> 01:01:26,220
Thanks to Kang Yo Han,

907
01:01:26,455 --> 01:01:30,890
will I get the chance to get back up?

908
01:02:26,745 --> 01:02:27,910
He's here.

909
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:32,979
- Mr. Seo. - Mr. Seo.

910
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:40,120
There's no way to meet you when you're in prayer.

911
01:02:40,225 --> 01:02:42,789
It can't have been easy to join us.

912
01:02:42,995 --> 01:02:45,629
You all look dreadful.

913
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:48,329
Why?

914
01:02:49,105 --> 01:02:52,840
Is this issue getting you worked up?

915
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:56,709
Yes. It's such a mess.

916
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,539
We must sort it out before it's too late.

917
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:02,109
I have employees who are getting ideas.

918
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:05,709
I will deal with it.

919
01:03:09,324 --> 01:03:11,525
If you were to help us,

920
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:13,524
we'd have nothing to worry about.

921
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:15,795
That's right. Mr. Seo, in our country,

922
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:19,899
you are the only person who can sort this out.

923
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,300
Yes. You're the only one.

924
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:25,329
The last remaining true teacher.

925
01:03:26,105 --> 01:03:27,174
An elder of society.

926
01:03:27,174 --> 01:03:28,769
You're going too far.

927
01:03:29,174 --> 01:03:30,370
Anyway,

928
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,939
if I were to speak,

929
01:03:33,045 --> 01:03:37,685
the public will awaken from Kang Yo Han's trickery...

930
01:03:37,685 --> 01:03:39,109
and come around.

931
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:43,320
There is no reason to react to every small allegation.

932
01:03:43,324 --> 01:03:44,855
You are right.

933
01:03:44,855 --> 01:03:47,495
Once we gain control of the media,

934
01:03:47,495 --> 01:03:50,764
we can turn the flow and ride it out.

935
01:03:50,764 --> 01:03:52,094
I'm so impressed.

936
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,634
You hit the nail on the head.

937
01:03:53,634 --> 01:03:55,530
Still, we need...

938
01:03:56,234 --> 01:03:58,269
something to toss them.

939
01:04:02,975 --> 01:04:04,674
Something to toss?

940
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,685
The people need something like a bone...

941
01:04:07,685 --> 01:04:09,240
to keep them quiet.

942
01:04:09,384 --> 01:04:12,680
Something to bite and chew on.

943
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,550
If you were to name someone,

944
01:04:16,654 --> 01:04:17,924
who would it be?

945
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:19,189
Come on now.

946
01:04:19,324 --> 01:04:22,590
Don't we all know someone ideal?

947
01:04:23,435 --> 01:04:27,200
While I remained in my room praying for our country,

948
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:32,399
someone has been handling all the foundation's business.

949
01:04:33,005 --> 01:04:34,939
Do you mean Ms. Jung?

950
01:04:36,574 --> 01:04:40,745
Ms. Jung does her job so carefully and thoroughly.

951
01:04:40,745 --> 01:04:42,109
Doesn't she?

952
01:04:42,114 --> 01:04:43,910
She's still a mere slave.

953
01:04:44,284 --> 01:04:47,479
Didn't we groom her up to use her at a time like this?

954
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:53,090
How do you think we should...

955
01:04:53,295 --> 01:04:55,220
put her to good use, then?

956
01:04:55,395 --> 01:04:59,359
She's not the type to stay quiet if we frame her for something.

957
01:04:59,804 --> 01:05:01,300
First,

958
01:05:01,804 --> 01:05:06,070
we must make sure that she doesn't talk.

959
01:05:06,134 --> 01:05:08,370
- Right? - Of course.

960
01:05:09,815 --> 01:05:11,070
Forever.

961
01:05:12,114 --> 01:05:14,439
Silence her so she'll take the fall.

962
01:05:15,045 --> 01:05:16,240
Do you understand?

963
01:05:22,054 --> 01:05:23,390
I understand.

964
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:25,390
Forever.

965
01:05:50,554 --> 01:05:54,350
(True correction, a bright future)

966
01:05:55,955 --> 01:05:57,289
What are you doing?

967
01:05:57,295 --> 01:05:58,490
Get out.

968
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:07,499
(Corrections)

969
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,369
We're huge fans, Judge Kang.

970
01:06:46,444 --> 01:06:47,444
We are...

971
01:06:47,444 --> 01:06:48,545
- We are... - We are...

972
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:49,643
power!

973
01:06:49,644 --> 01:06:50,909
- power! - power!

974
01:06:54,345 --> 01:06:55,879
You have our respect.

975
01:07:03,654 --> 01:07:05,824
- We are... - We are...

976
01:07:05,824 --> 01:07:07,989
- power! - power!

01:07:07,995 --> 01:07:09,894
- We are... - We are...

978
01:07:09,894 --> 01:07:12,090
- power! - power!

979
01:07:12,135 --> 01:07:13,999
- We are... - We are...

980
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:15,104
power!

981
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:16,874
(Advanced correction brings on the future)

982
01:07:16,875 --> 01:07:21,169

(Advanced correction brings on the future)

Inmate number 70618,

986
01:07:38,524 --> 01:07:41,060
Doh Young Choon. Visiting Room Seven.

987
01:07:48,404 --> 01:07:50,430
Do you want me to lose my mind?

988
01:07:51,274 --> 01:07:53,739
Do you want to see me strangle him?

989
01:07:56,875 --> 01:07:58,140
You scumbag.

990
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:14,194
Inmate number 70618,

991
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:15,560
Doh Young Choon.

992
01:08:50,465 --> 01:08:51,590
No.

993
01:08:52,034 --> 01:08:53,499
He's not Doh Young Choon.

994
01:08:53,904 --> 01:08:55,999
He's someone else. Something's wrong.

995
01:08:56,774 --> 01:08:59,400
Inmate number 70618, he is Doh Young Choon.

996
01:09:00,205 --> 01:09:01,400
He's not.

997
01:09:01,974 --> 01:09:03,569
He's not Doh Young Choon.

998
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:05,340
This is impossible.

999
01:09:06,345 --> 01:09:07,684
It's someone else.

1000
01:09:07,684 --> 01:09:11,050
He got additional charges for economic crimes...

1001
01:09:11,154 --> 01:09:12,550
and was sentenced to 17 years.

1002
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,850
Name, Doh Young Choon.

1003
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:19,959
(Doh Young Choon, factory worker, high school dropout)

1004
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:27,659
I don't know what your story is,

1005
01:09:27,734 --> 01:09:30,999
but his inmate and ID number, date of imprisonment,

1006
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:32,430
they all match up.

1007
01:09:39,015 --> 01:09:40,209
Never once,

1008
01:09:42,314 --> 01:09:45,110
not even for a single day have I forgotten his face.

1009
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:52,050
It's not him. It's another person.

1010
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:55,159
Sir, why are you in there?

1011
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:57,060
Sir.

1012
01:09:57,265 --> 01:09:59,590
Why are you in there? Come out.

1013
01:09:59,835 --> 01:10:00,930
Sir!

1014
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,060
Let's go.

(Establishment of order, promotion of morality)

1016
01:11:15,474 --> 01:11:17,273
The only thing that can be thoroughly manipulated...

1017
01:11:17,274 --> 01:11:18,970
is the system itself.

1018
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:20,840
This is the system.

1019
01:11:21,885 --> 01:11:24,209
A system has no chance against power.

1020
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:29,279
Power can control a system however it likes.

1021
01:11:42,205 --> 01:11:45,900
(Morality)

1022
01:13:35,385 --> 01:13:37,850
- Oh... - Have you been somewhere?

1023
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:39,350
No.

1024
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,980
I just stepped out for some air.

1025
01:13:43,654 --> 01:13:44,949
That's not good.

1026
01:13:45,524 --> 01:13:48,919
The air is too cold for an old man like you.

1027
01:13:49,364 --> 01:13:51,094
Your knees must be freezing.

1028
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:53,560
No, I'm fine.

1029
01:14:09,684 --> 01:14:11,480
You've aged.

1030
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:15,949
Is it because of me?

1031
01:14:17,095 --> 01:14:19,223
Because I have something on you...

1032
01:14:19,224 --> 01:14:20,959
and have been bullying you?

1033
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,860
No, not at all.

1034
01:14:24,765 --> 01:14:26,760
It's all my fault.

1035
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:31,199
I'm not in the position to blame anyone.

1036
01:14:33,404 --> 01:14:34,569
Are you sure?

1037
01:14:37,814 --> 01:14:40,514
Wow, I'm impressed.

1038
01:14:40,515 --> 01:14:42,739
I'd blame me.

1039
01:14:43,715 --> 01:14:46,379
I guess all the meditating paid off.

1040
01:14:51,324 --> 01:14:52,489
Remember?

1041
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:57,090
When I first came here to work for you,

1042
01:14:58,095 --> 01:15:00,900
I was still pretty young.

1043
01:15:02,104 --> 01:15:03,199
Yes,

1044
01:15:04,205 --> 01:15:05,400
you were.

1045
01:15:07,104 --> 01:15:08,539
Why did you do that?

1046
01:15:11,074 --> 01:15:12,739
Why?

1047
01:15:14,745 --> 01:15:16,879
I was just a little girl who had nowhere else to go.

1048
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:37,629
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

1049
01:15:37,974 --> 01:15:40,300
I never got the chance to cry once.

1050
01:15:51,055 --> 01:15:52,150
Stand up.

1051
01:16:23,585 --> 01:16:25,579
Let's put an end to this.

1052
01:16:27,625 --> 01:16:29,119
I forgive you.

1053
01:16:30,894 --> 01:16:31,989
Pardon?

1054
01:16:33,295 --> 01:16:36,794
I do. You're an important person.

1055
01:16:36,795 --> 01:16:38,890
It's your responsibility to save this country.

1056
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:42,199
Everything's already been discussed.

1057
01:16:56,484 --> 01:17:00,010
It's okay. Everything will be all right.

1058
01:17:02,024 --> 01:17:06,390
You'll die an honorable death as the respected Chairman Seo.

1059
01:17:07,394 --> 01:17:08,720
It's more than you deserve.

1060
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,860
It's a lot more...

1061
01:17:12,965 --> 01:17:16,400
than a pig like you deserves.

1062
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:58,844
Chairman Seo Jeong Hak of Social Responsibility Foundation passed on.

1063
01:17:58,845 --> 01:18:00,744
It's been reported that he took his own life...

1064
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:03,044
as a way to take responsibility...

1065
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,180
for the recent donation embezzlement allegations.

1066
01:18:05,184 --> 01:18:07,483
All the employees involved in the embezzlement...

1067
01:18:07,484 --> 01:18:09,783
have destroyed all evidence and fled.

1068
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:12,254
It seems that the deceased was devastated by this...

1069
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,294
and decided to bear his cross.

1070
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:16,464
Overcoming many hardships, he devoted his life...

1071
01:18:16,465 --> 01:18:19,764
to helping those in need and promoting the national spirit.

1072
01:18:19,765 --> 01:18:22,733
His death has left the entire country in grief.

(The Devil Judge)

1081
01:20:38,835 --> 01:20:41,300
I lived on so I could go back there.

1082
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:45,814
As the master of the world you kicked me out of.

1083
01:20:45,814 --> 01:20:48,015
A monster who releases their brakes...

1084
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:49,783
never stops when it's best.

1085
01:20:49,784 --> 01:20:51,010
What are you doing?

1086
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:53,114
The show must go on.

1087

The public's support is our only weapon.

1088
01:20:55,425 --> 01:20:56,955
What is Kang Yo Han's intention?

1089
01:20:56,955 --> 01:21:00,390
You want me to see you enjoy life so I will lose my mind!

1090
01:21:00,394 --> 01:21:02,959
I told you before. Any elements of risk...

1091
01:21:03,095 --> 01:21:05,629
You are a lot like me in this aspect.

1092
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,329
Is that why you like me?
