=Episode 31=

16
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,199
Is this the construction site
of the Entertainment Center?

17
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,080
This is it.

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,399
Too bad.

19
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,399
Such a nice piece of land! The project
has been put on hold for over one year.

20
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,960
If your dad were here,

21
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,320
he'd be heartbroken.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,279
To be honest, Yuzheng,

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,839
I really admire your father.

24
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,639
He had so much courage
to take this project.

25
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,360
I can see Mr. Lei's ambition
at that time.

26
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,679
This project

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,839
was so sensational at that time.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,639
I've seen the design of the
Entertainment Center.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,399
Now I've seen
the construction site as well.

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,759
Although time passed
and everything changed,

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
you can still see
(Foundation, February 2016)

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
how vigorous Mr. Lei
was to this project.

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,520
He was trying to
leave something great to Yutian.

34
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,039
Yutian was founded by my father.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
In other word, it was his life.

36
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,440
What he did for
the Entertainment Center project,

37
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,160
is much more than what I did,
as his son.

38
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,320
I think

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,240
the Entertainment Center project

40
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,639
was envisioned in his mind
a million times.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,160
Unfortunately, he cannot
see this anymore.

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,199
Siyang, how about

43
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,720
I restart this project?

44
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,440
Pretty hard.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I called it "hard"

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,479
not only because of the financial issue,

47
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,720
but also people.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,199
Firstly, you have to convince the board

49
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,839
to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,399
Even the board agrees

51
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,520
to restart
the Entertainment Center project,

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,119
Lin Xiangyuan probably

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,759
will set obstacles in your way,

54
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,080
and put you in a dilemma.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,800
I am well prepared.

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,600
I remember last time Jiang Jin
and Lin Xiangyuan

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
met you,

58
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,600
they promised you at the table that

59
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,199
they would operate this project well.

60
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,160
But with what we can see today,

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,759
I think, you already have the answer.

62
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:50,720
Besides, don't forget.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,919
Though you are
the majority shareholder of Yutian,

64
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,839
you actually

65
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,759
cannot join the decision-making.

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
The first thing we have to do...

67
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,240
To prove that I was innocent?

68
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
Isn't it?

69
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:05,520
Siyang, I can understand
what you are talking about.

70
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,320
So it is better than
not to act and fail.

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,360
I need to go back to Yutian.

72
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:11,039
Are you sure?

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,679
Yes.

74
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,119
I will not only go back to Yutian,

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,119
but also let everyone know that

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,040
I, Lei Yuzheng,
will fulfill my dad's last wish.

77
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,359
I will build up a great monument

78
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,040
from this project.

79
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:31,200
Let's move on to the last item.

80
00:04:32,359 --> 00:04:33,359
Regarding Lei Yuzheng's

81
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,279
apportionment as the assistant of
the chairman of board,

82
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,799
please vote.

83
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,720
Lei Yuzheng was arrested
for internal information leakage.

84
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,079
According to the law,

85
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,320
he must not be in the top management
within five years.

86
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,119
Everyone,

87
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,440
please allow me to speak a few words.

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,239
According to the law,

89
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,760
Lei Yuzheng

90
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,480
should not be in the top management
of a listed company.

91
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,040
But

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,760
it never says
he cannot work for the company.

93
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,320
So,

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,600
for the appointment of Lei Yuzheng
as the assistant of the chairman,

95
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
I agree.

96
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,279
OK, approved.

97
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,799
They didn't do the cleaning.

98
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,679
I remember that Mr. Lei

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,679
hated having a dirty table.

100
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,200
I will clean it up.

101
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't bother.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,399
Mr. Lei,

103
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
I just heard that you are back.

104
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,760
Weicheng, long time no see.

105
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,359
You're just the same.

106
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:19,399
Mr. Lei,

107
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,040
you still look great.

108
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,040
It's really nice to see you again.

109
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,000
You are back now, which is great.

110
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,079
The Entertainment Center project
can go ahead.

111
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,839
Seeing that project be held,

112
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,399
I was so sad.

113
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,959
Now, it is so terrible.

114
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
We really feel sorry

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,399
to your dad, Mr. Lei.

116
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,079
But we cannot find out any solution.

117
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,640
There is nothing we can do but worry.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,799
You are all senior staff.

119
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,679
For the previous period,

120
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,119
I really appreciate your hard work.

121
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,000
If you can wait,

122
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,040
I believe,

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
as long as you keep working for Yutian,

124
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
it will become better and better.

125
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,440
Mr. Lei, what you just said

126
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,279
makes us feel secure and comfortable.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,880
We look forward to the day when
the project is successfully completed.

128
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,119
Mr. Lei,

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,799
what do you think

130
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,080
Lin Xiangyuan was
thinking about just now?

131
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
Your opinion?

132
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,679
I think he was thinking about

133
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,119
why you are back so soon.

134
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,280
He invited me back to Yutian
a few days ago.

135
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,000
So having me back,

136
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,559
he should not feel surprised.

137
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,080
For what happened in the past,

138
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,119
I am terrible sorry.

139
00:09:04,359 --> 00:09:06,159
I know, in my life,

140
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,479
no matter what I do,

141
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,080
I cannot pay it off.

142
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,479
Let the past pass.

143
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,559
But I have to tell you.

144
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,400
Before doing anything,

145
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,799
you should think well.

146
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,039
Please don't worry.

147
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,280
In the future, even if I get killed,

148
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,400
I will never make this kind of mistake.

149
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,679
Don't exaggerate your words.

150
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
I don't want to get you killed.

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,599
Hello, Mr. Lin.

152
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,919
One is the former CEO,
and the other is the current CEO.

153
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,679
It's going to be a tough competition.
One of them is going to lose.

154
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,479
You're right.

155
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,440
After all, Mr. Lei is from Lei's family.

156
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,679
Hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

157
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,159
Hard to tell who the "lion" is,
and who the "hare" is?

158
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,280
Lin Xiangyuan,

159
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,479
how can you fight with me?!

160
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,960
Mr. Lin,

161
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,000
Lei Yuzheng is back.

162
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,400
You look so worried.

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,799
Lei Ting passed away.

164
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,359
Lei Yuzheng is
the most majority shareholder of Yutian.

165
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,400
He is just back to his own company.

166
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:43,400
Don't be surprised.

167
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,599
Mr. Lin, you're really
holding your nerve.

168
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,679
Didn't you say that
he didn't want to come back?

169
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,919
To tell you the truth,

170
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,159
I invited Lei Yuzheng back.

171
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,039
So, Mr. Lin,

172
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,840
what are you thinking?

173
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,520
You just wait and see.

174
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,599
Don't you think that

175
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,960
Lei Yuzheng is back at this moment

176
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,200
with some purpose?

177
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,400
What purpose?

178
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,479
You're not afraid of him
to prove his innocence?

179
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,799
We have to pay more attention.

180
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,479
Xie, can you please use your brain?

181
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,119
At this moment, if Lei Yuzheng
were not in the building of Yutian,

182
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,679
will you know
what he is planning out here?

183
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,440
Right.

184
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,039
Mr. Lin, you are so thoughtful.

185
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,960
Why didn't I think of that?

186
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,280
That's why

187
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,119
I am the CEO,

188
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,080
and you are my assistant.

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,239
Of course.

190
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,280
You're the CEO. Definitely,
I'm not comparable to you.

191
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,760
Mr. Lin,

192
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,239
where are you going?

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Lei Yuzheng is back.
I am going to meet him.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,640
Qunfei,

195
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,440
doing cleaning?

196
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,320
Mr. Lin.

197
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,719
You're here to see Mr. Lei?

198
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:17,640
I brought two cleaners

199
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,559
to clean the office for Mr. Lei.

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,039
It's fine. No more cleaning.

201
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,280
I have cleaned it well.

202
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Oh, Qunfei.

203
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,599
Have you gone through
the job on-board process?

204
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,799
I am not in a hurry.

205
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,000
After Mr. Lei
appointing me the position,

206
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,919
I will go through the process.

207
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,119
OK.

208
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,559
Don't wait until your
job position is determined.

209
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I will require someone
to give you an access card.

210
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,960
So you can go in and out freely.

211
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Do you think, for Mr. Lei,

212
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,719
he also needs one?

213
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,320
Qunfei,

214
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,080
you're really funnier than before.

215
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
No need to worry about Mr. Lei.

216
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,640
He can go in and out
without any access card.

217
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,080
You're right. I forgot.

218
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:24,200
I just thought

219
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,400
if Mr. Lei wants to get in Yutian

220
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,960
but someone stops him,

221
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,799
that would be so embarrassed.

222
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,400
Please tell Mr. Lei I was here.

223
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:35,719
Sure.

224
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,320
Such a big deal,

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,320
I will not forget.

226
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,559
Yuzheng,

227
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280
you're back now.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
What's your plan?

229
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,000
My plan?

230
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,359
To be honest,

231
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,760
this time,

232
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm going to do only one thing.

233
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,520
Yuzheng,

234
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,359
no matter what you are going to do,

235
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,960
Uncle Jiang
will always stand on your side.

236
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,559
Thank you.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,280
Then, Uncle Jiang,
I will come straight to the point.

238
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I want to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

239
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,080
The Entertainment Center project

240
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:10,880
is not on the progress?

241
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,919
What do you mean to restart?

242
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
The Entertainment Center project
has been on hold for more than one year.

243
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,280
I was at the
construction site yesterday.

244
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,320
This is what it looks like now.

245
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,520
On hold? When was that?

246
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
Why didn't I know that?

247
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,280
Yuzheng,

248
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,320
this is my fault.

249
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
I was worried about you,

250
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,239
so a lot of things were not followed.

251
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,719
Uncle Jiang's negligence.

252
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,799
Uncle Jiang,

253
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,359
I know you are now the chairman.

254
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:52,880
You should be very busy.

255
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,960
You cannot focus on every detail.

256
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,159
So, today, I come here.

257
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
I don't blame you.

258
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,599
But for the
Entertainment Center project,

259
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,280
Mr. Lin and other directors

260
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:05,840
have different opinions.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,119
My dad passed away.

262
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,799
I was not here.

263
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,239
So, such a big project being on hold

264
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,760
is inevitable.

265
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,880
I can understand.

266
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,640
Yuzheng, you can think like that.

267
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,479
I'm glad and relieved.

268
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:23,440
I

269
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,239
feel involuntary sometimes.

270
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,320
Restarting the project

271
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,760
must be approved by the board.

272
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,799
Don't worry.

273
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,799
I will definitely support you.

274
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,719
It is really nice of you to say that.

275
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,239
I believe that you don't want to see it

276
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,000
being given up.

277
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,919
You're absolutely right.

278
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:42,840
If the Entertainment Center project

279
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,559
can be completed and opened up
during your term of chairman,

280
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,039
to you,

281
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,760
it will be a great achievement, right?

282
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:51,080
Uncle Jiang
will definitely support you.

283
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,559
Uncle Jiang, I'm here today

284
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,200
for one more thing.

285
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,039
I hope you can help
convince Lin Xiangyuan.

286
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,359
Don't worry about that.
Though Xiangyuan is my son-in-law,

287
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,359
if it benefits the company,

288
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,840
he will not object.

289
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,679
He does not have shares.

290
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,159
So, for significant decisions,
he has to listen to the board.

291
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:14,880
Thank you. With your support,

292
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,640
it is already half done.

293
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,919
You're right.

294
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,239
And for the
Entertainment Center project,

295
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,520
Xiangyuan may have his own opinions.

296
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:24,599
For the future of Yutian,

297
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,039
he may also have his own vision.

298
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,039
But his purpose is to
let Yutian become better.

299
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,799
As a CEO,

300
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:34,479
he is very good.

301
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,039
He was promoted by me.

302
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,159
If he does a good job,
I will be proud of him as well.

303
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,119
Don't worry.

304
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,760
For restarting
the Entertainment Center project,

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,000
if I agree,

306
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,440
he will support me.

307
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,199
Mr. Lei, are you here now?

308
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,680
I just arrived. Where are you?

309
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,640
Mr. Lei, go straight,

310
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,359
and pass the washroom.
There is a back door.

311
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,640
I will wait for you there.

312
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,880
Excuse me.

313
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,520
Where is the washroom, please?

314
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,520
Go straight to the end.

315
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,760
Thank you.

316
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:30,719
Welcome.

317
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Mr. Lei, I'm so sorry

318
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,079
to ask you to meet here.

319
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,079
Safety is the most important now.

320
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
What you asked us to investigate
is not a trivial matter.

321
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,599
If it alerts the opponent,

322
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:46,119
we cannot find anything anymore.

323
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
Besides,

324
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,880
it involves tens of millions of yuan.

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,760
If it's for money, your opponent

326
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,400
will probably do anything.

327
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,359
Good. I think I got a right person.

328
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,199
You're so professional.

329
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:01,280
OK. Then wait for my call.

330
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,319
Sir, this is your coffee.

331
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,520
I didn't order coffee.

332
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,640
The gentleman who just left
bought it for you.

333
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,760
Since Zhenrong passed away,

334
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,319
you seldom came here.

335
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,199
You're afraid of seeing these things,

336
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,479
and feeling sad, right?

337
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,839
I know.

338
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,439
You want to conserve

339
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,839
the memories of you and Zhenrong.

340
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,520
Shangguan, since when

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
did you talk like a poet?

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,479
Conserve...

343
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,640
Don't laugh at me.

344
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I want to ask you.

345
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,479
Do you want a "killing spree"?

346
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
Don't play too many games.

347
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,119
It is not easy to be back to Yutian.

348
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,880
Don't you want to do something?

349
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:36,880
Fine.

350
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,239
If you don't want to talk about it,
just let it be.

351
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,359
But I came all the way here,

352
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,839
just to see a sword?

353
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,880
What are you doing?

354
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:49,520
You asked me

355
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
whether I want a "killing spree".

356
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,520
But I don't want to
be the person you kill.

357
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,959
You are the one to "kill".

358
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,079
Change.

359
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,079
I said I cannot do fencing.

360
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,040
I don't want to be a target.

361
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,040
Enough.

362
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,040
Done.

363
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,760
I cannot play

364
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,119
such kind of noble sports with you.

365
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,280
It's too plain.

366
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,160
Too plain?

367
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

368
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,160
Shut up.

369
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,199
Don't...

370
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,560
I have heart disease.

371
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Believe or not, if you keep
doing that, I will just lie down here.

372
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,880
OK, lie down.

373
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,400
Shangguan,

374
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,520
you're really

375
00:20:50,199 --> 00:20:51,400
so afraid of death.

376
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,439
Feeling hurt?

377
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,239
Hurt?

378
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,119
It's fine.

379
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,239
Not hurt? Then, stand up.

380
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,640
Keep practicing.

381
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,560
Are you serious?

382
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,000
Be gentle.

383
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,680
I think I have talent.

384
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,400
Come.

385
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,000
Fanlv,

386
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,359
you become thinner.

387
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
Isn't it good to be thin?

388
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,839
Many people want to lose weight,

389
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,800
and they may not succeed.

390
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,199
This is not what I expect.

391
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,560
In my whole life,

392
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,880
I have no other expectation.

393
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,640
I only hope you
can be happy and healthy.

394
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,319
Dad, don't talk about this.

395
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,119
Yuzheng is back.

396
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,520
Maybe it's a good thing.

397
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,040
In a way,

398
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:17,239
it will bring
Lin Xiangyuan some restraint.

399
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,479
You want Yuzheng

400
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,239
to drive Lin Xiangyuan away.

401
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:26,800
After all, Lin Xiangyuan
is my son-in-law.

402
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,760
Today, Lei Yuzheng had a talk with me.

403
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,040
I have relieved.

404
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:36,839
I hope they can
forgive and forget the pass,

405
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:39,520
and manage Yutian well together.

406
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,800
So, dad wants to tell you.

407
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,199
Yuzheng is back now.

408
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:48,040
Between him and Lin Xiangyuan,

409
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:50,599
you should not do anything.

410
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:55,119
Dad is protecting you. Understand?

411
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,160
I know.

412
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,719
Your marriage with Lin Xiangyuan
is in trouble.

413
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,160
This is not a key problem.

414
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,599
Yuzheng is back.

415
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,040
Xiangyuan should be very clear that

416
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,239
his position is not stable now.

417
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
At this moment,

418
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,160
don't put him in any trouble.

419
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,959
Everyone has his own fate.

420
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm not persuading you
to believe in destiny.

421
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,920
I just want to tell you that

422
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,719
everything has both good side

423
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,760
and bad side.

424
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,560
Even if you marry Lei Yuzheng,

425
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:44,079
will you be happy?

426
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,680
Sometimes, for something,

427
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:51,400
you have to learn to take them easy,

428
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,719
and don't be too serious.

429
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,800
Understand?

430
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,520
Keep your elbow in.

431
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,319
Elbow.

432
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,359
Buddy, say it.

433
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,040
What do you want?

434
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,319
Not just ask me to play this with you?

435
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,439
I wasn't planning to talk about it.

436
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,319
But now that you mentioned it,

437
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,359
I will just tell you.

438
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
I want to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

439
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Just...

440
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,040
Jiang Jin and Lin Xiangyuan
do not agree?

441
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:42,959
No, it's not.

442
00:24:43,479 --> 00:24:44,359
Then what?

443
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,079
You know that

444
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:48,479
to restart this project,
money is the priority.

445
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,040
Such a large amount of money,

446
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,000
even if they do not disagree,

447
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,000
other directors will probably disagree.

448
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,959
So...

449
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:01,520
You want to put a "killing spree" on me?

450
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
Right?

451
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:05,000
I've never said that.

452
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,760
You, yourself said that.

453
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,479
Think about it.

454
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,560
To get the approval of the board,

455
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,959
I must have some external funding.

456
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,319
If outsiders want to
take a slice as well,

457
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,839
it means
this project is doable.

458
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,439
Just put up the appearance
to give them some faith.

459
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,160
Let me speak frankly.

460
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:27,040
You should help me.

461
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,680
Of course, buddy.

462
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:31,400
For all things of yours,

463
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,319
I have never flinched.

464
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,560
As soon as I get to my office tomorrow,

465
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,280
I'll ask them to prepare the money.

466
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Get ready for you.

467
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,000
As long as you tell me to go,

468
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,719
I'll take the money

469
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
directly to Yutian.

470
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,719
Thanks, my buddy.

471
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,599
According to the financial statement
of the past months,

472
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:52,959
the profits from traditional businesses

473
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,319
are increasing,

474
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,239
but the growth rate is getting smaller.

475
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,359
Now, every industry

476
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,239
conducts restructuring.

477
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,719
I think Yutian

478
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,000
should have a new breakthrough.

479
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,800
What is your opinion?

480
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:13,439
New Energy Automobile.
(New Energy Automobile Report)

481
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,599
According to our research,

482
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,119
many big cities

483
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:20,400
are trying to promote
new energy automobile.

484
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,239
More importantly,

485
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,439
among our consumers

486
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,359
in our researches,

487
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,920
since this year,

488
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,599
our consumers' interests in
new energy automobile

489
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,959
are increasing.

490
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,839
That means, the market

491
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,319
is slowly forming.

492
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,640
If we join in the market at this time,

493
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,439
we can grab the original stock.

494
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,719
But we don't have the technicians,

495
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,239
or research and development
institutions for this.

496
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,280
Cooperation.

497
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:50,680
Nowadays,

498
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:51,520
it is impossible

499
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,439
to create an industrial chain
all by ourselves.

500
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,280
We have to seek for cooperation.

501
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,680
That is to say, we put in the money

502
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,479
and the institutions
go for the technology.

503
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,319
Every decision

504
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:08,520
should be approved by the board.

505
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,880
In my opinion,

506
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,800
it can be discussed
at the board meeting first.

507
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:14,800
So,

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,760
we need your support.

509
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,599
Dad,

510
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,119
I have promised
both you and Lei Yuzheng,

511
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,239
I will take Yutian to a new stage.

512
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,920
You have to support me this time.

513
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:38,359
Shareholders need to see a profit,

514
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,359
and you need to
show that to shareholders.

515
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,359
We must make sure that
nothing goes wrong in this matter.

516
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Don't worry. They are all buddies.

517
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,359
Yutian is planning for something big.

518
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,199
What's going on?

519
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,239
Lin Xiangyuan decided
to hold a board meeting.

520
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,880
He wants to initiate cooperation
with Green Investment,

521
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,000
an emerging company.

522
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,400
Green Investment?

523
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,079
Right.

524
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,239
I read about it
on Economics the other day.

525
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,880
This is an emerging company.

526
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,880
Last week, it invested
a large amount of money

527
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,119
to buy the most famous
new energy research institute in China,

528
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,119
Green Energy.

529
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,079
Yes.

530
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,239
It should be this dubious company.

531
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:33,599
This dubious company

532
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,839
bought this institute,

533
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,680
and then

534
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,239
Lin Xiangyuan proposed
to cooperate with this company.

535
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,359
What they're asking for is

536
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,640
Yutian should be
the majority shareholder.

537
00:28:43,719 --> 00:28:45,160
This is unbelievable.

538
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:48,719
Green Investment cannot
afford to lose out in this investment.

539
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,640
It is willing to act as
a "money transfer station" for Yutian?

540
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,040
I heard that

541
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,680
the boss of Green Investment
made a bad decision.

542
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,760
After buying this institute,

543
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,239
they found that investing in new energy
industry needs huge amount of money.

544
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,719
That's why they are
looking for help from Yutian.

545
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,199
Our Yutian's shareholders

546
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,959
definitely want to take this advantage.

547
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,800
It sounds

548
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,719
like pennies from the heaven?

549
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,119
Let's make an assumption.

550
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,760
Of course, that would be
the worst situation.

551
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,599
We assume that the investment company

552
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,160
is to help Lin Xiangyuan.

553
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,239
They took the risk

554
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,119
and bought a research institute
that cost large amount of money.

555
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:24,280
Then they want to
take advantage of the market's

556
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,319
attention to new energy automobile

557
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,680
to whet the appetite of shareholders,

558
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,119
so as to make the shareholders
eager to make this investment.

559
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,599
That means,

560
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:33,719
Yutian's money

561
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,319
will be transferred to Green Investment.

562
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,680
Though it is Yutian's
property nominally,

563
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,599
it's actually helping Green Investment
to make money.

564
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:43,920
If...

565
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,479
If there are
some illegal practices involved,

566
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,959
Green Investment

567
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,199
can be in the name of
new energy research to

568
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,920
perform money laundering.

569
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,359
The money of Yutian!

570
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,839
You're right.

571
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
This kind of irrational investment

572
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,640
will feed Green Investment full
in a short time.

573
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,959
That is to say,

574
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,920
Green Investment actually

575
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,760
holds a huge amount of money of Yutian.

576
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
If it were me,

577
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,199
when Yutian runs out of money,
I would definitely

578
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,119
invest money back to Yutian

579
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,719
to exchange for shares.

580
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,800
In this way, Green Investment

581
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:17,479
will naturally become
a shareholder of Yutian.

582
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,079
Even a majority shareholder.

583
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,760
At that time, the legal representative

584
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:23,920
will be changed

585
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,719
to Lin Xiangyuan.

586
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,000
Hs is so smart!

587
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,760
I said just now that

588
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,079
this is only an assumption.

589
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,959
Yuzheng,

590
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,079
now that we anticipate the risks,

591
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,760
I suggest you exercise a veto.

592
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,920
After all, you are
the majority shareholder.

593
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,119
No.

594
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,719
Before the bad guys come out,

595
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
how can we pull the "net"?

596
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,079
I'm going to set the "big fish" free.

597
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,079
Is that what you're waiting for?

598
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,079
Stay close.

599
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:29,760
OK.

600
00:32:13,504 --> 00:32:14,592
(Securities Law)

601
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:22,760
Come in.

602
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:27,920
Mr. Lei,

603
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
long time no see.

604
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,800
Reading a book?

605
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Just take a look.

606
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,280
I don't know who
put these two books here.

607
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:39,280
Maybe

608
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,599
someone is trying to remind me

609
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,680
of something I cannot do.

610
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,640
If I don't read it,

611
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,319
I may let down his "kindness".

612
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,160
I had my staff

613
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:49,560
to send you the briefing.

614
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,479
I didn't expect

615
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,439
to send you these two books.

616
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,199
You come to me not for these two books?

617
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:56,680
Of course not.

618
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,040
I'm here to discuss with you

619
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,439
on the Entertainment Center project.

620
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:02,280
I just want to know

621
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,040
if this project is to be restarted,

622
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,000
what is Mr. Lin's opinion?

623
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,839
Mr. Jiang has talked to me,

624
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,880
and let me fully cooperate with you
to restart the project.

625
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,719
But

626
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,079
some time ago,

627
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,680
our company is going to
invest in a new energy project

628
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,400
which requires
a large amount of capital.

629
00:33:20,239 --> 00:33:22,359
If you want to restart
the Entertainment Center project,

630
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,719
for the company's cash flow,

631
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,199
it's a little difficult.

632
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:29,079
It is a pity that
I can do nothing about it.

633
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,680
So I'm here to explain to you.

634
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,760
I can understand.

635
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,479
But as you know,

636
00:33:36,199 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm a person

637
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
who is not easy to give up.

638
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,640
Don't worry.

639
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,560
About money, it is not a problem.

640
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,199
Anything else?

641
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,199
Forgot to tell you.

642
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,520
According to
the proposal of the chairman,

643
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,400
the board has approved

644
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,160
your position as
the special assistant to the chairman.

645
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,680
Restarting
the Entertainment Center project

646
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,000
is in your charge now.

647
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,839
Mr. Lin, if you have nothing else,

648
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,320
please help yourself.

649
00:34:09,959 --> 00:34:10,760
As a special assistant,

650
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,000
I have a lot of work to do.

651
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,280
Mr. Lin,

652
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,639
the books.

653
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,600
This Lei Yuzheng.

654
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,280
He came back to Yutian
in such a high profile.

655
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,239
He also proposed to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

656
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,840
What on earth is he up to?

657
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,479
What are you worried about?

658
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,760
At least within a few years,

659
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,239
Lei Yuzheng is not able to be in
the top management of Yutian.

660
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
The ball is in our court,

661
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,439
and all he can do

662
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,320
is to find the money.

663
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,560
Would anyone help him?

664
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,840
With Lei Yuzheng's strength,

665
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,120
he can just go out there for money,

666
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,239
and it is not a problem for him
to get it.

667
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
You are followed?

668
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,120
Is it a mistake?

669
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,360
I took a detour today,

670
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,879
and I found that
someone was following me.

671
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,000
There should be more than one.

672
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,439
Did they find out
you are investigating them?

673
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,040
Should be.

674
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,639
So,

675
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,239
we must now find another way

676
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,800
to cover our tracks.

677
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
What do you want to do?

678
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,080
Shangguan always wants to hold

679
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,360
a party for me, for my return to Yutian.

680
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,280
I thought it was too high profile.

681
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,080
Now, I think

682
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,959
the party comes at a good time.

683
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:52,040
Just let the opponent think that

684
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,840
I have no will to fight now.

685
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,120
On the Entertainment Center project,

686
00:35:56,439 --> 00:35:57,800
after two setbacks,

687
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,719
I have given up completely.

688
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,520
So I need to have fun and relax.

689
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,080
What I'm most worried about now

690
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
is my father-in-law.

691
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,679
You mean Mr. Jiang?

692
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,719
In case Mr. Jiang is bamboozled
by Lei Yuzheng,

693
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,159
in a moment of aberration,

694
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:16,800
he may support his proposal

695
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:17,919
and become his supporter.

696
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,840
He may divert our project funds to his.

697
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:21,399
Then we'll be in trouble.

698
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,520
After all, Mr. Jiang,
is a member of the board,

699
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,719
and he can join the decision-making.

700
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,239
So what do we do?

701
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,679
Oh,

702
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,040
there's an antique
appreciation tomorrow.

703
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,320
But I have to go to a party,

704
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:36,560
and I have no time to go with him.

705
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,760
Make an arrangement for that.

706
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,639
OK, got it.

707
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,199
Do what he wants to please Mr. Jiang.

708
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,399
It can distract his attention.

709
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,679
So he will not always focus on
the Entertainment Center project.

710
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:01,639
Dad.

711
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,679
Sit.

712
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,919
Dad.

713
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm being stupid again.

714
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,919
Please forgive me
for making Fanlv so angry.

715
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,679
What did you do to Fanlv?

716
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:17,280
Dad.

717
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:18,439
Don't ask him.

718
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:22,679
He worries about me and cares about me.

719
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,879
He doesn't want me to go out
for drinking tonight.

720
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,040
We had a fight.

721
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,159
Fanlv,

722
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,239
I'm so sorry.

723
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,159
I know what you mean.

724
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,040
Shangguan will hold a party
for Lei Yuzheng,

725
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,679
and you don't want me to go.

726
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
You're afraid that my friends

727
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,679
bad-mouthed you in front of me, right?

728
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,719
That's a good thing.

729
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,159
For this party,

730
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,120
I think that you should both go.

731
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:50,159
Dad, only I am invited.

732
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,919
There is no "you" or "I".

733
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,040
In my opinion, this is also
a good chance for you and Xiangyuan

734
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,719
to have better communication
with your friends.

735
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:00,399
Take Xiangyuan to meet them.

736
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:01,760
In the future,

737
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,320
there may be cooperation opportunities.

738
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
Forget it, dad.

739
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:09,840
I'd rather not go.

740
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:11,520
You must go.

741
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,679
You help me take care of Fanlv.

742
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,360
Don't let her drink too much.

743
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,439
Welcome, Miss.

744
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,600
What can I do for you?

745
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,280
I'm good, thanks.

746
00:38:46,479 --> 00:38:47,479
Excuse me, are you...

747
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,560
I am invited by Shangguan.

748
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,600
What should I call you?

749
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,560
Du Xiaosu.

750
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,679
Miss Du, this way please.

751
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,479
Excuse me.

752
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,719
Designer Du.

753
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,520
Come.

754
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,679
Welcome.

755
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,280
I get it.

756
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,320
It must be for my buddy, right?

757
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,639
I really envy him.

758
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,679
Can I open it?

759
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,000
Of course.

760
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,360
Wow,

761
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,800
it means to tie up my buddy.

762
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:26,840
I wouldn't dare to accept it.

763
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,080
Shall I give you some space?

764
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,320
I'll just leave.

765
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,040
I like the gift very much.

766
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,760
Thank you.

767
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:53,239
Good.

768
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,320
How are you?

769
00:39:58,919 --> 00:39:59,760
I'm good.

770
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,639
How about you?

771
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,800
I'm good, too.

772
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,479
The gift is delivered.

773
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,439
I gotta go.
