=Episode 31=

16
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,199
Is this the construction site
of the Entertainment Center?

17
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,080
This is it.

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,399
Too bad.

19
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:41,399
Such a nice piece of land! The project
has been put on hold for over one year.

20
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:42,960
If your dad were here,

21
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,320
he'd be heartbroken.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,279
To be honest, Yuzheng,

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,839
I really admire your father.

24
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,639
He had so much courage
to take this project.

25
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,360
I can see Mr. Lei's ambition
at that time.

26
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,679
This project

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,839
was so sensational at that time.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,639
I've seen the design of the
Entertainment Center.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,399
Now I've seen
the construction site as well.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,759
Although time passed
and everything changed,

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
you can still see
(Foundation, February 2016)

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,320
how vigorous Mr. Lei
was to this project.

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,520
He was trying to
leave something great to Yutian.

34
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,039
Yutian was founded by my father.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,320
In other word, it was his life.

36
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,440
What he did for
the Entertainment Center project,

37
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,160
is much more than what I did,
as his son.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,320
I think

39
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,240
the Entertainment Center project

40
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,639
was envisioned in his mind
a million times.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Unfortunately, he cannot
see this anymore.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,199
Siyang, how about

43
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,720
I restart this project?

44
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,440
Pretty hard.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
I called it "hard"

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,479
not only because of the financial issue,

47
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:46,720
but also people.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,199
Firstly, you have to convince the board

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,839
to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,399
Even the board agrees

51
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,520
to restart
the Entertainment Center project,

52
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,119
Lin Xiangyuan probably

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,759
will set obstacles in your way,

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
and put you in a dilemma.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,800
I am well prepared.

56
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,600
I remember last time Jiang Jin
and Lin Xiangyuan

57
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
met you,

58
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,600
they promised you at the table that

59
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,199
they would operate this project well.

60
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,160
But with what we can see today,

61
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,759
I think, you already have the answer.

62
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,720
Besides, don't forget.

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,919
Though you are
the majority shareholder of Yutian,

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,839
you actually

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,759
cannot join the decision-making.

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
The first thing we have to do...

67
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,240
To prove that I was innocent?

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
Isn't it?

69
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,520
Siyang, I can understand
what you are talking about.

70
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,320
So it is better than
not to act and fail.

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,360
I need to go back to Yutian.

72
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,039
Are you sure?

73
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,679
Yes.

74
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,119
I will not only go back to Yutian,

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,119
but also let everyone know that

76
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,040
I, Lei Yuzheng,
will fulfill my dad's last wish.

77
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,359
I will build up a great monument

78
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,040
from this project.

79
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,200
Let's move on to the last item.

80
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,359
Regarding Lei Yuzheng's

81
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,279
apportionment as the assistant of
the chairman of board,

82
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,799
please vote.

83
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,720
Lei Yuzheng was arrested
for internal information leakage.

84
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,079
According to the law,

85
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,320
he must not be in the top management
within five years.

86
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,119
Everyone,

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,440
please allow me to speak a few words.

88
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,239
According to the law,

89
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
Lei Yuzheng

90
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,480
should not be in the top management
of a listed company.

91
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,040
But

92
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
it never says
he cannot work for the company.

93
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,320
So,

94
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,600
for the appointment of Lei Yuzheng
as the assistant of the chairman,

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,600
I agree.

96
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,279
OK, approved.

97
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,799
They didn't do the cleaning.

98
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,679
I remember that Mr. Lei

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,679
hated having a dirty table.

100
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,200
I will clean it up.

101
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't bother.

102
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,399
Mr. Lei,

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,200
I just heard that you are back.

104
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,760
Weicheng, long time no see.

105
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,359
You're just the same.

106
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,399
Mr. Lei,

107
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,040
you still look great.

108
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,040
It's really nice to see you again.

109
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,000
You are back now, which is great.

110
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,079
The Entertainment Center project
can go ahead.

111
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,839
Seeing that project be held,

112
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,399
I was so sad.

113
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,959
Now, it is so terrible.

114
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
We really feel sorry

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,399
to your dad, Mr. Lei.

116
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,079
But we cannot find out any solution.

117
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,640
There is nothing we can do but worry.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,799
You are all senior staff.

119
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,679
For the previous period,

120
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,119
I really appreciate your hard work.

121
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,000
If you can wait,

122
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,040
I believe,

123
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,000
as long as you keep working for Yutian,

124
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,480
it will become better and better.

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,440
Mr. Lei, what you just said

126
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,279
makes us feel secure and comfortable.

127
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,880
We look forward to the day when
the project is successfully completed.

128
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,119
Mr. Lei,

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,799
what do you think

130
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:06,080
Lin Xiangyuan was
thinking about just now?

131
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,039
Your opinion?

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,679
I think he was thinking about

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,119
why you are back so soon.

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
He invited me back to Yutian
a few days ago.

135
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,000
So having me back,

136
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,559
he should not feel surprised.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,080
For what happened in the past,

138
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,119
I am terrible sorry.

139
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:31,159
I know, in my life,

140
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,479
no matter what I do,

141
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,080
I cannot pay it off.

142
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,479
Let the past pass.

143
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,559
But I have to tell you.

144
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,400
Before doing anything,

145
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,799
you should think well.

146
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,039
Please don't worry.

147
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:47,280
In the future, even if I get killed,

148
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,400
I will never make this kind of mistake.

149
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,679
Don't exaggerate your words.

150
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
I don't want to get you killed.

151
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,599
Hello, Mr. Lin.

152
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,919
One is the former CEO,
and the other is the current CEO.

153
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:14,679
It's going to be a tough competition.
One of them is going to lose.

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,479
You're right.

155
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,440
After all, Mr. Lei is from Lei's family.

156
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,679
Hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

157
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,159
Hard to tell who the "lion" is,
and who the "hare" is?

158
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,280
Lin Xiangyuan,

159
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,479
how can you fight with me?!

160
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,960
Mr. Lin,

161
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,000
Lei Yuzheng is back.

162
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,400
You look so worried.

163
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,799
Lei Ting passed away.

164
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,359
Lei Yuzheng is
the most majority shareholder of Yutian.

165
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,400
He is just back to his own company.

166
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,400
Don't be surprised.

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,599
Mr. Lin, you're really
holding your nerve.

168
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:14,679
Didn't you say that
he didn't want to come back?

169
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,919
To tell you the truth,

170
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,159
I invited Lei Yuzheng back.

171
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,039
So, Mr. Lin,

172
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
what are you thinking?

173
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,520
You just wait and see.

174
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,599
Don't you think that

175
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,960
Lei Yuzheng is back at this moment

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,200
with some purpose?

177
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:33,400
What purpose?

178
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,479
You're not afraid of him
to prove his innocence?

179
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,799
We have to pay more attention.

180
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:44,479
Xie, can you please use your brain?

181
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,119
At this moment, if Lei Yuzheng
were not in the building of Yutian,

182
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,679
will you know
what he is planning out here?

183
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,440
Right.

184
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,039
Mr. Lin, you are so thoughtful.

185
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,960
Why didn't I think of that?

186
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,280
That's why

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,119
I am the CEO,

188
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,080
and you are my assistant.

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,239
Of course.

190
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,280
You're the CEO. Definitely,
I'm not comparable to you.

191
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,760
Mr. Lin,

192
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,239
where are you going?

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,960
Lei Yuzheng is back.
I am going to meet him.

194
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
Qunfei,

195
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,440
doing cleaning?

196
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,320
Mr. Lin.

197
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,719
You're here to see Mr. Lei?

198
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:42,640
I brought two cleaners

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,559
to clean the office for Mr. Lei.

200
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,039
It's fine. No more cleaning.

201
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,280
I have cleaned it well.

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Oh, Qunfei.

203
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,599
Have you gone through
the job on-board process?

204
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,799
I am not in a hurry.

205
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,000
After Mr. Lei
appointing me the position,

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,919
I will go through the process.

207
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,119
OK.

208
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,559
Don't wait until your
job position is determined.

209
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I will require someone
to give you an access card.

210
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,960
So you can go in and out freely.

211
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,880
Do you think, for Mr. Lei,

212
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,719
he also needs one?

213
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,320
Qunfei,

214
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,080
you're really funnier than before.

215
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,520
No need to worry about Mr. Lei.

216
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,640
He can go in and out
without any access card.

217
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,080
You're right. I forgot.

218
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,200
I just thought

219
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,400
if Mr. Lei wants to get in Yutian

220
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,960
but someone stops him,

221
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,799
that would be so embarrassed.

222
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,400
Please tell Mr. Lei I was here.

223
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,719
Sure.

224
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,320
Such a big deal,

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,320
I will not forget.

226
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:12,559
Yuzheng,

227
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,280
you're back now.

228
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
What's your plan?

229
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,000
My plan?

230
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:17,359
To be honest,

231
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,760
this time,

232
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,200
I'm going to do only one thing.

233
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,520
Yuzheng,

234
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,359
no matter what you are going to do,

235
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,960
Uncle Jiang
will always stand on your side.

236
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,559
Thank you.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,280
Then, Uncle Jiang,
I will come straight to the point.

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
I want to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

239
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,080
The Entertainment Center project

240
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:35,880
is not on the progress?

241
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,919
What do you mean to restart?

242
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,760
The Entertainment Center project
has been on hold for more than one year.

243
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,280
I was at the
construction site yesterday.

244
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,320
This is what it looks like now.

245
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,520
On hold? When was that?

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,440
Why didn't I know that?

247
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,280
Yuzheng,

248
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,320
this is my fault.

249
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,000
I was worried about you,

250
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,239
so a lot of things were not followed.

251
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,719
Uncle Jiang's negligence.

252
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,799
Uncle Jiang,

253
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,359
I know you are now the chairman.

254
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,880
You should be very busy.

255
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,960
You cannot focus on every detail.

256
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,159
So, today, I come here.

257
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,440
I don't blame you.

258
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,599
But for the
Entertainment Center project,

259
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,280
Mr. Lin and other directors

260
00:14:29,479 --> 00:14:30,840
have different opinions.

261
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,119
My dad passed away.

262
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:33,799
I was not here.

263
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,239
So, such a big project being on hold

264
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
is inevitable.

265
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,880
I can understand.

266
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,640
Yuzheng, you can think like that.

267
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,479
I'm glad and relieved.

268
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,440
I

269
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,239
feel involuntary sometimes.

270
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,320
Restarting the project

271
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,760
must be approved by the board.

272
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,799
Don't worry.

273
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,799
I will definitely support you.

274
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,719
It is really nice of you to say that.

275
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,239
I believe that you don't want to see it

276
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,000
being given up.

277
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,919
You're absolutely right.

278
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:07,840
If the Entertainment Center project

279
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,559
can be completed and opened up
during your term of chairman,

280
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,039
to you,

281
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,760
it will be a great achievement, right?

282
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,080
Uncle Jiang
will definitely support you.

283
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,559
Uncle Jiang, I'm here today

284
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,200
for one more thing.

285
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,039
I hope you can help
convince Lin Xiangyuan.

286
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,359
Don't worry about that.
Though Xiangyuan is my son-in-law,

287
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,359
if it benefits the company,

288
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
he will not object.

289
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,679
He does not have shares.

290
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,159
So, for significant decisions,
he has to listen to the board.

291
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,880
Thank you. With your support,

292
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,640
it is already half done.

293
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,919
You're right.

294
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,239
And for the
Entertainment Center project,

295
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,520
Xiangyuan may have his own opinions.

296
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:49,599
For the future of Yutian,

297
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,039
he may also have his own vision.

298
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,039
But his purpose is to
let Yutian become better.

299
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,799
As a CEO,

300
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,479
he is very good.

301
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:02,039
He was promoted by me.

302
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,159
If he does a good job,
I will be proud of him as well.

303
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,119
Don't worry.

304
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,760
For restarting
the Entertainment Center project,

305
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,000
if I agree,

306
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,440
he will support me.

307
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,199
Mr. Lei, are you here now?

308
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,680
I just arrived. Where are you?

309
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,640
Mr. Lei, go straight,

310
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,359
and pass the washroom.
There is a back door.

311
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,640
I will wait for you there.

312
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,880
Excuse me.

313
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,520
Where is the washroom, please?

314
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,520
Go straight to the end.

315
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,760
Thank you.

316
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,719
Welcome.

317
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Mr. Lei, I'm so sorry

318
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,079
to ask you to meet here.

319
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,079
Safety is the most important now.

320
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
What you asked us to investigate
is not a trivial matter.

321
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,599
If it alerts the opponent,

322
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,119
we cannot find anything anymore.

323
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,760
Besides,

324
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,880
it involves tens of millions of yuan.

325
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,760
If it's for money, your opponent

326
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,400
will probably do anything.

327
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,359
Good. I think I got a right person.

328
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,199
You're so professional.

329
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:26,280
OK. Then wait for my call.

330
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,319
Sir, this is your coffee.

331
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,520
I didn't order coffee.

332
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:56,640
The gentleman who just left
bought it for you.

333
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,760
Since Zhenrong passed away,

334
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,319
you seldom came here.

335
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,199
You're afraid of seeing these things,

336
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,479
and feeling sad, right?

337
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,839
I know.

338
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,439
You want to conserve

339
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,839
the memories of you and Zhenrong.

340
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,520
Shangguan, since when

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
did you talk like a poet?

342
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,479
Conserve...

343
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,640
Don't laugh at me.

344
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
I want to ask you.

345
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,479
Do you want a "killing spree"?

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
Don't play too many games.

347
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,119
It is not easy to be back to Yutian.

348
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,880
Don't you want to do something?

349
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:01,880
Fine.

350
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,239
If you don't want to talk about it,
just let it be.

351
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,359
But I came all the way here,

352
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,839
just to see a sword?

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,880
What are you doing?

354
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,520
You asked me

355
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,160
whether I want a "killing spree".

356
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,520
But I don't want to
be the person you kill.

357
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,959
You are the one to "kill".

358
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:24,079
Change.

359
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,079
I said I cannot do fencing.

360
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,040
I don't want to be a target.

361
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,040
Enough.

362
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,040
Done.

363
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,760
I cannot play

364
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:56,119
such kind of noble sports with you.

365
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,280
It's too plain.

366
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,160
Too plain?

367
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes.

368
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,160
Shut up.

369
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,199
Don't...

370
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
I have heart disease.

371
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
Believe or not, if you keep
doing that, I will just lie down here.

372
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,880
OK, lie down.

373
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,400
Shangguan,

374
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,520
you're really

375
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,400
so afraid of death.

376
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,439
Feeling hurt?

377
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,239
Hurt?

378
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,119
It's fine.

379
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,239
Not hurt? Then, stand up.

380
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,640
Keep practicing.

381
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,560
Are you serious?

382
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,000
Be gentle.

383
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:38,680
I think I have talent.

384
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Come.

385
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,000
Fanlv,

386
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,359
you become thinner.

387
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,000
Isn't it good to be thin?

388
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,839
Many people want to lose weight,

389
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,800
and they may not succeed.

390
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,199
This is not what I expect.

391
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,560
In my whole life,

392
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:24,880
I have no other expectation.

393
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,640
I only hope you
can be happy and healthy.

394
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,319
Dad, don't talk about this.

395
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,119
Yuzheng is back.

396
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,520
Maybe it's a good thing.

397
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,040
In a way,

398
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:42,239
it will bring
Lin Xiangyuan some restraint.

399
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,479
You want Yuzheng

400
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,239
to drive Lin Xiangyuan away.

401
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:51,800
After all, Lin Xiangyuan
is my son-in-law.

402
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,760
Today, Lei Yuzheng had a talk with me.

403
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,040
I have relieved.

404
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:01,839
I hope they can
forgive and forget the pass,

405
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,520
and manage Yutian well together.

406
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,800
So, dad wants to tell you.

407
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,199
Yuzheng is back now.

408
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:13,040
Between him and Lin Xiangyuan,

409
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:15,599
you should not do anything.

410
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:20,119
Dad is protecting you. Understand?

411
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,160
I know.

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,719
Your marriage with Lin Xiangyuan
is in trouble.

413
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,160
This is not a key problem.

414
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,599
Yuzheng is back.

415
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,040
Xiangyuan should be very clear that

416
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,239
his position is not stable now.

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,760
At this moment,

418
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,160
don't put him in any trouble.

419
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,959
Everyone has his own fate.

420
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
I'm not persuading you
to believe in destiny.

421
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,920
I just want to tell you that

422
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,719
everything has both good side

423
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,760
and bad side.

424
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,560
Even if you marry Lei Yuzheng,

425
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:09,079
will you be happy?

426
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,680
Sometimes, for something,

427
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,400
you have to learn to take them easy,

428
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,719
and don't be too serious.

429
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
Understand?

430
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,520
Keep your elbow in.

431
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,319
Elbow.

432
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,359
Buddy, say it.

433
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,040
What do you want?

434
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:54,319
Not just ask me to play this with you?

435
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,439
I wasn't planning to talk about it.

436
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,319
But now that you mentioned it,

437
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,359
I will just tell you.

438
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,400
I want to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

439
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,000
Just...

440
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,040
Jiang Jin and Lin Xiangyuan
do not agree?

441
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:07,959
No, it's not.

442
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,359
Then what?

443
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,079
You know that

444
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,479
to restart this project,
money is the priority.

445
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,040
Such a large amount of money,

446
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
even if they do not disagree,

447
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:20,000
other directors will probably disagree.

448
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,959
So...

449
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:26,520
You want to put a "killing spree" on me?

450
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Right?

451
00:24:28,239 --> 00:24:30,000
I've never said that.

452
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,760
You, yourself said that.

453
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,479
Think about it.

454
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,560
To get the approval of the board,

455
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,959
I must have some external funding.

456
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,319
If outsiders want to
take a slice as well,

457
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,839
it means
this project is doable.

458
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,439
Just put up the appearance
to give them some faith.

459
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,160
Let me speak frankly.

460
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:52,040
You should help me.

461
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,680
Of course, buddy.

462
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,400
For all things of yours,

463
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,319
I have never flinched.

464
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:00,560
As soon as I get to my office tomorrow,

465
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,280
I'll ask them to prepare the money.

466
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Get ready for you.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
As long as you tell me to go,

468
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,719
I'll take the money

469
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
directly to Yutian.

470
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,719
Thanks, my buddy.

471
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,599
According to the financial statement
of the past months,

472
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,959
the profits from traditional businesses

473
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,319
are increasing,

474
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,239
but the growth rate is getting smaller.

475
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,359
Now, every industry

476
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,239
conducts restructuring.

477
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,719
I think Yutian

478
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,000
should have a new breakthrough.

479
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,800
What is your opinion?

480
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,439
New Energy Automobile.
(New Energy Automobile Report)

481
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,599
According to our research,

482
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,119
many big cities

483
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,400
are trying to promote
new energy automobile.

484
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,239
More importantly,

485
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,439
among our consumers

486
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,359
in our researches,

487
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,920
since this year,

488
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,599
our consumers' interests in
new energy automobile

489
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,959
are increasing.

490
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:57,839
That means, the market

491
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,319
is slowly forming.

492
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,640
If we join in the market at this time,

493
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,439
we can grab the original stock.

494
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,719
But we don't have the technicians,

495
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,239
or research and development
institutions for this.

496
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,280
Cooperation.

497
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,680
Nowadays,

498
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,520
it is impossible

499
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,439
to create an industrial chain
all by ourselves.

500
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
We have to seek for cooperation.

501
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,680
That is to say, we put in the money

502
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,479
and the institutions
go for the technology.

503
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,319
Every decision

504
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:33,520
should be approved by the board.

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,880
In my opinion,

506
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,800
it can be discussed
at the board meeting first.

507
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,800
So,

508
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
we need your support.

509
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,599
Dad,

510
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,119
I have promised
both you and Lei Yuzheng,

511
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,239
I will take Yutian to a new stage.

512
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:59,920
You have to support me this time.

513
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:03,359
Shareholders need to see a profit,

514
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,359
and you need to
show that to shareholders.

515
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:14,359
We must make sure that
nothing goes wrong in this matter.

516
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
Don't worry. They are all buddies.

517
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,359
Yutian is planning for something big.

518
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,199
What's going on?

519
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,239
Lin Xiangyuan decided
to hold a board meeting.

520
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,880
He wants to initiate cooperation
with Green Investment,

521
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,000
an emerging company.

522
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,400
Green Investment?

523
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,079
Right.

524
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,239
I read about it
on Economics the other day.

525
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,880
This is an emerging company.

526
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Last week, it invested
a large amount of money

527
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,119
to buy the most famous
new energy research institute in China,

528
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,119
Green Energy.

529
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:55,079
Yes.

530
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,239
It should be this dubious company.

531
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,599
This dubious company

532
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,839
bought this institute,

533
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,680
and then

534
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:03,239
Lin Xiangyuan proposed
to cooperate with this company.

535
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,359
What they're asking for is

536
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,640
Yutian should be
the majority shareholder.

537
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,160
This is unbelievable.

538
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,719
Green Investment cannot
afford to lose out in this investment.

539
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,640
It is willing to act as
a "money transfer station" for Yutian?

540
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,040
I heard that

541
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:20,680
the boss of Green Investment
made a bad decision.

542
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,760
After buying this institute,

543
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,239
they found that investing in new energy
industry needs huge amount of money.

544
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,719
That's why they are
looking for help from Yutian.

545
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,199
Our Yutian's shareholders

546
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,959
definitely want to take this advantage.

547
00:28:33,719 --> 00:28:34,800
It sounds

548
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,719
like pennies from the heaven?

549
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,119
Let's make an assumption.

550
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:41,760
Of course, that would be
the worst situation.

551
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,599
We assume that the investment company

552
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
is to help Lin Xiangyuan.

553
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,239
They took the risk

554
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,119
and bought a research institute
that cost large amount of money.

555
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:49,280
Then they want to
take advantage of the market's

556
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,319
attention to new energy automobile

557
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,680
to whet the appetite of shareholders,

558
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,119
so as to make the shareholders
eager to make this investment.

559
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,599
That means,

560
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,719
Yutian's money

561
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:01,319
will be transferred to Green Investment.

562
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,680
Though it is Yutian's
property nominally,

563
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:07,599
it's actually helping Green Investment
to make money.

564
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,920
If...

565
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,479
If there are
some illegal practices involved,

566
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,959
Green Investment

567
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,199
can be in the name of
new energy research to

568
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,920
perform money laundering.

569
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,359
The money of Yutian!

570
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,839
You're right.

571
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
This kind of irrational investment

572
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,640
will feed Green Investment full
in a short time.

573
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,959
That is to say,

574
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Green Investment actually

575
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,760
holds a huge amount of money of Yutian.

576
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
If it were me,

577
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,199
when Yutian runs out of money,
I would definitely

578
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,119
invest money back to Yutian

579
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,719
to exchange for shares.

580
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,800
In this way, Green Investment

581
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,479
will naturally become
a shareholder of Yutian.

582
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,079
Even a majority shareholder.

583
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,760
At that time, the legal representative

584
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:48,920
will be changed

585
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,719
to Lin Xiangyuan.

586
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,000
Hs is so smart!

587
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,760
I said just now that

588
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,079
this is only an assumption.

589
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,959
Yuzheng,

590
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,079
now that we anticipate the risks,

591
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,760
I suggest you exercise a veto.

592
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,920
After all, you are
the majority shareholder.

593
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,119
No.

594
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,719
Before the bad guys come out,

595
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,400
how can we pull the "net"?

596
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,079
I'm going to set the "big fish" free.

597
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,079
Is that what you're waiting for?

598
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,079
Stay close.

599
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:54,760
OK.

600
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:39,592
(Securities Law)

601
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,760
Come in.

602
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:52,920
Mr. Lei,

603
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
long time no see.

604
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,800
Reading a book?

605
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Just take a look.

606
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,280
I don't know who
put these two books here.

607
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,280
Maybe

608
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,599
someone is trying to remind me

609
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,680
of something I cannot do.

610
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,640
If I don't read it,

611
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,319
I may let down his "kindness".

612
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,160
I had my staff

613
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,560
to send you the briefing.

614
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,479
I didn't expect

615
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,439
to send you these two books.

616
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,199
You come to me not for these two books?

617
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:21,680
Of course not.

618
00:32:21,959 --> 00:32:24,040
I'm here to discuss with you

619
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,439
on the Entertainment Center project.

620
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:27,280
I just want to know

621
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,040
if this project is to be restarted,

622
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,000
what is Mr. Lin's opinion?

623
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,839
Mr. Jiang has talked to me,

624
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,880
and let me fully cooperate with you
to restart the project.

625
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,719
But

626
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,079
some time ago,

627
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,680
our company is going to
invest in a new energy project

628
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:44,400
which requires
a large amount of capital.

629
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:47,359
If you want to restart
the Entertainment Center project,

630
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,719
for the company's cash flow,

631
00:32:50,959 --> 00:32:52,199
it's a little difficult.

632
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,079
It is a pity that
I can do nothing about it.

633
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,680
So I'm here to explain to you.

634
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,760
I can understand.

635
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,479
But as you know,

636
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,880
I'm a person

637
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,400
who is not easy to give up.

638
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,640
Don't worry.

639
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:08,560
About money, it is not a problem.

640
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,199
Anything else?

641
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,199
Forgot to tell you.

642
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,520
According to
the proposal of the chairman,

643
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,400
the board has approved

644
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,160
your position as
the special assistant to the chairman.

645
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,680
Restarting
the Entertainment Center project

646
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,000
is in your charge now.

647
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,839
Mr. Lin, if you have nothing else,

648
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:34,320
please help yourself.

649
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,760
As a special assistant,

650
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
I have a lot of work to do.

651
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,280
Mr. Lin,

652
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,639
the books.

653
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,600
This Lei Yuzheng.

654
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,280
He came back to Yutian
in such a high profile.

655
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,239
He also proposed to restart
the Entertainment Center project.

656
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,840
What on earth is he up to?

657
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,479
What are you worried about?

658
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
At least within a few years,

659
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,239
Lei Yuzheng is not able to be in
the top management of Yutian.

660
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
The ball is in our court,

661
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,439
and all he can do

662
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,320
is to find the money.

663
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,560
Would anyone help him?

664
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,840
With Lei Yuzheng's strength,

665
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,120
he can just go out there for money,

666
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,239
and it is not a problem for him
to get it.

667
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,840
You are followed?

668
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,120
Is it a mistake?

669
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,360
I took a detour today,

670
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,879
and I found that
someone was following me.

671
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,000
There should be more than one.

672
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,439
Did they find out
you are investigating them?

673
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,040
Should be.

674
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,639
So,

675
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,239
we must now find another way

676
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,800
to cover our tracks.

677
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
What do you want to do?

678
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,080
Shangguan always wants to hold

679
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,360
a party for me, for my return to Yutian.

680
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
I thought it was too high profile.

681
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,080
Now, I think

682
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:14,959
the party comes at a good time.

683
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,040
Just let the opponent think that

684
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,840
I have no will to fight now.

685
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,120
On the Entertainment Center project,

686
00:35:21,439 --> 00:35:22,800
after two setbacks,

687
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:24,719
I have given up completely.

688
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,520
So I need to have fun and relax.

689
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,080
What I'm most worried about now

690
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,560
is my father-in-law.

691
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,679
You mean Mr. Jiang?

692
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,719
In case Mr. Jiang is bamboozled
by Lei Yuzheng,

693
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,159
in a moment of aberration,

694
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,800
he may support his proposal

695
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:42,919
and become his supporter.

696
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,840
He may divert our project funds to his.

697
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,399
Then we'll be in trouble.

698
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,520
After all, Mr. Jiang,
is a member of the board,

699
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:51,719
and he can join the decision-making.

700
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,239
So what do we do?

701
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,679
Oh,

702
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,040
there's an antique
appreciation tomorrow.

703
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:00,320
But I have to go to a party,

704
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,560
and I have no time to go with him.

705
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,760
Make an arrangement for that.

706
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,639
OK, got it.

707
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,199
Do what he wants to please Mr. Jiang.

708
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,399
It can distract his attention.

709
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,679
So he will not always focus on
the Entertainment Center project.

710
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:26,639
Dad.

711
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,679
Sit.

712
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,919
Dad.

713
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,000
I'm being stupid again.

714
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,919
Please forgive me
for making Fanlv so angry.

715
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:40,679
What did you do to Fanlv?

716
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:42,280
Dad.

717
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:43,439
Don't ask him.

718
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:47,679
He worries about me and cares about me.

719
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:49,879
He doesn't want me to go out
for drinking tonight.

720
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,040
We had a fight.

721
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,159
Fanlv,

722
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,239
I'm so sorry.

723
00:36:56,879 --> 00:36:58,159
I know what you mean.

724
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,040
Shangguan will hold a party
for Lei Yuzheng,

725
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,679
and you don't want me to go.

726
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,000
You're afraid that my friends

727
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,679
bad-mouthed you in front of me, right?

728
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,719
That's a good thing.

729
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,159
For this party,

730
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,120
I think that you should both go.

731
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:15,159
Dad, only I am invited.

732
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,919
There is no "you" or "I".

733
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,040
In my opinion, this is also
a good chance for you and Xiangyuan

734
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,719
to have better communication
with your friends.

735
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:25,399
Take Xiangyuan to meet them.

736
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,760
In the future,

737
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,320
there may be cooperation opportunities.

738
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
Forget it, dad.

739
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:34,840
I'd rather not go.

740
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,520
You must go.

741
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,679
You help me take care of Fanlv.

742
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,360
Don't let her drink too much.

743
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:00,439
Welcome, Miss.

744
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,600
What can I do for you?

745
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
I'm good, thanks.

746
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,479
Excuse me, are you...

747
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,560
I am invited by Shangguan.

748
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,600
What should I call you?

749
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,560
Du Xiaosu.

750
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,679
Miss Du, this way please.

751
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,479
Excuse me.

752
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,719
Designer Du.

753
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,520
Come.

754
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,679
Welcome.

755
00:38:33,439 --> 00:38:34,280
I get it.

756
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,320
It must be for my buddy, right?

757
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,639
I really envy him.

758
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,679
Can I open it?

759
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,000
Of course.

760
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,360
Wow,

761
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,800
it means to tie up my buddy.

762
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:51,840
I wouldn't dare to accept it.

763
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,080
Shall I give you some space?

764
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
I'll just leave.

765
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,040
I like the gift very much.

766
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,760
Thank you.

767
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:18,239
Good.

768
00:39:22,399 --> 00:39:23,320
How are you?

769
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:24,760
I'm good.

770
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,639
How about you?

771
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm good, too.

772
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,479
The gift is delivered.

773
00:39:36,399 --> 00:39:37,439
I gotta go.
