1
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:06,055
(This drama is set in an imaginary dystopian Korea,)

2
00:01:06,056 --> 00:01:08,390
(and all people, organizations, and incidents are fictitious.)

3
00:01:11,095 --> 00:01:12,135
(A new leap for the people,)

4
00:01:12,135 --> 00:01:13,830
(The hopeful Dream Home Village becomes a reality.)

5
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:17,265
The Social Responsibility Foundation is accepting donations...

6
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,631
for their Dream Home Village project.

7
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:25,971
But I received a tip that the money is being used elsewhere.

8
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:28,810
These are the people running the project.

9
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:33,281
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

10
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,491
Where the donations are being used,

11
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:47,436
and what the real purpose of this project is.

12
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:48,961
To anyone who gives us a tip,

13
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:51,870
I will compensate you with my own money.

14
00:01:52,105 --> 00:01:53,630
That's my promise to you.

15
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:54,840
Thank you.

16
00:02:04,486 --> 00:02:06,211
Kang Yo Han, that punk.

17
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:10,220
Did he just put a bounty on the head of state?

18
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,151
My own TV station broadcasted my face...

19
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:14,321
because of something like this?

20
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:16,395
Chairman Park, that's not the issue here.

21
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,195
He just declared war against his country.

22
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:21,835
This is a rebellion. It's civil war!

23
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,434
He slandered his head of state?

24
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:26,005
Did we take the working class' hard-earned money?

25
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,744
That doesn't make sense.

26
00:02:27,745 --> 00:02:29,905
In order to save the poor,

27
00:02:29,905 --> 00:02:32,346
I donated my precious money.

28
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:34,946
And this is what I get for being nice?

29
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,181
What's with Kang Yo Han? Is he a communist?

30
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:39,116
What's Mr. Seo doing?

31
00:02:39,116 --> 00:02:40,786
He just sent his secretary here.

32
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:43,651
What is he going to do about this?

33
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:46,491
With all due respect,

34
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:49,360
I think you're too infuriated.

35
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,560
It's a groundless accusation, right?

36
00:02:53,236 --> 00:02:54,431
Am I wrong?

37
00:02:57,536 --> 00:03:00,100
Of course, it's groundless.

38
00:03:00,106 --> 00:03:01,970
There's a bite in your words.

39
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:03,340
Watch it.

40
00:03:04,646 --> 00:03:06,744
How could he think we would do that?

41
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,681
Right. We wouldn't dare to touch that money.

42
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,491
You kidnapped Jang Ki Young, didn't you?

43
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:26,530
I had to talk to him.

44
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:29,064
"We should put up a show in front of the whole nation."

45
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:32,030
"Or you'll be in trouble, too." Is this what you told him?

46
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:33,901
You should talk nicely.

47
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:36,641
I explained it differently but it was the gist.

48
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,141
Differently?

49
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:44,111
Did you really help him because you felt so sorry for him?

50
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:46,116
You told him you'd pay him afterward...

51
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:48,120
if he testifies as you wanted, didn't you?

52
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:52,090
It's possible I felt bad for him from the beginning.

53
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,021
So don't jump to a quick conclusion.

54
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:59,491
Then you weren't the one who attacked Soo Hyun.

55
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:01,761
Can you believe it now...

56
00:04:02,005 --> 00:04:03,660
that I'm not that kind of person.

57
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,801
I think you are that kind of person.

58
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:11,244
- But I guess you didn't have to. - I didn't have to?

59
00:04:11,245 --> 00:04:13,515
You figured out Cha Kyung Hee got the account details.

60
00:04:13,516 --> 00:04:15,511
So you kidnapped Jang Ki Young in a hurry.

61
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:19,410
And it didn't matter if Soo Hyun takes the bankbook or not.

62
00:04:19,655 --> 00:04:21,551
That's why you didn't touch her.

63
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,551
You're such a smart guy...

64
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,261
so why were you so furious that day?

65
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:31,535
I only took Elijah out for a moment.

66
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:33,195
And you went furious too.

67
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:35,231
So I don't think it's your place to judge me.

68
00:04:40,535 --> 00:04:42,570
Then who attacked Soo Hyun?

69
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:47,570
At the least, it wouldn't be someone who favors me.

70
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:59,951
What do you think Chief Kang is up to?

71
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:05,765
Isn't the foundation one of the good guys?

72
00:05:05,766 --> 00:05:07,761
They help the poor and do volunteer work.

73
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:14,800
Judge Oh, there's something I forgot to tell you.

74
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:16,600
What?

75
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,871
How could you not take me with you?

76
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:23,211
A secret party with the key members of the foundation?

77
00:05:23,216 --> 00:05:26,410
You two went to a party like that without me?

78
00:05:26,486 --> 00:05:29,980
Chief Kang even got me a nice dress for that charity event.

79
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm really sorry.

80
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,125
Is that the only thing you're mad about among all the other things?

81
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:37,595
Of course, interfering with the trial...

82
00:05:37,596 --> 00:05:38,765
is very inappropriate.

83
00:05:38,765 --> 00:05:40,660
Should we just release it to the press?

84
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,205
There's a reporter I know well.

85
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,205
A reporter?

86
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,901
Yes, she works for a fashion magazine called "Bling Bling".

87
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:50,371
No, never mind.

88
00:05:52,815 --> 00:05:56,040
Okay. Let's calm down and think about this.

89
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:59,716
So you're saying the president and the rich people were there...

90
00:05:59,716 --> 00:06:01,954
trying to interfere with Lee Young Min's trial, right?

91
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,220
And it seemed they were sharing information for profit.

92
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:05,550
Yes.

93
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:10,061
- I'm sorry I didn't tell... - What about Chief Kang?

94
00:06:10,226 --> 00:06:12,790
- What? - What did he say to them?

95
00:06:13,195 --> 00:06:15,561
Do you think he's with them?

96
00:06:16,135 --> 00:06:18,100
Why aren't you saying anything about Chief Kang?

97
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,644
I can't be sure.

98
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,641
He didn't say anything at the party.

99
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:27,571
But considering how he declared war against them...

100
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:29,480
I don't know...

101
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:32,081
if he's really cool or if he's trying to look cool.

102
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:34,415
It's true that he gave money to the witness.

103
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,656
How can a judge do that?

104
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,990
He was just putting on a show in front of the reporters.

105
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:40,151
Then he suddenly asked people to vote on whether they trust him.

106
00:06:41,726 --> 00:06:43,961
It feels like he's deceiving people.

107
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:50,300
I was a really big fan of his.

108
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,771
He was confident and righteous.

109
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,170
And he seemed so shinny to me.

110
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,970
But I'm not sure he still does.

111
00:07:06,486 --> 00:07:07,811
You should be ambitious.

112
00:07:07,986 --> 00:07:10,381
On the live court show that I watched,

113
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:12,856
you were the biggest star.

114
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:15,160
Twinkle, twinkle.

115
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:32,871
If you want a bright star shining in the sky...

116
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,910
If you desperately...

117
00:07:37,986 --> 00:07:39,381
want it,

118
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:45,391
you should change yourself first.

119
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,490
In order to reach the star,

120
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:55,660
become a bigger...

121
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:57,961
person.

122
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:34,271
I'm perfect.

123
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,571
- Sun Ah. - Yes.

124
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:41,240
Your skin is gorgeous today.

125
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,416
A compliment coming from you? What a surprise?

126
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:46,251
Is it because you have a guilty conscience?

127
00:08:47,315 --> 00:08:49,050
It's because I'm jealous.

128
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,350
By the way, what should I do with this?

129
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,490
It's the bankbook I took from Yoon Soo Hyun.

130
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,961
Oh, the bankbook?

131
00:08:57,966 --> 00:08:59,090
Get rid of it.

132
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:02,230
Gosh, you're such a nasty witch.

133
00:09:02,505 --> 00:09:04,366
Why would you make me take it if you don't need it?

134
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:05,901
Who says I don't need it?

135
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,040
I needed it to create a story.

136
00:09:09,276 --> 00:09:10,470
A story?

137
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:13,811
Enough of that.

138
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:17,881
What comes next is more important.

139
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,685
Watch every move of the old guys from the foundation.

140
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,021
Not Kang Yo Han?

141
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:26,496
Unexpectedly, the wolf broke into the ranch...

142
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:29,721
in a very violent way.

143
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:33,631
The sheep will get scared and go violent too.

144
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,001
Okay.

145
00:09:35,266 --> 00:09:36,601
Oh, by the way.

146
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,835
I think you'll be giving the Healing Mentor Lecture...

147
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:40,231
that will be posted on the website.

148
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,141
Me?

149
00:09:43,146 --> 00:09:46,645
Kang Yo Han put Mr. Seo's face on the screen...

150
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:49,841
saying he embezzled the donations for the people.

151
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,511
If he gives the lecture, it'll only draw the reporters' attention.

152
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:58,021
Gosh, I feel awkward to give a cheesy lecture.

153
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:01,721
Jae Hee.

154
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:03,560
Yes?

155
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:09,761
If you were a little faster, we would've taken Jang Ki Young.

156
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,300
Right?

157
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,910
I didn't know the judge was going to take him.

159
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,960
Do it right.

160
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,160
You can, can't you?

161
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:44,560
Yes.

162
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:46,430
I won't make a mistake.

163
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:52,841
We are almost done.

164
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:54,881
You know that, right?

165
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:07,521
If I see you dozing off while Mr. Seo gives the lecture,

166
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:08,991
you'll be in trouble.

167
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,296
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:12,565
Gosh, I'm sick and tired of you girls.

169
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,131
Hello, Director.

170
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,905
Are you from the foundation?

171
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:19,330
Why is Mr. Seo so late?

172
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:23,641
Hello, I came here on behalf of Mr. Seo today.

173
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:25,810
She is Jung Sun Ah, the executive director of the foundation.

174
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:27,910
Oh, she is?

175
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:29,440
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

176
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:34,416
You're so pretty.

177
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:35,651
How old are you?

178
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,690
I'm 18 years old.

179
00:11:40,095 --> 00:11:41,521
She is pretty, isn't she?

180
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,021
Go up now.

181
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:44,665
Come on. Go.

182
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,160
Excuse me, ma'am.

183
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:51,536
They're all orphans or teenage runaways.

184
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,300
So they're troubled kids.

185
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:57,101
Be careful when you get closer. They might steal your valuables.

186
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,511
They're troubled kids?

187
00:12:03,315 --> 00:12:04,440
Excuse me?

188
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:10,780
You must go through a lot.

189
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:14,021
Not really. Shall we go upstairs?

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

191
00:12:18,796 --> 00:12:21,660
(Sun)

192
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,011
Gosh, I have no idea.

193
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:42,080
(Sun Ah)

194
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,055
That's my name.

195
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,221
"Sun" means "good", and "Ah" means a "child".

196
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,361
I'm a grown-up, but I still have to be a good child.

197
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:54,030
My mom must've hoped...

198
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:57,330
that I'd grow up to be an ordinary, good person.

199
00:13:01,006 --> 00:13:02,741
Then why did she do that to me?

200
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:05,641
If that was her wish, why did she beat me up...

201
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:08,481
every time she was drunk?

202
00:13:15,985 --> 00:13:17,080
I'm sorry, guys.

203
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:21,056
Seeing you guys brings back memories.

204
00:13:21,056 --> 00:13:22,320
But I should stop being silly.

205
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,591
My mom did that too.

206
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,030
She did?

207
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,434
Usually, she was nice like an angel.

208
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,930
But she changed completely when she was drunk.

209
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:34,771
She'd start crying and...

210
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,210
It must've been tough for her.

211
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,241
She must've been going through a lot.

212
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:45,710
I didn't understand back then, I do now.

213
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,484
Her husband abandoned his wife and children.

214
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:52,820
She had to work her bottom off to make ends meet.

215
00:13:53,955 --> 00:13:56,621
Still, she shouldn't have done that.

216
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,991
She shouldn't have treated her child that way no matter what.

217
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:04,104
I believed my mom hated me...

218
00:14:04,105 --> 00:14:06,871
because I was a bad kid.

219
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,074
I swore, got in fights,

220
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,074
and got in trouble for stealing.

221
00:14:11,075 --> 00:14:13,641
But I had no choice back then.

222
00:14:13,776 --> 00:14:16,844
Everyone around me insulted,

223
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:19,310
teased, and beat me.

224
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:25,151
And I was always hungry.

225
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,991
But the thing is,

226
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:31,721
when I was 12,

227
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,830
I started working for a wealthy family.

228
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:41,101
The boys in that house were so adorable and nice.

229
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:44,905
They smelled good and never swore.

230
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:46,810
They glowed from head to toe.

231
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:51,080
If I'd been as good as them,

232
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,710
would my mom not have beaten me?

233
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,481
Would she have loved me?

234
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:05,830
Well, anyway,

235
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:12,401
what can you do to be a good child then?

236
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:18,040
You have to become rich.

237
00:15:18,246 --> 00:15:20,814
You can only be nice if you can make ends meet.

238
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,344
The world is a jungle.

239
00:15:22,345 --> 00:15:25,555
When you have to prey on others to survive,

240
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:27,550
how can you possibly be nice?

241
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:32,151
First, survive by all means.

242
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:33,655
If others hit you, bite them.

243
00:15:33,656 --> 00:15:35,391
If you need something, steal it.

244
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:37,820
In addition,

245
00:15:38,095 --> 00:15:41,790
the world is a tougher place for lonely girls like you.

246
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:45,434
Beasts are everywhere.

247
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:47,474
No matter how educated and respected they are,

248
00:15:47,475 --> 00:15:49,771
all men are the same.

249
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,614
When those scumbags come on to you,

250
00:15:56,615 --> 00:15:58,040
what are you supposed to do?

251
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,950
Report to the police.

252
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:04,651
Wrong answer. Take advantage of it.

253
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:11,295
The law is never on our side.

254
00:16:11,296 --> 00:16:12,891
So secure evidence by all means.

255
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:14,761
Record it if you can.

256
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:20,700
And then...

257
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:24,871
torment him until the day he dies.

258
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:28,611
Threaten to destroy everything he has...

259
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:32,310
until he becomes as tame as a dog.

260
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,790
Do you understand?

261
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,121
- Yes. - Yes.

(Social Responsibility Foundation Healing Mentor Lecture)

263
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:47,290
Yes, go ahead.

264
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:51,460
You've become such a great person.

265
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:56,271
Does your mom love you now?

266
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:01,474
She passed away when I was 12.

267
00:17:01,475 --> 00:17:03,145
She got completely drunk...

268
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:05,251
and fell down some stairs in the neighborhood.

269
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,310
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:11,280
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

271
00:17:13,796 --> 00:17:17,521
Your lecture was so refreshing and realistic.

272
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:20,290
It really touched me, Ms. Jung.

273
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:25,131
I haven't given many lectures.

274
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,604
I'm sure it showed.

275
00:17:26,605 --> 00:17:30,405
Not at all. You were amazing.

276
00:17:30,406 --> 00:17:35,341
Speaking of which, please give another touching lecture soon.

277
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,540
Sure.

278
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:41,385
I'd love the opportunity.

279
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:43,180
Of course.

280
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,260
How did you find me?

281
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,591
Did you put a tracker on me or something?

282
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,331
I know you already found it. Why are you even asking?

283
00:18:35,506 --> 00:18:39,275
I get to decide where I go and who I meet.

284
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:41,215
Who gives you the right?

285
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:43,410
I'm your guardian whether you like it or not.

286
00:18:44,246 --> 00:18:46,910
A guardian? You treat me like some animal you keep.

287
00:18:47,286 --> 00:18:49,354
Haven't you learned a lesson yet?

288
00:18:49,355 --> 00:18:52,051
No one approaches a person without a motive.

289
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:54,225
Aren't you tired yet?

290
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:56,064
You always act like you're the smartest one,

291
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,364
but you follow anyone who shows the slightest kindness...

292
00:18:58,365 --> 00:19:00,634
and end up being used and even kidnapped. You're such a fool.

293
00:19:00,635 --> 00:19:01,730
Stop it.

294
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,341
Is it her fault to feel lonely?

295
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,581
You shouldn't talk to her like that.

296
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:20,351
Are you teaching me how to talk?

297
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,124
She's under my protection.

298
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:25,250
Exactly. You're the only one she has.

299
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:31,861
Can you be a little more honest?

300
00:19:38,036 --> 00:19:39,301
This is funny.

301
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,445
How long have you even been here?

302
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:45,710
Stop talking like you know everything.

303
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,381
I apologize if I was out of line.

304
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:55,281
Let's go.

305
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:18,601
Secretary.

306
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,041
Yes, sir.

307
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:31,485
How am I supposed to talk to a teenage girl?

308
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:32,591
Let me see.

309
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:36,624
Experts say you should listen from the other person's perspective.

310
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,864
Also, use positive language to improve the self-esteem of...

311
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:40,960
Forget it.

312
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:47,031
Just order some books on the subject for me.

313
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:48,371
Yes, sir.

314
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:13,435
You asked me why I was a restaurant owner's son for 16 years,

315
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:14,531
remember?

316
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:19,670
That's when my parents...

317
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:21,770
passed away.

318
00:21:22,546 --> 00:21:24,071
When I was 16.

319
00:21:24,645 --> 00:21:27,071
Oh, is that right?

320
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,311
Why? Did they have an accident?

321
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,824
They got conned by a horrible con artist...

322
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,420
and lost everything they had.

323
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,450
My father took his own life.

324
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,720
My mom collapsed from the shock and eventually...

325
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,061
I see.

326
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:51,531
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

327
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:54,531
I don't know what to say in a situation like this.

328
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,371
It's okay. It's been a long time.

329
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:02,311
But it's not something you can forget easily.

330
00:22:03,716 --> 00:22:05,081
You're right.

331
00:22:11,385 --> 00:22:12,591
It was very hard, wasn't it?

332
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:14,051
It was the same for me.

333
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:16,265
I hated being home alone.

334
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:18,720
So I slept anywhere and hung out with anyone.

335
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:20,331
I was lonely.

336
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:21,891
Like some stray dog.

337
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:30,541
You're strong, Elijah.

338
00:22:33,546 --> 00:22:35,440
- I am? - Of course.

339
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:37,910
You endured everything alone in this big house.

340
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:41,950
You're an incredible person.

341
00:22:44,786 --> 00:22:45,855
What are you saying?

342
00:22:45,855 --> 00:22:47,924
It doesn't suit you to say such cringy things.

343
00:22:47,925 --> 00:22:49,861
Aren't you usually cynical?

344
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,490
Was it obvious?

345
00:22:52,595 --> 00:22:55,960
It's not easy to say things I don't mean.

346
00:22:57,905 --> 00:22:59,131
Do you want to die?

347
00:23:01,306 --> 00:23:02,901
You pack a hard punch.

348
00:23:03,046 --> 00:23:04,341
I wonder who you take after.

349
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:05,770
Good night.

352
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,235
I have to smile while I speak.

353
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,006
I'm going to smile while I talk to her.

354
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:53,175
Smile.

355
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,475
What is this? It was you?

356
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,445
What's with that face?

357
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,286

- How was your day? - What?

361
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,806
So did you have a good day?

362
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,705
Or did you have a bad day?

363
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:32,776
Is there anything you want to discuss with me?

364
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,725
Well... So...

365
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,356
What is it?

366
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:49,800
Who is the evil jerk who conned...

367
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,266
Ga On's parents?

368
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,566
You want to talk about Ga On again?

369
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:57,405
Right. I have to smile while I talk.

370
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:02,211
He scammed poor people out...

371
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:04,405
of hundreds of millions of dollars through a pyramid scheme.

372
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,751
There were over ten victims who committed suicide from it.

373
00:25:06,751 --> 00:25:08,675
- Really? - Yes.

374
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,445
I see.

375
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,256
Right, so...

376
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:17,826
My gosh. Secretary!

377
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,955
Secretary. Are you playing with me right now?

378
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:22,501
All I need to do is follow what the book says?

379
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,965
Sir. Stress is bad for your health.

380
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,241
In the kitchen...

381
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:30,735
- What are you talking about? - Make sure you take one pill a day.

382
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:33,576
You must take care of yourself at your age.

383
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,175
Forget it. Get lost.

384
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,485
(Multivitamins)

385
00:25:58,471 --> 00:26:00,300
(Blue House)

386
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,195
I will get started now.

387
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:04,511
Regarding the unexpected remark...

388
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:07,411
that Judge Kang Yo Han made during the last live court show,

389
00:26:07,411 --> 00:26:09,781
we are carefully looking into it from all perspectives...

390
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,506
It's fake news!

391
00:26:15,021 --> 00:26:16,921
Hello. I, Heo Joong Se,

392
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:19,820
overcame all sorts of slanderous tricks to get to this position.

393
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,730
Now, a judge is spreading false rumors about me.

394
00:26:23,731 --> 00:26:25,695
How can our country run like this?

395
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:28,971
Can Kang Yo Han, a man who spreads wild rumors during difficult times,

396
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:33,395
truly call himself a citizen of our great nation, Korea?

397
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,506
To be honest,

398
00:26:36,711 --> 00:26:40,735
I have been receiving a lot of reports about Judge Kang.

399
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:41,810
I was told that Judge Kang...

400
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,309
is conspiring with a foreign nation to put our society in disarray.

401
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,220
That he's not a pure-blooded Korean.

402
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,320
In other words, he's different from us.

403
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,090
On top of that, I received reports...

404
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,816
that Judge Kang has been receiving funds from foreign countries.

405
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:57,530
For the sake of national security, if anyone gives us...

406
00:26:57,531 --> 00:26:59,860
any information about Judge Kang Yo Han,

407
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,261
depending on the quality of the tip,

408
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,296
we will provide you with a significant reward.

409
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:07,665
We'll be sure to reward you heavily.

410
00:27:07,671 --> 00:27:10,070
Will the reward come out of your own pocket?

411
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,866
- That is all. - Please answer our questions.

412
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,036
He's going to go that far to get information on Judge Kang?

413
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,506
We will organize the contents of his speech and announce it later.

414
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:22,715
Are you sure you're not going too far?

415
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,685
It's not like politics is a comedy.

416
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,319
People will have something to say about it.

417
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,415
The more comedic it is, the better.

418
00:27:28,461 --> 00:27:30,830
- What? - If they get used to...

419
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,261
the comedy and competition,

420
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:34,296
they won't see the complicated things in front of them.

421
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:38,495
Remember how I said that I would reward depending on quality?

422
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,635
That's creating competition.

423
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,905
I'm just adding entertainment to it and moving forward.

424
00:27:45,981 --> 00:27:49,145
My gosh. Who can stop you?

425
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,576
I'm going to get them, so they can't come to their senses.

426
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,776
Will it be okay?

427
00:27:55,751 --> 00:27:56,945
What?

428
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:59,960
Ten years ago, he was a famous actor who was known for his blunt remarks,

429
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,191
but now he's the president.

430
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,431
Yes, that's right.

431
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:05,556
Now it's the president, Minister of Justice, media, and conglomerates.

432
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,556
That's pretty much all of Korea.

433
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,995
Right. You just picked a fight with the country.

434
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,326
Are you okay with that?

435
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:15,135
Do you know how they ended up gaining their power?

436
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:18,735
Through hypocrisy.

437
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,981
(Your help will create a happy Korea.)

438
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:24,306
When in trouble, people are moved by the smallest kindness.

439
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,245
After the pandemic, the foundation began expanding its charity.

440
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:33,485
But they didn't spend the most money on disaster relief.

441
00:28:34,261 --> 00:28:35,455
What did they spend it on?

442
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,485
Advertisement.

443
00:28:38,031 --> 00:28:41,526
They used all sorts of media outlets to advertise and exaggerate.

444
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,165
Noblesse oblige.

445
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:47,266
They created an image of the wealthy taking social responsibility.

446
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,511
They used that as a weapon to take over the administration.

447
00:28:49,511 --> 00:28:51,435
What do you think they can do now?

448
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,205
Collect their capital.

449
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,635
No, it goes beyond that.

450
00:28:55,441 --> 00:28:58,506
The Dream Home Village that they've been working extensively on...

451
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,046
is just a means of creating a large asylum using citizens' donations...

452
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:05,050
to put the homeless, the poor, and those with social discontent...

453
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:08,155
all in one place and get them out of sight. After that...

454
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:13,225
they will start a widespread redevelopment of the city.

455
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,366
I bet they purchased the land for it for cheap under a borrowed land.

456
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,165
Did you get your hands on definitive evidence?

457
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,110
You know that isn't easy.

458
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,511
Those people would easily blow up my judge's chambers without hesitation.

459
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:30,380
And yet you blew up the issue in front of the entire nation?

460
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,445
- It's fun. - What?

461
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:35,016
It should at least be fun...

462
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,645
if I'm standing at the edge.

463
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:42,161
Is this fun for you?

464
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,556
(It will be realized now.)

465
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,326
Don't you think it's irresponsible?

466
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,425
What about Elijah?

467
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,395
Did you even think about her?

468
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:57,235
Always.

469
00:29:58,911 --> 00:30:00,235
Constantly.

470
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:09,691
Give me all the information you have on the foundation.

471
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:10,985
Are you going to help me?

472
00:30:12,661 --> 00:30:14,356
Just promise me one thing.

473
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,660
What is it?

474
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:18,526
Subornation of perjury, abduction, blackmail,

475
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:21,296
and making of a fool of good citizens with your lies.

476
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,695
I can't become a shady law-breaker.

477
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,435
Not in front of my parents who died because of a conman,

478
00:30:30,671 --> 00:30:31,905
nor in front of Soo Hyun.

479
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:35,751
A judge...

480
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,106
(It will be realized now. A just Korea.)

481
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,876
has the most power when they do what the law says, sir.

482
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,915
"You can't become a shady law-breaker."

483
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,356
"A judge has the most power when they do..."

484
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,655
"what the law says."

485
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:56,925
Okay then.

486
00:30:57,201 --> 00:30:59,165
(It will be realized now. A just Korea)

487
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,106
You gained the public's interest by raising doubt,

488
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,435
so what's your next plan?

489
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,640
Division.

490
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,376
(Minbo Group)

491
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:19,286
There's nothing we can do if those who have power stick together.

492
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,215
We need to shake them up.

493
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:27,695
Can't we start with something like this?

494
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,639
(Minbo Group)

495
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:45,006
(Lowest income, extra work, Minbo Group is evil)

496
00:31:58,261 --> 00:31:59,955
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

497
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,596
Okay, I understand. Bye.

498
00:32:08,771 --> 00:32:10,205
What floor is the chairman's office?

499
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:12,836
Judge Kang?

500
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:14,975
It's the 20th floor.

501
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,985
(Lowest income, extra work. They kill you.)

502
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:24,385
This is the first floor.

503
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,586
Judge Kang Yo Han suddenly...

504
00:32:32,231 --> 00:32:35,629
Sir. The chairman is in a meeting.

505
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,369
- I'll wait. - Oh, will you?

506
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,336
Then come this way.

507
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,705
- You can return to your work. - Thank you.

508
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,336
Seven minutes and 30 seconds.

509
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,180
You're leaving, sir?

510
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,145
- I got what I needed. - I see.

511
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,856
(Minbo, 297-6 Namsandae-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul)

512
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:46,296
Goodbye.

513
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:01,676
You told me to call if something happened.

514
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:10,926
(Min Yong Shik must resign!)

515
00:34:20,471 --> 00:34:22,836
Five, four,

516
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:26,176
three, two, one.

517
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,106
And a half, and a quarter.

518
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:34,180
(HMBN Chairman Park Du Man)

519
00:34:34,181 --> 00:34:35,615
Hello, sir.

520
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:41,656
Come on, talk to me, Judge Kang.

521
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:46,926
Is there something I don't know?

522
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,325
You know I'm always on your side, right?

523
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,566
That thing about buying witnesses.

524
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,305
It was Cha Kyung Hee's idea.

525
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,415
Can you handle this?

526
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,946
You made an enemy out of the foundation.

527
00:35:14,391 --> 00:35:15,790
Do you have any questions for me?

528
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,886
I can tell you everything I know.

529
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:27,736
You're sucking your fingers.

530
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:32,435
You're hungry, aren't you?

531
00:35:32,641 --> 00:35:35,376
I was inconsiderate. Get something nice to eat.

532
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,205
Get out!

533
00:35:37,581 --> 00:35:38,876
Eat something expensive!

534
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,046
We all work for a living, don't we?

535
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:45,886
You can go ahead.

536
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,185
It's me.

537
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,926
My chairman is with someone.

538
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,395
So,

539
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,740
everything you talked about with Park Du Man.

540
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:03,240
Everything he said is best to assume is a lie.

541
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:06,140
Whatever he gave you, it's fake.

542
00:36:06,141 --> 00:36:08,006
He opens his mouth to lie.

543
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:09,850
Anything he says is a lie.

544
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:11,180
Since he was a kid...

545
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:14,519
All day long, he'd think of ways to beat me.

546
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,249
This happened in middle school.

547
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,620
When he was in middle school, he told people he was in college.

548
00:36:19,621 --> 00:36:21,216
Think about it.

549
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,185
Why would I have to spend the foundation's money?

550
00:36:25,291 --> 00:36:29,126
If anyone in the world did that, it would be Min Yong Shik.

551
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:31,799
Do you know how he nabbed his wife?

552
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,439
Ms. Pi.

553
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,939
He took her to a club, got her drunk, and then...

554
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,506
Minbo Group right now...

555
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,106
has a huge financial problem.

556
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,160
I'll get you the foundation's financial documents.

557
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,689
I have it prepared already.

558
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,390
You don't have to worry. Everything is ready.

559
00:36:58,391 --> 00:37:00,430
I'll give it all to you.

560
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:04,365
Whatever Min Yong Shik gave you, you need to know they're fake.

561
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,026
Don't fall for it.

562
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:10,935
- Should I not? - No.

563
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:16,010
Eat up. Let's talk as we eat.

564
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:17,906
Try this. The food here's good.

568
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,580
Judge Kang, can you come with us?

569
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,475
The VIP wishes to see you.

570
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,185
I'm surprised, Mr. President.

571
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:09,216
About what?

572
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,986
I didn't think you'd invite me in that manner.

573
00:39:13,161 --> 00:39:14,495
It was scary.

574
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,830
They acted like they could've buried me.

575
00:39:16,831 --> 00:39:18,700
Why would you say that?

576
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:22,399
You put my photo up for the world to see...

577
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,169
and ruined my reputation.

578
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,906
It would be too hard to do something to you.

579
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,805
But the thing is,

580
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,245
that is why...

581
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:37,749
people would think there's no way I'd touch you.

582
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,319
Would the head of state...

583
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,760
take action during an uproar?

584
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,359
Wouldn't that be fun?

585
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,495
While people wonder, time will pass.

586
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,129
If I were to release a few celebrity scandals,

587
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,640
people will forget about it in no time.

588
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,196
Like goldfish.

589
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,106
It's a reasonable scenario.

590
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,319
You're nervous.

591
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,915
The great Judge Kang Yo Han.

592
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,356
You look good in a suit.

593
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,220
You seem to be busy these days,

594
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,530
meeting this fool and that.

595
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,656
I am. Just like right now.

596
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:27,236
This fool and that fool.

597
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:30,765
What on earth did they give you?

598
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,406
The scenario I just mentioned.

599
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:37,950
Doesn't it sound fun?

600
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:42,245
I could make that scenario happen right this moment.

601
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:47,156
If that's the case...

602
00:40:51,291 --> 00:40:52,586

603
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,395
Oh? What...

604
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,395
Greetings, subscribers of Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing.

605
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,470
It's a pleasure to meet you. Today, Mr. President invited me.

606
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:04,836
- Thank you, Mr. President. - Is this live?

607
00:41:05,141 --> 00:41:08,339
Wow, so many people joined and we just got started.

608
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,805
We're getting lots of comments too.

609
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,645
Yes, I am Kang Yo Han the judge.

610
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:16,890
Thank you, Mr. President, for changing your mind.

611
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,086
You promise to take a close look into the foundation's corruption?

612
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:23,160
He invited me to the Blue House...

613
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:25,955
and suggested we give a joint statement.

614
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,196
- I appreciate it, Mr. President. - Well, Judge Kang...

615
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:32,900
Mr. President and I will find out...

616
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,895
how every dollar of your donations is being used.

617
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:37,810
That's it for today.

Wave at the camera.

624
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,915
Put on a smile.

625
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,415

Wow, is your analysis already over?

628
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:14,535
- Impressive. - It looked complicated at first,

629
00:42:14,581 --> 00:42:16,845
- but I've found a weak spot. - A weak spot?

630
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,250
PR. They've been doing too much PR.

631
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,581
They've been pouring out articles saying the foundation has donated...

632
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:25,015
10, 20 million dollars to the Dream Home project,

633
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:26,685
but the amount is just too big.

634
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,190
The project should be able to be covered...

635
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,086
solely by the donations from the public so far.

636
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,931
They've been advertising about their donations...

637
00:42:33,931 --> 00:42:36,225
while the project is covered by donations from the public?

638
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,696
It's just my suspicion.

639
00:42:38,701 --> 00:42:41,296
We'll need the foundation's financial data to be sure.

640
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,636
The data from Park Du Man and Min Yong Shik...

641
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,365
are fake, aren't they?

642
00:42:45,971 --> 00:42:47,340
Yes, they both fabricated the data...

643
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,075
so it'd look like the other embezzled money.

644
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,546
I didn't expect those sly dogs to give up data easily anyway.

645
00:42:52,911 --> 00:42:54,245
Did we get any tip-offs?

646
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,851
Nothing useful.

647
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:58,915
They were all pranks or lies from people who are after the reward.

648
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,356
We should still pay them.

649
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:03,015
- Pardon? - I mean the reward.

650
00:43:03,161 --> 00:43:05,285
Why should we?

651
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,595
What's important is the number, not the content.

652
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:11,196
Put up the number of tip-offs all over the Internet.

653
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,495

654

657
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,216
You sound like an experienced con artist.

658
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,515
It slipped my mind.

659
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,555
You've been personally affected by a con artist.

660
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,696
But isn't this a little different?

661
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:50,935

He's here!

Don't do it.

688
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,316
Don't ruin your life over a crook like him.

689
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,955
He's not worth it, Ga On.

690
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,406
- Thank you. - Thank you.

691
00:48:21,741 --> 00:48:24,710
I'm being discharged soon. You don't have to come every day.

692
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:26,345
It's a hassle.

693
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:30,586
Weren't you complaining all morning that he wasn't here?

694
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,790
Shouldn't you protect a patient's privacy?

695
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,185
Maybe it was someone else.

696
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,785
You did that?

697
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:45,895
Anyway, what on earth is Kang Yo Han up to?

698
00:48:46,371 --> 00:48:48,296
This looks like a total fraud to me.

699
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,606
What?

700
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,035
You should rest up.

701
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,081
Your recovery is more important.

702
00:48:55,081 --> 00:48:57,776
How can I rest up? I've got so much digging to do.

703
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,180
The false testimony,

704
00:48:59,181 --> 00:49:00,915
the church fire,

705
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:03,575
and Elijah. Is she doing okay?

706
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:08,216
It must've been too much to deal with...

707
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,256
at such a young age.

708
00:49:12,561 --> 00:49:14,756
Did she remind you of me when I was little?

709
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:18,426
You're shameless.

710
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,371
How could you compare yourself to that adorable girl?

711
00:49:20,371 --> 00:49:22,900
Can't you look at yourself more objectively?

712
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,006
Yes, ma'am.

713
00:49:24,241 --> 00:49:26,035
You're obviously fine. I'll get going.

714
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,136
I can't stand you, but you're still my guest.

715
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:31,506
Do you want some apples?

716
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,475
I can't believe you, Soo Hyun.

717
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,115
Show me how well you can peel an apple.

718
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,185
All right. Let's see here.

719
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,696
What's wrong?

720
00:50:15,161 --> 00:50:17,386
- Soo Hyun. - Yes?

721
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:21,796
I'll do it.

722
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:24,066
If you peel it, there won't be anything left to eat.

723
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,836
Gosh, you're one cold punk.

724
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:47,684
Judge Kang Yo Han has received...

725
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:50,013
over 20 tips regarding the corruption...

726
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,553
of Social Responsibility Foundation.

727
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:55,724
Other than stating that they are all false,

728
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:58,693
the foundation has not released any other official statements.

729
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:01,463
Over 100,000 petitions to reveal the truth have been submitted...

730
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:03,120
to the Blue House National Petition.

731
00:51:04,134 --> 00:51:05,959
Don't get distracted and get back to work.

732
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,769
I heard you can say anything, and they'll give you money.

733
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:18,544
I heard it's a lot of money too.

734
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:19,669
It's true.

735
00:51:20,484 --> 00:51:22,740
I have a lot of expenses next month, should I try it too?

736
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:25,180
No way. What if you get caught?

737
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,320
They actively support Kang Yo Han? Those jerks in the opposition party.

738
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:34,763
"The live court show was a means to distract the citizens."

739
00:51:34,764 --> 00:51:36,823
"It could violate human rights."

740
00:51:36,824 --> 00:51:39,763
That's what they said as they tried to act so high and mighty.

741
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,859
That's what politics is like.

742
00:51:42,034 --> 00:51:43,700
The enemy of your enemies is an ally.

743
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:44,899
More importantly,

744
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:49,939
what did you two give Kang Yo Han?

745
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:54,084
It's nothing. It really isn't.

746
00:51:54,085 --> 00:51:56,439
I gave him something to mess with him and confuse him.

747
00:51:56,585 --> 00:51:58,084
While you're at it, were you hoping it messed with me too?

748
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:00,350
Gosh, what do you take me for?

749
00:52:00,654 --> 00:52:02,185
In any case, Kang Yo Han...

750
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,820
will just dig himself into a deeper hole by looking into it.

751
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:06,294
What about you, Chairman Min? What did you give him?

752
00:52:06,295 --> 00:52:08,224
Are you planning on getting into the broadcasting business with me gone?

753
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,559
That's a good idea.

754
00:52:10,264 --> 00:52:12,863
- You punk. What are you saying? - Let go.

755
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:14,300
Who do you think...

756
00:52:15,634 --> 00:52:17,970
would like what's going on here?

757
00:52:20,844 --> 00:52:23,573
The walls of a castle are broken from the inside out.

758
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:25,673
Fix it before it gets too late.

759
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:29,079
Kang Yo Han will keep going without giving you a chance to breathe.

760

(Sir, Judge Kang is holding a press conference and airing it live.)

761
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,390

We keep getting tips.

765
00:52:53,174 --> 00:52:55,340
Many people are being courageous and stepping up...

766
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:57,244
to help reveal the truth.

767
00:52:57,245 --> 00:52:59,244
Thanks to the courageous informants,

768
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:01,180
the behavior of the foundation is changing too.

769
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,684
Did you all watch the president's YouTube video?

770
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:05,354
Korea's Total Change.

771
00:53:05,355 --> 00:53:08,320
- Heo Joong Sae's How Refreshing. - How refreshing!

772
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:13,689
There's something that's even more surprising.

773
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,903
Two executive directors of the foundation gave me something...

774
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:22,329
and said it was their financial records.

775
00:53:24,475 --> 00:53:26,374
- What is that? - What did he give him?

776
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,100
- What's in the envelopes? - What could it be?

777
00:53:50,324 --> 00:53:52,959
- What is that? - He gave him something too?

778
00:54:02,645 --> 00:54:03,870
It's very interesting.

779
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,769
They gave a subcontract to a company run by a family member,

780
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,309
and they bought a site for a future business venture in advance.

781
00:54:10,214 --> 00:54:13,950
As it happens, the documents they gave me had opposing information,

782
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,019
so I need to look into it further.

783
00:54:16,355 --> 00:54:19,254
However, this isn't the only problem. Let's have a look.

785
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:23,664

(Status of Donations)

787
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:32,570
Where is all of the money that the directors have donated...

788
00:54:32,804 --> 00:54:34,200

(Status of Donations)

790
00:54:40,014 --> 00:54:42,184
According to Judge Kim Ga On,

791
00:54:42,185 --> 00:54:45,649
who has gone through all of the foundation's financial records,

792
00:54:46,185 --> 00:54:47,625
the amount that they claimed to have donated,

793
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,579
and the amount that was received by the foundation...

794
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,990
don't add up.

795
00:54:57,335 --> 00:55:00,359
Did you really get your hands on the foundation's financial records?

796
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:03,129
Yes.

797
00:55:03,665 --> 00:55:06,169
A courageous person on the inside sent it to us.

798
00:55:07,134 --> 00:55:08,744
If the amounts don't add up,

799
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:10,439
does that mean someone embezzled that money?

800
00:55:10,614 --> 00:55:11,814
If they didn't embezzle it,

801
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,609
then they never donated anything from the beginning.

803
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:23,419
Did Judge Kim Ga On participate in revealing this as well?

804
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:28,789
Yes, that's right.

805

(I am against it.)

807
00:55:34,935 --> 00:55:38,899
Judge Kim Ga On is known as an uptight man of principle.

808
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:42,570
But I'm sure you were unaware of this.

809
00:55:43,344 --> 00:55:44,570
Oh, my.

814
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:19,439
Judge Kim overcame such hardship.

00:56:19,714 --> 00:56:22,443
That's why he couldn't stand by and watch...

After we take all measures to protect the people who sent us tips,

818
00:56:35,165 --> 00:56:38,390
we will reveal all of the contents of the reports we received.

819
00:56:38,665 --> 00:56:41,363
It'll take place in one week right here.

820
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:42,459
Thank you,

821
00:56:52,775 --> 00:56:54,343
Do you have an informant from the foundation?

822
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,783
Do you know the informant?

823
00:56:55,784 --> 00:56:57,954
Judge Kim. Is that article really about your parents?

824
00:56:57,955 --> 00:56:59,814
- Could you tell us more? - Is it true?

825
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:01,883
- Would you like to add anything? - Please give us a statement.

826
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:02,979

827
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:07,363

- Judge Kim. - Excuse me.

830
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:15,334

Was this your plan all along?

834
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:30,140
Was I just a tool for your scheme?

835
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,213
How are you any different from them?

836
00:57:32,214 --> 00:57:34,919
Is it okay to use whatever you want to achieve your goal?

Don't you think you're being a bit naive?

00:57:45,734 --> 00:57:47,459
This is a war.

841
00:57:48,734 --> 00:57:50,729
What are you going to reveal next week?

842
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:53,669
The financial records you perjured? The tips that don't exist?

843
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,039
Even if it takes time and is hard,

844
00:57:56,375 --> 00:57:59,240
we should punish them properly according to the law.

845
00:57:59,674 --> 00:58:02,280
Really? I guess you were satisfied.

846
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:06,283
I guess you were really moved by the strict punishment...

847
00:58:06,284 --> 00:58:08,450
the fraud who killed your parents received.

848
00:58:09,255 --> 00:58:10,724

00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:13,224
they followed all the principles and processes...

850
00:58:13,225 --> 00:58:16,024
and endured the tricks laid out by the expensive lawyers.

851
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:18,064
They endured the trial as it got drawn out,

852
00:58:18,065 --> 00:58:20,193
and the sentence he received was 17 years in prison.

853
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:23,463
Is that it? Is that what justice is to you?

854
00:58:23,464 --> 00:58:25,300
Don't talk like that!

855
00:58:29,674 --> 00:58:32,340
Ordinary citizens like my parents...

856
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:35,939
were a part of the jury and they contemplated it for a long time.

857
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:38,713
Despite all the tricks,

858
00:58:38,714 --> 00:58:41,419
they came to a conclusion in accordance with the law.

859
00:58:42,054 --> 00:58:43,419
That's the system.

860
00:58:44,295 --> 00:58:46,820
Even if we hate it, that's the system.

861
00:58:49,295 --> 00:58:52,090
Is that what you had to believe in order to live?

862
00:58:54,534 --> 00:58:56,204
Is that what Yoon Soo Hyun and Min Jung Ho...

863
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:59,700
the two people you have left in your life told you?

864
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:04,004
Did you suppress your desire to stab and kill him and end your life...

865
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:06,309
by holding onto that belief?

866
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:10,979
Is that it? Is it?

867
00:59:13,614 --> 00:59:15,019
Don't come to your own conclusions.

868
00:59:17,185 --> 00:59:18,289
Who do you think you are?

869
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:23,820
Who do you think you are?

870
00:59:37,915 --> 00:59:39,870
There's something I want to show you.

871
00:59:46,384 --> 00:59:50,280
What... What happened? What is going on?

872
00:59:50,685 --> 00:59:51,990
That's impossible.

873
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:54,320
It's impossible to take out the financial records.

874
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,559
Chairman Min. Can you take responsibility for this?

875
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:00,289
What if all of this is true?

876
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:02,834
He said he'd reveal it in a week.

877
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:05,870
The entire nation will be watching. What are you going to do?

878
01:00:06,105 --> 01:00:08,600
The viewership ratings will be off the charts.

879
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:11,939
That's enough!

01:00:11,944 --> 01:00:13,510
My gosh, you punk!

881
01:00:15,214 --> 01:00:17,140
I'm pretty good at playing cards,

882
01:00:17,245 --> 01:00:19,213
and I can tell Kang Yo Han is bluffing.

883
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:21,320
He doesn't have anything, so he's coming out stronger.

884
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:25,749
Excuse me.

01:00:27,295 --> 01:00:28,795
(Social Responsibility Foundation)

886
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:32,930
Kang Yo Han is capable of making cards if he doesn't have any.

887
01:00:32,935 --> 01:00:35,100
Without batting an eyelid.

888
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:36,864
Then we must cut off his hands!

889
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:39,403
It's a huge game and the whole nation's watching.

890
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:42,070
You three voluntarily upped the stakes.

891
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:45,410
To reveal that Kang Yo Han is bluffing,

892
01:00:45,645 --> 01:00:47,879
you must show your hands.

893
01:00:48,784 --> 01:00:50,280
Are you okay with that?

894
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,050
Your trumped up donations aren't the only problem.

895
01:00:54,054 --> 01:00:57,153
Every detail on how the Dream Home project funds were spent.

896
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:59,820
Future spending plans and...

897
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:04,430
the project's real purpose.

898
01:01:05,264 --> 01:01:06,459
Ms. Jung.

899
01:01:07,194 --> 01:01:08,399
I apologize.

900
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,370
I spoke out of line.

901
01:01:11,804 --> 01:01:15,269
So what? What are you saying?

902
01:01:15,404 --> 01:01:17,039
What will you do about this?

903
01:01:18,844 --> 01:01:20,169
We have...

904
01:01:21,614 --> 01:01:24,209
Mr. Seo, don't we?

905
01:01:41,105 --> 01:01:44,700
(Fasting and Praying for Korea, Do Not Enter)

906
01:01:58,455 --> 01:02:01,220
Thanks to Kang Yo Han,

907
01:02:01,455 --> 01:02:05,890
will I get the chance to get back up?

908
01:03:01,745 --> 01:03:02,910
He's here.

909
01:03:06,114 --> 01:03:07,979
- Mr. Seo. - Mr. Seo.

910
01:03:11,295 --> 01:03:15,120
There's no way to meet you when you're in prayer.

911
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:17,789
It can't have been easy to join us.

912
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:20,629
You all look dreadful.

913
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,329
Why?

914
01:03:24,105 --> 01:03:27,840
Is this issue getting you worked up?

915
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:31,709
Yes. It's such a mess.

916
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,539
We must sort it out before it's too late.

917
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,109
I have employees who are getting ideas.

918
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:40,709
I will deal with it.

919
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:46,525
If you were to help us,

920
01:03:46,525 --> 01:03:48,524
we'd have nothing to worry about.

921
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,795
That's right. Mr. Seo, in our country,

922
01:03:50,795 --> 01:03:54,899
you are the only person who can sort this out.

923
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,300
Yes. You're the only one.

924
01:03:57,364 --> 01:04:00,329
The last remaining true teacher.

925
01:04:01,105 --> 01:04:02,174
An elder of society.

926
01:04:02,174 --> 01:04:03,769
You're going too far.

927
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,370
Anyway,

928
01:04:05,815 --> 01:04:07,939
if I were to speak,

929
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:12,685
the public will awaken from Kang Yo Han's trickery...

930
01:04:12,685 --> 01:04:14,109
and come around.

931
01:04:14,685 --> 01:04:18,320
There is no reason to react to every small allegation.

932
01:04:18,324 --> 01:04:19,855
You are right.

933
01:04:19,855 --> 01:04:22,495
Once we gain control of the media,

934
01:04:22,495 --> 01:04:25,764
we can turn the flow and ride it out.

935
01:04:25,764 --> 01:04:27,094
I'm so impressed.

936
01:04:27,094 --> 01:04:28,634
You hit the nail on the head.

937
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:30,530
Still, we need...

938
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,269
something to toss them.

939
01:04:37,975 --> 01:04:39,674
Something to toss?

940
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:42,685
The people need something like a bone...

941
01:04:42,685 --> 01:04:44,240
to keep them quiet.

942
01:04:44,384 --> 01:04:47,680
Something to bite and chew on.

943
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:51,550
If you were to name someone,

944
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:52,924
who would it be?

945
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:54,189
Come on now.

946
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:57,590
Don't we all know someone ideal?

947
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:02,200
While I remained in my room praying for our country,

948
01:05:03,435 --> 01:05:07,399
someone has been handling all the foundation's business.

949
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,939
Do you mean Ms. Jung?

950
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:15,745
Ms. Jung does her job so carefully and thoroughly.

951
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,109
Doesn't she?

952
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:18,910
She's still a mere slave.

953
01:05:19,284 --> 01:05:22,479
Didn't we groom her up to use her at a time like this?

954
01:05:25,625 --> 01:05:28,090
How do you think we should...

955
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:30,220
put her to good use, then?

956
01:05:30,395 --> 01:05:34,359
She's not the type to stay quiet if we frame her for something.

957
01:05:34,804 --> 01:05:36,300
First,

958
01:05:36,804 --> 01:05:41,070
we must make sure that she doesn't talk.

959
01:05:41,134 --> 01:05:43,370
- Right? - Of course.

960
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,070
Forever.

961
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,439
Silence her so she'll take the fall.

962
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:51,240
Do you understand?

963
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:58,390
I understand.

964
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:00,390
Forever.

965
01:06:25,554 --> 01:06:29,350
(True correction, a bright future)

966
01:06:30,955 --> 01:06:32,289
What are you doing?

967
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:33,490
Get out.

968
01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:42,499
(Corrections)

969
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:19,369
We're huge fans, Judge Kang.

970
01:07:21,444 --> 01:07:22,444

971
01:07:22,444 --> 01:07:23,545
- We are... - We are...

power!

973
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:25,909
- power! - power!

974
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:30,879
You have our respect.

- We are... - We are...

976
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:42,989
- power! - power!

- We are... - We are...

980
01:07:49,005 --> 01:07:50,104
power!

(Advanced correction brings on the future)

982

Inmate number 70618,

986
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:16,060
Doh Young Choon. Visiting Room Seven.

987
01:08:23,404 --> 01:08:25,430
Do you want me to lose my mind?

988
01:08:26,274 --> 01:08:28,739
Do you want to see me strangle him?

989
01:08:31,875 --> 01:08:33,140
You scumbag.

990
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,194
Inmate number 70618,

991
01:08:49,194 --> 01:08:50,560
Doh Young Choon.

992
01:09:25,465 --> 01:09:26,590
No.

993
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,499
He's not Doh Young Choon.

994
01:09:28,904 --> 01:09:30,999
He's someone else. Something's wrong.

995
01:09:31,774 --> 01:09:34,400
Inmate number 70618, he is Doh Young Choon.

996
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:36,400
He's not.

997
01:09:36,974 --> 01:09:38,569
He's not Doh Young Choon.

998
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:40,340
This is impossible.

999
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:42,684
It's someone else.

1000
01:09:42,684 --> 01:09:46,050
He got additional charges for economic crimes...

1001
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:47,550
and was sentenced to 17 years.

1002
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:49,850
Name, Doh Young Choon.

1003
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:54,959
(Doh Young Choon, factory worker, high school dropout)

1004
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:02,659
I don't know what your story is,

1005
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,999
but his inmate and ID number, date of imprisonment,

1006
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:07,430
they all match up.

1007
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,209
Never once,

1008
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:20,110
not even for a single day have I forgotten his face.

1009
01:10:24,684 --> 01:10:27,050
It's not him. It's another person.

1010
01:10:28,055 --> 01:10:30,159
Sir, why are you in there?

1011
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:32,060
Sir.

1012
01:10:32,265 --> 01:10:34,590
Why are you in there? Come out.

1013
01:10:34,835 --> 01:10:35,930
Sir!

1014
01:11:00,955 --> 01:11:02,060

(Establishment of order, promotion of morality)

1016
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:52,273
The only thing that can be thoroughly manipulated...

1017
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:53,970
is the system itself.

1018
01:11:54,545 --> 01:11:55,840
This is the system.

1019
01:11:56,885 --> 01:11:59,209
A system has no chance against power.

1020
01:12:00,314 --> 01:12:04,279
Power can control a system however it likes.

1021
01:12:17,205 --> 01:12:20,900
(Morality)

1022
01:14:10,385 --> 01:14:12,850
- Oh... - Have you been somewhere?

1023
01:14:13,255 --> 01:14:14,350
No.

1024
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,980
I just stepped out for some air.

1025
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:19,949
That's not good.

1026
01:14:20,524 --> 01:14:23,919
The air is too cold for an old man like you.

1027
01:14:24,364 --> 01:14:26,094
Your knees must be freezing.

1028
01:14:26,095 --> 01:14:28,560
No, I'm fine.

1029
01:14:44,684 --> 01:14:46,480
You've aged.

1030
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:50,949
Is it because of me?

1031
01:14:52,095 --> 01:14:54,223
Because I have something on you...

1032
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,959
and have been bullying you?

1033
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,860
No, not at all.

1034
01:14:59,765 --> 01:15:01,760
It's all my fault.

1035
01:15:03,534 --> 01:15:06,199
I'm not in the position to blame anyone.

1036
01:15:08,404 --> 01:15:09,569
Are you sure?

1037
01:15:12,814 --> 01:15:15,514
Wow, I'm impressed.

1038
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:17,739
I'd blame me.

1039
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:21,379
I guess all the meditating paid off.

1040
01:15:26,324 --> 01:15:27,489
Remember?

1041
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:32,090
When I first came here to work for you,

1042
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,900
I was still pretty young.

1043
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:38,199
Yes,

1044
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:40,400
you were.

1045
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:43,539
Why did you do that?

1046
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,739
Why?

1047
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,879
I was just a little girl who had nowhere else to go.

1048
01:16:09,635 --> 01:16:12,629
Stop crying. Why are you crying?

1049
01:16:12,974 --> 01:16:15,300
I never got the chance to cry once.

1050
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:27,150
Stand up.

1051
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,579
Let's put an end to this.

1052
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:04,119
I forgive you.

1053
01:17:05,894 --> 01:17:06,989
Pardon?

1054
01:17:08,295 --> 01:17:11,794
I do. You're an important person.

1055
01:17:11,795 --> 01:17:13,890
It's your responsibility to save this country.

1056
01:17:15,034 --> 01:17:17,199
Everything's already been discussed.

1057
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:35,010
It's okay. Everything will be all right.

1058
01:17:37,024 --> 01:17:41,390
You'll die an honorable death as the respected Chairman Seo.

1059
01:17:42,394 --> 01:17:43,720
It's more than you deserve.

1060
01:17:44,625 --> 01:17:46,860
It's a lot more...

1061
01:17:47,965 --> 01:17:51,400
than a pig like you deserves.

1062
01:18:30,045 --> 01:18:33,844
Chairman Seo Jeong Hak of Social Responsibility Foundation passed on.

1063
01:18:33,845 --> 01:18:35,744
It's been reported that he took his own life...

1064
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:38,044
as a way to take responsibility...

1065
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:40,180
for the recent donation embezzlement allegations.

1066
01:18:40,184 --> 01:18:42,483
All the employees involved in the embezzlement...

1067
01:18:42,484 --> 01:18:44,783
have destroyed all evidence and fled.

1068
01:18:44,784 --> 01:18:47,254
It seems that the deceased was devastated by this...

1069
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:49,294
and decided to bear his cross.

1070
01:18:49,295 --> 01:18:51,464
Overcoming many hardships, he devoted his life...

1071
01:18:51,465 --> 01:18:54,764
to helping those in need and promoting the national spirit.

1072
01:18:54,765 --> 01:18:57,733
His death has left the entire country in grief.

(The Devil Judge)

1081
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:16,300
I lived on so I could go back there.

1082
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:20,814
As the master of the world you kicked me out of.

1083
01:21:20,814 --> 01:21:23,015
A monster who releases their brakes...

1084
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:24,783
never stops when it's best.

1085
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:26,010
What are you doing?

1086
01:21:26,955 --> 01:21:28,114
The show must go on.

1087

The public's support is our only weapon.

1088
01:21:30,425 --> 01:21:31,955
What is Kang Yo Han's intention?

1089
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:35,390
You want me to see you enjoy life so I will lose my mind!

1090
01:21:35,394 --> 01:21:37,959
I told you before. Any elements of risk...

1091
01:21:38,095 --> 01:21:40,629
You are a lot like me in this aspect.

1092
01:21:40,894 --> 01:21:42,329
Is that why you like me?
