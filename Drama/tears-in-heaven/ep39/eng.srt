Qunfei.

18
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,000
Please enjoy it.

19
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:09,720
It's just...

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
What?

21
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,320
Just...

22
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,600
I want to say...

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,160
He Qunfei,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,880
marry me.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Excuse me.

26
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,080
He Qunfei,

27
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,000
let me marry you.

28
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,160
Please enjoy it.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,000
It's just...

30
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,639
Just...

31
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,679
What is it?

32
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,440
Just what?

33
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,279
Just that.

34
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,720
You don't understand?

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,839
How can I understand
when you didn't say anything?

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,039
It's just that.

38
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,119
Which? What?

39
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,399
You don't know that?

40
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,800
Which? I really don't know.

41
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,279
Just...

42
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,559
Just...

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,160
Why can't I say it out?

44
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,399
What can't you say?

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,639
You can say anything.

46
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,119
Why do I have to propose?

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,039
It's not something for women to do.

48
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,119
So annoying.

49
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,720
You don't know how to
eat French meals, right?

50
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,839
It's fine. I will teach you.
I've had French meals with Mr. Lei.

51
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,919
He Qunfei,

52
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,839
I'm going to say it to you.

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,399
I...

54
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,919
What about you?

55
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,399
I'm telling you

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,320
I need to go out for a little while.

57
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,440
Wait for me here.

58
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:38,720
Siqi.

59
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,559
Xiaosu,

60
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,839
I apologize sincerely

61
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,279
for suddenly disappearing

62
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,399
and hiding the truth from you.

63
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,639
You tell me the truth up until now.

64
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,880
It hurts me

65
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,440
so much.

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Can you forgive me?

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,880
Sorry,

68
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,239
but I don't think I can forgive you.

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,079
I didn't have a choice at that time.

70
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,880
I just wanted to protect you.

71
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,200
Protect me?

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,079
You think that hiding from me

73
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,880
and running away from me

74
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,399
were the best ways to protect me?

75
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:34,239
Xiaosu.

76
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,119
I'm not afraid of them at all.

77
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm not afraid of being followed.

78
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,480
You know what I'm afraid of?

79
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,040
You disappearing from my world.

80
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,760
I was worried that I would not
be able to see you again.

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
As long as I thought of

82
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,320
how dangerous you were at that time,

83
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,799
while I had no idea about it,

84
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,839
I can't help feeling very sad

85
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,359
and self-condemned.

86
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:58,600
I really hope that

87
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,079
the person who was there for you was me.

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,799
Two people who love each other

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,000
should face everything together,

90
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,399
no matter being dead or alive.

91
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,359
Qunfei,

92
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,200
actually I know why
you don't want to get married.

93
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,279
You want to wait until
you've become more successful.

94
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,640
But I want to tell you that

95
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,679
love can't wait.

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,040
It's like the house price.

97
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:35,359
If you don't make decisions quickly,

98
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,040
you will regret it afterwards.

99
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,720
I'm not the one
who I used to be anymore.

100
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,200
I've thought through many things.

101
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,799
People

102
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,720
shouldn't be controlled by houses.

103
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,440
We are poor and we can't
afford buying an apartment,

104
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,920
but we can rent one.

105
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:52,640
If you think it's too stressful

106
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,440
to live in Shanghai,

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
we can go to Australia together.

108
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
We can be a farm owner,

109
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,640
or we can buy a cheap car

110
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,440
and travel around the world.

111
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,359
We can be a citizen of the world.

112
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:09,679
Qunfei,

113
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,760
I'm saying all these
to let you know that

114
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
it's OK that we can't
afford an apartment now.

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,160
For me,

116
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,200
home is wherever

117
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,839
you are.

118
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
I used to think that

119
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,239
two people have to
enjoy themselves in marriage.

120
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,160
But now I know that

121
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,119
marriage

122
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,839
requires the effort of two people.

123
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,440
Qunfei,

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,119
let's work hard together.

125
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,799
Qunfei.

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,200
He Qunfei, come back!

127
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,720
He Qunfei.

128
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,880
He Qunfei.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,040
From now on,

130
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,559
no matter what happens,

131
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,000
I will tell you immediately

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,920
and I won't hide anything from you.

133
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
Do we really have

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,119
a future together?

135
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,760
I've been thinking

136
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,119
if we should actually be together.

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,440
Xiaosu,

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,600
do you know how long I've waited

139
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,200
to hug you like this?

140
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,960
I've never wanted to be apart from you.

141
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,080
Thank you for telling me these,

142
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,599
but

143
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,119
I'm really tired.

144
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,559
I want to be alone for a while.

145
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,320
Maybe

146
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,599
it's better for us to be friends.

147
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,000
Siqi.

148
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,440
Don't talk to me.

149
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,400
I don't want to see you anymore.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,280
Siqi, listen to me.

151
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,239
He Qunfei,

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,679
what do you want me to do?

153
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,640
I've already proposed to you.

154
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,679
Will you get satisfied if I kneel down?

155
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,679
I'm very touched by your words,

156
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,359
but we need to be realistic.

157
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,640
Realistic?

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,039
It's not realistic?

159
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
Think about it.

160
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,359
Always renting an apartment

161
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,039
means to be constantly
chased by the owners.

162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
Even if we have a touring car,

163
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:55,799
we can't drive through oceans or rivers.

164
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,719
And do you think life will be easier

165
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,599
if we become farmers in Australia?

166
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,280
No, it won't.

167
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
Because I would never

168
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:06,359
let you touch cow dung

169
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,840
or pull grass.

170
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,159
Enough, He Qunfei.

171
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:11,559
If you don't want to get married.

172
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,359
you don't have to
tell me all these reasons.

173
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm here and

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,840
you don't need to worry about all these.

175
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,919
Siqi, I've thought it through.

176
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,799
Thank you for giving me confidence.

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,640
We can't afford
an apartment in 10 years,

178
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,520
but it doesn't mean we still
can't afford one in 50 years.

179
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,000
But on top of it,

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,919
you need to be my wife.

181
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Marry me.

182
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,880
He Qunfei,

183
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,479
what's that?

184
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,440
Proposal ring for men.

185
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,080
You've never seen one, right?

186
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Are you saying that

187
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,719
Siqi proposed to you?

188
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:53,919
It's embarrassing

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,119
to say it.

190
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,679
At first,

191
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,159
I was shy.

192
00:11:58,239 --> 00:11:59,039
But I was surprised that

193
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,799
she was very open-minded as a girl

194
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,599
and proposed to me.

195
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,039
But

196
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,960
I also gave her

197
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,239
a lot of promises.

198
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,840
So it was like a mutual proposal.

199
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,919
So she doesn't care about
the house problem anymore?

200
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:14,479
She said it by herself.

201
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,760
If she didn't mention it,

202
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,119
it would be stuck in my mind.

203
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,080
Mr. Lei,

204
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,760
now I'm your predecessor
in relationships.

205
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,479
For love,

206
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:27,559
pain and happiness always come together.

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,159
Happiness runs faster.

208
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,359
But as for pain,

209
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,119
it would stay where it is.

210
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
Therefore,

211
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,239
Mr. Lei,

212
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,440
if you don't chase after it,

213
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,679
the pain will stick around

214
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,119
until it ruins the love of two people.

215
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,080
Chase after it?

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,039
Right.

217
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,840
How would you catch the happiness
if you don't chase after it?

218
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,159
How?

219
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,479
You need to work hard
no matter what you do, Mr. Lei.

220
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
Did you explain everything

221
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,359
to Xiaosu?

222
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,119
We will start from being friends.

223
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,080
Well, being friends is at least better

224
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,280
than being enemies.

225
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:05,679
Oh, Mr. Lei.

226
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,200
Since Siqi and I are getting married,

227
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,119
I want to invite you to be our witness.

228
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,840
I will also invite Xiaosu.

229
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,880
Love is like spark

230
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,039
after all.

231
00:13:16,119 --> 00:13:17,520
You need to make frictions

232
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,239
and then love will appear.

233
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:20,640
Alright.

234
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you for your trust.

235
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:24,719
I will prepare a great speech.

236
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,599
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

237
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,719
I gotta go now.

238
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
Sure.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,679
Chase after it.

240
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:41,719
Here I come.

241
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,239
Stop.

242
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:46,520
Let's have a rest.

243
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm so tired.

244
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,840
You're quite a match now!

245
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,119
You've made great progress.

246
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,359
Bro,

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,919
you seem a little distracted today.

248
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,440
Tell me,

249
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,919
why did you come to me

250
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,039
so urgently?

251
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
I...

252
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
It seems the entry requirements here

253
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,400
are getting higher and higher.

254
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,799
There are more and more
beautiful girls here.

255
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Shangguan.

256
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,479
Shangguan.

257
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:20,280
What?

258
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,320
Let me ask you.

259
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,880
How...

260
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
can you...

261
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,919
make a girl...

262
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:29,640
like you?

263
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,320
Am I hearing it correctly?

264
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,520
You're consulting me
for going after girls?

265
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,320
It doesn't sound like
something you would say.

266
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,599
Did I punch through your temple?

267
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,559
Did I make you dumb?

268
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,119
Why can't I go after girls?

269
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
Since you were a kid,

270
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,599
it's always girls chasing after you.

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,919
I see.

272
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,280
You are going after Du Xiaosu.

273
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,000
What should I do?

274
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:58,520
If you want to get a girl,

275
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,200
do you know what you lack the most?

276
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,280
What?

277
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,919
Affinity.

278
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:04,719
Affinity?

279
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:06,559
Number one rule for affinity.

280
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,359
Don't drive your Bentley.

281
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
The car is black and too shiny.

282
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,719
When you get off the car

283
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,679
with your poker face,

284
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,599
the aura is too heavy.

285
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,919
Girls would be scared.

286
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,400
Lei Yuzheng?

287
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Why are you here?

288
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,479
I just want to come to see you.

289
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

290
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,159
I have to get up early tomorrow.

291
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
I will skip it.

292
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Then it's not for you to decide.

293
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,799
Wait.

294
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,039
When did I agree to

295
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,640
ride a motorbike?

296
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,280
Lei Yuzheng, let me go.

297
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,280
Lei Yuzheng, I've never
been on a motorbike.

298
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,599
I'm really scared.

299
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,200
Why do you want a ride

300
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,520
in such cold weather?

301
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,559
Are you losing your mind?

302
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,039
I'm scared.

303
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,640
Hold me tight.

304
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,479
Be slow.

305
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,840
Lei Yuzheng, are you crazy?

306
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,880
Why do you ride motorbike at night?

307
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,159
Are you trying to freeze me?

308
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,400
Sorry I forgot that

309
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,479
you can't handle coldness.

310
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,040
You must have done it on purpose.

311
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,520
It's better like this, right?

312
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,479
Number two rule for affinity.

313
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,040
Stop wearing your classy suit.

314
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,560
Too expensive and too professional.

315
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,239
When girls see you,

316
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:36,719
they wouldn't want to get closer.

317
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
What if she rubs her

318
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,040
bb cream on it?

319
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,119
Can she afford it?

320
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,000
-Lei Yuzheng,
-What's wrong?

321
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:45,479
since when you started
wearing clothes like this?

322
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,239
It's so not like you.

323
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,040
Number three rule for affinity.

324
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:54,359
Create romantic
atmosphere and surprises.

325
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,359
Make the whole city full of love.

326
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,880
Then your affection

327
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,599
will warm up naturally.

328
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,560
Lei Yuzheng, are you sick?

329
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,239
Why are you being so weird today?

330
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:13,199
Is Shangguan trustful?

331
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,760
Xiaosu,

332
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,760
I'm here today

333
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,640
because I've prepared
a surprise for you.

334
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,560
Surprise?

335
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,520
What surprise?

336
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,079
Wait here. I will be back soon.

337
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,560
Wait for me.

338
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,959
As long as it's nothing startling.

339
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,400
Surprise.

340
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,079
Your phone.

341
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,560
I left my number to you last time.

342
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,119
Why didn't you call me?

343
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,239
Why are you not saying anything?

344
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,000
Shall we have meals together
when you have time?

345
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,959
We met at the fencing club last time.

346
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,560
Follow me.

347
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,400
Let me show you the surprise.

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,959
What?

349
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,839
Is this the surprise you prepared?

350
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,040
What?

351
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
Such a huge surprise.

352
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,520
There's nothing can be
more surprising than that.

353
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:52,239
Xiaosu.

354
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,640
Xiaosu.

355
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,760
Why did you hang up on me?

356
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,160
Who are you?

357
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,719
You forgot me already?

358
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,680
We met at the fencing club last time.

359
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,520
You were really proactive at that time.

360
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,359
I remembered.

361
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,040
You have misunderstood it.

362
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,599
It's Shangguan who
asked for your number.

363
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,400
Yes. It's Shangguan.

364
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,800
I asked for your number from Shangguan

365
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,800
before I give my number to him.

366
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,239
No, you misunderstood.

367
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,400
It's not me who wants to ask you out.

368
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,359
It's Shangguan.

369
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
Xiaosu.

370
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:35,959
Xiaosu.

371
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,319
Xiaosu, wait.

372
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,319
Xiaosu.

373
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:46,160
You have misunderstood it.

374
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:48,560
But no matter what,

375
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,599
I apologize to you.

376
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,280
It's your freedom to make friends.

377
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,920
There's nothing to apologize for.

378
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,760
The girl who just called me

379
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,560
is the one Shangguan liked.

380
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,319
But about how she has my number,

381
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,560
it's hard to explain.

382
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,719
Anyway,

383
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,079
if you don't like it,

384
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,800
I won't do that again.

385
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:10,119
OK?

386
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:12,319
I just want to make changes for you.

387
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,359
I've never said that

388
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,359
I don't like who you were.

389
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:21,400
You don't need to make
any changes for me.

390
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,079
Xiaosu, you know that

391
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,119
I can try anything for you.

392
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,839
Thank you for talking to me like this.

393
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,280
But I want to say that

394
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,959
you've just taken over Yutian,

395
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:39,359
and you must have
a lot of things to take care of.

396
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
I don't want you to
waste your time and effort

397
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,760
on me.

398
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
It's getting late. Get on the bike.

399
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,439
I will drive you back.

400
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,439
Thank you for driving me back.

401
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,400
I have to go upstairs now.

402
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,640
Hold on.

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,880
It's pretty late.

404
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,560
I have work to do tomorrow.

405
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,319
I will walk you to the door.

406
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,319
This is it.

407
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,520
It's already at the door.

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,119
You should go back.

409
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,239
Good night.

410
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Xiaosu,

411
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,280
I will make you like me

412
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,719
in my own ways.

413
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,839
Go inside now.

414
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,160
If you want to let me go

415
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,239
you need to loosen your hand.

416
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,560
See you.

417
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,160
Turn right at the next crossroad.

418
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:22,479
Fanlv,

419
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:24,640
aren't we getting a divorce?

420
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:27,680
This is not the way to
the civil affairs bureau?

421
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
Xiangyuan,

422
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:39,880
we were in a rush when we got married,

423
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,800
and we never had a normal wedding.

424
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,719
I've been very sorry

425
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,640
to you.

426
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,760
It feels like I owe you something.

427
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,520
Before we get divorced,

428
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,119
I want to make up the wedding for you.

429
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,760
Xiangyuan?

430
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:39,199
Come on in.

431
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,319
Come on in.

432
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,839
I will not go inside.

433
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,439
Fanlv asked me to bring you
the wedding candies.

434
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,520
Wedding candies?

435
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,599
Right.

436
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,800
I want to make up a wedding for Fanlv.

437
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,800
I want to invite you and Lei Yuzheng

438
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,079
as our witnesses.

439
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,119
That's awesome.

440
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:02,199
When is it?

441
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,119
Very soon.

442
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,680
After the wedding,

443
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,199
I will leave Shanghai.

444
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,119
Where would you be?

445
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,520
Lei Yuzheng is back,

446
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:16,839
and there's no need for me
to stay in the company.

447
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
Will she be OK with

448
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,800
you leaving her?

449
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,640
Fanlv is a very strong woman.

450
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:26,880
I believe that

451
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,520
she would understand my decision.

452
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,400
We will get divorced after the wedding.

453
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,520
Because

454
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,160
I don't want to drag her down.

455
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,800
I will be very happy if

456
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,319
you would come to our wedding.

457
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,880
Alright, I will stop bothering you.

458
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,199
I'm leaving now.

459
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Xiangyuan,

460
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,000
if you need my help,

461
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:52,839
be sure to let me know.

462
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,160
Xiaosu,

463
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,239
after going through all these things,

464
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:04,640
now I finally realize that

465
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,920
I've been wanting too much.

466
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,359
When two people are together,

467
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,079
true love means to let go.

468
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,280
Now I finally realized

469
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,520
and maybe it's too late.

470
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,160
But no matter what,

471
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,520
we will just follow the fate.

472
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Thanks for your blessing for us.

473
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,479
I also hope that

474
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:27,839
you can find your own happiness.

475
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,280
Thank you.

476
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm leaving now.

477
00:27:11,392 --> 00:27:13,120
(Lei Yuzheng)

478
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
(Do you have time?
I'll treat you to dinner.)

479
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:41,040
You've finally thought it out and

480
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,400
asked me out for meals?

481
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,000
You ordered so much.

482
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,280
Of course.

483
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,160
It's so hard to ask you out.

484
00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:50,439
Then it must be me
to pay the bill later.

485
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,839
Don't try to pay for it.

486
00:27:55,199 --> 00:27:56,119
It seems that

487
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,520
this meal means something.

488
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,239
If you don't want anything from me,

489
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,280
I assume that you
wouldn't want to see me.

490
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
Lin Xiangyuan came to me earlier.

491
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,800
He wanted to make up a wedding for Fanlv

492
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,719
and wanted us to be the witnesses.

493
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,680
After the wedding

494
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Lin Xiangyuan will leave Yutian.

495
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,920
Why didn't he tell me
if he decides to leave?

496
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,400
Yutian still needs him.

497
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,479
Do you really want

498
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:30,079
Lin Xiangyuan to stay at Yutian?

499
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
He's doing a good job and

500
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,199
there's no reason I have to fire him.

501
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,319
Are you here today to

502
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,400
test me for Lin Xiangyuan?

503
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,439
Then go to tell him that

504
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,359
if he's a man,

505
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,880
come to me on his own

506
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,479
and say it to me.

507
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
I think you've taken it wrong.

508
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,560
It has nothing to do with Lin Xiangyuan.

509
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,599
Even an outsider like me

510
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,040
cannot forgive him.

511
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:54,599
Not to mention you.

512
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,920
What exactly are you thinking?

513
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,800
When I just came back to Yutian,

514
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,359
I did want to revenge him.

515
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,400
If I acted like who I used to be,

516
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,439
he will be miserable

517
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,719
and never be able to step foot
in the business industry.

518
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,239
But you know what?

519
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,479
He actually had his chance
to take me down.

520
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,319
When Yutian was at its hardest time,

521
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,760
if he took the stock and
collaborated with Hengshan,

522
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,280
or revealed some of my plans

523
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,680
to Hengshan ahead of time,

524
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,479
it will be very hard for me to recover.

525
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,239
But he didn't.

526
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,439
Actually besides you,

527
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,520
Uncle Jiang and Fanlv

528
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:31,439
also asked me to

529
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,839
forgive him.

530
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
So what did you say?

531
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,520
After going through this much,

532
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,880
actually it became clearer to me.

533
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,839
This world is harsh
from the very beginning.

534
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,880
Anyone can

535
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:48,319
lose everything anytime.

536
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,160
It's like this for him,

537
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,920
and for me too.

538
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Now

539
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,640
I just want to keep
what's the most important in life.

540
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,239
Yutian is owned by Lei's family,

541
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,040
so no matter what you do or choose,

542
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,880
I would understand.

543
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,920
Alright,

544
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,479
let's not talk about these heavy stuff.

545
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,160
Qunfei is also getting married soon.

546
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,239
How about having a group
wedding for all of them?

547
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,160
What do you think?

548
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,520
It's a great idea.

549
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,280
I will go tell Siqi after I go back.

550
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,839
It will be so much fun.

551
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,400
Is my necklace centered?

552
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
Yes, it is.

553
00:30:44,439 --> 00:30:45,239
Zou Siqi.

554
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,079
Inhale, quickly.

555
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,760
Keep inhaling. Let me tighten this part.

556
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,920
I can't inhale anymore.

557
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,000
You're going to be a bride,

558
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,280
but you are still acting so bold.

559
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,880
Why didn't you lose some weight?

560
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,280
I couldn't help.

561
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,199
Meeting the right person
and marrying to true love

562
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,520
have boosted my appetite.

563
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,719
Alright.

564
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,640
Miss Jiang is also very pretty today.

565
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,800
Am I looking good?

566
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:15,880
Of course.

567
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,160
Yes, you are.

568
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,880
Where are my high heels?

569
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,079
Have you seen my high heels?

570
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:26,119
No, I haven't.

571
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,000
Don't be anxious.

572
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,359
I will help you look for it.

573
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,839
Thank you.

574
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,520
Where are you rushing to?

575
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,520
To save the situation.

576
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,560
What are you looking at?

577
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,319
You gave it to me.

578
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,520
You know it.

579
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,160
I will keep my favorite stuff on me.

580
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,479
Really?

581
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,640
I don't remember.

582
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,040
It's not just the tie that I like.

583
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,439
There's still something I need to do.

584
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,199
The wedding is going to start soon.

585
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,119
Dear friends,

586
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,760
in such a beautiful day,

587
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,160
we get together and

588
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,319
celebrate the wedding for

589
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,839
Mr. Lin Xiangyuan, Miss Jiang Fanlv,

590
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,040
and Mr. He Qunfei and Miss Zou Siqi.

591
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,760
At this moment,

592
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,520
let's place our attention to

593
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,119
the door that represents
love and eternity.

594
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,520
Let's welcome beautiful brides.

595
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,640
OK.

596
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,439
So pretty!

597
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,400
So pretty!

598
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,119
From the flower door of happiness
to the wedding palace hall,

599
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,800
maybe it's just a couple of steps,

600
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,479
but the happy marriage will
take a whole life to complete.

601
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,959
I'm sure there's a hero

602
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,880
in every girl's heart here,

603
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:58,760
and she would wish that
this guy can be with her forever.

604
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,079
Let's wish these two couples

605
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,640
hold hands and grow old together.

606
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:07,719
Let's witness the brides and grooms
to exchange the rings.

607
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,239
Wait a second.

608
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Xiangyuan, there's a surprise for you.

609
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,879
Mom.

610
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,120
Son.

611
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,199
How did you come?

612
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Fanlv brought me here.

613
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,879
I'm so happy.

614
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:48,280
Mom.

615
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:52,840
Have a seat.

616
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,479
Stand over there.

617
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,320
Let the brides and grooms
exchange the rings.

618
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,439
Bravo!

619
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,360
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

620
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,120
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

621
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,600
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

622
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,360
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

623
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,000
Next,

624
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,159
let's welcome the marriage
witness of these two couples,

625
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,320
Mr. Lei Yuzheng to give the speech.

626
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:11,639
Thank you everyone.

627
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,719
I appreciate you all to take your time

628
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,320
and witness with me

629
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:16,800
the wedding of these two couples.

630
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,159
Since you two couples decide to

631
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,919
step into marriage,

632
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,320
I hope that

633
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,879
you can persist until the end.

634
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,879
At this moment,

635
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,159
I also want to thank someone.

636
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,800
It's her

637
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,800
who taught me how to love,

638
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,320
and how to forgive.

639
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:42,080
Siqi, Qunfei,

640
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,600
Fanlv, Xiangyuan,

641
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,120
I wish you to be respectful to
each other and be happy forever.

642
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,280
Qunfei, I want to say to you that

643
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,399
you are my working partner

644
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:56,040
and also the nicest person I've seen.

645
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,959
So today,

646
00:36:58,439 --> 00:37:00,399
there's a gift I would
like to give to you

647
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,159
to express my appreciation.

648
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,439
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

649
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:12,879
Happy marriage!

650
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,840
Thank you!

651
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,080
This...

652
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,439
Mr. Lei, you are...

653
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:25,800
Of course,

654
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:27,919
you have to work hard for this gift.

655
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Come on, give your thanks to Mr. Lei.

656
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,919
Sure.

657
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,360
I will follow you forever

658
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,080
and try my best for Yutian.

659
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:40,560
Yutian's success cannot be without you.

660
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:41,679
Go for it!

661
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,719
Let's bless these two couples!

662
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:47,959
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

663
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
Let's send the applause to

664
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:52,280
these two couples.

665
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:59,639
Alright. Brides, please throw
the hand tied bouquet.

666
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,679
Every girl here today

667
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,520
can participate.

668
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,360
When we move a step forward,

669
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:06,040
happiness will get a little closer.

670
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,719
Let's head towards happiness together.

671
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,280
Let's have our two beautiful brides

672
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,439
throwing the bouquet!

673
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,360
We are throwing now.

674
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Bravo!

675
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,919
One two three.

676
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:43,239
Together! Together! Together!

677
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:46,840
