Thank you.

Qunfei.

18
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,000
Please enjoy it.

19
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:34,720
It's just...

20
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,520
What?

21
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,320
Just...

22
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,600
I want to say...

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,160
He Qunfei,

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,880
marry me.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
Excuse me.

26
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,080
He Qunfei,

27
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,000
let me marry you.

28
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:00,160
Please enjoy it.

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,000
It's just...

30
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,639
Just...

31
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,679
What is it?

32
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:04,440
Just what?

33
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,279
Just that.

34
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,720
You don't understand?

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,839
How can I understand
when you didn't say anything?

37
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,039
It's just that.

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,119
Which? What?

39
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,399
You don't know that?

40
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,800
Which? I really don't know.

41
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,279
Just...

42
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,559
Just...

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,160
Why can't I say it out?

44
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,399
What can't you say?

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,639
You can say anything.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,119
Why do I have to propose?

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,039
It's not something for women to do.

48
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,119
So annoying.

49
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,720
You don't know how to
eat French meals, right?

50
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:40,839
It's fine. I will teach you.
I've had French meals with Mr. Lei.

51
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,919
He Qunfei,

52
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,839
I'm going to say it to you.

53
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,399
I...

54
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,919
What about you?

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,399
I'm telling you

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,320
I need to go out for a little while.

57
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,440
Wait for me here.

58
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,720
Siqi.

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,559
Xiaosu,

60
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,839
I apologize sincerely

61
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,279
for suddenly disappearing

62
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,399
and hiding the truth from you.

63
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,639
You tell me the truth up until now.

64
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:21,880
It hurts me

65
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,440
so much.

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Can you forgive me?

67
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,880
Sorry,

68
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:42,239
but I don't think I can forgive you.

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,079
I didn't have a choice at that time.

70
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,880
I just wanted to protect you.

71
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,200
Protect me?

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,079
You think that hiding from me

73
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,880
and running away from me

74
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:54,399
were the best ways to protect me?

75
00:03:58,679 --> 00:03:59,239
Xiaosu.

76
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,119
I'm not afraid of them at all.

77
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,200
I'm not afraid of being followed.

78
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,480
You know what I'm afraid of?

79
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,040
You disappearing from my world.

80
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I was worried that I would not
be able to see you again.

81
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,760
As long as I thought of

82
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,320
how dangerous you were at that time,

83
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,799
while I had no idea about it,

84
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,839
I can't help feeling very sad

85
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,359
and self-condemned.

86
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:23,600
I really hope that

87
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,079
the person who was there for you was me.

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,799
Two people who love each other

89
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,000
should face everything together,

90
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,399
no matter being dead or alive.

91
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,359
Qunfei,

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,200
actually I know why
you don't want to get married.

93
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,279
You want to wait until
you've become more successful.

94
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,640
But I want to tell you that

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,679
love can't wait.

96
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,040
It's like the house price.

97
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,359
If you don't make decisions quickly,

98
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,040
you will regret it afterwards.

99
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,720
I'm not the one
who I used to be anymore.

100
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,200
I've thought through many things.

101
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,799
People

102
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,720
shouldn't be controlled by houses.

103
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,440
We are poor and we can't
afford buying an apartment,

104
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,920
but we can rent one.

105
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:17,640
If you think it's too stressful

106
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,440
to live in Shanghai,

107
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
we can go to Australia together.

108
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,480
We can be a farm owner,

109
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,640
or we can buy a cheap car

110
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,440
and travel around the world.

111
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,359
We can be a citizen of the world.

112
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:34,679
Qunfei,

113
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,760
I'm saying all these
to let you know that

114
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
it's OK that we can't
afford an apartment now.

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,160
For me,

116
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,200
home is wherever

117
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,839
you are.

118
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,720
I used to think that

119
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,239
two people have to
enjoy themselves in marriage.

120
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,160
But now I know that

121
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,119
marriage

122
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,839
requires the effort of two people.

123
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:06,440
Qunfei,

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,119
let's work hard together.

125
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,799
Qunfei.

126
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
He Qunfei, come back!

127
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,720
He Qunfei.

128
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,880
He Qunfei.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,040
From now on,

130
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,559
no matter what happens,

131
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,000
I will tell you immediately

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
and I won't hide anything from you.

133
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Do we really have

134
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,119
a future together?

135
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,760
I've been thinking

136
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,119
if we should actually be together.

137
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,440
Xiaosu,

138
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
do you know how long I've waited

139
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,200
to hug you like this?

140
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,960
I've never wanted to be apart from you.

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,080
Thank you for telling me these,

142
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,599
but

143
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,119
I'm really tired.

144
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,559
I want to be alone for a while.

145
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,320
Maybe

146
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,599
it's better for us to be friends.

147
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,000
Siqi.

148
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,440
Don't talk to me.

149
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,400
I don't want to see you anymore.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Siqi, listen to me.

151
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,239
He Qunfei,

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,679
what do you want me to do?

153
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,640
I've already proposed to you.

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,679
Will you get satisfied if I kneel down?

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,679
I'm very touched by your words,

156
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,359
but we need to be realistic.

157
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,640
Realistic?

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,039
It's not realistic?

159
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,400
Think about it.

160
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,359
Always renting an apartment

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,039
means to be constantly
chased by the owners.

162
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,400
Even if we have a touring car,

163
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,799
we can't drive through oceans or rivers.

164
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,719
And do you think life will be easier

165
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,599
if we become farmers in Australia?

166
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
No, it won't.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,960
Because I would never

168
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,359
let you touch cow dung

169
00:09:31,599 --> 00:09:32,840
or pull grass.

170
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,159
Enough, He Qunfei.

171
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,559
If you don't want to get married.

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,359
you don't have to
tell me all these reasons.

173
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:39,520
I'm here and

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
you don't need to worry about all these.

175
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,919
Siqi, I've thought it through.

176
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,799
Thank you for giving me confidence.

177
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,640
We can't afford
an apartment in 10 years,

178
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,520
but it doesn't mean we still
can't afford one in 50 years.

179
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:52,000
But on top of it,

180
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,919
you need to be my wife.

181
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Marry me.

182
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,880
He Qunfei,

183
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,479
what's that?

184
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,440
Proposal ring for men.

185
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,080
You've never seen one, right?

186
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Are you saying that

187
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,719
Siqi proposed to you?

188
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,919
It's embarrassing

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,119
to say it.

190
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,679
At first,

191
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,159
I was shy.

192
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,039
But I was surprised that

193
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,799
she was very open-minded as a girl

194
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,599
and proposed to me.

195
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,039
But

196
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,960
I also gave her

197
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,239
a lot of promises.

198
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,840
So it was like a mutual proposal.

199
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,919
So she doesn't care about
the house problem anymore?

200
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,479
She said it by herself.

201
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,760
If she didn't mention it,

202
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,119
it would be stuck in my mind.

203
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,080
Mr. Lei,

204
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,760
now I'm your predecessor
in relationships.

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,479
For love,

206
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,559
pain and happiness always come together.

207
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,159
Happiness runs faster.

208
00:11:55,359 --> 00:11:56,359
But as for pain,

209
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,119
it would stay where it is.

210
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,320
Therefore,

211
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,239
Mr. Lei,

212
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,440
if you don't chase after it,

213
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,679
the pain will stick around

214
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,119
until it ruins the love of two people.

215
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,080
Chase after it?

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,039
Right.

217
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,840
How would you catch the happiness
if you don't chase after it?

218
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,159
How?

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,479
You need to work hard
no matter what you do, Mr. Lei.

220
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,440
Did you explain everything

221
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,359
to Xiaosu?

222
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,119
We will start from being friends.

223
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Well, being friends is at least better

224
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,280
than being enemies.

225
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,679
Oh, Mr. Lei.

226
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,200
Since Siqi and I are getting married,

227
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,119
I want to invite you to be our witness.

228
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,840
I will also invite Xiaosu.

229
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,880
Love is like spark

230
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,039
after all.

231
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,520
You need to make frictions

232
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,239
and then love will appear.

233
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:45,640
Alright.

234
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,000
Thank you for your trust.

235
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,719
I will prepare a great speech.

236
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,599
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

237
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,719
I gotta go now.

238
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,640
Sure.

239
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,679
Chase after it.

240
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,719
Here I come.

241
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,239
Stop.

242
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:11,520
Let's have a rest.

243
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,080
I'm so tired.

244
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:16,840
You're quite a match now!

245
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,119
You've made great progress.

246
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,359
Bro,

247
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,919
you seem a little distracted today.

248
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Tell me,

249
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,919
why did you come to me

250
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,039
so urgently?

251
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
I...

252
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,200
It seems the entry requirements here

253
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
are getting higher and higher.

254
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,799
There are more and more
beautiful girls here.

255
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,080
Shangguan.

256
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:43,479
Shangguan.

257
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,280
What?

258
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,320
Let me ask you.

259
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,880
How...

260
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,280
can you...

261
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,919
make a girl...

262
00:13:53,719 --> 00:13:54,640
like you?

263
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,320
Am I hearing it correctly?

264
00:13:56,719 --> 00:13:58,520
You're consulting me
for going after girls?

265
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,320
It doesn't sound like
something you would say.

266
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,599
Did I punch through your temple?

267
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,559
Did I make you dumb?

268
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,119
Why can't I go after girls?

269
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,760
Since you were a kid,

270
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,599
it's always girls chasing after you.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,919
I see.

272
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,280
You are going after Du Xiaosu.

273
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,000
What should I do?

274
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,520
If you want to get a girl,

275
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,200
do you know what you lack the most?

276
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,280
What?

277
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,919
Affinity.

278
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,719
Affinity?

279
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,559
Number one rule for affinity.

280
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,359
Don't drive your Bentley.

281
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,760
The car is black and too shiny.

282
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,719
When you get off the car

283
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,679
with your poker face,

284
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,599
the aura is too heavy.

285
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:42,919
Girls would be scared.

286
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,400
Lei Yuzheng?

287
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Why are you here?

288
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,479
I just want to come to see you.

289
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,400
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

290
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,159
I have to get up early tomorrow.

291
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,440
I will skip it.

292
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,640
Then it's not for you to decide.

293
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,799
Wait.

294
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,039
When did I agree to

295
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,640
ride a motorbike?

296
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,280
Lei Yuzheng, let me go.

297
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Lei Yuzheng, I've never
been on a motorbike.

298
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:21,599
I'm really scared.

299
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Why do you want a ride

300
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,520
in such cold weather?

301
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,559
Are you losing your mind?

302
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,039
I'm scared.

303
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,640
Hold me tight.

304
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:41,479
Be slow.

305
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,840
Lei Yuzheng, are you crazy?

306
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,880
Why do you ride motorbike at night?

307
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,159
Are you trying to freeze me?

308
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,400
Sorry I forgot that

309
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,479
you can't handle coldness.

310
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,040
You must have done it on purpose.

311
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,520
It's better like this, right?

312
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,479
Number two rule for affinity.

313
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,040
Stop wearing your classy suit.

314
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,560
Too expensive and too professional.

315
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,239
When girls see you,

316
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,719
they wouldn't want to get closer.

317
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
What if she rubs her

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,040
bb cream on it?

319
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,119
Can she afford it?

320
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
-Lei Yuzheng,
-What's wrong?

321
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:10,479
since when you started
wearing clothes like this?

322
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,239
It's so not like you.

323
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,040
Number three rule for affinity.

324
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,359
Create romantic
atmosphere and surprises.

325
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,359
Make the whole city full of love.

326
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,880
Then your affection

327
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,599
will warm up naturally.

328
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,560
Lei Yuzheng, are you sick?

329
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,239
Why are you being so weird today?

330
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,199
Is Shangguan trustful?

331
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,760
Xiaosu,

332
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
I'm here today

333
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:51,640
because I've prepared
a surprise for you.

334
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,560
Surprise?

335
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,520
What surprise?

336
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,079
Wait here. I will be back soon.

337
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,560
Wait for me.

338
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,959
As long as it's nothing startling.

339
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,400
Surprise.

340
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,079
Your phone.

341
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
I left my number to you last time.

342
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,119
Why didn't you call me?

343
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,239
Why are you not saying anything?

344
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,000
Shall we have meals together
when you have time?

345
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,959
We met at the fencing club last time.

346
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,560
Follow me.

347
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,400
Let me show you the surprise.

348
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,959
What?

349
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,839
Is this the surprise you prepared?

350
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,040
What?

351
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,760
Such a huge surprise.

352
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,520
There's nothing can be
more surprising than that.

353
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,239
Xiaosu.

354
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
Xiaosu.

355
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
Why did you hang up on me?

356
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,160
Who are you?

357
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,719
You forgot me already?

358
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,680
We met at the fencing club last time.

359
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,520
You were really proactive at that time.

360
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,359
I remembered.

361
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,040
You have misunderstood it.

362
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,599
It's Shangguan who
asked for your number.

363
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,400
Yes. It's Shangguan.

364
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,800
I asked for your number from Shangguan

365
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,800
before I give my number to him.

366
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,239
No, you misunderstood.

367
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,400
It's not me who wants to ask you out.

368
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:51,359
It's Shangguan.

369
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,000
Xiaosu.

370
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,959
Xiaosu.

371
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:03,319
Xiaosu, wait.

372
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,319
Xiaosu.

373
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,160
You have misunderstood it.

374
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,560
But no matter what,

375
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,599
I apologize to you.

376
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,280
It's your freedom to make friends.

377
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,920
There's nothing to apologize for.

378
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
The girl who just called me

379
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,560
is the one Shangguan liked.

380
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,319
But about how she has my number,

381
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,560
it's hard to explain.

382
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,719
Anyway,

383
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:32,079
if you don't like it,

384
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,800
I won't do that again.

385
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,119
OK?

386
00:20:35,479 --> 00:20:37,319
I just want to make changes for you.

387
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,359
I've never said that

388
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,359
I don't like who you were.

389
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,400
You don't need to make
any changes for me.

390
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,079
Xiaosu, you know that

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,119
I can try anything for you.

392
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,839
Thank you for talking to me like this.

393
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
But I want to say that

394
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,959
you've just taken over Yutian,

395
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:04,359
and you must have
a lot of things to take care of.

396
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,760
I don't want you to
waste your time and effort

397
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,760
on me.

398
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,880
It's getting late. Get on the bike.

399
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,439
I will drive you back.

400
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:29,439
Thank you for driving me back.

401
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:31,400
I have to go upstairs now.

402
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,640
Hold on.

403
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
It's pretty late.

404
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,560
I have work to do tomorrow.

405
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,319
I will walk you to the door.

406
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:58,319
This is it.

407
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
It's already at the door.

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,119
You should go back.

409
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,239
Good night.

410
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Xiaosu,

411
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,280
I will make you like me

412
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,719
in my own ways.

413
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:16,839
Go inside now.

414
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,160
If you want to let me go

415
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,239
you need to loosen your hand.

416
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,560
See you.

417
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,160
Turn right at the next crossroad.

418
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,479
Fanlv,

419
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:49,640
aren't we getting a divorce?

420
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,680
This is not the way to
the civil affairs bureau?

421
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Xiangyuan,

422
00:23:01,199 --> 00:23:04,880
we were in a rush when we got married,

423
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,800
and we never had a normal wedding.

424
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,719
I've been very sorry

425
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,640
to you.

426
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,760
It feels like I owe you something.

427
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,520
Before we get divorced,

428
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,119
I want to make up the wedding for you.

429
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,760
Xiangyuan?

430
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:04,199
Come on in.

431
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,319
Come on in.

432
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,839
I will not go inside.

433
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,439
Fanlv asked me to bring you
the wedding candies.

434
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,520
Wedding candies?

435
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,599
Right.

436
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,800
I want to make up a wedding for Fanlv.

437
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,800
I want to invite you and Lei Yuzheng

438
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,079
as our witnesses.

439
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,119
That's awesome.

440
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:27,199
When is it?

441
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,119
Very soon.

442
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,680
After the wedding,

443
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,199
I will leave Shanghai.

444
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,119
Where would you be?

445
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,520
Lei Yuzheng is back,

446
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:41,839
and there's no need for me
to stay in the company.

447
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Will she be OK with

448
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,800
you leaving her?

449
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
Fanlv is a very strong woman.

450
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,880
I believe that

451
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:54,520
she would understand my decision.

452
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,400
We will get divorced after the wedding.

453
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,520
Because

454
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't want to drag her down.

455
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,800
I will be very happy if

456
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,319
you would come to our wedding.

457
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,880
Alright, I will stop bothering you.

458
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,199
I'm leaving now.

459
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
Xiangyuan,

460
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,000
if you need my help,

461
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,839
be sure to let me know.

462
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,160
Xiaosu,

463
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,239
after going through all these things,

464
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,640
now I finally realize that

465
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,920
I've been wanting too much.

466
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,359
When two people are together,

467
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,079
true love means to let go.

468
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,280
Now I finally realized

469
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,520
and maybe it's too late.

470
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,160
But no matter what,

471
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,520
we will just follow the fate.

472
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,400
Thanks for your blessing for us.

473
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,479
I also hope that

474
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,839
you can find your own happiness.

475
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,280
Thank you.

476
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,760
I'm leaving now.

477
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:38,120
(Lei Yuzheng)

478
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:48,264
(Do you have time?
I'll treat you to dinner.)

479
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:06,040
You've finally thought it out and

480
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
asked me out for meals?

481
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,000
You ordered so much.

482
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,280
Of course.

483
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,160
It's so hard to ask you out.

484
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,439
Then it must be me
to pay the bill later.

485
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,839
Don't try to pay for it.

486
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,119
It seems that

487
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,520
this meal means something.

488
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,239
If you don't want anything from me,

489
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,280
I assume that you
wouldn't want to see me.

490
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Lin Xiangyuan came to me earlier.

491
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,800
He wanted to make up a wedding for Fanlv

492
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,719
and wanted us to be the witnesses.

493
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,680
After the wedding

494
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Lin Xiangyuan will leave Yutian.

495
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,920
Why didn't he tell me
if he decides to leave?

496
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,400
Yutian still needs him.

497
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,479
Do you really want

498
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,079
Lin Xiangyuan to stay at Yutian?

499
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,400
He's doing a good job and

500
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,199
there's no reason I have to fire him.

501
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,319
Are you here today to

502
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,400
test me for Lin Xiangyuan?

503
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,439
Then go to tell him that

504
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,359
if he's a man,

505
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
come to me on his own

506
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,479
and say it to me.

507
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,000
I think you've taken it wrong.

508
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,560
It has nothing to do with Lin Xiangyuan.

509
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,599
Even an outsider like me

510
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,040
cannot forgive him.

511
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:19,599
Not to mention you.

512
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,920
What exactly are you thinking?

513
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:24,800
When I just came back to Yutian,

514
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,359
I did want to revenge him.

515
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,400
If I acted like who I used to be,

516
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,439
he will be miserable

517
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,719
and never be able to step foot
in the business industry.

518
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,239
But you know what?

519
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,479
He actually had his chance
to take me down.

520
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,319
When Yutian was at its hardest time,

521
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,760
if he took the stock and
collaborated with Hengshan,

522
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,280
or revealed some of my plans

523
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,680
to Hengshan ahead of time,

524
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,479
it will be very hard for me to recover.

525
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,239
But he didn't.

526
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,439
Actually besides you,

527
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,520
Uncle Jiang and Fanlv

528
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,439
also asked me to

529
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,839
forgive him.

530
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,640
So what did you say?

531
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,520
After going through this much,

532
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,880
actually it became clearer to me.

533
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,839
This world is harsh
from the very beginning.

534
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,880
Anyone can

535
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,319
lose everything anytime.

536
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,160
It's like this for him,

537
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,920
and for me too.

538
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Now

539
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,640
I just want to keep
what's the most important in life.

540
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,239
Yutian is owned by Lei's family,

541
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,040
so no matter what you do or choose,

542
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,880
I would understand.

543
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,920
Alright,

544
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,479
let's not talk about these heavy stuff.

545
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,160
Qunfei is also getting married soon.

546
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:46,239
How about having a group
wedding for all of them?

547
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,160
What do you think?

548
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,520
It's a great idea.

549
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,280
I will go tell Siqi after I go back.

550
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,839
It will be so much fun.

551
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,400
Is my necklace centered?

552
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,760
Yes, it is.

553
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:10,239
Zou Siqi.

554
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,079
Inhale, quickly.

555
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,760
Keep inhaling. Let me tighten this part.

556
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,920
I can't inhale anymore.

557
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,000
You're going to be a bride,

558
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
but you are still acting so bold.

559
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,880
Why didn't you lose some weight?

560
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
I couldn't help.

561
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,199
Meeting the right person
and marrying to true love

562
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,520
have boosted my appetite.

563
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,719
Alright.

564
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,640
Miss Jiang is also very pretty today.

565
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,800
Am I looking good?

566
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:40,880
Of course.

567
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,160
Yes, you are.

568
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
Where are my high heels?

569
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,079
Have you seen my high heels?

570
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,119
No, I haven't.

571
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,000
Don't be anxious.

572
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,359
I will help you look for it.

573
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,839
Thank you.

574
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,520
Where are you rushing to?

575
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,520
To save the situation.

576
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,560
What are you looking at?

577
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,319
You gave it to me.

578
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,520
You know it.

579
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:35,160
I will keep my favorite stuff on me.

580
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,479
Really?

581
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,640
I don't remember.

582
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:48,040
It's not just the tie that I like.

583
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,439
There's still something I need to do.

584
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,199
The wedding is going to start soon.

585
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,119
Dear friends,

586
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,760
in such a beautiful day,

587
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,160
we get together and

588
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,319
celebrate the wedding for

589
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,839
Mr. Lin Xiangyuan, Miss Jiang Fanlv,

590
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,040
and Mr. He Qunfei and Miss Zou Siqi.

591
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,760
At this moment,

592
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,520
let's place our attention to

593
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,119
the door that represents
love and eternity.

594
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:37,520
Let's welcome beautiful brides.

595
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,640
OK.

596
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,439
So pretty!

597
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,400
So pretty!

598
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:10,119
From the flower door of happiness
to the wedding palace hall,

599
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,800
maybe it's just a couple of steps,

600
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,479
but the happy marriage will
take a whole life to complete.

601
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,959
I'm sure there's a hero

602
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,880
in every girl's heart here,

603
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,760
and she would wish that
this guy can be with her forever.

604
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,079
Let's wish these two couples

605
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,640
hold hands and grow old together.

606
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,719
Let's witness the brides and grooms
to exchange the rings.

607
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,239
Wait a second.

608
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,760
Xiangyuan, there's a surprise for you.

609
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,879
Mom.

610
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,120
Son.

611
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,199
How did you come?

612
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Fanlv brought me here.

613
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,879
I'm so happy.

614
00:34:12,479 --> 00:34:13,280
Mom.

615
00:34:16,959 --> 00:34:17,840
Have a seat.

616
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:21,479
Stand over there.

617
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,320
Let the brides and grooms
exchange the rings.

618
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,439
Bravo!

619
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,360
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

620
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,120
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

621
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:10,600
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

622
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,360
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

623
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:28,000
Next,

624
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,159
let's welcome the marriage
witness of these two couples,

625
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,320
Mr. Lei Yuzheng to give the speech.

626
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,639
Thank you everyone.

627
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:38,719
I appreciate you all to take your time

628
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,320
and witness with me

629
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,800
the wedding of these two couples.

630
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,159
Since you two couples decide to

631
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,919
step into marriage,

632
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,320
I hope that

633
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,879
you can persist until the end.

634
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,879
At this moment,

635
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,159
I also want to thank someone.

636
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,800
It's her

637
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,800
who taught me how to love,

638
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,320
and how to forgive.

639
00:36:05,479 --> 00:36:07,080
Siqi, Qunfei,

640
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:09,600
Fanlv, Xiangyuan,

641
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,120
I wish you to be respectful to
each other and be happy forever.

642
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,280
Qunfei, I want to say to you that

643
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,399
you are my working partner

644
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,040
and also the nicest person I've seen.

645
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,959
So today,

646
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:25,399
there's a gift I would
like to give to you

647
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,159
to express my appreciation.

648
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,439
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

649
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:37,879
Happy marriage!

650
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,840
Thank you!

651
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,080
This...

652
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,439
Mr. Lei, you are...

653
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:50,800
Of course,

654
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,919
you have to work hard for this gift.

655
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,120
Come on, give your thanks to Mr. Lei.

656
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,919
Sure.

657
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,360
I will follow you forever

658
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,080
and try my best for Yutian.

659
00:37:04,479 --> 00:37:05,560
Yutian's success cannot be without you.

660
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:06,679
Go for it!

661
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,719
Let's bless these two couples!

662
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:12,959
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

663
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Let's send the applause to

664
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:17,280
these two couples.

665
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,639
Alright. Brides, please throw
the hand tied bouquet.

666
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,679
Every girl here today

667
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,520
can participate.

668
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,360
When we move a step forward,

669
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:31,040
happiness will get a little closer.

670
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,719
Let's head towards happiness together.

671
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,280
Let's have our two beautiful brides

672
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,439
throwing the bouquet!

673
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:38,360
We are throwing now.

674
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
Bravo!

675
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,919
One two three.

676
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:08,239
Together! Together! Together!

677
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:11,840
