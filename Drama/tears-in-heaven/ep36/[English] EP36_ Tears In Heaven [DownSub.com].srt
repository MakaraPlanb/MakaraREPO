you look tired.

00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,760
It's because of the acquisition.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,959
Since you mentioned the acquisition,

76
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,920
actually, there is a person

77
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
I really worry about.

00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,720
you are in bad mood.

82
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,239
Mr. Yu, what did you want me for?

83
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,640
I'll come straight to the point.

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
I just want to know

85
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,000
the current financial situation
of Yutian.

86
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,519
Finance of Yutian

87
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,320
has always been in the charge
of the chairman.

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
I don't know.

89
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,720
You are the CEO of Yutian.

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
How come you don't know?

91
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:07,880
I didn't want to tell you
at the first thought.

92
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,119
But, since things have come to this,

93
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,880
I have to tell you.

94
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,440
The internal information leakage
of Yutian

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,839
was related to Lin Xiangyuan.

96
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,959
Are you sure?

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,079
Yes.

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
According to what I know,

99
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,760
the reason why Yutian's stock
suddenly raised during that time

100
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,239
is that

101
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,959
someone disclosed the information that
I would go abroad

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,079
to negotiate with S.G.

103
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,679
on jointly building the
Universal Entertainment Center project.

104
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
I don't want to lie to you.

105
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,920
This time, I didn't go abroad.

106
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,239
I went to Guizhou.

107
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,640
Why did you go to Guizhou?

108
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,079
To investigate Lin Xiangyuan.

109
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,480
I don't know if you still remember.

110
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,959
On the day I was arrested,

111
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,640
the Financial Times published an article

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
saying that someone disclosed Yutian's

113
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
internal information.

114
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,519
I vaguely remember that.

115
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:51,839
But,

116
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,480
is it related to Lin Xiangyuan?

117
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,799
The article was quite detailed.

118
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,440
It just happened when

119
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,079
I signed a contract with S.G.

120
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,359
It was on the same day.

121
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,679
Don't you

122
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,119
think that there is anything abnormal?

123
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,119
You mean

124
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:08,040
it was Lin Xiangyuan
who disclosed the information?

125
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,200
The reporter who wrote this article

126
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,239
is named Li Lu who is in Guizhou.

127
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,079
He was the classmate of Lin Xiangyuan.

128
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Was it arranged by Lin Xiangyuan?

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,839
I don't know if it was him.

130
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
Because

131
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,440
the reporter who wrote the article
is missing.

132
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:25,799
Missing?

133
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,440
Kidnapped, to be more precise.

134
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,279
What the hell do you want?

135
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,959
This is not a nice attitude
for cooperation.

136
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,359
I have to remind you that

137
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,760
we are on the same boat.

138
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,359
If anything happens to us,

139
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
you won't be fine either.

140
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:42,799
It

141
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,760
can't be Lin Xiangyuan.

142
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,720
Uncle Jiang.

143
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,279
I also hope it is not him.

144
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,640
But one thing is pretty certain that

145
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,760
the one who is behind

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,239
should be Hengshan Fund.

147
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,959
Hengshan Fund?

148
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,880
According to my investigation,

149
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,480
Hengshan Fund has been

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,679
secretly buying Yutian's shares.

151
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:02,959
What is strange is that,

152
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,600
at the high price, they don't

153
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:05,720
sell the shares.

154
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,200
Instead, they kept buying in.

155
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,519
From then, they have started their plan.

156
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,440
They want to acquire Yutian.

157
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,920
It looks that they really want to win.

158
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,559
I'm telling you,

159
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,119
don't threaten me!

160
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,279
I am very clear about the situation now.

161
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,799
But I have to tell you

162
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,760
it is in the charge of the chairman.

163
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,239
I really don't know anything.

164
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,840
Ok, I trust you.

165
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,719
If anything happens,

166
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,400
please call me as soon as possible.

167
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,599
Fanlv,

168
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,400
how are you and Lin Xiangyuan recently?

169
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:56,960
We are good.

170
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,320
Really?

171
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,599
Dad, what's wrong?

172
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,400
Nothing.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,479
Dad, what happened?

174
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,200
Dad is just asking.

175
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Dad, are you worried about that,

176
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
since Xiangyuan has got the shares,

177
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,080
he will drop his mask

178
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,960
and treat me like before?

179
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,880
He's very nice to me now.

180
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,239
And I can feel that

181
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
he is truly repentant.

182
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,520
If he is really nice to you,

183
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,799
why didn't he come back to
have dinner with you today?

184
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,039
He didn't even call.

185
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,559
Dad is really scared now.

186
00:09:40,599 --> 00:09:42,479
I'm afraid that I am wrong again.

187
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,280
It's not only going to destroy you,

188
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,200
but also Yutian.

189
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,479
Yutian?

190
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Dad, Fanlv, I'm back.

191
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Where were you?

192
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,000
Why did you come back so late?

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I bought you some food.

194
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,679
You said yesterday that

195
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,320
you like the egg tarts of this shop.

196
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,400
I've been waiting in a long line

197
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,880
to buy it for you.

198
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,000
I just casually said.

199
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,960
Dad, I'm sorry that I'm late.

200
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,119
Hurry up. Eat.

201
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,159
It doesn't taste good when it gets cold.

202
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,719
How is it? Good?

203
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,559
Xiangyuan, sit down.

204
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:18,520
Let's have dinner together.

205
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,599
Ok.

206
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,080
What's wrong?

207
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,479
Are you feeling cold?

208
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,640
Let me get your jacket.

209
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:32,159
You have transferred
Lin Xiangyuan and Fanlv's

210
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,159
jointly owned shares

211
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,239
to Lin Xiangyuan.

212
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
At that time, I was worried about that,

213
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,640
if Lin Xiangyuan

214
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,119
was really related to Hengshan Fund,

215
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,880
it will make it harder
for us to resist the acquisition.

216
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Dad, I will eat this.

217
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,479
You and Xiangyuan enjoy.

218
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,080
Xiangyuan, I go upstairs.

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,799
Don't worry about her.

220
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,400
Come here. Sit.

221
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,760
Dad,
do you have something to talk to me?

222
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,679
Xiangyuan,
do you know what role you are now?

223
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,840
I know.

224
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,960
You're now

225
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,119
not only Fanlv's husband

226
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,559
and my son-in-law,

227
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,159
but also the CEO of Yutian

228
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,599
and a director of Yutian.

229
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,239
At this time,

230
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,159
you should know clearly

231
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,960
what is more important.

232
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,679
Be worthy of your relatives,

233
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,559
people who have helped you

234
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,840
and your role.

235
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,400
It is more important that

236
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,880
you should respect your conscience.

237
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,400
Dad, you can rest assured.

238
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,599
I've got it in my heart.

239
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,960
You are smart.

240
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,440
"A word to the wise is sufficient".

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,239
Conduct yourself well.

242
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,320
Tell me,

243
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,000
how is the negotiation with S.G. going?

244
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,359
Not well.

245
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
I think

246
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,599
Linton of S.G.

247
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,520
was very polite to us on the surface.

248
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,239
When it came to cooperation,

249
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,320
he passed it to the board of S.G.

250
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,640
I think

251
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,119
they will not

252
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,400
help Yutian,

253
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
and they are probably

254
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,760
negotiating with Hengshan Fund

255
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
to support the acquisition of Yutian.

256
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,400
That's exactly what I am thinking.

257
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
According to what I know of Linton,

258
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,960
maybe S.G.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,359
has cooperated with Hengshan Fund.

260
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,799
For such a business plan of

261
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,960
acquiring Yutian,

262
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,000
only Hengshan Fund is not enough.

263
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:44,039
So,

264
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,400
we have to think of another way.

265
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,479
By the way,

266
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,200
how is the situation in Guizhou?

267
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,239
Any progress?

268
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:51,599
Li Lu was found.

269
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,919
But unfortunately,

270
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,200
he has been kidnapped.

271
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,359
It means Hengshan Fund

272
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:00,000
knows that you are doing investigation

273
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
and they start to take action.

274
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,880
Now, we have to wait for
the result from Shangguan.

275
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Hope they can get Xie Li.

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
Let me open the door.

277
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,880
Why not ring the bell?

278
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,200
Here you are.

279
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,679
At the door just now,

280
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,760
I heard you mentioned my name.

281
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,080
You said something bad about me?

282
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,039
Any information from Ye?

283
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:35,400
He got Xie Li.

284
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,000
Shall we

285
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,440
pull in the "net"?

286
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,280
No, it is not the right time.

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,119
Xie Li is very experienced.

288
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:46,359
Don't be too hurried.
Otherwise, he may get suspicious.

289
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,080
This is
something really important to him,

290
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,159
and especially
his life and fortune are involved.

291
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,679
He won't confess

292
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,799
easily.

293
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,752
(He Qunfei)

294
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:00,128
(Hengshan Fund is holding
a press conference)

295
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,799
Hengshan Fund
is holding a press conference.

296
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,520
(Today, Hengshan Fund)

297
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,679
(has officially reported to CSRC)

298
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,080
(and announced its plan for acquisition
of the listed company, Yutian.)

299
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,559
(Yutian is an old listed company.)

300
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,479
(What's Hengshan Fund's)

301
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,559
(purpose)

302
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
(for acquiring Yutian?)

303
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,200
(Once the acquisition is successful,)

304
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,520
(will you make any changes)

305
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:27,840
(to the operation strategy of Yutian?)

306
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,679
(The reason why we put forward
this acquisition plan is that)

307
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,640
(we hope to have
friendly cooperation with Yutian.)

308
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,479
(After the acquisition,)

309
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,000
(we will set up some reform plans.)

310
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,039
(What are your reform plans?)

311
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
(Firstly, we will focus on
the development of new energy)

312
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:47,640
(to accelerate the  transformation
and upgrade of Yutian.)

313
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:51,919
(Secondly,
we will sell the Global Finance Port)

314
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:53,440
(to raise fund.)

315
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,039
(Thirdly, we will dispatch a talent team)

316
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,239
(to join Yutian's board.)

317
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,799
(We will reorganize
the current top management of Yutian.)

318
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,200
They called these plans?

319
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:07,080
It is robbery!

320
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,039
Merger and acquisition

321
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,799
are so common in the business.

322
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,080
(Yutian's
current top management is rigid.)

323
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,679
(The development of Yutian
is also stagnant.)

324
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,239
(But we are confident that,)

325
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,200
(in the following three to five years,)

326
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,400
(we will develop Yutian into)

327
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,159
(one of the world's top 500 companies.)

328
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,799
Lei Yuzheng is in trouble.

329
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,919
Mr. Lin, I have spread the information.

330
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,599
What information?

331
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,080
I have spread that

332
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
Lei Yuzheng will not fight any more,

333
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,440
and Yutian will be over very soon.

334
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,039
What do you mean?

335
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,359
Who tells you that Yutian will be over?

336
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,960
Mr. Lin,

337
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,919
you haven't got the picture yet?

338
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,520
How can Yutian fight against
Hengshan Fund?

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,640
Mr. Lin, it is a good opportunity

340
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,760
for us

341
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
to sell our shares.

342
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,239
We can earn a lot of money.

343
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,919
At that time,

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,719
even if Hengshan Fund's
acquisition plan is successful,

345
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,440
it has nothing to do with us.

346
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,479
We are not afraid of that,
as we have money.

347
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,239
At that time, we just make a clean break

348
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,520
and leave Yutian.

349
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,119
We can set up our own company.

350
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,239
Mr. Lin, am I right?

351
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,239
Finished?

352
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,400
I hope you won't say such irresponsible

353
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,320
things in the future.

354
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:58,320
Besides,

355
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,760
stop doing such stupid things.

356
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,959
Now, I am telling you.

357
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,239
You and I, we are staff of Yutian.

358
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,000
We are paid by Yutian.

359
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,920
Yutian now is fighting with others.

360
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,359
You are one of the top management.

361
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,959
How can you say that?

362
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,520
If there is really a "war",

363
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,800
for such kind of action,

364
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,760
you should be shot.

365
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,719
Mr. Lin, you misunderstood me.

366
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,520
What I have done is all good to you.

367
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,839
I'm warning you again.

368
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,599
No matter what I had

369
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,000
with Lei Yuzheng before,

370
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,199
now, in such a special period,

371
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,920
don't make any trouble for me.

372
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,079
Am I clear?

373
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,280
Yes.

374
00:17:49,719 --> 00:17:50,280
Yes, clear.

375
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,160
Get out.

376
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,079
Good-heartedness is not recompensed.

377
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,400
Xie, what happened?

378
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,040
Why did you ask me out?

379
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,920
Why are you drinking like this?

380
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,079
Anything unhappy?

381
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,000
You can talk about it with me.

382
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,920
See if I can help you.

383
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,959
It's because of my boss.

384
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,239
I

385
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,800
was so kind to give him advices.

386
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,040
He was not only ungrateful,

387
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,280
but also
asked me not to be a sticky beak.

388
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,719
Xie.

389
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,400
Listen.

390
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,040
"Evil people are bad all over the world".

391
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,520
See,

392
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
we've known each other for a long time.

393
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,359
I find that

394
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,839
you are

395
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,479
really a royal friend.

396
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,400
You are so right!

397
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,839
I'm telling you that,

398
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:17,599
one day...

399
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,160
although he seems like

400
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,880
a successful and respectable man,

401
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,760
actually, he is a bumpkin.

402
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,239
A hillbilly. A little redneck.

403
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,640
Right. He is a redneck.

404
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:29,199
If one day he pisses me off,

405
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:33,000
I will make the thing about him public

406
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,000
to send him in jail

407
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,959
and let him lose
both fortune and honor.

408
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:39,319
Go on bragging!

409
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,479
Our boss is so eager
to make his dirty money

410
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
that he sent our previous CEO

411
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,079
in jail.

412
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,000
I didn't expect your boss
was such a jerk.

413
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,560
I also got what I wanted.

414
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,640
He made his big money.

415
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,560
I made my pennies.

416
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:13,160
Pennies?  How?

417
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:16,239
Stock.

418
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,439
I have a buddy
who is a securities broker.

419
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I provided him the information,

420
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,680
and he paid me for that.

421
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,719
You know what?

422
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,920
You are not a good friend of mine,

423
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,199
because you earned money alone.

424
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,520
Ye, are you also interested in stock?

425
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,199
I am interested in earning money.

426
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,239
You should have told me earlier.

427
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,839
I'll give you my buddy's phone number.

428
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,400
Here it is.

429
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,680
You just tell him that
I recommend him to you.

430
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,719
You just tell him
I recommend him to you.

431
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,400
Just make a call.

432
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,199
You don't
have to worry about anything else.

433
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
So simple.

434
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,599
Forget it.

435
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:10,160
I don't know much about stock.

436
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,119
Come on. Cheers.

437
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,640
Xiangyuan.

438
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,439
Don't get too tired and go to bed early.

439
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,119
Thank you.

440
00:21:42,959 --> 00:21:44,400
Have you been
working very hard recently?

441
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,560
I don't mind working hard,

442
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,359
because I am your man.

443
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,119
I saw the news on TV.

444
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,520
Is Yutian in trouble?

445
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,479
Don't worry.

446
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:05,760
There's no problem.

447
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,800
It will soon be solved.

448
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,239
Is there something you want to tell me?

449
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,239
There is one thing

450
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,319
I want to discuss with you.

451
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,199
You don't have to discuss anything
with me.

452
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:20,319
Just tell me what to do.

453
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,520
Recently,

454
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,280
my dad is not in good mood.

455
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,680
He is always sighing.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,239
I think Yutian may be in big trouble.

457
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,439
He is old now.

458
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,239
I don't want him to be too tired.

459
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,719
So, Xiangyuan,

460
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,119
you may need to
share the work load a little bit more.

461
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,839
Fanlv, don't worry.

462
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,640
I will not let him over tire himself.

463
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,319
And...

464
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,920
It's ok. Just say it.

465
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,719
Can you put down
your prejudice to Lei Yuzheng

466
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,199
and work well with him

467
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,239
to help Yutian
overcome the difficulties?

468
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,160
I know.

469
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,239
You don't like Lei Yuzheng.

470
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:19,719
You've been treating him
like an imaginary enemy.

471
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,400
You've been trying to
compete with him all the time.

472
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,439
But this time, it is quite different.

473
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,079
Yutian is in big trouble.

474
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,560
You have to stop competition

475
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,079
and work together,

476
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
in order to save Yutian.

477
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,479
Ok?

478
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,119
Xiangyuan, you just do it for me.

479
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:39,400
Ok?

480
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:43,719
Fanlv,

481
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,479
don't worry about that.

482
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,119
I know what I should do.

483
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:48,959
I listen to you.

484
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,520
Thank you.

485
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:55,920
You don't need to thank me.

486
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,400
After I finish all the work,

487
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:01,160
I will take you abroad to relax.

488
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:05,319
To be honest, I seldom go abroad.

489
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,520
You have to be my tour guide.

490
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,599
Yutian's share price
has been rapidly raising for three days.

491
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,319
From the current data,

492
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,719
they have acquired 15 percent of

493
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,880
the tradable shares of Yutian.

494
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,800
I believe, in a few days,

495
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,199
they will become a majority shareholder

496
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,760
and request Yutian
to hold a shareholder meeting.

497
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,199
It will be perfect

498
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,760
if we have
some evidences of their illegal behaviors.

499
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,439
We can report it to CSRC

500
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,800
and let them lose all their money!

501
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:44,640
By the way,
how is the situation of Shangguan?

502
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,199
Maybe
it's time to let them pull in the "net"?

503
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,319
Are you sure Xie Li will tell the truth?

504
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,959
No.

505
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,800
Even if Xie Li says something,

506
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,479
can you be sure that what he says

507
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,000
can be used as a legal evidence?

508
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:58,400
No.

509
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,400
So,

510
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,800
we cannot pin our hopes on Xie Li.

511
00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:03,800
We cannot put all eggs in one basket.

512
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:05,439
This is not gambling.

513
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,239
Do we have any other option?

514
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,160
Here is the fried bread stick.

515
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
What's wrong? Why don't you eat?

516
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,040
I have little appetite.

517
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,239
Lei Yuzheng's company will be acquired.
What's the big deal?

518
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,839
You have to be like this?

519
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,280
What?

520
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,719
It is not because of that.

521
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,079
You're talking nonsense!

522
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,880
How many years have we known each other?

523
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,040
Ten years.

524
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,319
How come I don't know you?

525
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,760
You are trying to keep it from me?

526
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,599
Halifax

527
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,160
has provided us a definite answer.

528
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,319
Within such a short time, if we want

529
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,479
to seek help from them,

530
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
that's impossible.

531
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,959
According to their reply,

532
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:55,880
it will take one month
to make their decision.

533
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,800
Most of the foreign banks

534
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,959
are not familiar with China

535
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:02,040
and don't know much about Yutian.

536
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,160
No matter how much effort we make,

537
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,000
they will follow

538
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,359
their own procedure.

539
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,959
How about the other foreign banks?

540
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,000
I need to wait for a while

541
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,599
before I can talk to James.

542
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,959
By the way,

543
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,280
is James your father's old friend?

544
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:19,520
He should be familiar with Yutian

545
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,079
and has good relationship.

546
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
How about this?

547
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,719
I, as your sister,

548
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,760
will go with you to Yutian

549
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,000
after breakfast

550
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,359
to ask about what you want to know.

551
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,880
No.

552
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,119
Lei Yuzheng should be very busy.

553
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:37,520
He should not want anyone to bother him.

554
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,880
Who says I want to meet Lei Yuzheng?

555
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,239
I will take you to Yutian

556
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,760
to ask He Qunfei.

557
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,199
How is it? Go or not?

558
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,520
No.

559
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,359
Are you sure? Ok, fine by me.

560
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,680
James.

561
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,880
Hello, Mr. Lei.

562
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,199
Long time no see.

563
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,359
Likewise.

564
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,079
Have you had a chance to spot my email?

565
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,560
Look, we made there one assessment.

566
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,359
The assessment is already sent to

567
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,839
Pasadena, our mother company.

568
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:12,920
Thank you.

569
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,359
But here I have some problems.

570
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,000
How about

571
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,439
calling He Qunfei out and asking him?

572
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,079
I knew that.

573
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,239
You really love Lei Yuzheng.

574
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,280
You are incurable.

575
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,479
What are you talking about?

576
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,000
Stupid.

577
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,160
I will ask He Qunfei out.

578
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,560
So, you can ask him.

579
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:49,800
But Lei, in this situation,
your mortgage is not of any worth.

580
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:54,359
But James, that's why I am calling
personally to ask you this favor.

581
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,199
And group board for me,
team board, its will

582
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,880
is my will.

583
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,199
It's grateful for what you've done,
and...

584
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,479
Lei, I am so sorry, not able to help.

585
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,680
Thank you. Next time.

586
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,719
Thank you. Good bye.

587
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,560
I hope the results from domestic banks

588
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,599
are not the same.

589
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:30,439
Mr. Lei.

590
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,040
I'll be at the club tomorrow

591
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,599
to entertain Mr. Cao from Dafeng Bank

592
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:36,239
and some other friends from the bank.

593
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,239
Please call the club, and let them not
to have arrangement for other guests.

594
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,880
And, at six o'clock,

595
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,800
pick me up at my house on time.

596
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,239
Sure, Mr. Lei.

597
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,040
Anything else?

598
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,119
No.

599
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:46,359
Ok. You can rest assured.

600
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,479
Who are you calling?

601
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,280
You scared me!

602
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,959
You check too much, Siqi.
(Lei Yuzheng)

603
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,040
You even care who he calls!

604
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,800
Your slap

605
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,119
made me feel scared.

606
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,000
See, you have made him very scared.

607
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:04,479
He must have done something bad.

608
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,959
When did your courage get so small?

609
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,000
Why are you so happy that

610
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,280
you two

611
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,920
invite me for meal?

612
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,040
We ask you out to ask

613
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,319
for some information.

614
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:18,800
Xiaosu wants to know

615
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,719
how Lei Yuzheng and Yutian are.

616
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,599
Is Yutian acquired?

617
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,719
What are you talking about?

618
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:29,079
The acquisition just starts.

619
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,719
It should not be acquired so soon.

620
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,239
Yes, there is acquisition.

621
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,239
But, don't worry.

622
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,000
Mr. Lei can handle it.

623
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,520
But I can see that
the other side seems so powerful,

624
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,599
aggressive

625
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,199
and confident.

626
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,800
It looks like they just want to
eat Yutian in one bite.

627
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,959
How is he these days?

628
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:48,479
He is good. He is optimistic.

629
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,119
He also got the way to fight against

630
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,599
Hengshan Fund.

631
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,640
That's good.

632
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,280
Give this to him.

633
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,439
What's this?

634
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,119
It is the amulet Xiaosu got for him.

635
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
Wish him well.

636
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,599
Xiaosu, why don't you
give it to him by yourself?

637
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:11,800
It is better that
you help me to give it to him.

638
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,560
And don't tell him that it is from me.

639
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,359
Just tell him it is from you.

640
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
Why?

641
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,239
I am afraid that he will refuse it
if he knows it is from me.

642
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
During this period, I can feel that

643
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,439
he has been avoiding me.

644
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,280
I don't know the reason,

645
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
but

646
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,560
I believe that he

647
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:34,959
should have his reason.

648
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,479
So, I don't want to bother him.

649
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
I just hope that
he can be healthy and safe

650
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,119
and everything goes smoothly.

651
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,239
Other things don't matter.

652
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,560
Mr. Lei, Mr. Cao has arrived.

653
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,800
Mr. Cao.

654
00:30:59,520 --> 00:30:59,880
Hello.

655
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,119
-Hello.
-Hello.

656
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,719
Where are the other gentlemen?

657
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,359
Mr. Min and Mr. Liao
have something urgent to deal with,

658
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,079
so they can't come.

659
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,119
I come today

660
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,319
because of the good relationship
with your father.

661
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,479
I come here to say hello.

662
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,400
To be honest, our bank

663
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,719
and the other gentlemen
you invited today

664
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,560
know the situation of Yutian.

665
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,119
We are sorry that we can't help.

666
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,560
It's not that we don't want to help you,

667
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,760
but we really
don't have the ability to help.

668
00:31:24,959 --> 00:31:26,439
Mr. Cao. Please listen to me.

669
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,359
You don't need to say anything else.

670
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,760
Indeed,
Yutian's offer is very attractive.

671
00:31:31,239 --> 00:31:32,839
50 percent shares
of the Entertainment Center

672
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:33,839
as the mortgage!

673
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,880
But we really can't accept that.

674
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,439
Hope you can understand.

675
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,520
I have prepared dinner.

676
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,640
How about we sit down and talk?

677
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:43,640
No.

678
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,359
I can't join the dinner.

679
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,439
I hope you can understand.

680
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,880
I am really busy.

681
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,920
Maybe next time.

682
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,760
Ok. Next time.

683
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,319
Ok.

684
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,199
Didn't you see the doorbell?

685
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,199
Doorbell?

686
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Why are you so funny?

687
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,199
Why don't you
ask me what I am doing here?

688
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,079
You are really...

689
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,760
Come in.

690
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:16,160
Buddy.

691
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:17,839
Look at this.

692
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,640
Shangguan.

693
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,040
What's this?

694
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,000
What's this?

695
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:29,520
Treasure.

696
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,239
A treasure that can beat Hengshan.

697
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,616
(Summary of Stock Transaction Details)

698
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,719
Shangguan.

699
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,599
How did you get this?

700
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,319
Ye and I

701
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,680
got Xie Li drunk.

702
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,439
From what he said,

703
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,479
we got
a securities broker's phone number.

704
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,520
I have a buddy
who is a securities broker.

705
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,800
I provided him the information,

706
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,560
and he paid me for that.

707
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:06,599
You know what?

708
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,599
I'll give you my buddy's phone number.

709
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,800
Then, we went to look for

710
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
this securities broker.

711
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,839
Ye and I

712
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:17,280
tried to use all the tactics.

713
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,880
He didn't tell anything.

714
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,119
At last, there was nothing we could do

715
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:24,000
but  to deal with him in a tough way.

716
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,239
What have you done to him?

717
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,880
Buddy, don't worry.

718
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,319
We didn't do anything to him.

719
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:31,920
I just told him that

720
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,599
what he has done

721
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
is improperly using internal information
from a listed company

722
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,680
to disrupt the stock market.

723
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,839
He will go to jail for that.

724
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,959
Was he frightened?

725
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,160
Of course he was.
He was frightened to death.

726
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:45,680
Then, he told us everything,
including how Xie Li gave him the money,

727
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,160
and how he helped Xie Li

728
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,359
to buy and sell the stocks of Yutian.

729
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:50,680
He told us everything.

730
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,160
Yuzheng.

731
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,479
We have the evidence in our hands.

732
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,199
There is no need to

733
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,439
fight against Hengshan in the stock market.

734
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,239
We should beat them.

735
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,000
Have you ever thought about that,

736
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,119
if we submit it to the regulator,

737
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,800
what kind of result it will be?

738
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,800
What else?

739
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,439
Hengshan Fund
will stop the hostile acquisition.

740
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,120
Then, Yutian can release its crisis.

741
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:15,800
Lin Xiangyuan
got the information from He Qunfei.

742
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,239
And Xie Li

743
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,040
got the information from Lin Xiangyuan.

744
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:21,959
So, he started
buying and selling shares of Yutian.

745
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,760
If Xie Li

746
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,639
blamed all the charges

747
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,239
on Lin Xiangyuan,

748
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,679
Lin Xiangyuan may go to jail.

749
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,120
So what?

750
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,439
It's him whom we have to deal with.

751
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,360
Our target is not Lin Xiangyuan.

752
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,040
It is Hengshan.

753
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,928
(Mr. Yu)

754
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,479
If Lin Xiangyuan goes to jail,

755
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,800
have you ever thought about Uncle Jiang

756
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,959
and Fanlv?

757
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,000
What should they do?

758
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,959
Fanlv just recovered.

759
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:14,560
If this happens, she will get worse.

760
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,479
That's right.

761
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,239
Mr. Jiang can't stand this.

762
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,376
(Summary of Stock Transaction Details)

763
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,879
This cannot be submitted.

764
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,320
What do you want again?

765
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
Mr. Lin.

766
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,520
I am now
really doubtful of your sincerity.

767
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,639
What do you mean?

768
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,000
Last evening, Lei Yuzheng

769
00:35:35,479 --> 00:35:37,560
invited the top management
of several banks.

770
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,520
Do you know that?

771
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,479
Lei Yuzheng invited
top management of banks for dinner?

772
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:43,399
It seems that you don't know anything.

773
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,959
But you are the CEO of Yutian.

774
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:47,600
Lei Yuzheng invited others for dinner.

775
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:48,919
Why did he need to tell me?

776
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,479
You're right. I am the CEO of Yutian.

777
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,800
Is a CEO supposed to know everything?

778
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,840
You also know

779
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,239
about my relationship with Lei Yuzheng.

780
00:35:58,399 --> 00:35:59,320
I understand.

781
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,239
But I have to tell you.

782
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,639
The banks will not help Yutian.

783
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,679
I hope you can understand the situation
clearly.

784
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,879
Not irresolute and hesitant any more.

785
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,360
Are you that confident?

786
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,840
Of course.

787
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,760
We'll see if you don't believe me.

788
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,320
You don't submit it?

789
00:36:18,439 --> 00:36:20,320
So, you don't want to save Yutian?

790
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:21,959
Of course I do.

791
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,600
But not in this way.

792
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,679
It is too harmful.

793
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:29,439
If two armies engage on the battlefield,

794
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
will there be no casualties?

795
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,159
Let's think about another way.

796
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,439
I have to go home.

797
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:41,919
Ask for help again!

798
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:19,520
You are?

799
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,679
I'm Yuzheng's friend.

800
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:22,800
My name is Liu Siyang.

801
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,959
I'm Shao Kaixuan.

802
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:26,840
Aunt Shao.

803
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,639
I've heard about you from Yu Zheng.

804
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,439
Please come in.

805
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,679
Aunt Shao.

806
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,040
Why are you here?

807
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:41,879
You haven't slept for a few days.

808
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,280
You knew all?

809
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:44,679
I knew everything.

810
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,280
I came here
to tell you something important.

811
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,479
But you have to promise that

812
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:52,320
you'll go to bed after I tell you everything.

813
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:53,679
I don't want to see you

814
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,239
like this.

815
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,439
Aunt Shao, please have a seat.

816
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Yuzheng,
you must be exhausted these days.

817
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,639
Aunt Shao, to be honest,

818
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,879
I've experienced something before.

819
00:38:13,439 --> 00:38:15,639
But there was no pressure at that time.

820
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,800
Now, it is your hardest time.

821
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:21,399
I can really feel it.

822
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,840
The time I spent in jail

823
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,399
was better than now.

824
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,479
If Yutian is really acquired,

825
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:31,159
what I have done

826
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,840
will be all in vain.

827
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,520
Your father worked on Yutian
for all his life.

828
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,800
You and Yutian mean a lot to him.

829
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,120
In other words,

830
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Yutian and you are his two sons.

831
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:46,600
I really miss him sometimes.

832
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,679
I feel sorry to him.

833
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,280
Since your childhood,

834
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,600
Aunt Shao has never seen you so sad.

835
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,320
I don't want to lose.

836
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:14,719
What's this?

837
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,919
Your father left it to you.

838
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,120
My dad?

839
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:26,120
Since you went to university abroad,

840
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,639
your dad had worked on it.

841
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,280
Open it and have a look.

842
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,432
(Group Trust Fund Plan)

843
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,840
Group trust fund?

844
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,280
About how to use this trust fund,

845
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:47,639
it's up to you,

846
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,919
as long as you're worthy of your father.

847
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,199
Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

848
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,919
Mr. Lin.

849
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,760
Now, you don't even knock.

850
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,879
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

851
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,679
I just got the latest news.

852
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,000
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Lei
are going to hold a press conference

853
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,320
in order to
respond to the acquisition.
