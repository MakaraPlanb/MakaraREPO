you look tired.

00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,760
It's because of the acquisition.

75
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,959
Since you mentioned the acquisition,

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,920
actually, there is a person

77
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
I really worry about.

00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,720
you are in bad mood.

82
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,239
Mr. Yu, what did you want me for?

83
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,640
I'll come straight to the point.

84
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,320
I just want to know

85
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,000
the current financial situation
of Yutian.

86
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,519
Finance of Yutian

87
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,320
has always been in the charge
of the chairman.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,040
I don't know.

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,720
You are the CEO of Yutian.

90
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
How come you don't know?

91
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,880
I didn't want to tell you
at the first thought.

92
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,119
But, since things have come to this,

93
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,880
I have to tell you.

94
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,440
The internal information leakage
of Yutian

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,839
was related to Lin Xiangyuan.

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,959
Are you sure?

97
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,079
Yes.

98
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,440
According to what I know,

99
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,760
the reason why Yutian's stock
suddenly raised during that time

100
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,239
is that

101
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,959
someone disclosed the information that
I would go abroad

102
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,079
to negotiate with S.G.

103
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,679
on jointly building the
Universal Entertainment Center project.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,920
I don't want to lie to you.

105
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:58,920
This time, I didn't go abroad.

106
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,239
I went to Guizhou.

107
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,640
Why did you go to Guizhou?

108
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,079
To investigate Lin Xiangyuan.

109
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,480
I don't know if you still remember.

110
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,959
On the day I was arrested,

111
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,640
the Financial Times published an article

112
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
saying that someone disclosed Yutian's

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,000
internal information.

114
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,519
I vaguely remember that.

115
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,839
But,

116
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,480
is it related to Lin Xiangyuan?

117
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,799
The article was quite detailed.

118
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,440
It just happened when

119
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,079
I signed a contract with S.G.

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,359
It was on the same day.

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,679
Don't you

122
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,119
think that there is anything abnormal?

123
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,119
You mean

124
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:33,040
it was Lin Xiangyuan
who disclosed the information?

125
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,200
The reporter who wrote this article

126
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,239
is named Li Lu who is in Guizhou.

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,079
He was the classmate of Lin Xiangyuan.

128
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
Was it arranged by Lin Xiangyuan?

129
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,839
I don't know if it was him.

130
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
Because

131
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:49,440
the reporter who wrote the article
is missing.

132
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,799
Missing?

133
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,440
Kidnapped, to be more precise.

134
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,279
What the hell do you want?

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,959
This is not a nice attitude
for cooperation.

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,359
I have to remind you that

137
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,760
we are on the same boat.

138
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,359
If anything happens to us,

139
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
you won't be fine either.

140
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,799
It

141
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,760
can't be Lin Xiangyuan.

142
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:11,720
Uncle Jiang.

143
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,279
I also hope it is not him.

144
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,640
But one thing is pretty certain that

145
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,760
the one who is behind

146
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,239
should be Hengshan Fund.

147
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,959
Hengshan Fund?

148
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,880
According to my investigation,

149
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,480
Hengshan Fund has been

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,679
secretly buying Yutian's shares.

151
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,959
What is strange is that,

152
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,600
at the high price, they don't

153
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:30,720
sell the shares.

154
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,200
Instead, they kept buying in.

155
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,519
From then, they have started their plan.

156
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,440
They want to acquire Yutian.

157
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,920
It looks that they really want to win.

158
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,559
I'm telling you,

159
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,119
don't threaten me!

160
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,279
I am very clear about the situation now.

161
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,799
But I have to tell you

162
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,760
it is in the charge of the chairman.

163
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,239
I really don't know anything.

164
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,840
Ok, I trust you.

165
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,719
If anything happens,

166
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:02,400
please call me as soon as possible.

167
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:16,599
Fanlv,

168
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,400
how are you and Lin Xiangyuan recently?

169
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:21,960
We are good.

170
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,320
Really?

171
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:26,599
Dad, what's wrong?

172
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:27,400
Nothing.

173
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,479
Dad, what happened?

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
Dad is just asking.

175
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,400
Dad, are you worried about that,

176
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,320
since Xiangyuan has got the shares,

177
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,080
he will drop his mask

178
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,960
and treat me like before?

179
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,880
He's very nice to me now.

180
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,239
And I can feel that

181
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
he is truly repentant.

182
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,520
If he is really nice to you,

183
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,799
why didn't he come back to
have dinner with you today?

184
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,039
He didn't even call.

185
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,559
Dad is really scared now.

186
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,479
I'm afraid that I am wrong again.

187
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,280
It's not only going to destroy you,

188
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,200
but also Yutian.

189
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,479
Yutian?

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Dad, Fanlv, I'm back.

191
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,880
Where were you?

192
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
Why did you come back so late?

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
I bought you some food.

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,679
You said yesterday that

195
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,320
you like the egg tarts of this shop.

196
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,400
I've been waiting in a long line

197
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,880
to buy it for you.

198
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:29,000
I just casually said.

199
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,960
Dad, I'm sorry that I'm late.

200
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,119
Hurry up. Eat.

201
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,159
It doesn't taste good when it gets cold.

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,719
How is it? Good?

203
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:42,559
Xiangyuan, sit down.

204
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,520
Let's have dinner together.

205
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,599
Ok.

206
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,080
What's wrong?

207
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,479
Are you feeling cold?

208
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,640
Let me get your jacket.

209
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,159
You have transferred
Lin Xiangyuan and Fanlv's

210
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,159
jointly owned shares

211
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,239
to Lin Xiangyuan.

212
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,520
At that time, I was worried about that,

213
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,640
if Lin Xiangyuan

214
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,119
was really related to Hengshan Fund,

215
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,880
it will make it harder
for us to resist the acquisition.

216
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,840
Dad, I will eat this.

217
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,479
You and Xiangyuan enjoy.

218
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,080
Xiangyuan, I go upstairs.

219
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,799
Don't worry about her.

220
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,400
Come here. Sit.

221
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
Dad,
do you have something to talk to me?

222
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,679
Xiangyuan,
do you know what role you are now?

223
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,840
I know.

224
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:39,960
You're now

225
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,119
not only Fanlv's husband

226
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,559
and my son-in-law,

227
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,159
but also the CEO of Yutian

228
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,599
and a director of Yutian.

229
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,239
At this time,

230
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,159
you should know clearly

231
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,960
what is more important.

232
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,679
Be worthy of your relatives,

233
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,559
people who have helped you

234
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,840
and your role.

235
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,400
It is more important that

236
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,880
you should respect your conscience.

237
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,400
Dad, you can rest assured.

238
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:12,599
I've got it in my heart.

239
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,960
You are smart.

240
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,440
"A word to the wise is sufficient".

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,239
Conduct yourself well.

242
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
Tell me,

243
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,000
how is the negotiation with S.G. going?

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,359
Not well.

245
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,280
I think

246
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,599
Linton of S.G.

247
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:42,520
was very polite to us on the surface.

248
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,239
When it came to cooperation,

249
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,320
he passed it to the board of S.G.

250
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,640
I think

251
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:49,119
they will not

252
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,400
help Yutian,

253
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
and they are probably

254
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,760
negotiating with Hengshan Fund

255
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
to support the acquisition of Yutian.

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
That's exactly what I am thinking.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,400
According to what I know of Linton,

258
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
maybe S.G.

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,359
has cooperated with Hengshan Fund.

260
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,799
For such a business plan of

261
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,960
acquiring Yutian,

262
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,000
only Hengshan Fund is not enough.

263
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:09,039
So,

264
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
we have to think of another way.

265
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,479
By the way,

266
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,200
how is the situation in Guizhou?

267
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,239
Any progress?

268
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,599
Li Lu was found.

269
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,919
But unfortunately,

270
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,200
he has been kidnapped.

271
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,359
It means Hengshan Fund

272
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:25,000
knows that you are doing investigation

273
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,440
and they start to take action.

274
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:29,880
Now, we have to wait for
the result from Shangguan.

275
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,919
Hope they can get Xie Li.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,880
Let me open the door.

277
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,880
Why not ring the bell?

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,200
Here you are.

279
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,679
At the door just now,

280
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,760
I heard you mentioned my name.

281
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,080
You said something bad about me?

282
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,039
Any information from Ye?

283
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:00,400
He got Xie Li.

284
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,000
Shall we

285
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:04,440
pull in the "net"?

286
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,280
No, it is not the right time.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,119
Xie Li is very experienced.

288
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,359
Don't be too hurried.
Otherwise, he may get suspicious.

289
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,080
This is
something really important to him,

290
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,159
and especially
his life and fortune are involved.

291
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,679
He won't confess

292
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,799
easily.

293
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:23,752
(He Qunfei)

294
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:25,128
(Hengshan Fund is holding
a press conference)

295
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,799
Hengshan Fund
is holding a press conference.

296
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,520
(Today, Hengshan Fund)

297
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,679
(has officially reported to CSRC)

298
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,080
(and announced its plan for acquisition
of the listed company, Yutian.)

299
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,559
(Yutian is an old listed company.)

300
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,479
(What's Hengshan Fund's)

301
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,559
(purpose)

302
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,960
(for acquiring Yutian?)

303
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,200
(Once the acquisition is successful,)

304
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,520
(will you make any changes)

305
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:52,840
(to the operation strategy of Yutian?)

306
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,679
(The reason why we put forward
this acquisition plan is that)

307
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:58,640
(we hope to have
friendly cooperation with Yutian.)

308
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,479
(After the acquisition,)

309
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,000
(we will set up some reform plans.)

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,039
(What are your reform plans?)

311
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,000
(Firstly, we will focus on
the development of new energy)

312
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:12,640
(to accelerate the  transformation
and upgrade of Yutian.)

313
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,919
(Secondly,
we will sell the Global Finance Port)

314
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,440
(to raise fund.)

315
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,039
(Thirdly, we will dispatch a talent team)

316
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,239
(to join Yutian's board.)

317
00:14:23,719 --> 00:14:26,799
(We will reorganize
the current top management of Yutian.)

318
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,200
They called these plans?

319
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:32,080
It is robbery!

320
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,039
Merger and acquisition

321
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,799
are so common in the business.

322
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,080
(Yutian's
current top management is rigid.)

323
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,679
(The development of Yutian
is also stagnant.)

324
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,239
(But we are confident that,)

325
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
(in the following three to five years,)

326
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,400
(we will develop Yutian into)

327
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,159
(one of the world's top 500 companies.)

328
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,799
Lei Yuzheng is in trouble.

329
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,919
Mr. Lin, I have spread the information.

330
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,599
What information?

331
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,080
I have spread that

332
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Lei Yuzheng will not fight any more,

333
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,440
and Yutian will be over very soon.

334
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,039
What do you mean?

335
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,359
Who tells you that Yutian will be over?

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,960
Mr. Lin,

337
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:42,919
you haven't got the picture yet?

338
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,520
How can Yutian fight against
Hengshan Fund?

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,640
Mr. Lin, it is a good opportunity

340
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:51,760
for us

341
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,280
to sell our shares.

342
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,239
We can earn a lot of money.

343
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,919
At that time,

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,719
even if Hengshan Fund's
acquisition plan is successful,

345
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,440
it has nothing to do with us.

346
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,479
We are not afraid of that,
as we have money.

347
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,239
At that time, we just make a clean break

348
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,520
and leave Yutian.

349
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,119
We can set up our own company.

350
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,239
Mr. Lin, am I right?

351
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,239
Finished?

352
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,400
I hope you won't say such irresponsible

353
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,320
things in the future.

354
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,320
Besides,

355
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,760
stop doing such stupid things.

356
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,959
Now, I am telling you.

357
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,239
You and I, we are staff of Yutian.

358
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:38,000
We are paid by Yutian.

359
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
Yutian now is fighting with others.

360
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,359
You are one of the top management.

361
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:42,959
How can you say that?

362
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,520
If there is really a "war",

363
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,800
for such kind of action,

364
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
you should be shot.

365
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,719
Mr. Lin, you misunderstood me.

366
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,520
What I have done is all good to you.

367
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:54,839
I'm warning you again.

368
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,599
No matter what I had

369
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,000
with Lei Yuzheng before,

370
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,199
now, in such a special period,

371
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,920
don't make any trouble for me.

372
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,079
Am I clear?

373
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,280
Yes.

374
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:15,280
Yes, clear.

375
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,160
Get out.

376
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,079
Good-heartedness is not recompensed.

377
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,400
Xie, what happened?

378
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,040
Why did you ask me out?

379
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,920
Why are you drinking like this?

380
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,079
Anything unhappy?

381
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
You can talk about it with me.

382
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,920
See if I can help you.

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,959
It's because of my boss.

384
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,239
I

385
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,800
was so kind to give him advices.

386
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,040
He was not only ungrateful,

387
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,280
but also
asked me not to be a sticky beak.

388
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,719
Xie.

389
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,400
Listen.

390
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,040
"Evil people are bad all over the world".

391
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:30,520
See,

392
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,760
we've known each other for a long time.

393
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,359
I find that

394
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,839
you are

395
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:37,479
really a royal friend.

396
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,400
You are so right!

397
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,839
I'm telling you that,

398
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:42,599
one day...

399
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,160
although he seems like

400
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,880
a successful and respectable man,

401
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,760
actually, he is a bumpkin.

402
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,239
A hillbilly. A little redneck.

403
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,640
Right. He is a redneck.

404
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,199
If one day he pisses me off,

405
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:58,000
I will make the thing about him public

406
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,000
to send him in jail

407
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:02,959
and let him lose
both fortune and honor.

408
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,319
Go on bragging!

409
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,479
Our boss is so eager
to make his dirty money

410
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,640
that he sent our previous CEO

411
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,079
in jail.

412
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't expect your boss
was such a jerk.

413
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,560
I also got what I wanted.

414
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,640
He made his big money.

415
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,560
I made my pennies.

416
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,160
Pennies?  How?

417
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,239
Stock.

418
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,439
I have a buddy
who is a securities broker.

419
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
I provided him the information,

420
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,680
and he paid me for that.

421
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:57,719
You know what?

422
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,920
You are not a good friend of mine,

423
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,199
because you earned money alone.

424
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,520
Ye, are you also interested in stock?

425
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,199
I am interested in earning money.

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,239
You should have told me earlier.

427
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,839
I'll give you my buddy's phone number.

428
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,400
Here it is.

429
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,680
You just tell him that
I recommend him to you.

430
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,719
You just tell him
I recommend him to you.

431
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,400
Just make a call.

432
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,199
You don't
have to worry about anything else.

433
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
So simple.

434
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:32,599
Forget it.

435
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:35,160
I don't know much about stock.

436
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,119
Come on. Cheers.

437
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,640
Xiangyuan.

438
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,439
Don't get too tired and go to bed early.

439
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,119
Thank you.

440
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,400
Have you been
working very hard recently?

441
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:13,560
I don't mind working hard,

442
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,359
because I am your man.

443
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,119
I saw the news on TV.

444
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,520
Is Yutian in trouble?

445
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,479
Don't worry.

446
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:30,760
There's no problem.

447
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,800
It will soon be solved.

448
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,239
Is there something you want to tell me?

449
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,239
There is one thing

450
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,319
I want to discuss with you.

451
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,199
You don't have to discuss anything
with me.

452
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,319
Just tell me what to do.

453
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,520
Recently,

454
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,280
my dad is not in good mood.

455
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,680
He is always sighing.

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,239
I think Yutian may be in big trouble.

457
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,439
He is old now.

458
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,239
I don't want him to be too tired.

459
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,719
So, Xiangyuan,

460
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,119
you may need to
share the work load a little bit more.

461
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,839
Fanlv, don't worry.

462
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,640
I will not let him over tire himself.

463
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,319
And...

464
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,920
It's ok. Just say it.

465
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,719
Can you put down
your prejudice to Lei Yuzheng

466
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,199
and work well with him

467
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,239
to help Yutian
overcome the difficulties?

468
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,160
I know.

469
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,239
You don't like Lei Yuzheng.

470
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,719
You've been treating him
like an imaginary enemy.

471
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,400
You've been trying to
compete with him all the time.

472
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,439
But this time, it is quite different.

473
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,079
Yutian is in big trouble.

474
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,560
You have to stop competition

475
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,079
and work together,

476
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
in order to save Yutian.

477
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,479
Ok?

478
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:03,119
Xiangyuan, you just do it for me.

479
00:23:03,479 --> 00:23:04,400
Ok?

480
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:08,719
Fanlv,

481
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,479
don't worry about that.

482
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,119
I know what I should do.

483
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,959
I listen to you.

484
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,520
Thank you.

485
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,920
You don't need to thank me.

486
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,400
After I finish all the work,

487
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,160
I will take you abroad to relax.

488
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,319
To be honest, I seldom go abroad.

489
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,520
You have to be my tour guide.

490
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,599
Yutian's share price
has been rapidly raising for three days.

491
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,319
From the current data,

492
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,719
they have acquired 15 percent of

493
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,880
the tradable shares of Yutian.

494
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,800
I believe, in a few days,

495
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,199
they will become a majority shareholder

496
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,760
and request Yutian
to hold a shareholder meeting.

497
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,199
It will be perfect

498
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,760
if we have
some evidences of their illegal behaviors.

499
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,439
We can report it to CSRC

500
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,800
and let them lose all their money!

501
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,640
By the way,
how is the situation of Shangguan?

502
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,199
Maybe
it's time to let them pull in the "net"?

503
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,319
Are you sure Xie Li will tell the truth?

504
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,959
No.

505
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,800
Even if Xie Li says something,

506
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,479
can you be sure that what he says

507
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,000
can be used as a legal evidence?

508
00:24:22,439 --> 00:24:23,400
No.

509
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,400
So,

510
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,800
we cannot pin our hopes on Xie Li.

511
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,800
We cannot put all eggs in one basket.

512
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:30,439
This is not gambling.

513
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,239
Do we have any other option?

514
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,160
Here is the fried bread stick.

515
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,760
What's wrong? Why don't you eat?

516
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,040
I have little appetite.

517
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,239
Lei Yuzheng's company will be acquired.
What's the big deal?

518
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,839
You have to be like this?

519
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,280
What?

520
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,719
It is not because of that.

521
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,079
You're talking nonsense!

522
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,880
How many years have we known each other?

523
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,040
Ten years.

524
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:07,319
How come I don't know you?

525
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,760
You are trying to keep it from me?

526
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,599
Halifax

527
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,160
has provided us a definite answer.

528
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,319
Within such a short time, if we want

529
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,479
to seek help from them,

530
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
that's impossible.

531
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,959
According to their reply,

532
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:20,880
it will take one month
to make their decision.

533
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,800
Most of the foreign banks

534
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,959
are not familiar with China

535
00:25:25,199 --> 00:25:27,040
and don't know much about Yutian.

536
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,160
No matter how much effort we make,

537
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,000
they will follow

538
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,359
their own procedure.

539
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:34,959
How about the other foreign banks?

540
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,000
I need to wait for a while

541
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,599
before I can talk to James.

542
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,959
By the way,

543
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,280
is James your father's old friend?

544
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:44,520
He should be familiar with Yutian

545
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,079
and has good relationship.

546
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,400
How about this?

547
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,719
I, as your sister,

548
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,760
will go with you to Yutian

549
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:55,000
after breakfast

550
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,359
to ask about what you want to know.

551
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,880
No.

552
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,119
Lei Yuzheng should be very busy.

553
00:26:01,239 --> 00:26:02,520
He should not want anyone to bother him.

554
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,880
Who says I want to meet Lei Yuzheng?

555
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,239
I will take you to Yutian

556
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,760
to ask He Qunfei.

557
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,199
How is it? Go or not?

558
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,520
No.

559
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,359
Are you sure? Ok, fine by me.

560
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,680
James.

561
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,880
Hello, Mr. Lei.

562
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:26,199
Long time no see.

563
00:26:26,959 --> 00:26:28,359
Likewise.

564
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,079
Have you had a chance to spot my email?

565
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,560
Look, we made there one assessment.

566
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,359
The assessment is already sent to

567
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,839
Pasadena, our mother company.

568
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,920
Thank you.

569
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,359
But here I have some problems.

570
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,000
How about

571
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,439
calling He Qunfei out and asking him?

572
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,079
I knew that.

573
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,239
You really love Lei Yuzheng.

574
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
You are incurable.

575
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,479
What are you talking about?

576
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,000
Stupid.

577
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,160
I will ask He Qunfei out.

578
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,560
So, you can ask him.

579
00:27:10,239 --> 00:27:14,800
But Lei, in this situation,
your mortgage is not of any worth.

580
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:19,359
But James, that's why I am calling
personally to ask you this favor.

581
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,199
And group board for me,
team board, its will

582
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,880
is my will.

583
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,199
It's grateful for what you've done,
and...

584
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:34,479
Lei, I am so sorry, not able to help.

585
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,680
Thank you. Next time.

586
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,719
Thank you. Good bye.

587
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,560
I hope the results from domestic banks

588
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,599
are not the same.

589
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,439
Mr. Lei.

590
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:58,040
I'll be at the club tomorrow

591
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,599
to entertain Mr. Cao from Dafeng Bank

592
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,239
and some other friends from the bank.

593
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:03,239
Please call the club, and let them not
to have arrangement for other guests.

594
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,880
And, at six o'clock,

595
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,800
pick me up at my house on time.

596
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,239
Sure, Mr. Lei.

597
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,040
Anything else?

598
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,119
No.

599
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,359
Ok. You can rest assured.

600
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,479
Who are you calling?

601
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,280
You scared me!

602
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,959
You check too much, Siqi.
(Lei Yuzheng)

603
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,040
You even care who he calls!

604
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,800
Your slap

605
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,119
made me feel scared.

606
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,000
See, you have made him very scared.

607
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,479
He must have done something bad.

608
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,959
When did your courage get so small?

609
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,000
Why are you so happy that

610
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,280
you two

611
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,920
invite me for meal?

612
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,040
We ask you out to ask

613
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,319
for some information.

614
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:43,800
Xiaosu wants to know

615
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,719
how Lei Yuzheng and Yutian are.

616
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,599
Is Yutian acquired?

617
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,719
What are you talking about?

618
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,079
The acquisition just starts.

619
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,719
It should not be acquired so soon.

620
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,239
Yes, there is acquisition.

621
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,239
But, don't worry.

622
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,000
Mr. Lei can handle it.

623
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,520
But I can see that
the other side seems so powerful,

624
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,599
aggressive

625
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,199
and confident.

626
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,800
It looks like they just want to
eat Yutian in one bite.

627
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:10,959
How is he these days?

628
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:13,479
He is good. He is optimistic.

629
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,119
He also got the way to fight against

630
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,599
Hengshan Fund.

631
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,640
That's good.

632
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,280
Give this to him.

633
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,439
What's this?

634
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,119
It is the amulet Xiaosu got for him.

635
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,560
Wish him well.

636
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:33,599
Xiaosu, why don't you
give it to him by yourself?

637
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,800
It is better that
you help me to give it to him.

638
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,560
And don't tell him that it is from me.

639
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,359
Just tell him it is from you.

640
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
Why?

641
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,239
I am afraid that he will refuse it
if he knows it is from me.

642
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,400
During this period, I can feel that

643
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,439
he has been avoiding me.

644
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,280
I don't know the reason,

645
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,560
but

646
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,560
I believe that he

647
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,959
should have his reason.

648
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,479
So, I don't want to bother him.

649
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
I just hope that
he can be healthy and safe

650
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,119
and everything goes smoothly.

651
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,239
Other things don't matter.

652
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,560
Mr. Lei, Mr. Cao has arrived.

653
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,800
Mr. Cao.

654
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:24,880
Hello.

655
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,119
-Hello.
-Hello.

656
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,719
Where are the other gentlemen?

657
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,359
Mr. Min and Mr. Liao
have something urgent to deal with,

658
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,079
so they can't come.

659
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,119
I come today

660
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,319
because of the good relationship
with your father.

661
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,479
I come here to say hello.

662
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,400
To be honest, our bank

663
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,719
and the other gentlemen
you invited today

664
00:30:42,719 --> 00:30:44,560
know the situation of Yutian.

665
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,119
We are sorry that we can't help.

666
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,560
It's not that we don't want to help you,

667
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,760
but we really
don't have the ability to help.

668
00:30:49,959 --> 00:30:51,439
Mr. Cao. Please listen to me.

669
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,359
You don't need to say anything else.

670
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:55,760
Indeed,
Yutian's offer is very attractive.

671
00:30:56,239 --> 00:30:57,839
50 percent shares
of the Entertainment Center

672
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:58,839
as the mortgage!

673
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,880
But we really can't accept that.

674
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,439
Hope you can understand.

675
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:05,520
I have prepared dinner.

676
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,640
How about we sit down and talk?

677
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,640
No.

678
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,359
I can't join the dinner.

679
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,439
I hope you can understand.

680
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,880
I am really busy.

681
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,920
Maybe next time.

682
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,760
Ok. Next time.

683
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,319
Ok.

684
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,199
Didn't you see the doorbell?

685
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,199
Doorbell?

686
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
Why are you so funny?

687
00:31:36,959 --> 00:31:38,199
Why don't you
ask me what I am doing here?

688
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,079
You are really...

689
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,760
Come in.

690
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:41,160
Buddy.

691
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:42,839
Look at this.

692
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,640
Shangguan.

693
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,040
What's this?

694
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,000
What's this?

695
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:54,520
Treasure.

696
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,239
A treasure that can beat Hengshan.

697
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,616
(Summary of Stock Transaction Details)

698
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,719
Shangguan.

699
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:08,599
How did you get this?

700
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,319
Ye and I

701
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,680
got Xie Li drunk.

702
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,439
From what he said,

703
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,479
we got
a securities broker's phone number.

704
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,520
I have a buddy
who is a securities broker.

705
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,800
I provided him the information,

706
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,560
and he paid me for that.

707
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:31,599
You know what?

708
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,599
I'll give you my buddy's phone number.

709
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,800
Then, we went to look for

710
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,000
this securities broker.

711
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,839
Ye and I

712
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,280
tried to use all the tactics.

713
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,880
He didn't tell anything.

714
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,119
At last, there was nothing we could do

715
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,000
but  to deal with him in a tough way.

716
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,239
What have you done to him?

717
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,880
Buddy, don't worry.

718
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,319
We didn't do anything to him.

719
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,920
I just told him that

720
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,599
what he has done

721
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
is improperly using internal information
from a listed company

722
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,680
to disrupt the stock market.

723
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,839
He will go to jail for that.

724
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,959
Was he frightened?

725
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,160
Of course he was.
He was frightened to death.

726
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:10,680
Then, he told us everything,
including how Xie Li gave him the money,

727
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,160
and how he helped Xie Li

728
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,359
to buy and sell the stocks of Yutian.

729
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:15,680
He told us everything.

730
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,160
Yuzheng.

731
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,479
We have the evidence in our hands.

732
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,199
There is no need to

733
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,439
fight against Hengshan in the stock market.

734
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,239
We should beat them.

735
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,000
Have you ever thought about that,

736
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,119
if we submit it to the regulator,

737
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,800
what kind of result it will be?

738
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,800
What else?

739
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,439
Hengshan Fund
will stop the hostile acquisition.

740
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,120
Then, Yutian can release its crisis.

741
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,800
Lin Xiangyuan
got the information from He Qunfei.

742
00:33:41,239 --> 00:33:42,239
And Xie Li

743
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,040
got the information from Lin Xiangyuan.

744
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,959
So, he started
buying and selling shares of Yutian.

745
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:48,760
If Xie Li

746
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,639
blamed all the charges

747
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,239
on Lin Xiangyuan,

748
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,679
Lin Xiangyuan may go to jail.

749
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,120
So what?

750
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,439
It's him whom we have to deal with.

751
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
Our target is not Lin Xiangyuan.

752
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,040
It is Hengshan.

753
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:09,928
(Mr. Yu)

754
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,479
If Lin Xiangyuan goes to jail,

755
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
have you ever thought about Uncle Jiang

756
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,959
and Fanlv?

757
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,000
What should they do?

758
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,959
Fanlv just recovered.

759
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,560
If this happens, she will get worse.

760
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,479
That's right.

761
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,239
Mr. Jiang can't stand this.

762
00:34:44,936 --> 00:34:46,376
(Summary of Stock Transaction Details)

763
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,879
This cannot be submitted.

764
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,320
What do you want again?

765
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,840
Mr. Lin.

766
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,520
I am now
really doubtful of your sincerity.

767
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,639
What do you mean?

768
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,000
Last evening, Lei Yuzheng

769
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,560
invited the top management
of several banks.

770
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,520
Do you know that?

771
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,479
Lei Yuzheng invited
top management of banks for dinner?

772
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:08,399
It seems that you don't know anything.

773
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,959
But you are the CEO of Yutian.

774
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,600
Lei Yuzheng invited others for dinner.

775
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:13,919
Why did he need to tell me?

776
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,479
You're right. I am the CEO of Yutian.

777
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,800
Is a CEO supposed to know everything?

778
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,840
You also know

779
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,239
about my relationship with Lei Yuzheng.

780
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:24,320
I understand.

781
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,239
But I have to tell you.

782
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:28,639
The banks will not help Yutian.

783
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,679
I hope you can understand the situation
clearly.

784
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,879
Not irresolute and hesitant any more.

785
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,360
Are you that confident?

786
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:35,840
Of course.

787
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,760
We'll see if you don't believe me.

788
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,320
You don't submit it?

789
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:45,320
So, you don't want to save Yutian?

790
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,959
Of course I do.

791
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,600
But not in this way.

792
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,679
It is too harmful.

793
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,439
If two armies engage on the battlefield,

794
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,320
will there be no casualties?

795
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,159
Let's think about another way.

796
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,439
I have to go home.

797
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:06,919
Ask for help again!

798
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,520
You are?

799
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,679
I'm Yuzheng's friend.

800
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:47,800
My name is Liu Siyang.

801
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,959
I'm Shao Kaixuan.

802
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:51,840
Aunt Shao.

803
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:53,639
I've heard about you from Yu Zheng.

804
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:54,439
Please come in.

805
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,679
Aunt Shao.

806
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,040
Why are you here?

807
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,879
You haven't slept for a few days.

808
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,280
You knew all?

809
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,679
I knew everything.

810
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,280
I came here
to tell you something important.

811
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,479
But you have to promise that

812
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,320
you'll go to bed after I tell you everything.

813
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,679
I don't want to see you

814
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,239
like this.

815
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,439
Aunt Shao, please have a seat.

816
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,320
Yuzheng,
you must be exhausted these days.

817
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,639
Aunt Shao, to be honest,

818
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:37,879
I've experienced something before.

819
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,639
But there was no pressure at that time.

820
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,800
Now, it is your hardest time.

821
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,399
I can really feel it.

822
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,840
The time I spent in jail

823
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,399
was better than now.

824
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,479
If Yutian is really acquired,

825
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:56,159
what I have done

826
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,840
will be all in vain.

827
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,520
Your father worked on Yutian
for all his life.

828
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,800
You and Yutian mean a lot to him.

829
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,120
In other words,

830
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,000
Yutian and you are his two sons.

831
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:11,600
I really miss him sometimes.

832
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,679
I feel sorry to him.

833
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,280
Since your childhood,

834
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,600
Aunt Shao has never seen you so sad.

835
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,320
I don't want to lose.

836
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:39,719
What's this?

837
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,919
Your father left it to you.

838
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,120
My dad?

839
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,120
Since you went to university abroad,

840
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,639
your dad had worked on it.

841
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,280
Open it and have a look.

842
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:03,432
(Group Trust Fund Plan)

843
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,840
Group trust fund?

844
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,280
About how to use this trust fund,

845
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,639
it's up to you,

846
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,919
as long as you're worthy of your father.

847
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:20,199
Mr. Lin. Mr. Lin.

848
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,919
Mr. Lin.

849
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,760
Now, you don't even knock.

850
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,879
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

851
00:39:25,399 --> 00:39:26,679
I just got the latest news.

852
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,000
Mr. Jiang and Mr. Lei
are going to hold a press conference

853
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320
in order to
respond to the acquisition.
