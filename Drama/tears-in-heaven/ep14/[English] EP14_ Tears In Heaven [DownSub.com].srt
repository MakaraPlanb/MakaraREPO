00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,559
Let me have a look.

17
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,320
What kind of makeup is that?

18
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,679
Let master Zou show you what I've got.

19
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,839
No, please don't.

20
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,639
You...not too much.

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,440
Trust me.

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,600
Let me tell you.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,759
The tailor makes the man.

24
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,919
Being pretty is more important
than being talented.

25
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,320
Oh,

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,720
when we have annual company
gathering next time,

27
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,800
I will also dress up a little.

28
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:31,639
I will make those colleagues who

29
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,199
used to treat me as nobody

30
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,039
to be surprised about how I look.

31
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:40,119
How much is this dress?

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,880
At least 10,000 RMB.

33
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,520
That expensive?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,039
Are you losing your mind?

35
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,279
Why did you buy such an expensive dress?

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,919
Mr. Mo bought this for me as a reward

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,839
for my job performance.

38
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,679
Since when did Mr. Mo become like that?

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,800
Slow down.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,679
Fighting!

41
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:23,679
I'm a little nervous.

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,119
You're the best.

43
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,600
You know that?

44
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,960
Cheer up and don't be nervous.

45
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm going inside.

46
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,399
Love you.

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,839
Sorry.

48
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,960
What's wrong with you?

49
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm very sorry.

50
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Let's go through insurance.

51
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,520
Insurance?

52
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,479
I'm busy right now.

53
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,040
I don't have time to
deal with insurance right now.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,839
Fine. We can also solve this privately.

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,720
There's only a tiny scratch here.

56
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,920
Don't tell me that you thought

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
they can fix the car
only by repainting this area

58
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,320
instead of the whole car.
The color won't match.

59
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,160
Please don't tell me that
you think my car

60
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,519
is the same kind of car as yours.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,679
I will go through insurance.

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,000
I can also ask for liability coverage.

63
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,880
I remind you

64
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,119
you have to pay out of your pocket
if insurance can't cover it.

65
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:39,959
Safeguard.

66
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,959
Miss Jiang.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,079
Help me watch her
and don't let her run away.

68
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,679
Copy her ID card

69
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
and get her address

70
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,839
in case we cannot find her later.

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
Zou Siqi.

72
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,760
Your address?

73
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,119
Don't tell me that
you don't even have a place to live.

74
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:15,279
Fu Long Jing Yuan
No.23 Building Apartment 2001

75
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,119
I guarantee that I won't run away.

76
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,399
Hold on a second.

77
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,679
That apartment is yours?

78
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,679
What does it have
anything to do with it?

79
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,040
I live there, and that's it.

80
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:43,920
Dai Meng,

81
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,079
help me investigate something.

82
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Here she comes. Look!

83
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,399
This dress looks fabulous on Miss Jiang.

84
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,239
Yes.

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,399
Yu Zheng.

86
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,720
For the invoice title,
just put Yutian Group.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
You can simply put in office supplies.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,839
Miss Jiang,

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,320
what shall we do about the dress?

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,160
Didn't you already have the invoice?

91
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,720
But we only have the invoice.

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,679
What if the accountant
wants to see the actual goods?

93
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Besides, if I accept this dress,

94
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,079
does it mean that
you gave it to me or I bought it myself?

95
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,720
Here you are.

96
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,399
Miss Jiang.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
You look amazing tonight.

98
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,279
So pretty. Who's this lady?

99
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,200
How come they wear the same dress?

100
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
Same dress.

101
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,920
It's so embarrassing.

102
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,600
Two people are both very elegant.

103
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,760
Miss Du looks amazing tonight.

104
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,760
We only have two
of this gown in our store.

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,160
I tried one gown in your store

106
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,239
the other day, don't you remember?

107
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,640
That's good.

108
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,880
I will send someone to pick it up.

109
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:52,760
May I have the honor
to have the first dance

110
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,399
with Miss Du?

111
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,640
I am not good at dancing.

112
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,239
It's OK. You can just follow me.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Who's that girl?

114
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
Why would Mr. Lei invite her to dance?

115
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,280
But they do look good together.

116
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,280
How come I have never
met this woman before?

117
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
How can she wear the same gown

118
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,840
as Miss Jiang?

119
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,320
How embarrassing is that!

120
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,400
Exactly.

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,640
Left foot.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,239
Lin Xiangyuan, look at what you did.

123
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,119
Tonight, you are the shining star

124
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:32,200
at this place.

125
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,679
Come on.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
I'd call it "star on the hating list".

127
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:37,559
Just look at me.

128
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,520
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,159
It's OK.

130
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:51,119
I set my foot at the wrong place.

131
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,039
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

132
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,599
Where is it from, the gown on Du Xiaosu?

133
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,760
How would I know about her gown?

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
The gown she is wearing

135
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,320
is the one that we turned down
at the mall, right?

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
Look at you, Lin Xiangyuan.

137
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,080
Use what's paid by
the company to please girl.

138
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,440
How earnest!

139
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Don't you know how embarrassing it is

140
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,200
for two women to wear the same dress

141
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
at a party?

142
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,119
Wait.

143
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:27,000
You said that you wouldn't wear it.

144
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,440
I've bought it already anyway.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,200
So I figured that I should not waste it.

146
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,320
Still trying to defend yourself.

147
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,640
Let me ask you.

148
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,119
Who's currently living in the apartment
that the company arranged for you?

149
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,479
No one.

150
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,000
No one's living there.

151
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,760
Only a friend.

152
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Friend?

153
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,640
Someone whose name is Zou Siqi?

154
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm afraid that there's also
Du Xiaosu who's living inside.

155
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:55,559
Miss Jiang, I'm sorry.

156
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,880
I know what I did is wrong.

157
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,840
But I really didn't expect...

158
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,239
What about the issue
with company's invoice?

159
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm so sorry about it.

160
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Alright. Shut up.

161
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:13,400
Let's try it again.

162
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,159
Stop.

163
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,919
Excuse me, everyone.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,080
I called it a stop.

165
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,239
How can we do nothing
but dancing at company's annual party?

166
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,520
We shall have some
bigger events to excite everyone.

167
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,880
Fanlv, don't be such a bitch.

168
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,119
Today is the annual party of Yutian.

169
00:11:41,599 --> 00:11:42,799
Everyone's here to have fun.

170
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,159
Don't ruin it.

171
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,559
Why, Yuzheng?

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,799
I just want to offer
some appetizer for everyone.

173
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,239
People must be curious.

174
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,840
How come Du Xiaosu

175
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,960
wears the same dress as mine tonight?

176
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,840
Enough, Jiang Fanlv.

177
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,799
Yuzheng, what I said is the truth.

178
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:06,599
Let me finish.

179
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,440
Lin Xiangyuan, come here.

180
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Tell me.

181
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:15,440
Where did Du Xiaosu's gown come from?

182
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,119
And whose apartment is she
currently living in.

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,599
Tell me about it.

184
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,400
Fu Long Jing Yuan
No.23 Building Apartment 2001

185
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,640
Is it the apartment
provided by Xinsheng to you?

186
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,400
And her dress.

187
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,039
Did you give it to her?

188
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

189
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,359
The apartment was provided by Xinsheng.

190
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:39,119
And her dress

191
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,679
was also bought by me.

192
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,239
He Qunfei,

193
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,960
take Miss Jiang out for now.

194
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,479
I'm not leaving.

195
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,679
Excuse me, Miss Jiang.

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
Yuzheng!

197
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
Everyone can keep dancing.

198
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,000
Tonight is the annual party of Yutian.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,119
Let's all enjoy ourselves.

200
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,159
Follow me.

201
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,280
I believe that
you owe me an explanation.

202
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,679
What explanation?

203
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,280
Du Xiaosu, are you
treating me as an idiot?

204
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,159
The dress you are wearing
and the apartment you are living in

205
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,559
are all from Lin Xiangyuan, right?

206
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,159
Yes.

207
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,640
Can you have some self-respect?

208
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,679
Don't you know
what kind of person Lin Xiangyuan is?

209
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,039
You keep having contact with him

210
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,559
just for these kind of stuff.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm so disappointed.

212
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,919
Don't insult me like that.

213
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,000
I insult you?

214
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,880
I thought that
you have high self-respect.

215
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,799
That's why you could fight so hard

216
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,479
for the apartment with me.

217
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,359
But now you're just
living at Lin Xiangyuan's place

218
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,919
so easily.

219
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,039
What do you want me to think of you?

220
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,359
How do you like me to think of you?

221
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,440
Du Xiaosu, what kind of person
are you exactly?

222
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:56,640
Xiaosu!

223
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Du Xiaosu!

224
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,280
What do you mean?

225
00:15:09,119 --> 00:15:10,280
You slapped me.

226
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,159
I haven't even said anything
and you feel wronged?

227
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,440
Don't you have anything

228
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,599
to explain to me?

229
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,039
I have nothing to explain to you,

230
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
because I didn't even know that

231
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,320
it was Lin Xiangyuan's apartment.

232
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,640
How come you don't know who the owner is

233
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,200
when you live in a place?

234
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,479
Du Xiaosu, are you testing my IQ?

235
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,960
Zou Siqi told me that

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,440
her relative has a friend

237
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:31,719
who stays abroad most of the time,

238
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,000
and that his apartment
needs to be taken care of.

239
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,559
How can you believe such excuses?

240
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,799
Fu Long Jing Yuan was
developed by Xinsheng.

241
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,799
Don't you know that?

242
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,679
And don't you know what Lin Xiangyuan

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,919
is planning for?

244
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,320
I have never found a trace

245
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,280
of Lin Xiangyuan

246
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:51,559
since I have started

247
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,359
living in that place.

248
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,479
As long as I found a tiny trace of him,

249
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,840
I would rather sleep outside

250
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,039
than entering that place.

251
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,520
You moved into this place

252
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,440
and you are telling me that

253
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,840
you never found a trace of the owner.

254
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Who would believe that?

255
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,559
Why can't you believe that?

256
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,039
I had no clue from the very beginning.

257
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,200
Why would I explain to you?

258
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,479
Who do you think you are?

259
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,599
Why should I explain it to you?

260
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,400
Xiaosu!

261
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,479
What is this?

262
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,479
Cheap compassion?

263
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,679
You can think however you like to think.

264
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,479
As you like.

265
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,280
You don't trust me,

266
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,640
but think of me that way.

267
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,599
Why have you been so nice to me?

268
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,440
Why did you return me the apartment?

269
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Why did you comfort me

270
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,799
when we were on the island?

271
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,599
Why did you take me to the place

272
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:01,760
where you used to hang out
when you were kids,

273
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,280
and tell me all those things?

274
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Because we are friends.

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,920
Friends.

276
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,839
Lei Yuzheng,

277
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,520
can you admit that

278
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,760
you have never had
any prejudice about me?

279
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,760
Can you admit your own feelings?

280
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Can you?

281
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,280
I would like to ask

282
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,680
have you ever had any emotions?

283
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,839
Yes.

284
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,599
Lin Xiangyuan was my elder at college.

285
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,880
He did admire me at that time,

286
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:44,959
but I have never accepted it.

287
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,719
What a small world!

288
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
On the rainy night,

289
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
I fell off in the rain

290
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,839
and then you happened to see me

291
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,359
and saved me.

292
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,599
I believe that

293
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,040
what happened that night

294
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,839
made you have prejudice about me.

295
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,119
Am I correct?

296
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,359
I thought that

297
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,359
you were so nice to me

298
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:18,400
because your attitude
towards me has changed,

299
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,359
but it seems that I was wrong.

300
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,959
About what happened tonight,

301
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,160
you can blame me
like you never believed in me,

302
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
you can think that I'm trashy,

303
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,439
and you can think that I'm shaky.

304
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,599
I see now that I'm
so unworthy in your mind.

305
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:38,199
I don't know
who you have fallen in love with

306
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,439
or who you ever believed in.

307
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,560
As a no-class employee,

308
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,640
talking about relationship in front of

309
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,680
the boss like you

310
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,359
may seem funny.

311
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,040
Wait.

312
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:56,479
If you want to explain anything,

313
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,040
there's no need.

314
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,119
You are right.

315
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,439
There's no one who has the right

316
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,199
to make fun of
other people's self-respect,

317
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,800
no matter he is a boss or an employee.

318
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,359
There's this saying

319
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,119
that our souls are all equal

320
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,920
in front of gods.

321
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:21,239
At this moment, we are equal.

322
00:19:22,199 --> 00:19:23,199
Xiaosu,

323
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
I'm telling you these

324
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,800
and you may think that

325
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,239
I'm just trying to look for excuses.

326
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Lei Yuzheng,

327
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,199
in this world,

328
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,760
there're many things that are unfair.

329
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,520
Maybe I'm just too sensitive.

330
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,599
It's already late.

331
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:46,479
I shall go back now.

332
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,199
Xiaosu, why didn't you
pick up the phone?

333
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I was so worried.

334
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,199
The phone?

335
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:27,199
I might have left it at the party.

336
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,239
Xiaosu, I was wrong.

337
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,719
About what happened at the party,

338
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,880
Qunfei has already told me.

339
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,119
I'm really sorry.

340
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,520
I don't blame you.

341
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,719
I'm tired.

342
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,439
I will go back to my room.

343
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,680
Xiaosu!

344
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,119
XIaosu, don't be like this.

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:56,199 --> 00:20:58,800
Watching you being sad makes me sad too.

347
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,119
How could they do this?

348
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,000
They are so bad.

349
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,160
I've said that

350
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,839
there's no free lunch.

351
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,400
Xiaosu, it's my fault.

352
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:25,920
I'm very sorry.

353
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,719
I can't believe what I was thinking.

354
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,359
I don't know why I trusted him.

355
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:34,800
Anyway. I'm moving out tomorrow.

356
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,119
You can decide for yourself.

357
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,119
How can I keep staying here
if you are gone?

358
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,599
We move out together.

359
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,920
I will pack my stuff too.

360
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,160
Wait for me.

361
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,079
Here she comes.

362
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,040
I can't believe what just happened.

363
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,040
I never knew
there could be such long vacation.

364
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,640
It's because someone's got covered.

365
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,520
Rules work completely different from us.

366
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,920
By simply acting lovey dovey
and looking good,

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,920
one can eat and live so well.

368
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,640
Such an easy life!

369
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,040
What an unfair world!

370
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,119
We have to work hard.

371
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:33,880
We are not comparable to her anyway.

372
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,839
Tell me,

373
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,479
why did you buy dress for Du Xiaosu

374
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,800
and let her stay in your place?

375
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,239
I don't care what your goal is

376
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,880
with all these moves,

377
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,439
but there's one thing
that I want to know.

378
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,880
Du Xiaosu has no clue about all these,

379
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,040
right?

380
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,400
I don't want to wrong her.

381
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,760
Du Xiaosu knows nothing about it.

382
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,359
I wanted to do it.

383
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:10,640
Go out.

384
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,160
Mr. Lei, did he admit it?

385
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:25,400
He Qunfei,

386
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,280
Lin Xiangyuan has many secrets

387
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:29,640
and he is dishonest.

388
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,560
Be careful when you
speak with him next time.

389
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,680
OK.

390
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,199
Mr. Lei.

391
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,479
Anything else?

392
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,199
There's something that
I'm not sure if I shall say.

393
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,239
Say it.

394
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,920
I heard people talking about Du Xiaosu,

395
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:48,319
and there were many bad words.

396
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,640
I guess that

397
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:52,119
the words may be worse
among female employees.

398
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,079
Do you know those people?

399
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:54,800
Yes.

400
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,599
One from technology team
and two from engineering team.

401
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,560
Fire them,

402
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:59,920
and give them three months' salary.
You can go now.

403
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,239
OK.

404
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,100
(Jiang Fanlv)

405
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,560
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

406
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
Please try again later.

407
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,560
Dad, Yuzheng didn't pick up the phone.

408
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,079
How can he be like this?

409
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,359
I put myself in such low place,

410
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,719
and chase after him every day,

411
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,599
but he seems that he never notices me.

412
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,920
How can he ignore my calls

413
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,000
and my messages

414
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:28,040
like no one cares about me?

415
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,959
Come here.

416
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,280
Fanlv, trust is very important

417
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,319
when two people are in love.

418
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,079
Especially girls,
you shall act a little restrained.

419
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,520
How about this, you call him.

420
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,719
Otherwise, if he hears me,

421
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,560
he would hang up again.

422
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,719
I don't know what I can do about you.

423
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:57,800
(Jiang Jin)

424
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,760
Uncle Jiang.

425
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
Yuzheng, are you busy now?

426
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,359
No. Please speak.

427
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,359
I just want to ask

428
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:12,680
how are you and Fanlv these days.

429
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,800
We are fine.

430
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:15,839
Why?

431
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,640
Is Fanlv unhappy?

432
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:18,839
It's not like that.

433
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm just wondering

434
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,479
if there's any misunderstanding
between you two.

435
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,319
Misunderstanding?

436
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,959
No.

437
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,920
Then that's good.

438
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:32,319
Yuzheng, Fanlv has been spoiled by me
since she was young,

439
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,079
and she's very stubborn.

440
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,560
Please look after her.

441
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:39,079
Dad, who are you defending now?

442
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,959
Uncle Jiang, is Fanlv next to you?

443
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,040
How about letting me talk to her?

444
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,640
Fanlv, Yuzheng wants to talk to you.

445
00:25:56,479 --> 00:25:58,680
Fanlv, how about this?

446
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
Let's have a talk tonight somewhere.

447
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,239
OK. See you tonight.

448
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
Dad, Yuzheng wants to see me tonight.

449
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,239
Look at you. Losing your temper
and suddenly acting so happy.

450
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Crazy girl.

451
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,599
Only Yuzheng can make you normal.

452
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,400
If you ignore my phone call again,

453
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I will call 110,

454
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
and tell them that you are missing.

455
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,319
Fanlv,

456
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,640
we grew up together.

457
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,839
I know your temper well,

458
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,160
but you shouldn't
treat other people like that.

459
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:00,839
Why did you have to embarrass her
in front of everyone?

460
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,479
Yuzheng,

461
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,959
you took me out so that

462
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,359
you can talk for Du Xiaosu?

463
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,319
Why is she so attractive

464
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,439
making you save her over and over again?

465
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,719
Why did you talk like that?

466
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,280
Given what happened the other day,

467
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:20,520
I had no choice
but to control the situation.

468
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,319
The one and only boss of Yutian

469
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:25,040
disappeared with a no-class employee

470
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,319
in front of all the staff.

471
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,680
How were you trying to
control the situation?

472
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,839
Fanlv!

473
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,719
Yuzheng,

474
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,239
do you know how happy I am

475
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,599
when you wanted to see me?

476
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,839
This is our first date in private

477
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:43,119
ever since I came back from abroad.

478
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,959
Actually, there's something that I have

479
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:56,239
always wanted to ask you.

480
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,640
Do you want to know my answer?

481
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Of course.

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,520
You have already hidden for so long.

483
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,800
I think it may be better
if you don't ask.

484
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,520
What do you mean?

485
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,359
I'm afraid that if you do,

486
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,119
not only can you get the answer you want,

487
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,479
but also hurt yourself.

488
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,239
But today I have to give it a try.

489
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,439
I don't want to hide it anymore,

490
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,839
and I have 50/50 chance

491
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,199
that I can get the answer I want.

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,079
Yuzheng,

493
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,439
do you like me?

494
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:01,719
Yuzheng,

495
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
do you like me?

496
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,439
Of course I do,

497
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,119
but it has nothing to do with love.

498
00:29:17,719 --> 00:29:18,599
I don't believe it.

499
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,359
How could you never
have any feeling about me?

500
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,439
We grew up together

501
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,959
and I remember every single thing

502
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,560
that you did for me.

503
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,359
But you are saying
it has nothing to do with love.

504
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,000
How do you want me to believe it?

505
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:37,680
Fanlv,

506
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,079
we did grow up together

507
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:44,000
and my care for you is real.

508
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,920
But just because of that,

509
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,839
I've always thought about you

510
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,359
as my little sister.

511
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
This would never change.

512
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,680
Who is it?

513
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,520
It's me. The apartment owner.

514
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,839
Hi.

515
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,719
Mr. Li.

516
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,040
I just passed by

517
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,160
and thought that I could visit you.

518
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,199
Mr. Li, I think that people should

519
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,719
keep their words.

520
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,800
Last time you told us that you would

521
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,479
give us half a month.

522
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:47,520
The lease ends next week.

523
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,640
It's not like what you think.

524
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,719
I'm not here to ask you to move out.

525
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,800
First of all, I want to apologize.

526
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,000
We had many misunderstandings
and you must be upset.

527
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,199
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

528
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:01,400
Also, I want to ask that

529
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,079
if you are still willing to live here.

530
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:06,359
What do you mean?

531
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,319
We can continue to live here?

532
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,719
Yes.

533
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,760
I like it that you two live in here.

534
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,199
You are both clean.

535
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,479
Every time I come here,

536
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,239
I see everything organized well,

537
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,199
and you always pay rent on time.

538
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,560
So,

539
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,880
if you two can forgive me

540
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,719
and want to keep living here,

541
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,800
I would love to keep the place for you.

542
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,239
That's great! Thank you, Mr. Li.

543
00:31:29,959 --> 00:31:31,839
You have been so anxious

544
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,319
to send us away.

545
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,599
Exactly.

546
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,760
Why are you being so nice suddenly?

547
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,719
You are not getting a divorce?

548
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,079
Why would I get a divorce?

549
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:43,040
Now new policies are published
regarding purchase restriction.

550
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,680
I figured that it's better
to be steadfast and collect rent.

551
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,880
Having such a life isn't bad.

552
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,599
I've told you that.

553
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,680
If the divorce becomes real,

554
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,079
this apartment would've gone.

555
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,359
You won't even have a place to cry in.

556
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,040
Stop it.

557
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,319
Mr. Li, you made a right choice.

558
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:57,880
Back to what we were talking about.

559
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,439
Are you going to
keep renting this place?

560
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,760
Yes, we are.

561
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,880
We can sign the contract right away.

562
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,640
You can't regret this time. Come on.

563
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,760
OK.

564
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Come in, please.

565
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,640
Xiaosu, here you are.
Please have a seat.

566
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,640
Miss Jiang,
I heard that you looked for me.

567
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:20,920
Take a seat.

568
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,160
Xiaosu,

569
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,959
do you prefer Blue Mountain

570
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,280
or Mandheling for coffee?

571
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:31,479
Or some tea?

572
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,959
It's afternoon tea time.

573
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,599
I'm fine, Miss Jiang.

574
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,160
Don't be so polite.

575
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:38,640
You shall try the tea I made myself.

576
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,760
Have a seat, Xiaosu.
Make yourself at home.

577
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,319
Would you like some milk in it?

578
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
No, thanks.

579
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,920
Xiaosu, I was wrong before.

580
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,280
I apologize for what I did at the party.

581
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,479
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,160
It's fine. The past belongs to the past.

583
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,560
Here.

584
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,560
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

585
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:25,920
How is it?

586
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,680
It's good.

587
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,599
Xiaosu, from today on,

588
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,520
we are good friends.

589
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,640
If you like the tea I make,

590
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,760
please let me know.

591
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,959
If you have anything
on your mind in the future,

592
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,199
you can tell me about it.

593
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,640
What do you think?

594
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,079
Does it make you feel uncomfortable

595
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,959
if I talk to you like this?

596
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,680
Xiaosu, do you know that

597
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,920
I was actually very upset

598
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:04,160
when you were

599
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,560
dancing with Yuzheng.

600
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,399
I grew up together with him.

601
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,679
Do you know how much I love him?

602
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:17,040
Ever since the day

603
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,719
I knew what love was,

604
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,159
everything I did was all for

605
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:25,520
marrying him one day.

606
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,760
Although I know nothing

607
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,560
about construction design,

608
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,399
I still decided to come to Boyuan

609
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,159
and persisted all the way here

610
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,719
where I give you orders.

611
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,959
Xiaosu, do you know that

612
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,800
although I look tough,

613
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,719
deep inside, I'm very weak and soft.

614
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,560
Since I was a kid, I have cried

615
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,320
numerous times for Yuzheng.

616
00:34:57,639 --> 00:34:59,320
And I can't even count
how many times I cried.

617
00:35:00,919 --> 00:35:03,760
Miss Jiang, I think that
you might misunderstand something.

618
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,760
Inside my heart,

619
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
Zhenrong is still alive.

620
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,360
About how you feel about Mr. Lei,

621
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,760
I can't know it better.

622
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,280
Everyone has different ways to love,

623
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,360
but there's something in common.

624
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,879
As long as it has rooted in your heart,

625
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:25,600
it becomes everything you live for.

626
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:28,840
Please believe that

627
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,679
the person who I love is Zhenrong.

628
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,239
Mr. Ning.

629
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,199
Xiaosu,

630
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,420
(Resignation Letter)

631
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,679
what happened?

632
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,639
Do you have any difficulties?

633
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,280
If you have any concerns about salary,

634
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,520
I can help you discuss with the company.

635
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,280
Mr. Ning, it's not like that.

636
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm very thankful for

637
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,000
all your help and support.

638
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,120
I'm just exhausted

639
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,800
and want to have a rest.

640
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,840
How about this, Xiaosu?

641
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,159
I will keep your
resignation letter for now.

642
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,479
If you are tired,

643
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,760
you can go have a vacation,

644
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,760
and we can
talk about this later, alright?

645
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,239
OK.

646
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,320
I will see myself out.

647
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,520
When am I coming back?

648
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,399
It depends. I have resigned anyway.

649
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,919
Oh,

650
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:36,120
don't tell anyone about it.

651
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,840
Especially,

652
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,439
Lei Yuzheng

653
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,959
and He Qunfei.

654
00:37:46,399 --> 00:37:48,080
Talk to you later. Bye.

655
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,560
Fanlv, are you coming back for meal?

656
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,159
About Fanlv,

657
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,800
I don't know what happened to her.

658
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,399
She comes back very late every night,

659
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,879
and mostly drunk.

660
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:28,639
Xiangyuan, do you know what happened?

661
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,639
Not really.

662
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:31,919
But don't worry.

663
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,239
I will talk to her.

664
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,600
Mr. Lei, Du Xiaosu has resigned.

665
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,879
She suddenly handed me
a resignation letter.

666
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,239
Why have you been so nice to me?

667
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,040
Why did you return me the apartment?

668
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Why did you comfort me

669
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,399
when we were on the island?

670
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
Why did you take me to the place

671
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,360
where you used to hang out
when you were kids

672
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,879
and tell me all those things?

673
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:17,280
I don't know
who you have fallen in love with

674
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,520
or who you ever believed in.

675
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,399
Lin Xiangyuan,

676
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,840
come, drink with me.

677
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:00,600
What are you doing? Come here.

678
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,439
It's not safe for you

679
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:17,120
to drink this much at night.

680
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,679
Stop drinking.

681
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,719
Stop drinking.

682
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
I will drink for you.

683
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,679
