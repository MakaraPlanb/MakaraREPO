16
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:33,759
Dad.

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,639
Are you busy?

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,720
Yes.

19
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,520
Mr. Lei is back.
I am preparing some materials for him.

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,320
You are very thoughtful.
You are also difficult.

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,800
Dad, I have to take care of Fanlv now.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
So, about my work,

23
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,279
I don't have enough time for it.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,759
After now, Yutian is managed by Mr. Lei.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,559
Don't worry.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Just let it out and let it in.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,320
Xiangyuan,
I have something to discuss with you.

28
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:08,679
About the company?

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,600
No, about our family.

30
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:13,119
Come.

31
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:23,880
I want to transfer my shares to you now.

32
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,479
Dad.

33
00:02:32,839 --> 00:02:34,479
The divorce didn't work out that day.

34
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,600
That is not my thought.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,160
I didn't force her to do anything.

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
I know.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,839
Fanlv has told me everything.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,720
If I don't divorce with Lin Xiangyuan,

39
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,119
is it possible to transfer our shares

40
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:50,520
to him?

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Daughter, this is a big deal.

42
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,520
You have to think it over.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,119
I'm not asking you to do it now.

44
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,240
I am thinking about,

45
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,000
if he has got the shares,

46
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,119
he will feel reassured.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,639
He will feel that we treat him
as our real family member.

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,399
Xiangyuan.

49
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,520
The doctor has told me everything.

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,479
You don't have to keep it from me.

51
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:25,039
She was actually very sick.

52
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,399
She got better so soon,

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,479
thanks to you.

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,720
During this period,

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,919
you've been working hard.

56
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,079
I used to watch out for you.
It is my fault.

57
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,279
During this period,

58
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,279
I've been thinking a lot.

59
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,959
Fanlv is right.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,679
Money comes and goes.

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,920
We are a family.

62
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,000
No matter you are divorced or not,

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,160
these shares are yours.

64
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:09,880
Dad.

65
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,239
Xiangyuan,

66
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,959
it is not easy for you
to fight for your career outside.

67
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
By giving you these shares,

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,720
I want nothing from you.

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,160
I just hope that you can have strong position
in the company,

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,760
so that you can apply your talents.

71
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:32,600
This is what you deserve.

72
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,040
(Miss Xu You,)

73
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,720
(you were photographed
not coming home that night.)

74
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,760
(Anything good to announce?)

75
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,920
(If I can meet the right person
at a right time)

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,799
(and have future plan,)

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,880
(I will definitely let you know
as soon as possible.)

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
(Is Lei Yuzheng your boyfriend?)

79
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,200
(Please answer.)

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
(Please answer.)

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
(When did you get together?)

82
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,600
(When will you get married?)

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,079
(Please answer.)

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,239
Your medicine.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
Thank you.

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,279
Qunfei.

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,839
Please give Siqi a call.

88
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,040
I call her?

89
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:56,880
I don't want to get scolded.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Please ask her

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,519
how Du Xiaosu is.

92
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,239
Ok.

93
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,392
(Zou Siqi)

94
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Nobody answered.

95
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:26,504
(Du Xiaosu)

96
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,679
Excuse me.

97
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,519
The patient in this room,

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,519
how is she?

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,880
The flu causes an inflection
in her lungs.

100
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,079
She has a serious fever

101
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,079
and dehydration.

102
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,720
When she goes home,
let her have a good rest

103
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,119
and not get too tired.

104
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,920
Mr. Lin,

105
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,320
Hengshan Fund seems to have a sure bet
this time.

106
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,359
We've been working on "the plan"
for a long time,

107
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,440
is it time to make a "profit"?

108
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,160
Mr. Lin,

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,959
you have so many shares.

110
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,799
If you work with majority shareholder

111
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:51,679
and vote for Hengshan Fund,

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,440
we will...

113
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:02,760
Go. Take it to Mr. Lei.

114
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,479
Mr. Lin, why?

115
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:15,320
This is what we've worked hard for.

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,679
As soon as Lei Yuzheng is back,

117
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,479
you give it to him and give up?

118
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,119
It's not like you.

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,880
Xie Li, let me tell you.

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,679
Though I have shares of Yutian,

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,799
Yutian is neither mine

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
nor yours.

123
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,440
I have no idea what you mean
by "profit" and "plan".

124
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,719
I can't understand either.

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,119
I have nothing to do with Hengshan Fund.

126
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:46,919
I have no right to get involved,

127
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,640
and neither do you.

128
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,280
I've finished.

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,080
Go out.

130
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,080
Lei Yuzheng.

131
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:09,719
Lei Yuzheng.

132
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
Please, don't leave.

133
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,520
Xiaosu, you're awake.

134
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
Mr. Liu.

135
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,320
How come it's you?

136
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
I heard that you were sick.

137
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,799
So, I came to see you at once.

138
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,760
You worked too hard.

139
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,880
Let me help you.

140
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:26,520
I'm really sorry.

141
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,559
You are also quite busy,

142
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,840
and I'm bothering you.

143
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Don't say that. We are home fellows.

144
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,239
Let me take your temperature.

145
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,520
All good.

146
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,479
Go home and have a good rest.

147
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,799
Don't get too tired.

148
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,919
Ok.

149
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,239
Nurse.

150
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,599
I wonder if I can

151
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,359
go through the discharge formalities.

152
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,239
Yes.

153
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,239
Let your boyfriend settle the bill,

154
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,960
and then you can go.

155
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,159
Let me do it.

156
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,200
Stay.

157
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,119
You're afraid that
I will pay for the bill for you?

158
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,840
You can return the money to me later.

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Thank you.

160
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,159
You boyfriend is so nice.

161
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,640
He took care of you all night yesterday.

162
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,559
Yuzheng.

163
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:28,880
What is S.G.'s opinion?

164
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,440
They are still
performing the assessment.

165
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,719
They let us
wait for further information.

166
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:36,919
Yuzheng.

167
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:38,880
Within such a short time,

168
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,520
how come the price of Yutian's share
has raised a lot?

169
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,559
Obviously,

170
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
Hengshan Fund
is absorbing and raising money.

171
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,119
Someone buys in,
then someone should sell.

172
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,440
This is how the stock market works.

173
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,520
No one wants to pass up the opportunity
to make a profit.

174
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,039
How do the majority shareholders react?

175
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,880
They all can't wait.

176
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,719
Some of them began to sell their shares.

177
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,520
Now, what I'm most worried about is

178
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:00,320
the reaction of S.G.

179
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:05,520
Call from S.G.

180
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:09,359
Hey, Linton.

181
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,719
Yuzheng.

182
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,520
For our beautiful "date",

183
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,359
only Mr. Liu came?

184
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,400
Have you met him?

185
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,640
Of course.

186
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,039
Mr. Liu is a tough guy.

187
00:13:20,239 --> 00:13:21,840
His capacity for liquor
and his courage were wonderful.

188
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,520
I'm afraid that,
to do business with you in future

189
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,599
should be not easy.

190
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
You are teating me as a stranger.

191
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:27,599
Next time,

192
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,559
I'll fly over to make an apology
to you.

193
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,280
Yuzheng.

194
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,400
I know the situation of Yutian.

195
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,479
What do you think?

196
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:37,559
Yuzheng.

197
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,200
I have to tell you.

198
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,880
At the same time
that Mr. Liu arrived in S.G.,

199
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,119
the representative of Hengshan Fund
abroad also arrived.

200
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,719
The board is still evaluating.

201
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,599
There will be an answer tonight.

202
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
You also understand
"the law of the jungle" in business.

203
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,200
The weak one is never welcomed.

204
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,359
So, let me tell you in advance that,

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,239
if the result is not good for Yutian,

206
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,719
there is nothing I can do.

207
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,359
An old Chinese saying:

208
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,080
willing to help but unable to do so.

209
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,239
Linton,

210
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,640
your Chinese is much better.

211
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,119
Ok, I can understand.

212
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,799
But there is also
another Chinese saying:

213
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,080
friendship can be established
even the business fails.

214
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,080
I hope you won't

215
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,520
do something like kicking people
when they are down.

216
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,479
Yuzheng, how is it?

217
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,719
What's the attitude at S.G.?

218
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,320
Uncle Jiang, what we can do now

219
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,799
is to assemble all forces

220
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,679
and inform
those majority and minority shareholders

221
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,159
to hold tightly

222
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,960
their shares.

223
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,200
Speaking of shareholders,

224
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:38,119
Yuzheng,

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,840
there's something I have to tell you.

226
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,119
I have given the joint shares
of Lin Xiangyuan

227
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,919
and Fanlv

228
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,000
to Lin Xiangyuan.

229
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,400
Fanlv gets depressed
after she lost her child.

230
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,400
It is Xiangyuan who has been with her.

231
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,119
I believe that

232
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,280
he is not the same as before.

233
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,000
I also believe that you can forgive him.

234
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,520
Ok.

235
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,799
Uncle Jiang,

236
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,400
I respect your decision.

237
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,599
Thank you.

238
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,336
(Memory Corrosion)

239
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,000
Yuzheng, what are you doing here?

240
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,400
Have a seat please.

241
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,799
Sit, please.

242
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,039
I just got back from a business trip

243
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,400
and heard everything about you.

244
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,799
I came here just to see you.

245
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,559
Feeling better?

246
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,559
I'm good.

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,799
That's good.

248
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,880
Are you reading?

249
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm looking at the photos.

250
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,679
What kind of photos?

251
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,400
You were only ten at that time.

252
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,840
In my heart,

253
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,760
you will always be the same as
when you were ten.

254
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:29,959
But, Fanlv,

255
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,880
everyone has to grow up

256
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,239
and go through something.

257
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,800
No matter what,

258
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,640
you are always my lovely sister
in my heart.

259
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,199
No matter where I am,

260
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:42,839
if you need me,

261
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,640
I will definitely be with you.

262
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,439
Yuzheng,

263
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,439
even if you just want to
make me feel comfortable

264
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
and say that,

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,760
I'd like to believe it's true.

266
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,479
It is true.

267
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,760
Seeing you like this,

268
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,439
I'm relieved.

269
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,439
On the way here, I was thinking that

270
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
you have to get better.

271
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,000
You

272
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,280
should not care about me right now.

273
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,640
You have to care about Du Xiaosu.

274
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,079
I saw a photo of you and Xu You
on the Internet.

275
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,199
Are you really seeing each other?

276
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,680
On that night,

277
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,079
you were with Xu You.

278
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,880
I saw Du Xiaosu was really sad.

279
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,479
You must have really hurt her.

280
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,880
So,

281
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,800
to be my lady is hard.

282
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,839
Tell me about it.

283
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:41,119
How is it going, you and Du Xiaosu?

284
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,000
Ok, fine.

285
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,800
Save the time to question me next time.

286
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,160
I'm relieved to see you
getting better now.

287
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,319
I'll come again in a couple of days.

288
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:52,280
I have to go.

289
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,319
Yuzheng.

290
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,599
Can I hug you
like I did when we were kids?

291
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,640
There is something

292
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:16,359
that I finally got,

293
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,920
but the price is too high.

294
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,239
I wish you wouldn't be the same as me.

295
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:10,119
Kai, is it ok?

296
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,199
He can't get away from us.

297
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,119
Handsome!

298
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,359
Why are you here drinking by yourself?

299
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,839
Do you have something in your mind?

300
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,160
Would you want me to chat with you?

301
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,839
Since our meeting is fate,

302
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,839
would you like a dance?

303
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,520
Of course.

304
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,359
Who are you? What's wrong with you?

305
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,160
Who are you? How dare you touch my wife?

306
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,439
You wanna go to hell?

307
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,199
You wanna die?

308
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,079
What happened, Kai?

309
00:20:14,239 --> 00:20:15,319
Why are you fighting?

310
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,319
Ye,

311
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
this guy was bullying my wife.

312
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,719
I wasn't.

313
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,000
She volunteered.

314
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:22,760
You…

315
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,359
Take it easy. Take it easy.

316
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,920
We are buddies. We can't go so far.

317
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,520
We come here for fun, right?

318
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,160
Kai, don't do that

319
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
for my sake.

320
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,640
You leave with your wife first.

321
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll pay the bill today.

322
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,839
I'll treat you to dinner
some other time.

323
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
Ok. For Ye's sake,

324
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,599
I'll let you off this time.

325
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,839
Don't let me see you again.

326
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,920
Go.

327
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:46,680
Don't leave!

328
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,040
Buddy, this is your fault.

329
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,959
Take it easy. Take it easy.

330
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,319
Ladies! Come on! Dance!

331
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,520
Have fun!

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,920
Buddy.

333
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,079
A toast to you.

334
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Thanks for helping me out today.

335
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:08,760
We are friends now.

336
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,479
Isn't it just a little thing
between men and women?

337
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,400
I can understand.

338
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,920
Buddy, I have to say.

339
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:18,359
Today,

340
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,719
you owe me one.

341
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:22,880
No problem.

342
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
From now on, if I can be of any help,

343
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,920
just tell me.

344
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:29,760
Cheers.

345
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,319
Ye?

346
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:33,079
You are a man of righteousness!

347
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,359
One more.

348
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,920
Cheers.

349
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:37,959
Cheers.

350
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:43,160
Buddy.

351
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:47,319
I have been fighting against injustice
all my life.

352
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,160
About what happened today,

353
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,479
never mind.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,680
I help you today,

355
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,400
and maybe someday I'll need your help.

356
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
Buddy.

357
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,800
Did you know me before?

358
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,040
I knew you?

359
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,640
Let me tell you.

360
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:17,359
I've been doing business
in Southeast Asia for years.

361
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,040
I just came back this year.

362
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,439
I've been speaking Vietnamese

363
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,760
for longer than speaking Chinese.

364
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,160
If you insisted that I knew you,

365
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,839
you must have been to Vietnam.

366
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,239
Vietnam?

367
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:35,359
You don't believe me?

368
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,439
Should I

369
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
talk to you in Vietnamese?

370
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:50,760
Buddy. Just joking.

371
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,160
Look at you.

372
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,959
How come I don't believe you?

373
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:56,959
Come on! Cheers!

374
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:58,079
Look at you!

375
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,560
I don't know what you do,

376
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,719
but I do know that you must be somebody!

377
00:24:12,959 --> 00:24:14,520
Somebody?

378
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm going to be an outcast.

379
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:19,599
You know what? People like you
all have a shortage.

380
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:20,959
Shortage?

381
00:24:21,239 --> 00:24:22,439
With too strong ability,

382
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,439
you easily overshadow your higher-ups.

383
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,079
Am I correct?

384
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,199
I'm correct, right?

385
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,520
Now your boss

386
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,319
doesn't like you. I'm sure about that.

387
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,800
You're right.

388
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,739
(Lei Yuzheng)

389
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,520
I have been following him

390
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,839
and working for him for a long time.

391
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,560
When it was time to get the profit,

392
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
he suddenly stopped.

393
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
He doesn't listen to me.

394
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,119
I can't understand.

395
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,199
Buddy, I can't understand.

396
00:25:04,776 --> 00:25:05,480
(Xu You's calling)

397
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,079
Xu You.

398
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,079
Yuzheng.

399
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,199
You didn't even tell me
when you came back?

400
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,439
You've been busy dealing with
the reporters all day.

401
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,000
I don't want to bother you.

402
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,239
Are you angry?

403
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,079
Why?

404
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,560
For what happened last time,

405
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,319
I'm still looking for a chance
to thank you.

406
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,599
You don't have to look for a chance.

407
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,199
If you want to thank me,
why don't you come to me now?

408
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:39,920
Here.

409
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,439
You usually take a private room.

410
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:49,839
Why did you decide to sit outside today?

411
00:25:50,479 --> 00:25:51,760
Even for a dinner,
I have to avoid people.

412
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm tired of that.

413
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,000
Aren't you afraid of being photographed?

414
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,239
Are you afraid?

415
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:59,040
What have I to be afraid of?

416
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,599
I'm not a super star
and I don't have fans.

417
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,719
I'm just afraid that
you don't feel comfortable.

418
00:26:04,199 --> 00:26:05,199
I have to say.

419
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,959
Now, the domestic entertainment industry
is not what it used to be.

420
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:10,560
A small thing

421
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,400
can make a big splash.

422
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,119
Good.

423
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:16,520
To experience a big splash with Mr. Lei

424
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,839
is what I really want.

425
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,880
I hope they pay attention to me.

426
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
So, I can be in the news more often.

427
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:23,800
Ok then,

428
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
if you insist.

429
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
Try it.

430
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:30,359
Thank you.

431
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,520
You don't like it?

432
00:26:38,439 --> 00:26:39,199
No.

433
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,520
I like here.

434
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,520
It is not because of the food here,

435
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:44,880
but the feeling here.

436
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,439
I don't need to hide,

437
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,839
and I can sit here with you

438
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,760
to have a dinner.

439
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,839
I've been thinking about
this kind of life for a long time.

440
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,280
Xu You.

441
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:55,599
I'm sorry

442
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
to cause you trouble.

443
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,199
If you want to be so polite to me,

444
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:02,040
I'll be polite to you as well.

445
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,199
You did cause me some troubles.

446
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,400
Big troubles.

447
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:09,400
An actress has to be mysterious,

448
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:11,119
so that more people can pay attention.

449
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,839
Once she's photographed being
accompanied by a man,

450
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,959
I'm afraid no one wants her
to act as a dream lover again.

451
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,199
Xu You, I'm really...

452
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,400
Save it.

453
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I was expecting all of that.

454
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,199
But I'd like to perform it with you.

455
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,199
I've performed so many roles.

456
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,479
But I've never performed myself.

457
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,079
The longer I perform that I love you,

458
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,880
the more difficult for me
to get out of it.

459
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,479
I'm not going to lie to you.

460
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,719
Because of

461
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:46,880
Du Xiaosu, right?

462
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:51,439
You are pretty sure
that you love her in your heart.

463
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,280
But why are you so cool toward her?

464
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,119
You're not protecting her.
You're hurting her,

465
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,400
and making her feel painful.

466
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,800
Xu You.

467
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Excuse me.

468
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I think I need to calm myself down.

469
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,280
Mr. Lin, wait, please.

470
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,079
I've read all the materials you gave me.

471
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,839
It is helpful.

472
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,640
Thank you.

473
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:38,959
You're welcome.

474
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,000
That's my job.

475
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,880
About transferring shares to you,

476
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,160
Uncle Jiang has told me.

477
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,239
What do you mean?

478
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,439
Are you trying
to remind me of something?

479
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,839
You took me wrong.

480
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,760
I just want to

481
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,839
congratulate you.

482
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,079
Congratulate me?

483
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,160
Congratulations
on becoming a shareholder of Yutian.

484
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,880
I've been waiting for a long time.

485
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,079
Now I got it.

486
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,400
I got a big chunk of shares.

487
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,520
Now, I can also have a say in Yutian.

488
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:15,839
These were all that

489
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,640
I had been dreaming of.

490
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,880
I thought I would be happy,

491
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,439
but I am not.

492
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,560
Because that's not what I really want.

493
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,479
So, what exactly do you want?

494
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,760
I just want to know

495
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,719
what the gap is between us.

496
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,359
Just let it be.

497
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,719
You can't give me the answer.

498
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,119
Because I don't think

499
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,680
you are that noble and upright.

500
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,199
Because you're my kind.

501
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,479
Lin Xiangyuan.

502
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,719
Did I hear it wrongly?

503
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:56,079
You said we were the same kind?

504
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,239
I thought you were a true man.

505
00:29:58,479 --> 00:29:59,079
I thought

506
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:00,839
you would cherish it more than I do.

507
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,079
However,

508
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,439
you chose to run away.

509
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,920
You don't even
have the courage to face it.

510
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,319
Am I right?

511
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,160
Lin Xiangyuan.

512
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,040
What's up?

513
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,239
Nothing.

514
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,599
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

515
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,040
So, I drop by to see you.

516
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,959
How are you these days?

517
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,439
Quite good.

518
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,880
I heard from Qunfei recently

519
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,959
about Miss Jiang.

520
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:11,000
How is she? Is she ok?

521
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:13,479
She is quite good.

522
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,040
I go shopping with her when I'm free.

523
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,199
Chat with her.

524
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,199
Though she hasn't recovered,

525
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,280
she is much better than before.

526
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:23,199
I'm here today,

527
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,199
because I want to say something to you.

528
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,479
In my heart,

529
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,640
you are always a strong girl,

530
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,640
whether in love or in business.

531
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,800
You've learned to heal yourself

532
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:38,560
and overcome it.

533
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,079
Am I?

534
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,160
I didn't even see it by myself that

535
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,880
I am so strong.

536
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,599
I think I need to

537
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,199
look at myself again.

538
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,920
It' true. I'm telling you the truth.

539
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:56,880
I know that over the years

540
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,760
you have had something against me.

541
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
But I never blamed you.

542
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,280
Because it was my fault.

543
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,520
Actually, Fanlv is right.

544
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,199
I was always
mindful of personal gains and losses.

545
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,719
Lin Xiangyuan.

546
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:11,920
If that's what you're here

547
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
to tell me,

548
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,079
would you please...

549
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:16,160
Xiaosu.

550
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
Please let me finish.

551
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:21,439
After I've been through this with Fanlv,

552
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,560
it seems
I've understood something better.

553
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,880
There is something
that cannot be forced.

554
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,160
There is something
that you should fight for.

555
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,680
There is also something

556
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:35,959
that you have to insist on.

557
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,479
What are you trying to tell me?

558
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,239
I know I made a lot of mistakes,

559
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,719
especially
what I have done to Lei Yuzheng.

560
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:48,959
Lei Yuzheng…

561
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Excuse me.

562
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,599
If you come to me today

563
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,520
just to tell me about him,

564
00:32:54,719 --> 00:32:55,479
save it.

565
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,560
And I have something to do.

566
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,560
I have to go.

567
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,160
If you don't want me to mention him,
I will not mention him.

568
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,439
Then,

569
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,680
let's talk about us.

570
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,640
Us?

571
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,040
Xiaosu.

572
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,560
From today, I hope to

573
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,319
give you a chance
to get to know me again.

574
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,599
Don't get me wrong.

575
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm not going to push you.

576
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,839
I am thinking that

577
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:27,280
we are still friends.

578
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,119
After what we have gone through,

579
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,520
can we still be friends?

580
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,000
That's exactly the reason

581
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,239
why we can be friends.

582
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,479
What kind of friends?

583
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,840
Less than lovers and more than friends.

584
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,439
We are confidants.

585
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,320
I am not pushing you.

586
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:57,719
You have time to think about it.

587
00:33:58,679 --> 00:33:59,919
I also give myself time

588
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
to test myself.

589
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,239
Ok, I agree.

590
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,040
Friends.

591
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,600
Don't you have something to do?

592
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,840
Would you
give me a chance to give you a drive?

593
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,679
Ok.

594
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,000
Let me check what the time is.

595
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,080
May 17 to

596
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:39,399
May 11 in 2019.

597
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,560
Yes, that's OK.

598
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,280
Regarding the position,

599
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,439
please wait.

600
00:34:48,959 --> 00:34:50,199
If there is any question,

601
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,639
you can communicate with me in time.

602
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,080
I don't think

603
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,959
there is much of a problem.

604
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,439
If any adjustment needed,

605
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,280
just feel free to contact me.

606
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,040
Ok.

607
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,159
Thank you for your support and trust.

608
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,760
You can rest assured that I will do it

609
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,560
very well.

610
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,239
Ok.

611
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,879
We have to go. Bye.

612
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:05,600
-Ok.
-Ok.

613
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,320
Bye. Bye.

614
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,159
We have to go.

615
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,040
Waitress.

616
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:11,840
Check, please.

617
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,479
Miss, a gentleman over there

618
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,600
paid for it just now.

619
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,600
What are you looking at?

620
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,719
Nothing.

621
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,479
I always feel that
there is someone following me.

622
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,360
Oh my god.

623
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,679
Don't scare me! In broad daylight,

624
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,679
someone can follow you?

625
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,320
I really feel that
someone is following me all the time.

626
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,560
Dear, don't you have persecutory delusion?

627
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,280
Just joking!

628
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,439
Get your head out of the clouds.
Let's go.

629
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,080
I really feel that
someone is following me all the time.

630
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,320
Xiaosu.

631
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,000
Why aren't you eating?

632
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,679
Are you worried about something?

633
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:28,479
Nothing.

634
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:29,800
Nothing.

635
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,239
You don't have to tell me.
I know already.

636
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,639
It is because of your boyfriend, right?

637
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,040
Fight?

638
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,040
Fight…

639
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,919
We just don't
even have a chance to fight.

640
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,239
He disappeared.

641
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,199
He is completely out of my life.

642
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:52,360
Disappear?

643
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,600
No contact at all?

644
00:36:58,479 --> 00:36:59,520
No.

645
00:37:00,959 --> 00:37:03,520
I always feel that he is by my side.

646
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:07,199
But I'm afraid that

647
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,000
it is just my illusion.

648
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,479
Although I don't know
who your boyfriend is,

649
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:18,239
I think he must have troubles

650
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,399
and is forced to part with you.

651
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:24,280
So, he can only choose
this kind of particular way

652
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,439
to care about you and protect you.

653
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,040
No matter what,

654
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,080
I believe him.

655
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,600
No matter what happens,

656
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,040
I'm willing to believe him.

657
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,040
You love your boyfriend very much,
don't you?

658
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,959
Love is quite strange.

659
00:37:48,879 --> 00:37:50,199
In the beginning, you care about everything,

660
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,159
but in the end,

661
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:54,919
you can forgive anything.

662
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,080
I am really afraid that

663
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:59,080
my insistence

664
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,159
will be defeated by time.

665
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,840
I don't know how long

666
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:05,879
will this kind of life last.

667
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,399
I'm sorry, Xiaosu.

668
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,199
There's something
I shouldn't have kept from you.

669
00:38:14,879 --> 00:38:17,639
I don't take you as

670
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,000
a sister only.

671
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,919
I also like you.

672
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,719
How can I not be tempted

673
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,120
by a girl like you?

674
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,679
How can I not care about you?

675
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,080
I want to apologize that

676
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,639
it wasn't me who was with you
at the hospital that night.

677
00:38:38,879 --> 00:38:41,919
I think, it might be him.
