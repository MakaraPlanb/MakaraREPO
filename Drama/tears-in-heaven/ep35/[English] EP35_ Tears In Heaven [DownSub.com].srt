00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,759
Dad.

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,639
Are you busy?

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,720
Yes.

19
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,520
Mr. Lei is back.
I am preparing some materials for him.

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,320
You are very thoughtful.
You are also difficult.

21
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,800
Dad, I have to take care of Fanlv now.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
So, about my work,

23
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,279
I don't have enough time for it.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,759
After now, Yutian is managed by Mr. Lei.

25
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,559
Don't worry.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Just let it out and let it in.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,320
Xiangyuan,
I have something to discuss with you.

28
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:43,679
About the company?

29
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,600
No, about our family.

30
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:48,119
Come.

31
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:58,880
I want to transfer my shares to you now.

32
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,479
Dad.

33
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,479
The divorce didn't work out that day.

34
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,600
That is not my thought.

35
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
I didn't force her to do anything.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,440
I know.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,839
Fanlv has told me everything.

38
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,720
If I don't divorce with Lin Xiangyuan,

39
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,119
is it possible to transfer our shares

40
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,520
to him?

41
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,160
Daughter, this is a big deal.

42
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,520
You have to think it over.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,119
I'm not asking you to do it now.

44
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,240
I am thinking about,

45
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:40,000
if he has got the shares,

46
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,119
he will feel reassured.

47
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,639
He will feel that we treat him
as our real family member.

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,399
Xiangyuan.

49
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,520
The doctor has told me everything.

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,479
You don't have to keep it from me.

51
00:03:55,679 --> 00:04:00,039
She was actually very sick.

52
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,399
She got better so soon,

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,479
thanks to you.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
During this period,

55
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,919
you've been working hard.

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,079
I used to watch out for you.
It is my fault.

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,279
During this period,

58
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,279
I've been thinking a lot.

59
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,959
Fanlv is right.

60
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,679
Money comes and goes.

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,920
We are a family.

62
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,000
No matter you are divorced or not,

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,160
these shares are yours.

64
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,880
Dad.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,239
Xiangyuan,

66
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,959
it is not easy for you
to fight for your career outside.

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
By giving you these shares,

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,720
I want nothing from you.

69
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,160
I just hope that you can have strong position
in the company,

70
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,760
so that you can apply your talents.

71
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,600
This is what you deserve.

72
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,040
(Miss Xu You,)

73
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:29,720
(you were photographed
not coming home that night.)

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,760
(Anything good to announce?)

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,920
(If I can meet the right person
at a right time)

76
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,799
(and have future plan,)

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
(I will definitely let you know
as soon as possible.)

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
(Is Lei Yuzheng your boyfriend?)

79
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,200
(Please answer.)

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,320
(Please answer.)

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,600
(When did you get together?)

82
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,600
(When will you get married?)

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,079
(Please answer.)

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,239
Your medicine.

85
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Thank you.

86
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,279
Qunfei.

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,839
Please give Siqi a call.

88
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,040
I call her?

89
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:31,880
I don't want to get scolded.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Please ask her

91
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,519
how Du Xiaosu is.

92
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,239
Ok.

93
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,392
(Zou Siqi)

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,760
Nobody answered.

95
00:07:00,704 --> 00:07:01,504
(Du Xiaosu)

96
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,679
Excuse me.

97
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,519
The patient in this room,

98
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,519
how is she?

99
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,880
The flu causes an inflection
in her lungs.

100
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,079
She has a serious fever

101
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,079
and dehydration.

102
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,720
When she goes home,
let her have a good rest

103
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,119
and not get too tired.

104
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,920
Mr. Lin,

105
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,320
Hengshan Fund seems to have a sure bet
this time.

106
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,359
We've been working on "the plan"
for a long time,

107
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,440
is it time to make a "profit"?

108
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,160
Mr. Lin,

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,959
you have so many shares.

110
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,799
If you work with majority shareholder

111
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,679
and vote for Hengshan Fund,

112
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,440
we will...

113
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,760
Go. Take it to Mr. Lei.

114
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,479
Mr. Lin, why?

115
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,320
This is what we've worked hard for.

116
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,679
As soon as Lei Yuzheng is back,

117
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,479
you give it to him and give up?

118
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,119
It's not like you.

119
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,880
Xie Li, let me tell you.

120
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,679
Though I have shares of Yutian,

121
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,799
Yutian is neither mine

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,320
nor yours.

123
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,440
I have no idea what you mean
by "profit" and "plan".

124
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,719
I can't understand either.

125
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,119
I have nothing to do with Hengshan Fund.

126
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,919
I have no right to get involved,

127
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
and neither do you.

128
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
I've finished.

129
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,080
Go out.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
Lei Yuzheng.

131
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,719
Lei Yuzheng.

132
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
Please, don't leave.

133
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,520
Xiaosu, you're awake.

134
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,520
Mr. Liu.

135
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,320
How come it's you?

136
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,440
I heard that you were sick.

137
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,799
So, I came to see you at once.

138
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,760
You worked too hard.

139
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,880
Let me help you.

140
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm really sorry.

141
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,559
You are also quite busy,

142
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,840
and I'm bothering you.

143
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
Don't say that. We are home fellows.

144
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,239
Let me take your temperature.

145
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:15,520
All good.

146
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:16,479
Go home and have a good rest.

147
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:18,799
Don't get too tired.

148
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,919
Ok.

149
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,239
Nurse.

150
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,599
I wonder if I can

151
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,359
go through the discharge formalities.

152
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,239
Yes.

153
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,239
Let your boyfriend settle the bill,

154
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,960
and then you can go.

155
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,159
Let me do it.

156
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,200
Stay.

157
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,119
You're afraid that
I will pay for the bill for you?

158
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,840
You can return the money to me later.

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,080
Thank you.

160
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,159
You boyfriend is so nice.

161
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,640
He took care of you all night yesterday.

162
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,559
Yuzheng.

163
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,880
What is S.G.'s opinion?

164
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:05,440
They are still
performing the assessment.

165
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,719
They let us
wait for further information.

166
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:11,919
Yuzheng.

167
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:13,880
Within such a short time,

168
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,520
how come the price of Yutian's share
has raised a lot?

169
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,559
Obviously,

170
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,520
Hengshan Fund
is absorbing and raising money.

171
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:21,119
Someone buys in,
then someone should sell.

172
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
This is how the stock market works.

173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,520
No one wants to pass up the opportunity
to make a profit.

174
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,039
How do the majority shareholders react?

175
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,880
They all can't wait.

176
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,719
Some of them began to sell their shares.

177
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,520
Now, what I'm most worried about is

178
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:35,320
the reaction of S.G.

179
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,520
Call from S.G.

180
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,359
Hey, Linton.

181
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,719
Yuzheng.

182
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,520
For our beautiful "date",

183
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,359
only Mr. Liu came?

184
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,400
Have you met him?

185
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,640
Of course.

186
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,039
Mr. Liu is a tough guy.

187
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:56,840
His capacity for liquor
and his courage were wonderful.

188
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm afraid that,
to do business with you in future

189
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,599
should be not easy.

190
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,320
You are teating me as a stranger.

191
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,599
Next time,

192
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,559
I'll fly over to make an apology
to you.

193
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
Yuzheng.

194
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,400
I know the situation of Yutian.

195
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,479
What do you think?

196
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,559
Yuzheng.

197
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,200
I have to tell you.

198
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,880
At the same time
that Mr. Liu arrived in S.G.,

199
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,119
the representative of Hengshan Fund
abroad also arrived.

200
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,719
The board is still evaluating.

201
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,599
There will be an answer tonight.

202
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,640
You also understand
"the law of the jungle" in business.

203
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,200
The weak one is never welcomed.

204
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,359
So, let me tell you in advance that,

205
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,239
if the result is not good for Yutian,

206
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,719
there is nothing I can do.

207
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,359
An old Chinese saying:

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
willing to help but unable to do so.

209
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,239
Linton,

210
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,640
your Chinese is much better.

211
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,119
Ok, I can understand.

212
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,799
But there is also
another Chinese saying:

213
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,080
friendship can be established
even the business fails.

214
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,080
I hope you won't

215
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,520
do something like kicking people
when they are down.

216
00:14:54,479 --> 00:14:55,479
Yuzheng, how is it?

217
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,719
What's the attitude at S.G.?

218
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,320
Uncle Jiang, what we can do now

219
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,799
is to assemble all forces

220
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,679
and inform
those majority and minority shareholders

221
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,159
to hold tightly

222
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:06,960
their shares.

223
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,200
Speaking of shareholders,

224
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:13,119
Yuzheng,

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,840
there's something I have to tell you.

226
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,119
I have given the joint shares
of Lin Xiangyuan

227
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,919
and Fanlv

228
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,000
to Lin Xiangyuan.

229
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,400
Fanlv gets depressed
after she lost her child.

230
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,400
It is Xiangyuan who has been with her.

231
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,119
I believe that

232
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:36,280
he is not the same as before.

233
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,000
I also believe that you can forgive him.

234
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,520
Ok.

235
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:48,799
Uncle Jiang,

236
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,400
I respect your decision.

237
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,599
Thank you.

238
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,336
(Memory Corrosion)

239
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,000
Yuzheng, what are you doing here?

240
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,400
Have a seat please.

241
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,799
Sit, please.

242
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,039
I just got back from a business trip

243
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:29,400
and heard everything about you.

244
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,799
I came here just to see you.

245
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:34,559
Feeling better?

246
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,559
I'm good.

247
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,799
That's good.

248
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,880
Are you reading?

249
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm looking at the photos.

250
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,679
What kind of photos?

251
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,400
You were only ten at that time.

252
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
In my heart,

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,760
you will always be the same as
when you were ten.

254
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:04,959
But, Fanlv,

255
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,880
everyone has to grow up

256
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,239
and go through something.

257
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:10,800
No matter what,

258
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,640
you are always my lovely sister
in my heart.

259
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,199
No matter where I am,

260
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:17,839
if you need me,

261
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,640
I will definitely be with you.

262
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,439
Yuzheng,

263
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,439
even if you just want to
make me feel comfortable

264
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,680
and say that,

265
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,760
I'd like to believe it's true.

266
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:31,479
It is true.

267
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:33,760
Seeing you like this,

268
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,439
I'm relieved.

269
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,439
On the way here, I was thinking that

270
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,880
you have to get better.

271
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,000
You

272
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:44,280
should not care about me right now.

273
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,640
You have to care about Du Xiaosu.

274
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,079
I saw a photo of you and Xu You
on the Internet.

275
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,199
Are you really seeing each other?

276
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
On that night,

277
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,079
you were with Xu You.

278
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,880
I saw Du Xiaosu was really sad.

279
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,479
You must have really hurt her.

280
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:06,880
So,

281
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,800
to be my lady is hard.

282
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,839
Tell me about it.

283
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:16,119
How is it going, you and Du Xiaosu?

284
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:18,000
Ok, fine.

285
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,800
Save the time to question me next time.

286
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,160
I'm relieved to see you
getting better now.

287
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,319
I'll come again in a couple of days.

288
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:27,280
I have to go.

289
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,319
Yuzheng.

290
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,599
Can I hug you
like I did when we were kids?

291
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,640
There is something

292
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,359
that I finally got,

293
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:53,920
but the price is too high.

294
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,239
I wish you wouldn't be the same as me.

295
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:45,119
Kai, is it ok?

296
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,199
He can't get away from us.

297
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,119
Handsome!

298
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,359
Why are you here drinking by yourself?

299
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,839
Do you have something in your mind?

300
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,160
Would you want me to chat with you?

301
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,839
Since our meeting is fate,

302
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:10,839
would you like a dance?

303
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,520
Of course.

304
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,359
Who are you? What's wrong with you?

305
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,160
Who are you? How dare you touch my wife?

306
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,439
You wanna go to hell?

307
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,199
You wanna die?

308
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,079
What happened, Kai?

309
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:50,319
Why are you fighting?

310
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,319
Ye,

311
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,400
this guy was bullying my wife.

312
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,719
I wasn't.

313
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,000
She volunteered.

314
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:57,760
You…

315
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,359
Take it easy. Take it easy.

316
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,920
We are buddies. We can't go so far.

317
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,520
We come here for fun, right?

318
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,160
Kai, don't do that

319
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,560
for my sake.

320
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
You leave with your wife first.

321
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll pay the bill today.

322
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,839
I'll treat you to dinner
some other time.

323
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,000
Ok. For Ye's sake,

324
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,599
I'll let you off this time.

325
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,839
Don't let me see you again.

326
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,920
Go.

327
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:21,680
Don't leave!

328
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,040
Buddy, this is your fault.

329
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,959
Take it easy. Take it easy.

330
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,319
Ladies! Come on! Dance!

331
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,520
Have fun!

332
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
Buddy.

333
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,079
A toast to you.

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thanks for helping me out today.

335
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,760
We are friends now.

336
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,479
Isn't it just a little thing
between men and women?

337
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,400
I can understand.

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,920
Buddy, I have to say.

339
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:53,359
Today,

340
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,719
you owe me one.

341
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:57,880
No problem.

342
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,640
From now on, if I can be of any help,

343
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,920
just tell me.

344
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,760
Cheers.

345
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,319
Ye?

346
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,079
You are a man of righteousness!

347
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,359
One more.

348
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,920
Cheers.

349
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,959
Cheers.

350
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,160
Buddy.

351
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:22,319
I have been fighting against injustice
all my life.

352
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,160
About what happened today,

353
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,479
never mind.

354
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,680
I help you today,

355
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,400
and maybe someday I'll need your help.

356
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,640
Buddy.

357
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:43,800
Did you know me before?

358
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,040
I knew you?

359
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,640
Let me tell you.

360
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,359
I've been doing business
in Southeast Asia for years.

361
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,040
I just came back this year.

362
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,439
I've been speaking Vietnamese

363
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,760
for longer than speaking Chinese.

364
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,160
If you insisted that I knew you,

365
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:02,839
you must have been to Vietnam.

366
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,239
Vietnam?

367
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,359
You don't believe me?

368
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,439
Should I

369
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,680
talk to you in Vietnamese?

370
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,760
Buddy. Just joking.

371
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,160
Look at you.

372
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,959
How come I don't believe you?

373
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:31,959
Come on! Cheers!

374
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:33,079
Look at you!

375
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,560
I don't know what you do,

376
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,719
but I do know that you must be somebody!

377
00:24:47,959 --> 00:24:49,520
Somebody?

378
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,920
I'm going to be an outcast.

379
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:54,599
You know what? People like you
all have a shortage.

380
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:55,959
Shortage?

381
00:24:56,239 --> 00:24:57,439
With too strong ability,

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,439
you easily overshadow your higher-ups.

383
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,079
Am I correct?

384
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:06,199
I'm correct, right?

385
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,520
Now your boss

386
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,319
doesn't like you. I'm sure about that.

387
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,800
You're right.

388
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,739
(Lei Yuzheng)

389
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:20,520
I have been following him

390
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,839
and working for him for a long time.

391
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,560
When it was time to get the profit,

392
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,880
he suddenly stopped.

393
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,280
He doesn't listen to me.

394
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,119
I can't understand.

395
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,199
Buddy, I can't understand.

396
00:25:39,776 --> 00:25:40,480
(Xu You's calling)

397
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,079
Xu You.

398
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,079
Yuzheng.

399
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,199
You didn't even tell me
when you came back?

400
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,439
You've been busy dealing with
the reporters all day.

401
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,000
I don't want to bother you.

402
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,239
Are you angry?

403
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,079
Why?

404
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,560
For what happened last time,

405
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,319
I'm still looking for a chance
to thank you.

406
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,599
You don't have to look for a chance.

407
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,199
If you want to thank me,
why don't you come to me now?

408
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:14,920
Here.

409
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:22,439
You usually take a private room.

410
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,839
Why did you decide to sit outside today?

411
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:26,760
Even for a dinner,
I have to avoid people.

412
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm tired of that.

413
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,000
Aren't you afraid of being photographed?

414
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,239
Are you afraid?

415
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,040
What have I to be afraid of?

416
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,599
I'm not a super star
and I don't have fans.

417
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,719
I'm just afraid that
you don't feel comfortable.

418
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,199
I have to say.

419
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,959
Now, the domestic entertainment industry
is not what it used to be.

420
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,560
A small thing

421
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,400
can make a big splash.

422
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,119
Good.

423
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,520
To experience a big splash with Mr. Lei

424
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:52,839
is what I really want.

425
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,880
I hope they pay attention to me.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,400
So, I can be in the news more often.

427
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:58,800
Ok then,

428
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
if you insist.

429
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,800
Try it.

430
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,359
Thank you.

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,520
You don't like it?

432
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,199
No.

433
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,520
I like here.

434
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,520
It is not because of the food here,

435
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,880
but the feeling here.

436
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,439
I don't need to hide,

437
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,839
and I can sit here with you

438
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,760
to have a dinner.

439
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,839
I've been thinking about
this kind of life for a long time.

440
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,280
Xu You.

441
00:27:29,719 --> 00:27:30,599
I'm sorry

442
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
to cause you trouble.

443
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,199
If you want to be so polite to me,

444
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,040
I'll be polite to you as well.

445
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,199
You did cause me some troubles.

446
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,400
Big troubles.

447
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:44,400
An actress has to be mysterious,

448
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,119
so that more people can pay attention.

449
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,839
Once she's photographed being
accompanied by a man,

450
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,959
I'm afraid no one wants her
to act as a dream lover again.

451
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,199
Xu You, I'm really...

452
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,400
Save it.

453
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,400
I was expecting all of that.

454
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,199
But I'd like to perform it with you.

455
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,199
I've performed so many roles.

456
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,479
But I've never performed myself.

457
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,079
The longer I perform that I love you,

458
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,880
the more difficult for me
to get out of it.

459
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,479
I'm not going to lie to you.

460
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,719
Because of

461
00:28:20,719 --> 00:28:21,880
Du Xiaosu, right?

462
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,439
You are pretty sure
that you love her in your heart.

463
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,280
But why are you so cool toward her?

464
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,119
You're not protecting her.
You're hurting her,

465
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,400
and making her feel painful.

466
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Xu You.

467
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Excuse me.

468
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
I think I need to calm myself down.

469
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,280
Mr. Lin, wait, please.

470
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,079
I've read all the materials you gave me.

471
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,839
It is helpful.

472
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:12,640
Thank you.

473
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:13,959
You're welcome.

474
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,000
That's my job.

475
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,880
About transferring shares to you,

476
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,160
Uncle Jiang has told me.

477
00:29:21,239 --> 00:29:22,239
What do you mean?

478
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,439
Are you trying
to remind me of something?

479
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,839
You took me wrong.

480
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,760
I just want to

481
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,839
congratulate you.

482
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,079
Congratulate me?

483
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,160
Congratulations
on becoming a shareholder of Yutian.

484
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,880
I've been waiting for a long time.

485
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,079
Now I got it.

486
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,400
I got a big chunk of shares.

487
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,520
Now, I can also have a say in Yutian.

488
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:50,839
These were all that

489
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
I had been dreaming of.

490
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,880
I thought I would be happy,

491
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,439
but I am not.

492
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,560
Because that's not what I really want.

493
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:04,479
So, what exactly do you want?

494
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,760
I just want to know

495
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,719
what the gap is between us.

496
00:30:16,479 --> 00:30:17,359
Just let it be.

497
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,719
You can't give me the answer.

498
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,119
Because I don't think

499
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,680
you are that noble and upright.

500
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,199
Because you're my kind.

501
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,479
Lin Xiangyuan.

502
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,719
Did I hear it wrongly?

503
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,079
You said we were the same kind?

504
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,239
I thought you were a true man.

505
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,079
I thought

506
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:35,839
you would cherish it more than I do.

507
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,079
However,

508
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,439
you chose to run away.

509
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,920
You don't even
have the courage to face it.

510
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,319
Am I right?

511
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,160
Lin Xiangyuan.

512
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,040
What's up?

513
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,239
Nothing.

514
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,599
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

515
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,040
So, I drop by to see you.

516
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,959
How are you these days?

517
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,439
Quite good.

518
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,880
I heard from Qunfei recently

519
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,959
about Miss Jiang.

520
00:31:43,719 --> 00:31:46,000
How is she? Is she ok?

521
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:48,479
She is quite good.

522
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,040
I go shopping with her when I'm free.

523
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,199
Chat with her.

524
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,199
Though she hasn't recovered,

525
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,280
she is much better than before.

526
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,199
I'm here today,

527
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,199
because I want to say something to you.

528
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,479
In my heart,

529
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,640
you are always a strong girl,

530
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,640
whether in love or in business.

531
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,800
You've learned to heal yourself

532
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,560
and overcome it.

533
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,079
Am I?

534
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,160
I didn't even see it by myself that

535
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,880
I am so strong.

536
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,599
I think I need to

537
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,199
look at myself again.

538
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,920
It' true. I'm telling you the truth.

539
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:31,880
I know that over the years

540
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
you have had something against me.

541
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,640
But I never blamed you.

542
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,280
Because it was my fault.

543
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,520
Actually, Fanlv is right.

544
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,199
I was always
mindful of personal gains and losses.

545
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,719
Lin Xiangyuan.

546
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:46,920
If that's what you're here

547
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,760
to tell me,

548
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,079
would you please...

549
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:51,160
Xiaosu.

550
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
Please let me finish.

551
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,439
After I've been through this with Fanlv,

552
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,560
it seems
I've understood something better.

553
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,880
There is something
that cannot be forced.

554
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,160
There is something
that you should fight for.

555
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,680
There is also something

556
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:10,959
that you have to insist on.

557
00:33:13,719 --> 00:33:15,479
What are you trying to tell me?

558
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,239
I know I made a lot of mistakes,

559
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:21,719
especially
what I have done to Lei Yuzheng.

560
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:23,959
Lei Yuzheng…

561
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
Excuse me.

562
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,599
If you come to me today

563
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,520
just to tell me about him,

564
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:30,479
save it.

565
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,560
And I have something to do.

566
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,560
I have to go.

567
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,160
If you don't want me to mention him,
I will not mention him.

568
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,439
Then,

569
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,680
let's talk about us.

570
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,640
Us?

571
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,040
Xiaosu.

572
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,560
From today, I hope to

573
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,319
give you a chance
to get to know me again.

574
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,599
Don't get me wrong.

575
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,800
I'm not going to push you.

576
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,839
I am thinking that

577
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,280
we are still friends.

578
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,119
After what we have gone through,

579
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:10,520
can we still be friends?

580
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,000
That's exactly the reason

581
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,239
why we can be friends.

582
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,479
What kind of friends?

583
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,840
Less than lovers and more than friends.

584
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,439
We are confidants.

585
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,320
I am not pushing you.

586
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,719
You have time to think about it.

587
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,919
I also give myself time

588
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
to test myself.

589
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,239
Ok, I agree.

590
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,040
Friends.

591
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,600
Don't you have something to do?

592
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,840
Would you
give me a chance to give you a drive?

593
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,679
Ok.

594
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,000
Let me check what the time is.

595
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,080
May 17 to

596
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:14,399
May 11 in 2019.

597
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,560
Yes, that's OK.

598
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,280
Regarding the position,

599
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,439
please wait.

600
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:25,199
If there is any question,

601
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,639
you can communicate with me in time.

602
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:28,080
I don't think

603
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:28,959
there is much of a problem.

604
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,439
If any adjustment needed,

605
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,280
just feel free to contact me.

606
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,040
Ok.

607
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,159
Thank you for your support and trust.

608
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,760
You can rest assured that I will do it

609
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,560
very well.

610
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,239
Ok.

611
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,879
We have to go. Bye.

612
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:40,600
-Ok.
-Ok.

613
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:41,320
Bye. Bye.

614
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,159
We have to go.

615
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,040
Waitress.

616
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,840
Check, please.

617
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,479
Miss, a gentleman over there

618
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,600
paid for it just now.

619
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
What are you looking at?

620
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,719
Nothing.

621
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,479
I always feel that
there is someone following me.

622
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,360
Oh my god.

623
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,679
Don't scare me! In broad daylight,

624
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,679
someone can follow you?

625
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
I really feel that
someone is following me all the time.

626
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,560
Dear, don't you have persecutory delusion?

627
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,280
Just joking!

628
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,439
Get your head out of the clouds.
Let's go.

629
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,080
I really feel that
someone is following me all the time.

630
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,320
Xiaosu.

631
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,000
Why aren't you eating?

632
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,679
Are you worried about something?

633
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,479
Nothing.

634
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:04,800
Nothing.

635
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,239
You don't have to tell me.
I know already.

636
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,639
It is because of your boyfriend, right?

637
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,040
Fight?

638
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,040
Fight…

639
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,919
We just don't
even have a chance to fight.

640
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,239
He disappeared.

641
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,199
He is completely out of my life.

642
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,360
Disappear?

643
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
No contact at all?

644
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,520
No.

645
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:38,520
I always feel that he is by my side.

646
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,199
But I'm afraid that

647
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,000
it is just my illusion.

648
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,479
Although I don't know
who your boyfriend is,

649
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,239
I think he must have troubles

650
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,399
and is forced to part with you.

651
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:59,280
So, he can only choose
this kind of particular way

652
00:37:59,399 --> 00:38:00,439
to care about you and protect you.

653
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,040
No matter what,

654
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,080
I believe him.

655
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:12,600
No matter what happens,

656
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm willing to believe him.

657
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,040
You love your boyfriend very much,
don't you?

658
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,959
Love is quite strange.

659
00:38:23,879 --> 00:38:25,199
In the beginning, you care about everything,

660
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,159
but in the end,

661
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,919
you can forgive anything.

662
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,080
I am really afraid that

663
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,080
my insistence

664
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,159
will be defeated by time.

665
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,840
I don't know how long

666
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,879
will this kind of life last.

667
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,399
I'm sorry, Xiaosu.

668
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,199
There's something
I shouldn't have kept from you.

669
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:52,639
I don't take you as

670
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,000
a sister only.

671
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,919
I also like you.

672
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,719
How can I not be tempted

673
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,120
by a girl like you?

674
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,679
How can I not care about you?

675
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,080
I want to apologize that

676
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:12,639
it wasn't me who was with you
at the hospital that night.

677
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:16,919
I think, it might be him.
