Yuzheng,

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,199
it's been a few days since I met you,

18
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,800
and you look drawn.

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Yuzheng,

20
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,440
I know you are sad.

21
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,160
Three of us grew up together,

22
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,720
and Zhenrong has always treated me
like his own sister.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,039
Now he's gone.

24
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:31,839
I'm just as sad as you are.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,639
Stop it.

26
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,559
Yuzheng,

27
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,080
don't blame yourself too much.

28
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,759
Take care of yourself.

29
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,320
At least you still have me.

30
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm so jealous of you.

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,399
Once the hard-working doctor like me
performs an operation,

32
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,279
no one knows when I can have a rest.

33
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,240
Brother,

34
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
you find me?

35
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,800
God has arranged such a
hard working doctor like you

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,000
to save lives.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,199
People like me

38
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,440
can only enjoy life.

39
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,600
Brother, here you are.

40
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,720
In this world,

41
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,559
only you can know I'm here.

42
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,239
Brother,

43
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,799
we will still be able to

44
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,720
chat happily like this

45
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,679
when we get old?

46
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,040
I remember that we have

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,119
buried something
underground, right?

48
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm surprised that you still remember.

49
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,399
When we get too old

50
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,519
to walk,

51
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,200
we can come back and

52
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:44,640
see what we've buried before.

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,679
That will be so nice.

54
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,920
Zhenrong,

55
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,239
didn't we agree that

56
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:53,000
we will come back here again
when we get old.

57
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,160
We promised each other
to be best friends forever.

58
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,200
I will never be able to

59
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,799
protect you like I used to.

61
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:14,839
What happened, Siqi?

62
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,519
Why don't you eat?

63
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,519
Something like this happened to Xiaosu,

64
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,760
and how am I able to eat?

65
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,320
And what happened to Dr. Shao

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,320
was indeed too sudden.

67
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,920
I have never seen such sorrow of Mr. Lei.

68
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,839
As far as I can tell from how he looks,

69
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,119
It would take a long time
for him to get better.

70
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,559
They had been so
in love with each other,

71
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,440
and suddenly they parted forever.

72
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,880
I really can't believe it.

73
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,399
Siqi,

74
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,959
life

75
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,480
is more splendid than TV drama.

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Life is vulnerable.

77
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,160
You should stop thinking too much.

78
00:05:58,559 --> 00:05:59,559
Actually,

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,559
after so many things
happened these days,

80
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,519
one thing has become clearer for me.

81
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,559
What is it?

82
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,000
It's that we should cherish more

83
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,920
about our good days.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,799
We have been together for
almost two years.

85
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:15,079
Although we are not very rich,

86
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,679
after two or three years of working,

87
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:18,480
it would be no problem for us
to make down payment for a house.

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,279
Ok. Stop it.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,920
Zhenrong,

90
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,480
I haven't seen you for a while.

91
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,119
How are you doing?

92
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,839
Brat,

93
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,200
since we were kids,

94
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,359
you always competed with me,

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,119
but never surpassed me.

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,640
You earned less than me.

97
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,880
And you couldn't win me on fencing.

(Beloved son Shao Zhenrong.

99

100
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,119
Why did you run away?

101
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,119
Why?

102
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,600
This time,

103
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,640
you are going to give up for good?

106
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:35,440

our childhood memories.

116

117

How can you be so shameless
and ask me why?

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
If you were not so heartless,

134
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,239
Zhenrong wouldn't have gone to Yunnan

135
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,200
and he would never come across
with that damn debris flow.

136

I don't want to hear your apology.

Your apology

140
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,039
only makes you more hypocritical.

Were you serious

I tried my best to endure you,

150

151

treat Zhenrong better.

That rainy night one year ago,

159
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,679
you were too drunk to know anything,

160
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:53,679
and you fell in front of my car.

161

was you?

168

I was too drunk at that time

169
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,440
and I really can't remember.

170
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:21,719
I only knew that the waiter told me that

171
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,280
the night before

172
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,080

Mr. Lei,

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,280
please let me explain.

Miss Du,

176
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,400
I don't want to hear your explanation.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,919
Please leave,

178
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,599

what you want,

184
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,280
please cherish it.

185
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,919

186
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
you love him,

187
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,039

everything for him.

188
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,359
Now you tell me that
you don't love him anymore.

189
00:13:49,599 --> 00:13:51,119
It seems like Miss Du's promise

190
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,960
is worth nothing.

(Zou Siqi)

192
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,960
This is what I found in his drawer

193
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,880
when I cleaned Dr. Shao's office.

194
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,239
Your name was written there.
(To Du Xiaosu)

195
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,640
I suppose that Dr. Shao
was not able to give it to you.

200
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,359
Shao,

201
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,559
Dr. Shao

202
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,159
has bought the house.

203
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,919
I have hurt him like that.

204
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
It should be me who
take this punishment.

205
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,640
Do you think Zhenrong hated me?

206
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,039
Stupid girl.

207
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,440
Why did he hate you?

208
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
He must hate me.

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,599
Just a few minutes.

210
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:26,159
No.

211
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,400
Maybe just a few seconds.

212
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,640
If I could arrive earlier,

213
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I might be able to speak with him.

214
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,200
I could do nothing but

215
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,119
watching him die in front of me.

216
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
That moment,

217
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,000
I held his hands,

218
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,559
and they were still warm.

219
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,599
Before he was gone,

220
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,919
he looked at me.

221
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,239
But I could not see his face clearly,

222
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:16,359
I didn't know if he was mad at me,

223
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,640
or just smiling at me.

224
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,479
I really don't know.

225
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,119
Ok, wait a second.

226
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,760
Xiaosu, stop crying for now.

227
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,559
It's the sales office,
and you should pick up.

228
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,440
Hello.

229
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:04,640
Yes, it's me.

230
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,160
What?

231
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay. I will go tomorrow.

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,839
Miss Du,

233
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,359
our houses in Anman western suburb

234
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,800
are very popular.

235
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,160
Many clients would wait in line
at night to buy the houses.

236
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,479
So, I'm afraid that I cannot
reserve a house for you.

237
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,560
Wait,

238
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,439
we will buy this house for sure,

239
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,760
and we have already paid
the deposit.

240
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
However, recently,

241
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,199
something happened to my family.

242
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,760
So, could you

243
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:46,599
help me

244
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,239
apply for more time?

245
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,839
As soon as I collect all the money,

246
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,359
we will sign the contract right away.

247
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,920
I know that you are in a dilemma

248
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,079
but I beg you.

249
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,479
Please give me one more week.

250
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,880
Just one more week.

251
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,520
I can only give you three more days.

252
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,079
If you cannot make the payment
three days later,

253
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
this house will be sold to
someone else for sure.

254
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,520
Three days.

255
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:23,800
Mr. Lei,

256
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:26,839
the designs for
Universal Entertainment Center

257
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
have been made.

258
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,839
When would you like to

259
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,000
meet with personnel in Boyuan

260
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,359
and discuss about them?

261
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,319
Mr. Lei.

262
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
It's up to you.

263
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,479

264
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:45,239

268
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,160
please contact the sales manager

269
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,400
of Yi Pin Ming Cheng for me.

270
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:13,880
Now.

271
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,680
Ok.

272
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,480

273
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,480

Available balance is 5000.00 yuan.)

(Mom)

275
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,760
Mom,

276
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,119
I want to beg you something.

277
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,160
Aunt Shao,

278
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:29,079
I am here to see you.

279
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,719
Yuzheng.

280
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,280
Yuzheng,

281
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
come here.

282
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,760
Yuzheng, I want to give these to you.

283
00:20:55,456 --> 00:20:56,660
(Yutian Group Shareholder Certificate)

284
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,839
Aunt Shao, I cannot accept them.

285
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,719
These are stock rights
and family legacy.

286
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
I wanted to leave them for Zhenrong.

287
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,599
Zhenrong was gone.

288
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
What can I do with these

289
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,119
while being alone in this home?

290
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,199
Aunt Shao,

291
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,959
I didn't have mom since I was a kid.

292
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,959
You and Zhenrong gave me another home.

293
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,160
It is my responsibility
to take care of you.

294
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,520
Please let me take care of
you for Zhenrong.

295
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,439
What did the real estate company say?

296
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,000
How long can they
reserve the house for you?

297
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:42,119
They only gave me three days.

298
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:47,040
Today, I have borrowed more than
300 thousand from my family,

299
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,800
but it's still not enough.

300
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,199
Here.
(Passbook if China Minsheng Bank)

301
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,160
Take it.

302
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,000
How can I take your money?

303
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,880
It's okay. Just take it.

304
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,760
Or I will get mad.

305
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,599
No. I can't.

306
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,599
This is all your dowry.

307
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I can't take this.

308
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,880
It's fine.
What's mine is also yours.

309
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:22,920
Take it.

310
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,479
You can think of it as

311
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,400
my share of your new house.

312
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,680
Thank you so much, Siqi.

313
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Look at you.

314
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,319
How much more do you need besides these?

315
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:44,920
About half.

316
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,719
Don't worry.

317
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,719
I told Qunfei today as well.

318
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,319
I told him to give you
his money for marriage,

319
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,119
so you can deal with this emergency.

320
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,920
He can transfer it to you tomorrow.

321
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,479
No, let's not bother Qunfei.

322
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,280
It's fine. His money for marriage

323
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,800
may not be used on me anyway.

324
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,560
You should just use it for now.

325
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,959
Thank you, Siqi.

326
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,880
It's so nice to have you and Qunfei.

327
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,920
Just love me then.

328
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,079
Love you.

329
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,239
You have left our company for long.

330
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,599
You never called me

331
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,359
when you were free.

332
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,760
Such an impolite girl!

333
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,280
I wanted to visit you,

334
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,119
but I was too scared.

335
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,920
I was afraid that you would
call me renegade,

336
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,359
and I was also afraid that you would
persuade me to go back.

337
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,839
I tell you that after you left,

338
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,520
the company recruited another

339
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,479
young and smart girl.

340
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:02,880
She was very obedient

341
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,439
and she would follow all my orders.

342
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,599
It was much easier to manage her
compared to you.

343
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:10,800
Brother Mo,

344
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:12,959
actually...

345
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,119
Girl, you can save it.

346
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,800
I know that you are having difficulty,

347
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:19,520
but you need to think about
the good side,

348
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
and be confident.

349
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:23,479
Life cannot always be smooth.

350
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,160
There must be peaks,

351
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,280
as well as low ebbs sometimes.

352
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,640
Although you are in one of them,

353
00:24:27,719 --> 00:24:29,239
you have to deal with it positively.

354
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,520
You have to be confident.

355
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,920
Look, I tell you

356
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:34,439
what I can tell never goes wrong.

357
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,920
Don't worry.
You will be able to handle it.

358
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,280
Right.

359
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,800
This is what you deserve.

360
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:43,599
Did you remember it?

361
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,680
Last time when we asked you
to find that big star,

362
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,079
Yan Jingjing,

363
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,680
you were able to interview her

364
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,640
and here's your bonus.

365
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,000
I have made the deposit for you.

366
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,119
Of course, part of that

367
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,800
was from me as a gift.

368
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,760
Take it.

369
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,920
Brother Mo...

370
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,719
Don't,

371
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,680
don't tell me things like

372
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,479
"thank you" or "I'm so touched".

373
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,160
I can't take it.

374
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,520
We don't need that between us.

375
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,599
Excuse me.

376
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:22,719
Miss, here I am.

377
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,319
Excuse me, Miss Du.

378
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,000
We said three days
and you didn't show up.

379
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,959
So, the house was already
bought by someone else.

380
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
It was bought?

381
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:34,760
But I'm only half day late.

382
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,439
I'm really sorry.

383
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,000
How could you do that?

384
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,479
I've collected all the money,

385
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,920
and we've signed the agreement contract.

386
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,920
How could you just sell it
to someone else

387
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
as you wish?

388
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:49,359
Miss Du,

389
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,439
if I tell you the truth

390
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,839
about this house,

391
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,199
don't tell anyone that it's me
who told you this.

392
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,119
What do you mean?

393
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,280
Who on earth

394
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,199
bought my house?

395
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,719
Mr. Lei, Du Xiaosu from Design Team
wants to see you.

396
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,719
Tell her that I don't want to see her.

397
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,839
But she insists to see you.

398
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Tell her

399
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,520
that I only give her five minutes.

400
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,400
Here is more than 200 thousand yuan

401
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
plus the deposit in the card.

402
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,439
It should be 710 thousand yuan in total.

403
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,439
I know that it's not enough.

404
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,160
But this is all

405
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:46,839
I am able to collect.

406
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,479
I'm still working,

407
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,359
so I can apply for business loan.

408
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,479
These should be enough for down payment.

409
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
I beg you

410
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,199
to sell me the house that

411
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,000
Zhenrong bought.

412
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,920
I'm not going to sell you that house.

413
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
This is my only wish.

414
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Hope you could help me with it.

415
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,920
Help you?

416
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,040
Why would I?

417
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:20,860
(Real Estate Invoice)

418
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,239
Here're purchase contract and
deposit receipt.

419
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,760
Why did you tear up my contract?

420
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,199
Because you let Zhenrong down.

421
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,760
If you have any doubt that

422
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,839
I tore up this contract,

423
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,880
you can sue me.

424
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:44,040
Also,

425
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,400
you don't need to work in Boyuan
from tomorrow.

426
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,719
Mr. Lei.

427
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,599
Mr. Lei,

428
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,359
you cannot fire me

429
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:59,319
or take away our house like this.

430
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,239
Your?

431
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,439
Don't you think that

432
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,079
it is ridiculous that
you mentioned this word?

433
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,079
Who gave you the right to mention it?

434
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
When you broke up with Zhenrong,

435
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,319
have you ever thought about this word?

436
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,719
That house only belonged to Zhenrong.

437
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,439
I'm just returning it to its owner.

438
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,239
I'm also telling you,

439
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,520
no matter what it takes,

440
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,280
I must take that house back.

441
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,439
Before that, I'm not leaving.

442
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,160
Are you challenging me?

443
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,319
If you would like to
think of it this way.

444
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,079
Don't play with fire,

445
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,959
or you will burn yourself.

446
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't care.

447
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,640
No matter how you think about me,

448
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,040
no matter what kind of woman I am

449
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,800
in your mind,

450
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,359
I don't care any of it.

451
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,839
The only thing I care about

452
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:46,000
is that house.

453
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,439
Maybe for you,

454
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,599
it is just a house.

455
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,520
But for me,

456
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,400
it is the home of Zhenrong and me.

457
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,239
How shameless are you
to mention about Zhenrong?

458
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
Zhenrong was gone

459
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,119
and he was murdered by you.

460
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,719
Yes.

461
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,520
I might be a killer in your mind.

462
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,400
Since you know it so well,

463
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,920
why are you fighting against me?

464
00:29:14,959 --> 00:29:16,119
You should know that,

465
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,199
a killer would do anything

466
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
to achieve the goal.

467
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,319
I will be back.

468
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:32,680
Mr. Xie, I've learned so much

469
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,520
by having meal and talking with you.

470
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,640
Look at you.

471
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,719
Cheers.

472
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,599
No wonder that Mr. Jiang

473
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,640
has always admired Mr. Xie.

474
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,680
He always wants to
have you in his team.

475
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,400
I have a really good project now.

476
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,560
There're many things that
I need to learn from you, Mr. Xie.

477
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,760
Which project?

478
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
Movie or TV drama?

479
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,000
It has nothing to do with these.

480
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,160
Yutian will build a
Universal Entertainment Center.

481
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,680
Brother, are you losing your mind?

482
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,079
How can I get involved in
Yutian's project?

483
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,560
Whether you can get involved or not

484
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,359
depends on what we do.

485
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:31,040
Brother,

486
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,359
I'm a vulgar man.

487
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Can we not talk vaguely?

488
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:40,160
Ok, I will just ask you one thing.

489
00:30:40,479 --> 00:30:41,319
What is that?

490
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,560
Do you want to do something huge?

491
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:47,000
Of course.

492
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,259
(Jiang Fanlv)

493
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:13,199
Hello, Miss Jiang.

494
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,199
Lin Xiangyuan, I'm almost late.

495
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,760
You need to get me a pair of shoes.

496
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,079
Miss Jiang, I have just driven
Mr. Jiang back home.

497
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:20,880
I will have an important meeting

498
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,839
at 8 o'clock.

499
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,520
There's an important party
where I need the shoes.

500
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,040
Call me when you get them.

501
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,040
That's all.

502
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,239
Miss Jiang!

503
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:50,280
Looks good.

504
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,880
That one looks good.

505
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,199
It looks good.

506
00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:00,400
(UnionPay. Amount 10800 yuan)

507
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,300
(Insufficient Funds)

508
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,199
Sir, excuse me.

509
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:03,719
The card limit has been reached.

510
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:05,719
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:06,719
It's okay.

512
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,280
This card.

513
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,199
Ok.

514
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:15,199
I'm sorry, do you have other cards?

515
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,920
I'm sorry.

516
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,680
This one.

517
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,319
I'm sorry, but this card doesn't work.

518
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,319
Mr. Lin.

519
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,560
What a coincidence!

520
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Are you shopping with girlfriend?

521
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,479
I'm here to accompany her.

522
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,479
Here, use mine.

523
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,239
I don't think I can take it.

524
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,640
It's okay. Take it.

525
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,280
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lin,

526
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:46,520
I will bring the money to you tomorrow.

527
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,000
Don't be so polite.

528
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,839
We are brothers,

529
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,280
and it's not a large amount of money.

530
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,640
By the way,

531
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,479
has the issue of Xiaosu been solved?

532
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:59,079
If anything happens to Xiaosu again,

533
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,400
please let me know.

534
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,839
After all, we are...

535
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:03,959
Don't worry. I get it.

536
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,280
Sir, your card.

537
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,560
Please sign here.

538
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,079
Thank you.

539
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:10,479
I'm here to get shoes
for Miss Jiang Fanlv.

540
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,280
Ok. It's all done.

541
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,040
Please take it.

542
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:17,119
Assistant He,

543
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:18,920
we both work for others,

544
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,920
but at least you work
for your girlfriend.

545
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,119
But I

546
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:25,160
am in much worse situation than you.

547
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm gonna go.

548
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,520
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

549
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,820
(Seaweed)

550
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,359
Nori egg soup.

551
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,400
Where did you get nori?

552
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,239
I took apart a bag of seaweed.

553
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:02,640
That is brilliant.

554
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:04,079
People who is as perfect as me

555
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:06,479
accepted your proposal.
How could you ask why?

556
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,080
Don't you know,

557
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,239
you are making me upset.

558
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
Xiaosu.

559
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,919
Xiaosu, we are back.

560
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,280
What is the smell?

561
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,040
What happened?

562
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:30,479
Xiaosu.

563
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,840
How did your hand get hurt?

564
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,199
What?

565
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,040
You are back!

566
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,120
I was too stupid.

567
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,159
It was also here that day

568
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,760
when Zhenrong made me a meal.

569
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,520
It was the best

570
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:59,679
nori egg soup that I've ever had.

571
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,639
I just want to see

572
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,479
if I can make the same thing.

573
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,879
We used to be so happy,

574
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,600
but now I have nothing left.

575
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,360
Xiaosu, don't be too sad.

576
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,760
You can cry if you want.

577
00:35:21,879 --> 00:35:23,600
Don't suppress yourself.

578
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
I'm really useless.

579
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,120
I couldn't even save the house.

580
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,399
The house?

581
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:38,879
I thought you already paid for it.

582
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,120
The house was taken by Lei Yuzheng.

583
00:35:45,439 --> 00:35:46,600
Lei Yuzheng?

584
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,159
It has nothing to do with me.

585
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:56,159
I messed everything up.

586
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,399
Tell me.

587
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:02,040
Will Zhenrong hate me?

588
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:04,800
No, he won't.

589
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,439
How could Dr. Shao hate you?

590
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,280
If he was still alive,

591
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,600
he must wish that you are fine.

592
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,239
How would he bear to see you
blame yourself so much?

593
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,639
Siqi,

594
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,360
for my whole life,

595
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,040
I can only do this much.

596
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,639
Xiaosu.

597
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,199
I want to talk with you.

598
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,639
Miss Du, who do you think you are?

599
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,120
My patience has reached the limit

600
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:57,600
over these days.

601
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,320
I told you that,

602
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,679
before I get the house,

603
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,719
I will be back.

604
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
I have told you clearly before.

605
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,479
I won't give you the house,

606
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:11,000
and Boyuan will never employ you again.

607
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,600
Do you understand?

608
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,080
Then please take a look at this.

609
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,120
You are the boss.
(Yutian Group. Employee Labor Contract)

610
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,399
I'm sure that you know better than I do.

611
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,520
I signed the contract with Boyuan.

612
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,639
Only when I'm breaking the rules,

613
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,439
or breaking the law,

614
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,800
can the company terminate
the labor contract

615
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,199
with me unconditionally.

616
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,199
Otherwise,

617
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,080
the company needs to inform me
30 days before.

618
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:34,080
Or,

619
00:37:34,439 --> 00:37:36,560
I can take this to sue you.

620
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,399
Sure.

621
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,399
I'm now officially informing you,

622
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,479
after 30 days,

623
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,280
you can leave Boyuan forever.

624
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,800
Is there any difference?

625
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:48,000
Of course, there is.

626
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:50,360
At least I have 30 more days.

627
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:51,479
In these 30 days,

628
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:52,919
there are numerous possibilities,

629
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,199
and anything could happen.

630
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,719
Who would tell what's going to happen?

631
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,679
What's done cannot be undone.

632
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,080
If you had known it would come to this,
you would have acted differently.

633
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:01,439
If you could know beforehand,

634
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,520
you would not act like a moth,

635
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,239
flying into the flame.

636
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,719
What's wrong with flying into the flame?

637
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,639
To me,

638
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,439
the moment that moth
flies into the flame

639
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,679
is when it finishes its rebirth.

640
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,879
There are many people in this world

641
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,439
who are powerful,

642
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,879
but they do not even have the courage
to fly into the flame.

643
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,360
You have your opinion,

644
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,159
while I have my insistence.

645
00:38:39,919 --> 00:38:41,280
I'm willing to take these 30 days

646
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,000
to complete this gambling.

647
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,959
Do you dare?

648
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,199
Ok.

649
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,879
I will give you 30 days.

650
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
Within 30 days,

651
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,560
if you collect all the money
for the house,

652
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:56,520
I will give the house to you.

653
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,719
Otherwise, please go away.

654
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,320
Leave this city.

655
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:05,320
Do you dare?

656
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,520
Deal.

657
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,239
I know

658
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,639
that the chance might be only 1/10000

659
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:21,520
that I can take this house back.

660
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,679
But even just for this
1/10000 possibility,

661
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,159
I would do anything for it

662
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,639
without regretting.

663
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:35,719
What?

664
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,560
Did you lose your mind?

665
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,439
You promised Lei Yuzheng

666
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,679
to collect all the money within 30 days?

667
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,479
How dare you?

668
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,320
Let me ask you.

669
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,560
30 days pass within a blink.

670
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,239
How could you possibly
collect millions of yuan?

671
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,520
What's wrong with flying into the flame?

672
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,479
To me,

673
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,280
the moment that moth
flies into the flame

674
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,199
is when it finishes its rebirth.

675
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,800
There are many people in this world

676
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,399
who are powerful,

677
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,919
but they do not even have the courage
to fly into the flame.
