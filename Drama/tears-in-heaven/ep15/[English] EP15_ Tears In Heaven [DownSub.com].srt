I will drink for you.

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
Do you like me?

19
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Yes, I like you.

20
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,039
Like me?

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,639
Then do you want to marry me?

22
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,000
Forget about it.

23
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,440
Miss Jiang, I really like you.

24
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,520
Can you give me a chance?

25
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,720
Miss Jiang, I really like you.

26
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,960
Can you give me a chance?

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Dad.

28
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,119
I'm done eating.
I will go to the office.

29
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:56,360
Ok.

30
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,880
Yuzheng, let me ask you something.

31
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,720
Is everything going well
for you and Fanlv?

32
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,199
Yes. Why?

33
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,759
She used to visit me often,

34
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,399
but these days,

35
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,119
I haven't seen her even once.

36
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,839
You must have offended her.

37
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
Dad, don't worry about me and Fanlv.

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,519
If nothing happened,

39
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,600
how about inviting
her and Uncle Jiang

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,959
to have dinner at home
this weekend?

41
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Alright, dad.

42
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,200
I know what I should do.

43
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,119
Don't worry.

44
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:28,959
I gotta go now.

45
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
You should go back inside
and rest.

46
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,959
You don't really know
what you should do.

47
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Come inside please.

48
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,559
Please come in.

49
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,679
Chairman, as you stop by
without notification,

50
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,679
we haven't prepared well for you.

51
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,839
There're many customers
at the end of year.

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Thus, I don't want to interrupt you.

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,760
So the revenue of the mall

54
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,160
is 1.087 billion yuan so far,

55
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,359
which has increased by 12%

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,559
compared to last month.

57
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,160
About the rent...

58
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,760
I'm not here to inspect the mall.

59
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,160
Then you are here for....

60
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,799
Mr. Wang, I want to know

61
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,040
if there's any store that
sells quilt in this mall.

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,279
Quilt.

63
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,320
Yes. I will take care of it at once.

64
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,119
Such a coincidence.

65
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,559
Fanlv, you are here too.

66
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,920
How are you having such good mood

67
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,880
to come here?

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,839
What's wrong with coming here?

69
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:34,799
Why can't I visit
my own mall?

70
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,679
It doesn't fit you.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,160
Why doesn't it fit me?

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,839
Showing a straight face

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,959
while sitting in the office

74
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,079
fits me?

75
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,679
Aren't you a top elite

76
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,519
who is always authoritative and
vigorous in work?

77
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,239
The shopping mall

78
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,920
seems more suitable for women.

79
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,119
I am still an elite but

80
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,880
I also like shopping in this mall.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
I'm not only visiting
but also buying today.

82
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,600
Mr. Lei, here's the quilt.

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,799
Give me a piece of advice.

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
Yuzheng, a chairman

85
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:06,000
actually comes here to buy quilt?

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,600
What's wrong with buying quilt?
I want to buy it.

87
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,399
I guess that it must feel nice to

88
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:16,559
sleep with.

89
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,799
What kind of quilt should you choose

90
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,559
on southern islands during winter?

91
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,880
Down? Wool?

92
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,839
Or silk?

93
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,720
I've never been to southern islands.

94
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,959
How do I know which kind is better?

95
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,839
Mr. Lei, this kind is pretty warm.

96
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,279
Okay, I will trust you.

97
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,160
I will get eight quilts of the same
style for single beds.

98
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:41,320
No problem.

99
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,239
Wait. I will buy ten quilts.

100
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,239
Also one more quilt for double bed.

101
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,239
OK.

102
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:46,679
I gotta go now.

103
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:49,519
Fanlv.

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,359
Qunfei, check out with Mr. Wang.

105
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,399
After checking out, deliver the quilts
to this address.

106
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:58,600
Ok.

107
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,399
Mr. Lei, have a nice day.

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,600
Fanlv.

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:00,959
This way, please.

110
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Fanlv.

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Jiang Fanlv.

112
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:14,920
What are you doing?

113
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,720
Why do you have temper tantrum again?

114
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,399
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,679
Every time I want to call you,

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,079
I tell myself

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
why I still contact him

118
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,799
when he doesn't even care about me?

119
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,679
Let's not quarrel in the mall, alright?

120
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,279
Just give your love to

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,559
all those people who

122
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,200
need wool quilts.

123
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,600
I went to the island for Zhenrong.

124
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,119
You like Du Xiaosu, right?

125
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,359
How come everything can

126
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,320
be associated with Du Xiaosu?

127
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,920
Jiang Fanlv, I want to ask you.

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,880
Does the resignation of Du Xiaosu

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,119
have anything to do with you?

130
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,880
You said that you
had no feeling for her,

131
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,679
but you seem sad about

132
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,359
her leaving because

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
you cannot see her anymore, right?

134
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,000
You haven't answered my question.

135
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,320
Is it important?

136
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm her boss.

137
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,920
I can't even talk to her?

138
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,519
If she left Yutian just because

139
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:19,000
what I said,

140
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,480
then you are looking down on her.

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,320
Fanlv, you are so irrational now.

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,040
Yuzheng.

143
00:08:31,359 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not finished yet, Yuzheng.

144
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,719
Siqi.

145
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,000
Come, have a seat.

146
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,039
Have you ordered?

147
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,239
Yes.

148
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,679
I'm so tired.

149
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,000
I stayed up all night again,

150
00:09:08,119 --> 00:09:09,840
and now it hurts everywhere.

151
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,239
There is big news every day.

152
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,159
Mr.Mo is having me on call
24 hours each day.

153
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,320
Siqi, besides working hard,

154
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,559
you still need to rest.

155
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,679
I want to rest too,

156
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
but I need to earn money.

157
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,479
I have worked so hard

158
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,840
for the news release this time.

159
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,320
This job seems so exhausting.

160
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,479
How about changing a job?

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,559
Changing a job?

162
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,760
Sounds good, but who will
help me with that?

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,479
Me.

164
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,400
You?

165
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,520
You are very confident, but how can you
help me as you are just an assistant?

166
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,000
Forget it, let's eat.

167
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,840
What are you doing?

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,080
Siqi, please marry me.

169
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
That's too hasty.

170
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,760
Siqi, we are not young anymore.

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
And we are at the age when
we should get married.

172
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,280
Ok, Qunfei.

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,760
Stop embarrassing me.

174
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,599
Quickly, sit over there.

175
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
Quickly, sit over there.

176
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,799
Qunfei.

177
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
There's something that

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,640
I still need to tell you clearly.

179
00:10:39,359 --> 00:10:40,760
It's important to take the reality
into account

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,919
when two people are together.

181
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,840
Considering our financial situation,

182
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,520
it's not the right moment
to get married.

183
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:49,159
Moreover, you need a house

184
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,799
to get married.

185
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:54,039
We both stay in rented apartment,

186
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
and we are constantly worried about

187
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,679
when the rent will be increased

188
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,239
and when the landlord will chase us out.

189
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,400
Have you thought about these issues?

190
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,760
If you don't think that I'm the right

191
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:04,119
person to get married with,

192
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,679
why are you still with me?

193
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,119
Because I like you as who you are.

194
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,080
You are handsome,

195
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:11,960
you can cook,

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,679
you are nice to me,

197
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
and you have a decent job.

198
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
However,

199
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,760
why do you have to propose to me

200
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,039
at this moment?

201
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,440
It is not good.

202
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,559
The timing is not right.

203
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:57,640
Qunfei.

204
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,400
There's something  that

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,719
I still need to tell you clearly.

206
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,719
It's important to take the reality
into account

207
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,440
when two people are together.

208
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,840
Considering our financial situation,

209
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,159
it's not the right moment
to get married.

210
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:31,500
(Mom)

211
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:33,880
Mom.

212
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,119
Qunfei.

213
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,919
How are you doing these days?

214
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,080
We're both fine. How about you?

215
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm doing well.

216
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
How's your plan for marriage?

217
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
I'm working on it.

218
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,559
Did she say yes?

219
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,799
Of course.

220
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,320
Your son is such a good man.

221
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,719
I'm just worried that
there're uncertainties.

222
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,640
Don't worry.

223
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,599
Don't keep it secret.

224
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,359
Please rest assured.

225
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,159
I will tell you and dad
as soon as possible.

226
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,799
You better hurry up.

227
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,559
Ok.

228
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,919
We will wait for your good news.

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,599
Ok.

230
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,880
Take care of yourself.

231
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,679
Sure.

232
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:05,559
Bye.

233
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,239
Sorry.

234
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Shangguan, here.

235
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,400
Let me introduce.

236
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,479
He is

237
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,119
Shangguan Boyao,

238
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,039
a great talent in Shanghai's
finance industry.

239
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,719
This is my good friend, Zou Siqi.

240
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:15,559
Huanhuan,

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,679
I don't know that you have

242
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,080
such a pretty friend.

243
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,559
I made the right decision
to come here today.

244
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
Order whatever you like to eat.

245
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,640
Take your time.

246
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,119
Siqi wants to ask you about fund.

247
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,840
You want to make money?

248
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,679
I'm the right person
you are looking for.

249
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,799
Tell me,

250
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,440
what exactly do you want to know?

251
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,159
Actually,

252
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,679
I'm not familiar with finance,

253
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,039
so I don't even know what

254
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,119
I want to ask you about.

255
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,479
What Siqi means is that

256
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,679
for white-collar workers like us

257
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,520
who want to earn more money,

258
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,559
what kind of investment we should make.

259
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,239
Right, Siqi?

260
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,359
That's what you mean?

261
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,599
I heard from Huanhuan that

262
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,320
the stock you recommended to her last time

263
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,400
had limit up three times within a week.

264
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,679
Can you also offer me some suggestions?

265
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:06,119
You are asking the right person

266
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
for this question.

267
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,039
It depends on if you prefer

268
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,119
steady investment or

269
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,559
short term investment with high return.

270
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,479
Shouldn't pretty girls like Miss Zou

271
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,359
only worry about

272
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:23,559
nail art and having tea?

273
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,799
Why are you so interested

274
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,119
in making money?

275
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,799
It's boring to just have fun.

276
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,640
I believe that people should

277
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,000
do something meaningful.

278
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,719
Right, Huanhuan?

279
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,000
Such as

280
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,039
making money.

281
00:15:37,359 --> 00:15:40,200
The stock that Shangguan
recommended to me last time

282
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
was so good,

283
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,119
and I earned a lot thanks to it.

284
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,880
Actually, investment all depends on

285
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,359
the ability to deal with risks.

286
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I think

287
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,039
I will choose steady investment.

288
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,679
I only have the deposit of
about tens of thousands of yuan.

289
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
The stock market is so risky,

290
00:15:57,119 --> 00:15:58,479
and I'm afraid that
I can't take the risk.

291
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,479
Choose the fund.

292
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Investment in fund is safer.

293
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,880
I can introduce some bosses

294
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,919
who work in the finance industry.

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,960
Like me,

296
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,599
they like to become friends
with smart girls.

297
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,159
♪Twitching of the eyelid♪

298
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,840
♪Good things are coming♪

299
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,719

♪Or it's huge fortune♪

301
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,400
The good time of me, Zou Siqi

302
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,159
is finally coming.

303
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,280
Zou Siqi,

304
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
this chance is rare.

305
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,119
You have to seize it.

306
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,559
Big house.

307
00:16:38,359 --> 00:16:40,200
No more clock-in.

308
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Sleeping without alarm clock.

309
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,440
Who's bothering me?

310
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,440
I haven't even finished my dream.

311
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,009
(He Qunfei)

312
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,479
Sorry.

313
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,239
The number you called is
currently unavailable.

314
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,200
What's the matter? No one answers.

315
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,400
Mr. Lei, this is the response from S.G.

316
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
They have made requirements,

317
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,880
and the detailed clauses
are listed in it.

318
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,880
Why are you looking so pale?

319
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,520
Am I?

320
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,160
You didn't sleep well last night?

321
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,959
There're something on my mind
and I couldn't fall asleep.

322
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:35,560
Something on your mind?

323
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,959
I assume that you were

324
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,400
bothered by your realistic girlfriend.

325
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,520
Qunfei.

326
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,160
You should break up with such

327
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
girl as soon as possible.

328
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:52,900
(Teacher Sun)

329
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,760
Teacher Sun.

330
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:55,959
Hello.

331
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,719
How are you and the kids?

332
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,319
Thank you, Yuzheng.

333
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,800
I've received all the quilts

334
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
that you sent to the kids.

335
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,199
I want to thank you for all the kids.

336
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,800
It's fine.

337
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
The quilt for double bed is

338
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,079
for you.

339
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,560
Thank you, Yuzheng.

340
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,000
You are so thoughtful.

341
00:18:11,719 --> 00:18:12,800
If you need anything else,

342
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,680
just let me know.

343
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:15,760
No, thanks. There's nothing else I need.

344
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,800
By the way, Yuzheng.

345
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,280
I want to know why

346
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,640
this time

347
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,640
you didn't come together with Xiaosu?

348
00:18:23,959 --> 00:18:24,959
I'm a little busy and

349
00:18:25,239 --> 00:18:26,359
I really couldn't make it.

350
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,520
Is Du Xiaosu fine there?

351
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:30,400
Yes, she is fine.

352
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:31,920
It's just that

353
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,040
this time she seems

354
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
to have something on her mind.

355
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,160
She sometimes stares blankly

356
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,520
when she has nothing to do.

357
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Yuzheng,

358
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:41,560
It will be Xiaosu's birthday soon.

359
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,959
I'm planning to give her
a surprise with kids.

360
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,479
How about...

361
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,800
Ok. I see.

362
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,880
Thank you and the kids.

363
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,000
Ok, bye.

364
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:07,239
One two three, wooden boy.

365
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,400
One two three, wooden boy.

366
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,400
One two three, wooden boy.

367
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't move, don't move.

368
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,439
One two three, wooden boy.

369
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:17,520
That's it. That's it.

370
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,959
Kids.

371
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,520
Come chase us.

372
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,800
Look who just came.

373
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,839
Look! Look!

374
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,880
Who's back? Teacher Sun is back.

375
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Let's check out what he brought.

376
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,839
Let me tell you.

377
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,680
Uncle Yuzheng has bought you new toys

378
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
and new quilts.

379
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
So great.

380
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,359
We won't feel cold during winter.

381
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,640
Quickly.

382
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,640
Here, take it!

383
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,000
Run, run, run.

384
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,680
Ok, you take this.

385
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:51,599
Let's hold these.

386
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,000
Ok, let's go.

387
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,439
Xiaosu, we will go over there.

388
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,319
Come on, kids.

389
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,800
Teacher will send you yogurts.

390
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,219
(Lei Yuzheng)

391
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:26,920
Mr. Lei.

392
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,359
Qunfei.

393
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,280
I will leave for a few days.

394
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,280
Where are you going?

395
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,199
Provisional business trip?
How long will you be gone?

396
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,920
Why are you so wordy?

397
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,520
I'm afraid that the directors will ask.

398
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,760
If they ask,

399
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,079
just tell them that I'm abroad
for a business trip.

400
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,040
It was a provisional decision.

401
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,400
However,

402
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,599
what about the meeting with S.G?

403
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:45,520
It's fine.

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,319
I will be back before the meeting.

405
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,199
If anything happens,

406
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,400
call me.

407
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,079
Ok.

408
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,280
By the way,

409
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:58,239
I have to remind you again.

410
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
The cooperation with S.G.
that we are promoting

411
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
is only a secret between us.

412
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
You have to keep secret.

413
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
Sure, I know.

414
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,439
I will see you out.

415
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,880
It's ok. I can leave by myself.

416
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,119
Mr. Lei, at least let me know

417
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,280
where you are going.

418
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,199
Why is he in a hurry?

419
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:15,839
What's wrong with him?

420
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,640
Mom.

421
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,599
What?

422
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,640
You are in Shanghai?

423
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,599
I'm busy now.

424
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,959
Why are you coming suddenly?

425
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,760
You are going to see Siqi?

426
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,560
Aunt, uncle.

427
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,800
Who are you looking for?

428
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,640
Are you Siqi?

429
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,560
Yes, I'm Zou Siqi.

430
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,079
My daughter, we finally meet.

431
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
Wait a second, aunt, please stay calm.

432
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,160
What's the matter?

433
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,719
I'm mom.

434
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm dad.

435
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,439
Since when did I have new parents

436
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,479
that I don't even know of.

437
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm He Qunfei's mom.

438
00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm He Qunfei's dad.

439
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Nice to meet you, aunt and uncle.

440
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,160
Feifei told us that

441
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:07,439
you are getting married.

442
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,839
She was so happy

443
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,079
that she couldn't sleep for two days,

444
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,040
and she insisted to come to
Shanghai to see you.

445
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,079
Right.

446
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,959
Son, Feifei.

447
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,479
Dad, mom.

448
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,359
She looks so pretty,

449
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
even prettier than the picture.

450
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,160
No wonder she's from big city.

451
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,920
The girls in our town
can't even compare.

452
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Qunfei.

453
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,479
You're lucky that Siqi
is willing to marry you.

454
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,479
Treat her well.

455
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,760
Mom, look at you.

456
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,640
How do I dare not treat her well.

457
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,239
It can only be the opposite.

458
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,199
But aunt and uncle,

459
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,640
you should've told me earlier,

460
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:47,359
so that we could prepare in advance.

461
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:49,599
Ever since Qunfei said that
you have registered your marriage,

462
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,959
his mom has been so excited

463
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
and she insisted to come to Shanghai.

464
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,359
She couldn't wait to see you.

465
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
What? Marriage Registration?

466
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Right. Why are you keeping

467
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,920
such good news secret?

468
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,680
Mom, Siqi is right.

469
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,640
We haven't prepared anything

470
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,400
as you visit so suddenly.

471
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,079
There will be so many things coming up.

472
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,920
Mom, what are you doing?

473
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:15,439
This is a present for Siqi.

474
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,319
I...

475
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,119
Our family isn't rich,

476
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,280
I assume that Feifei
has already told you about it.

477
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,239
But we also value the ritual.

478
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,760
We will prepare sufficient gifts.

479
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,800
I don't know how much
we shall give as cash gift here,

480
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:30,439
but in our town we will give

481
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,560
80 thousand yuan when we
meet daughter-in-law.

482
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:34,920
You can take 30 thousand yuan for now,

483
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:37,680
and we will make up for the rest later.

484
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,800
We won't make you feel wronged at all

485
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
to marry into our family.

486
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,920
Wait, aunt and uncle.

487
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:47,239
I can't take this money.

488
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,839
Is it not enough?

489
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
As I said, there will be
50 thousand yuan more.

490
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,599
We are currently borrowing
from our relatives and friends.

491
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,199
He Qunfei, look at what you did.

492
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,000
You just decided my marriage
by yourself.

493
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,520
Then get married by yourself.

494
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,560
What are you thinking?

495
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,079
Bringing your parents to my apartment.

496
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,119
Are you forcing me to get married?

497
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,880
Don't tell me to shut up.

498
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Siqi, let's speak quietly.

499
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,560
How can you do this?

500
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,319
You didn't pick up my call,

501
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,880
and my parents were dying to see you.

502
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,040
Either you go there
and tell them yourself or...

503
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:22,160
No, don't.

504
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,479
My mom has heart problems.

505
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,640
I'm begging you.

506
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,760
Let's fool them for today.

507
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,439
Just show them around
in Shanghai these two days.

508
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,520
I don't have time.

509
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,959
Take it away. I don't need it.

510
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,920
This is from my parents.
You should take it.

511
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,920
He Qunfei, are you losing your mind?

512
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,160
How can I accept this money?

513
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,599
I couldn't return it anyway.

514
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,239
She has heart problems, and what if

515
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,959
she has heart attack
once she's too shocked.

516
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:47,439
Then I am guilty.

517
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,239
You deserve it.

518
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,959
How about this?

519
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,479
I have an idea.

520
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,599
Would you like to try?

521
00:24:59,079 --> 00:24:59,880
What idea?

522
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,520
Isn't it hard for you to
return the money back?

523
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Then let's use this money
for the investment.

524
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,439
What kind of investment?

525
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:09,040
I happen to know someone.

526
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,400
Are you sure he's not fraud?

527
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,439
There're many financial
frauds these days.

528
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,640
Such as ones engaging in
internet financing.

529
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,040
I'm not stupid.

530
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,839
The person who I know
is really reliable.

531
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,119
No.

532
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,400
What if we lose everything?

533
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,160
This is hard-earned money of my parents.

534
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:21,959
He Qunfei,

535
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,680
what I want is to borrow
your money for the investment.

536
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,839
Are you going this far?

537
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,079
Fine. Never mind.

538
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,599
Let's go out and tell your parents.

539
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,520
Don't.

540
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,959
Siqi, I'm begging you.

541
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,119
I can keep the secret,

542
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,640
but you need to borrow me the money.

543
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,280
If this is my money,

544
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,880
I can give you however much you want.

545
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,920
But this money is from my parents.

546
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,160
He Qunfei,

547
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,719
today you are not rational,

548
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,959
instead of me.

549
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,119
Did I say that I won't
give this money back to your mom?

550
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,239
Never mind.

551
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,760
I will not take it
even if you change your mind now.

552
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,599
I won't owe any money to your family.

553
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,000
Let's tell your mom about the truth.

554
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,000
Ok.

555
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:00,959
I will tell them.

556
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:09,599
Did you give the money to Siqi?

557
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,760
Yes. I did.

558
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,680
But Siqi looked a little upset.

559
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,400
Is it not enough?

560
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
It's not like that.

561
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,359
It's not easy for us to
get a daughter-in-law.

562
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,199
You shall cherish her well.

563
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,000
Let go.

564
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,839
Robber!

565
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,680
Let go of it.

566
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,880
Let go of it.

567
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
Qunfei.

568
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,680
What are you doing?

569
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,199
When people get bad luck,

570
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,280
everything can go wrong.

571
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,000
Qunfei,

572
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,560
why are you taking so much money?

573
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,839
My parents gave the money to

574
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,560
my girlfriend as a present.

575
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,760
Your parents are so nice.

576
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,400
Your girlfriend must be happy.

577
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,599
I thought that Siqi and I

578
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,959
were ready to

579
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,640
get married.

580
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,400
So I bought the ring,

581
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,239
and proposed to her.

582
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,760
The day after that, my parents

583
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,000
called me and I happened to

584
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:30,839
tell them about it.

585
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,680
I said that she said yes.

586
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,599
Mr. Lin,

587
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,839
such a joke, right?

588
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:41,079
How can you say that?

589
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,079
A woman... I can understand that.

590
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,880
She just wants a house.

591
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,160
I, as an employee,

592
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,119
don't have a rich dad,

593
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,439
or graduate from abroad.

594
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,400
I want to succeed,

595
00:27:58,239 --> 00:27:59,479
but how can I make it?

596
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,479
Why?

597
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,800
You don't believe in miracle?

598
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,160
Don't be too pessimistic.

599
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,800
Miracle may happen to you one day.

600
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:11,680
Take myself as an example.

601
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,000
I have experienced
such relationship problems.

602
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,800
Mr. Lin,

603
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,119
you are the executive.

604
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:25,040
What kind of relationship problems
could you have?

605
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,359
Qunfei.

606
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,119
Actually I'm similar to you.

607
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
The only difference might be that

608
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,160
I am the executive.

609
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,079
In this city,

610
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:38,160
as long as you work hard,

611
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,119
and as long as you
strive forward,

612
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,239
you can always have the chance.

613
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,079
My parents

614
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,479
are both farmers in small town.

615
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,040
I was thinking when
I was in college that

616
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:56,719
I will do my best after I graduate

617
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,719
to buy them a big house in Shanghai.

618
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,560
Thus they can enjoy life.

619
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,040
But now,

620
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,079
I don't even have an apartment
for myself.

621
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,719
Actually my family is
in a worse situation.

622
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,040
I assume you don't know it.

623
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,760
My mom doesn't even have a job.

624
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Besides,

625
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
my dad passed away long time ago.

626
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:29,560
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

627
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,160
People who fight for living like us,

628
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,599
actually are all the same.

629
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:39,719
We hope that we can
have a successful career,

630
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,119
and do more for our parents.

631
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,040
Although there is "VP" in my title,

632
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,439
I'm still just a higher level employee

633
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,520
who needs to follow other's order.

634
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,640
All I could do is

635
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:56,439
buying a house for my mom in a town.

636
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
Really.

637
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,760
I'm ashamed.

638
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,280
Therefore,

639
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,280
we need to work harder,

640
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,199
if we want to

641
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,520
set our foot in this city,

642
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
and succeed.

643
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,280
Succeed?

644
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,439
I don't have a girlfriend any more.

645
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,680
How do I succeed?

646
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:20,800
Qunfei.

647
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,880
Cheer up.

648
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,959
You will have a woman.

649
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:27,400
as long as you have the ambition

650
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,640
to succeed.

651
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Then,

652
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,400
you will be the owner of
the relationship.

653
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,359
You can get everything you want,

654
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:38,160
and never have to
listen to other people.

655
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,520
So beautiful!

663
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,959
Teacher Xiaosu, happy birthday to you!

664
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:56,599
Thank you, Teacher Sun!

665
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,359
Thank you, kids!

666
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,359
Sister Du,

667
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:05,119
we made these together with Teacher Sun.

668
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,280
We have never made these,

669
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
and it's the first time for us.

670
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,719
The flour was sometimes too dry,

671
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,119
and sometimes too wet.

672
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,719
We finally baked it,

673
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,119
but it seems like it's
not in a good shape.

674
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,680
Teacher Du, please don't mind.

675
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,560
Thank you, Teacher Sun.

676
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,880
Thank you kids.

677
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,160
You're welcome.

678
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,520
This cake is the

679
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,199
prettiest cake I've
ever seen in my life.

680
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,479
This birthday party is also the

681
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,959
one I have celebrated
with the most people,

682
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,359
and it's also the happiest one.

683
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,040
Thank you all.

684
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:42,280
You're welcome.

685
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,839
You're welcome.

686
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Kids,

687
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,000
let's cut the cake.

688
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:50,599
Hold on, hold on.

689
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,000
You haven't made a wish yet.

690
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,959
Right, Teacher Du hasn't
made a wish yet.

691
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,359
Right, make a wish!

692
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
Right, Teacher Du can make three wishes.

693
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,239
-Alright?
-Right.

694
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,839
Alright.

695
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,000
Then Teacher Xiaosu

696
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,160
will start making wishes now.

697
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,239
The first wish.

698
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,920
I hope that all the kids can

699
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,880
be healthy and safe.

700
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,520
Hope they can grow up happily.

701
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,000
Ok.

702
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,000
The second wish.

703
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,439
I hope that Teacher Sun's girlfriend

704
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,000
can come back soon.

705
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,800
The third wish...

706
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,280
The third wish...

707
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,400
Hope that

708
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,359
all the lovers can have happy endings.

709
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:48,920
Ok.

710
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,400
Uncle Lei, Uncle Lei.

711
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,520
Uncle Lei is here.

712
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,479
Uncle Lei, Uncle Lei.

713
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:57,199
Uncle Lei is here.

714
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:58,640
Move, move.

715
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,719
Move, move, move

716
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:04,680
Let's move for Uncle Lei,

717
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,640
alright?

718
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,760
Ok!

719
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,879
What?

720
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,360
You can't recognize me?

721
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:23,040
Why are you here?

722
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,120
Why can't I be here?

723
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:27,679
Uncle Lei,

724
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,879
do you prepare gifts for teacher Xiaosu?

725
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,439
Sister Xiaosu will get mad if you don't.

726
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,360
She's even scared of herself
when she's mad.

727
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,159
Will she?

728
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,479
Yes.

729
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,560
Isn't the fact that Uncle Lei is
the best gift?

730
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:46,000
Right, Teacher Xiaosu?

731
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,719
Sister Xiaosu.

732
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,760
These fireworks

733
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,919
were all prepared by Brother Yuzheng.

734
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
I was in a hurry and

735
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,199
I forgot to buy a gift.

736
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,560
I will make it up for you later.

737
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,600
This cake

738
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,600
seems to be handmade and additive-free.

739
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,439
Teacher Sun.

740
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,280
Yes.

741
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,760
This is our island limited edition,

742
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:08,719
right?

743
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,040
Right.

744
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:12,679
Ok.

745
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,639
Let's eat cake together.

746
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:15,959
Ok.

747
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,239
One, two, three.

748
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,159
Happy birthday.

749
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
-Why are you waking up so early?
-Why are you waking up so early?

750
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:52,639
Let's go.

751
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
Let me take you somewhere.

752
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Where are we going?

753
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,520
You will see.

754
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Why do you bring me here?

755
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:11,399
I'm still sleepy.

756
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,239
I want to watch the sunrise with you
on your birthday.

757
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:18,919
This is a habit of mine.

758
00:36:19,919 --> 00:36:20,959
On every birthday,

759
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
no matter where I am

760
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,919
I would wake up early and

761
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,159
watch the sunrise,

762
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,879
because it can bring me luck.

763
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,120
Hope that it can bring you luck too.

764
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,120
Thank you.

765
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,360
Actually, I've been uneasy

766
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,520
ever since you left.

767
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,120
About that night,

768
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:48,840
I'm really sorry.

769
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,199
It belongs to the past,

770
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,959
and there's no need to mention it.

771
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,919
It seems that you were mad,

772
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,520
otherwise you wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

773
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,639
I thought that you were really

774
00:37:00,879 --> 00:37:03,199
here to celebrate my birthday.

775
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:04,800
But it seems that you are

776
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:07,239
here to criticize me.

777
00:37:09,919 --> 00:37:11,199
How would I dare?

778
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,320
You said before that

779
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,760
you wanted to stay at Yutian forever.

780
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,919
So I guess that there must be a reason

781
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,159
that you left without saying goodbye.

782
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,120
Quitting the job is my decision.

783
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,560
I was just too tired.

784
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,639
Xiaosu.

785
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,719
I know that Fanlv talked to you.

786
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,479
Yes.

787
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,159
Miss Jiang did talk to me.

788
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,159
I bet that she told you something.

789
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,639
Nothing.

790
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,040
We just had a short chat.

791
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,760
Short chat?

792
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:55,959
Yes.

793
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,840
Aren't you here to watch
the sunrise with me?

794
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,959
I'm really enjoying this moment.

795
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,239
Look!

796
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,719
It comes out.

797
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,840
The sun comes out.

798
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:18,719
It actually comes out.

799
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,199
It's so pretty.

800
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:29,439
Uncle sun, how are you?

801
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:32,000
I'm Du Xiaosu.

802
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,120
Thank you for bringing us the warmness.

803
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,560
Du Xiaosu,

804
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,399
happy birthday!

805
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,719
Hope you can be happy forever.

806
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,280
Thank you.

807
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:54,600
I've very happy.

808
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
This washbasin is pretty good.

809
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Help me take it.

810
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:20,560
Isn't it better to get

811
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,719
a bigger washbasin?

812
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,159
It's fine.

813
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,159
Let's take the bigger one.

814
00:39:28,879 --> 00:39:30,879
How much is this washbasin?

815
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Five yuan for each.

816
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,399
Can I have a discount if I buy two?

817
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,479
No.

818
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,199
If I buy two,

819
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,000
can you offer a discount?

820
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,760
Here you go.

821
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Thank you.

822
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,040
I haven't even finished bargaining.

823
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,080
Why are you so hurry to pay for it?

824
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:46,320
If you keep bargaining,

825
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,199
then we can't get home before darkness.

826
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,239
The wind is rising.

827
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,879
The weather might change
and we might not be able to go back.

828
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,040
Let's hurry up.

829
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,439
If you don't want to shop with me,

830
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,479
you can go back first
and I can shop by myself.

831
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,520
