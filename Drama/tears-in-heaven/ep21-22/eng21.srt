16
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Lin.

17
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,360
Lei Yuzheng had quite a fall this time.

18
00:02:13,839 --> 00:02:16,520
It'll take a while for him
to make a comeback.

19
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
I didn't expect that.

20
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,559
I…

21
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,279
What didn't you expect?

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,240
Nothing.

23
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,320
Mr. Lin, it's good that
Lei Yuzheng is gone now.

24
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,320
Why do you still seem
to worry a lot?

25
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,559
You can take this chance
to get promoted, right?

26
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,839
Promoted?

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,759
I, Lin Xiangyuan, will never
take advantage of other people.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,839
I was gonna fight with
Lei Yuzheng face to face.

29
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,520
If I win then,

30
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,279
it means that
I am really more capable than him.

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,800
But the result means everything.

32
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,919
As long as you become
the president of Yutian,

33
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,080
no one cares about
what means you took.

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,119
They will all look up to you.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Xieli,

36
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,839
what do you think
Lei Yuzheng is doing right now?

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,199
What else can he do?

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,839
He must be crying out loud at the court.

39
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,279
Now, the old is in hospital,

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,919
and the young is in jail.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,000
Now it's time for you, Mr. Lin,
to take charge.

42
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,880
Mr. Jiang, directors are waiting for you
to join the meeting.

43
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,440
Look at this,
these reporters are going way too far.

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,360
They used such title as
"Yutian's stock market scandal" and

45
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,679
"Construction of Entertainment Center
project might be called off".

46
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,679
They are talking nonsense.

47
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,039
Mr. Jiang,
that's what reporters usually do.

48
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,360
As long as they can make
a big news out of something,

49
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,000
they would exaggerate everything.

50
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,440
Speaking of that,

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,039
not only those reporters,

52
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,839
but also our employees are

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,880
talking about rumors right now.

54
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,839
What do you mean?

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,720
They are all saying that

56
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,119
it will take a while for Lei Yuzheng
to make a comeback.

57
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,960
And if no one takes the lead right now,

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
the Entertainment Center project
will be affected.

59
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,240
Mr. Jiang,

60
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,359
everyone is waiting for you
to take the lead.

61
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,760
But I don't know much about

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,760
the Entertainment City project.

63
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,559
If I take over right now,

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,399
isn't it too hasty?

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,079
I might trap myself

66
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,440
later on.

67
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,880
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,079
is Fanlv feeling better?

69
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,559
How's her appetite?

70
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,679
I'm planning to go back to my hometown,

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,279
and bring some delicacies
for her to improve her health.

72
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:46,679
Fanlv is fine.

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,279
Xiangyuan, you are very thoughtful.

74
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,920
Ah, regarding the
Entertainment Center project,

75
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,880
you know it the best
besides Lei Yuzheng.

76
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,920
Come and join the meeting with me.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,799
Lin, have a seat.

78
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
Regarding what happened to
Yutian recently,

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,959
I don't have to recap it.

80
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,000
Why don't all of you

81
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,679
contribute your ideas?

82
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,279
Such a big company

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,720
needs a leader.

84
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,720
Jiang, you should think of a way.

85
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,600
Yuzheng is in trouble,

86
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,320
and brother Ting is in the hospital.

87
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,559
Everyone must be very anxious.

88
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,760
But it's still important

89
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,079
to maintain the order
within the company.

90
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,480
Why don't we vote by raising hands

91
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:03,920
to elect a temporary president
to take charge for now?

92
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,679
How does that sound?

93
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
As far as I'm concerned,
we can skip that step.

94
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:09,440
The one who can take charge
is you, Mr. Jiang.

95
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,720
You should take this position.

96
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,000
Me?

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,119
No, no, no. How could it be me?

98
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,559
Don't be modest.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
The Entertainment Center project
belonged to Xinsheng in the first place.

100
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,640
Although Yutian is in charge of
the development,

101
00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:25,079
you also have the responsibility.

102
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,239
Mr. Jiang, don't be so modest.

103
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,920
Mr. Jiang, you should take it.

104
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
Mr. Jiang, I will vote for you.

105
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:30,679
I agree.

106
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,679
Yes, I agree.

107
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,040
All right. Since everyone has
such high expectation in me,

108
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,160
and we should take the overall interests
of the company into account.

109
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,399
I will just take this position for now,

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,920
and hope everyone could understand.

111
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,000
Of course.

112
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:53,720
But a leader cannot fight by oneself.

113
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,480
It's not enough to do it all

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,119
by myself.

115
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,119
Lin has been my assistant
for so many years.

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,160
We've built great rapport
with each other.

117
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,920
Everyone here has witnessed

118
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,320
his ability.

119
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,079
So I suggest that I will supervise

120
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,880
the Entertainment Center project,
and Lin will be in charge.

121
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,959
I know that Lin is my future son-in-law,

122
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,799
and I should have left him out of this,
so that people won't gossip about it.

123
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:32,679
But to the benefit of Yutian
and the Entertainment Center project,

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,000
I think we can entrust Lin
with this task.

125
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,640
Lin, the investment that
you were working on

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,160
is still possible, right?

127
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,760
I'll keep working on it.
I think it is possible for us to get it.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,920
If Lin can collect money
for the Entertainment Center project,

129
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,959
he will be the hero of Yutian.

130
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:52,959
We can't even thank him enough.

131
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
Everyone,

132
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,279
at the very beginning,
Xinsheng cooperated with Yutian

133
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,160
on the Entertainment Center project
by offering it as a gift.

134
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,119
Since the board has decided

135
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,959
that I will take charge of this project,

136
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,760
I know how much responsibility I have.

137
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,920
I won't let anyone down.

138
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,239
(Police)

139
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:36,599
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

140
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,799
Get off the car.

141
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:44,579
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

142
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,760
According to Article 180

143
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
of the Criminal Law
of the People’s Republic of China,

144
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:59,280
the defendant Lei Yuzheng,
the prior president of Yutian,

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,200
is sentenced for 8-month detention
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

146
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,880
due to the charge of
disclosing confidential information,

147
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,760
and immediate execution is required.

148
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,499
(Silence)

149
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,880
Time is like a one-way road.

150
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,559
You can only move forward
without going back.

151
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,239
There's no pure luck in this world.

152
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,960
Everyone needs to pay the price
for their mistakes.

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,400
Go inside.

154
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,280
My name is Liu Siyang.

155
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,479
It must be the first time for you.

156
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,000
I can tell that
you're not used to here yet.

157
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,679
It will be better in a few days.

158
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,559
Here you are.

159
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,400
Xiaosu, it was on TV.

160
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,440
Did Lei Yuzheng actually go to jail?

161
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,239
I couldn't do anything about it.

162
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,200
There was no evidence and

163
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
nothing was beneficial towards him.

164
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,880
He also didn't want to explain about it,

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,239
and took all the responsibilities
by himself.

166
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,679
So,

167
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,159
I couldn't do anything
but watching him get accused.

168
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,799
It's all my fault.

169
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,760
I couldn't do anything.

170
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,479
I couldn't help him.

171
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,599
What happened to Lei Yuzheng this time

172
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
is really a big issue.

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,159
Since when...

174
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,119
Siqi,

175
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,719
Let's break up.

176
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
What did you say?

177
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,559
Mr. Lei went to jail,

178
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
and the chairman is in a coma.

179
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,880
It's all because of me.

180
00:11:58,479 --> 00:11:59,719
Since the past cannot be changed,

181
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,799
I cannot just sit here and

182
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,880
have date with you.

183
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:08,119
He Qunfei, what is wrong with you?

184
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,559
Don't regret if you say this.

185
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,159
There's nothing to regret.

186
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,080
Things are already this bad.

187
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,479
I deserve whatever it costs.

188
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,960
He Qunfei, don't be so impulsive.

189
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,159
You can leave this behind.

190
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,640
He Qunfei,

191
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,799
you wanna break up, right?

192
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,440
From now on, let's go our own ways.

193
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,799
Don't you dare regret it.

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Siqi.

195
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,000
He Qunfei, get out of here now.

196
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,359
Now.

197
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:37,359
Siqi, calm down.

198
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,960
Xiaosu.

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,440
I really appreciate your help
this whole time.

200
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,599
See you.

201
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
What are you two doing?

202
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,919
You can't fall asleep, right?

203
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,880
There're only two of us

204
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,039
in this 9-square meter room.

205
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,159
If you keep silent like this,

206
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,039
it won't be long till

207
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,840
we both got crazy.

208
00:13:58,719 --> 00:13:59,919
You seem to be

209
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,320
someone who has power,

210
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,080
and can't bear with living in jail.

211
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:06,960
No wonder.

212
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,080
Rich people,

213
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,080
who's like you,

214
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,880
always seem proud when nothing happens.

215
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,239
As long as they get troubled,

216
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,559
they will look hopeless.

217
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,159
I look down on people like you.

218
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
What did you say?

219
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,239
Nothing.

220
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't have respect
for people like you.

221
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,440
Why?

222
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,000
Too weak.

223
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,559
You hit me?

224
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,799
Hit me! Come, hit me!

225
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:56,359
Hit me!

226
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:01,799
Hit me!

227
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,119
Stop it!

228
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,159
Do it!

229
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:06,440
What are you doing?

230
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,599
What are you doing?

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,840
Stand aside.

232
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,880
Who started first?

233
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,119
Xiangyuan,

234
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,159
was what Fanlv said true?

235
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:25,159
Did He Qunfei really fight with you?

236
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:26,640
Yes.

237
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,200
So, you do have something to do

238
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,719
with Lei Yuzheng's trouble?

239
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,919
Mr. Jiang, I've been serving you
for such a long time.

240
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,400
How could you not trust me?

241
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,239
How could I possibly do such

242
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,640
disgraceful thing?

243
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,559
Yes.

244
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,000
He Qunfei fought with me
because of Lei Yuzheng.

245
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,119
But it was because
he cares about Lei Yuzheng so much

246
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,919
that he lost his mind.

247
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,840
He's been thinking of me
as Lei Yuzheng's enemy,

248
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,080
and always suspecting me.

249
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,960
But I can understand that,

250
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:57,880
because I was sent by Xinsheng anyway,

251
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,000
and I don't have a direct relationship
with Lei Yuzheng.

252
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,280
What do you mean by that?

253
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,559
It was my decision to send you to Yutian

254
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,200
for the Entertainment Center project.

255
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:10,640
If He Qunfei is opinionative towards you

256
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,039
just because of this,

257
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,880
he's really shortsighted.

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,559
You don't have to care about him.

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,719
Sure.

260
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,119
I will keep it in mind.

261
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,599
Dad, do you think it's that simple?

262
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,400
Fanlv,

263
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,799
do you think I can actually do

264
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,440
anything that hurts Lei Yuzheng?

265
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,320
Do I seem like a cunning person

266
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,119
to you?

267
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,960
I've never been fussy with you.

268
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,080
You loved Lei Yuzheng,

269
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,719
but I don't care, because I love you.

270
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
This is my fate.

271
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm not complaining about anything.

272
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,200
But you can't just get me wrong

273
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,880
because of him.

274
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:54,840
I'm also flesh and blood,

275
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:57,719
and can get hurt.

276
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,319
Mr. Jiang, I swear that

277
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,000
I never did anything

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,400
against Lei Yuzheng,

279
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,439
not to mention anything
that would let you down.

280
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,959
If you don't believe me,

281
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,959
you can send me to jail

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,359
to replace Lei Yuzheng.

283
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,000
I won't say anything.

284
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,839
Don't get in a rage.

285
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:33,839
Fanlv,

286
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,160
I can understand that

287
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,400
you worry about Yuzheng.

288
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,640
But you shouldn't get Xiangyuan wrong

289
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,040
just because of Yuzheng.

290
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,119
He's your fiance after all.

291
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,760
If you don't even believe in him,

292
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,880
how do you expect him to feel?

293
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,040
Dad.

294
00:17:54,479 --> 00:17:55,479
Mr. Jiang.

295
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,319
It's all worth it

296
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,599
after hearing your words.

297
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,800
Alright, I have nothing else to say.

298
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,160
Xiangyuan, have a seat.

299
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,599
She has been spoiled since

300
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,160
she was a kid.

301
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,079
Please understand and forgive her.

302
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,959
Mr. Jiang,

303
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,040
meeting Fanlv

304
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,319
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

305
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Don't worry.

306
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,439
I will take care of her in my whole life

307
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,520
and treat her well.

308
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,352
(Medical Room)

309
00:19:03,479 --> 00:19:04,439
Fine.

310
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,079
Who started fighting?

311
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,760
You sure can handle a lot.

312
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,959
Lei Yuzheng, you just came inside.

313
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,680
I can understand
that you are not in a good mood.

314
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,839
But still, you shouldn't vent your anger

315
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,680
by harming your cellmate.

316
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,680
Read the prison rules and regulations again.

317
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,219
(Prison Rules and Regulations)

318
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,520
Do you know why I keep you two together?

319
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,680
Because you two had similar charges,

320
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,239
you should both reflect on yourselves.

321
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,520
After you get out,

322
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,479
try to be someone
who's beneficial for the society.

323
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:37,040
Also, I'm telling you that

324
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,000
he has serious heart problems.

325
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,880
We wouldn't even let him do

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,640
the works that might exhaust him.

327
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,599
If you keep doing this,

328
00:19:47,239 --> 00:19:49,239
you should know the consequences.

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,479
Take them away.

330
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:54,880
Go.

331
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,160
Don't worry, everything's fine at home.

332
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,280
Take care of yourself.

333
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
You too.

334
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,079
How was it?

335
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:21,400
I'm sorry,
but the prisoner rejected to see you.

336
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,079
He…

337
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,680
still didn't want to see me?

338
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,880
Yes.

339
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,400
And he told you not to come again.

340
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,439
But he's quite worried about his father.

341
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,920
Is his father alright?

342
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,800
Please tell him that

343
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,199
his father…

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,079
his father is doing well.

345
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,719
Tell him not to worry.

346
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Here, I brought him some books

347
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,920
and some food.

348
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,479
Please give these to him.

349
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,599
OK.

350
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,839
We'll give them to him after inspection.

351
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Thank you.

352
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,359
But he's quite worried about his father.

353
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,119
Is his father alright?

354
00:21:22,219 --> 00:21:23,979
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

355
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:30,179
(He Qunfei)

356
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:34,920
Hello, Qunfei.

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,560
Do you know
which hospital Yuzheng's dad stays in?

358
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:20,280
Miss, who are you looking for?

359
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,359
I'm here to see Mr. Lei.

360
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,239
You must be Miss Du.

361
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Assistant He just called me.

362
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,719
How's he doing now?

363
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,560
Still the same.

364
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,239
He doesn't have any consciousness.

365
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,880
So, we could just sit here and wait.

366
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,560
We couldn't help much.

367
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:45,920
Can I speak to him for a bit?

368
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,040
Sure.

369
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,079
Thank you.

370
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,400
Mr. Lei,

371
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,760
I went to see Yuzheng today.

372
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:18,880
He…

373
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,040
He's doing good.

374
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,239
He's just getting a little bored.

375
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,280
I know that the person

376
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,439
he worries about the most is you.

377
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:31,880
I also told him that

378
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,160
you are doing well too,

379
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,640
and waiting for him to come back

380
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,119
and kick his ass.

381
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Mr. Lei,

382
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,959
please get better soon.

383
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:00,920
If you don't get better,

384
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,040
you may lose Yutian

385
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,199
and Yuzheng would have gone to jail
for nothing.

386
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,880
Please wake up soon.

387
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Let's go and see together.

388
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,280
What's this?

389
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,479
What else can it be?

390
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,599
Isn't it obvious?
(Announcement of Personnel Adjustment)

391
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,040
The guy fired by Mr. Lei

392
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,439
got lucky and
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

393
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,000
came back.

394
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,560
Now, assistant He is doomed.
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

395
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,839
Mr. Lin, please tell me

396
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,239
why you fired me.

397
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,640
The reason is simple.

398
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,000
Yutian is experiencing
many difficulties.

399
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,000
In order to improve the efficiency
within the company,

400
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,400
the board decided to

401
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:04,359
simplify the company structure
and reduce the number of employees.

402
00:25:06,239 --> 00:25:07,280
Is this reason good enough?

403
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,439
Fine.

404
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,800
So, is it the board's decision or

405
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:13,119
your decision?

406
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,839
What's the difference?

407
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:19,800
Is the job market so rigorous that

408
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,119
you don't want to leave?

409
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,199
You can't decide whether I leave or now.

410
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,560
Mr. Lei should be the one
who decides it.

411
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:26,520
I knew you would bring Lei Yuzheng up.

412
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,319
Do you think it's okay
to mention him in front of me?

413
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,479
He can't even protect himself now.

414
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,280
How can he possibly
care about other people?

415
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,319
Lin Xiangyuan, I'm warning you.

416
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,199
Don't go too far.

417
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,959
Assistant He,

418
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,319
seriously,

419
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:42,800
I'm doing this for your own good.

420
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,719
Even just for the punch I got from you,

421
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:47,079
it will be impossible for you
to stay in Yutian.

422
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,640
Not to mention that

423
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,239
Yutian is no longer
what it used to be anymore.

424
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,400
It's better for you to

425
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,439
work at somewhere else.

426
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,439
Ok.

427
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,160
Then, I will ask the board to decide.

428
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,640
The board?

429
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,079
Do you think that the board
has nothing to do

430
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,680
and they would even care about
such thing?

431
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,719
If they won't, I will.

432
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,880
Fanlv, why are you here?

433
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:34,880
I've heard a while ago that Mr. Lin

434
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,479
made big moves after promotion,

435
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,479
and fired
many loyal employees in Yutian.

436
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,839
And now,

437
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,439
you are chasing He Qunfei away?

438
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,760
It's just career transfer.

439
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,199
And reducing staff is normal
for a company.

440
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,439
I don't care about other people,

441
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
but you cannot fire him.

442
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,800
You can think of it
as I'm pleading for him.

443
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,280
You can take this back.

444
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,199
Fanlv,

445
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,160
you are making this hard for me.

446
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:14,880
Alright.

447
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,040
Since Mr. Lin is having difficulty,

448
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,680
I have to go ask the board.

449
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I will let Mr. An and uncle Wang

450
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,560
to grant my request.

451
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,319
Let's go.

452
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,000
Wait a second.

453
00:27:34,439 --> 00:27:35,520
Fine.

454
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,280
Let him stay.

455
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,199
Miss Jiang,

456
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:07,199
thank you so much today.

457
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,959
You don't need to thank me.

458
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm not doing this for you.

459
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm doing this for Yuzheng.

460
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I don't want his people to get affected.

461
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,880
That guy has been really loud
for the whole night.

462
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,280
I'm so sleepy.

463
00:28:30,439 --> 00:28:32,079
Let the brother give him a lesson.

464
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:32,959
What happened yesterday?

465
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:33,839
Brother, brother.

466
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,000
Who was making so much noise

467
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,239
that I couldn't fall asleep?

468
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,520
Him.

469
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,079
That skinny guy. It's him.

470
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,280
That's the person.

471
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,800
Hey, skinny. You got hurt?

472
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,079
Seems like you've got temper too.

473
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
Are your ears beaten to deaf?

474
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm talking to you.

475
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:14,560
You can't hear me, right?

476
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,896
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

477
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,359
Listen,

478
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,439
at this place,

479
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,319
don't go against me, got it?

480
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,479
Who are you?

481
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,479
Who do you think you are?

482
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Do you want to get beaten?

483
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,640
He's hitting people! Police!
He's hitting people.

484
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,520
He's beating people up.

485
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,479
Stop it.

486
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,439
Brother.

487
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:53,239
Police, he's beating people up.

488
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,359
Who started?

489
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,040
He. He started it.

490
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,880
It's him.

491
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,560
Don't you dare keep moving.

492
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,520
Qunfei, you have to help me.

493
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,719
I have to see Lei Yuzheng.

494
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,280
Ok.

495
00:30:22,357 --> 00:30:23,019
(Civilized Prison Cell)

496
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:31,560
Lei Yuzheng,

497
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,479
your subordinate He Qunfei came again.

498
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Go see him.

499
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:38,319
Captain Liang,

500
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,640
is he by himself?

501
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,719
There's also a girl.

502
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,079
The girl who's been coming here
often to see you,

503
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,400
but you kept turning down.

504
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:50,719
They beg me to not tell you,

505
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,359
but you should go see them.

506
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:53,640
It's hard for them to keep

507
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,239
visiting here so often.

508
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,560
It's been several times already.

509
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
What happened?

510
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:06,640
I just had nose bleeding.
It's not a big deal.

511
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:14,239
Let's go.

512
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:19,560
Bro,

513
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,079
how are you?

514
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,199
I'm good.

515
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:03,599
I said that I don't want to see her.

516
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,199
Why did you bring her here?

517
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,880
Would I be able to see you

518
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:09,520
otherwise?

519
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,439
Mr. Lei,

520
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,920
you should talk to Xiaosu a little bit.

521
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,280
There's nothing to talk about.

522
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,959
Don't you even have the courage to

523
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,160
hear some words from me?

524
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:29,199
We all miss you a lot.

525
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,560
Please take care of yourself.

526
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Soon you will be able to get out.

527
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,160
Du Xiaosu,

528
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,719
if you come here just to

529
00:32:41,199 --> 00:32:42,920
tell me these things,

530
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,239
there's no such need.

531
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,479
Lei Yuzheng.

532
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,160
I said that I don't want to see you.

533
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,359
Why would you still come here?

534
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,880
I hate when you act

535
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,280
so self-righteous.

536
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,239
I'm here to see you

537
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,880
because we are friends.

538
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,439
I'm your friend

539
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,239
who just wants to help you
as much as possible.

540
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,319
How do you plan to help me?

541
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,680
You can stay in jail for me,

542
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,640
or you can help me fly out of here?

543
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,479
What's more,

544
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,119
I've never helped you.

545
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
Even if I have,

546
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,959
it was an impulsive act,

547
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,800
and you don't need to worry about it.

548
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,280
Regarding "friends",

549
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,599
I'm no longer the leader of Yutian,

550
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,000
and I'm just a prisoner.

551
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,359
Do you want to make friends
with a prisoner?

552
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:43,599
Lei Yuzheng,

553
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,800
what kind of person do you think I am?

554
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,239
Did I make friends with you because of

555
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:53,439
your fame or social status?

556
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:55,079
Mr. Lei.

557
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,119
Xiaosu has been really
worried about you.

558
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:00,199
You didn't know it but

559
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,800
she has been running around

560
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,680
for you these days,

561
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:07,000
and she's pined away.

562
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,239
Du Xiaosu,

563
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,840
stop being mawkish.

564
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,000
Didn't you want to see me as a loser?

565
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,159
Watching a person who used to be proud

566
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,919
to fall to the bottom

567
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,679
like me

568
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,840
can satisfy your curiosity

569
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,280
and compassion, right?

570
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,719
I know what you are thinking.

571
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,040
The once extremely arrogant Lei Yuzheng

572
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,520
is no different than other people

573
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,360
when he has lost everything.

574
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,040
Maybe even worse than other people,

575
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,479
isn't it?

576
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,120
If it can make you feel better

577
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,360
to see me like this,

578
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,760
then say it.

579
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:49,600
I'm listening.

580
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,280
Du Xiaosu,

581
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:53,520
save it.

582
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,239
No matter it's your compassion

583
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,560
or curiosity,

584
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,439
you should be satisfied now.

585
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,280
From now on, please

586
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,080
live your life well

587
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,000
and don't think about me again,

588
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,679
or come here to visit me.

589
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,959
Not to mention caring about me.

590
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,639
Please leave.

591
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,600
Lei Yuzheng,

592
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:24,560
I...

593
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,760
we will wait for you.

594
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,399
Qunfei, you two can have a chat.

595
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,639
I will be outside.

596
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,719
Mr. Lei,

597
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,719
I think you have some misunderstanding
about Xiaosu.

598
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,000
It's been hard for her.

599
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,399
I know that it's been hard for her.

600
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
Just because I know it,

601
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,000
I have to push her away.

602
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,840
Don't you think that it's too selfish

603
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,080
to waste all her time and effort

604
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,199
on a prisoner?

605
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,919
I don't want to
get her involved in this.

606
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,239
But you took her here anyway,

607
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,159
so I had no choice other than saying
all those words.

608
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:46,639
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

609
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,639
So, I had no choice
other than saying all those words.

610
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:31,919
Bro,

611
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,080
try to think positively.

612
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,959
Women go check on you now

613
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,360
and cry in front of you.

614
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
But only few can last long.

615
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,560
I've seen too much.

616
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,639
Don't you want to talk about it?

617
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,199
What do you want to talk about?

618
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,560
You're talking now.

619
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,080
Actually, nothing much.

620
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,679
I just want to know how you got in here.

621
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,280
Financial case.

622
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:00,040
There're so many kinds of
financial cases.

623
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,120
What kind are you accused of?

624
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,959
Disclosing confidential information
of a public company.

625
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,560
How much did you earn

626
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:11,080
by doing it?

627
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,199
Not a cent.

628
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,239
Then, what did you do it for?

629
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:16,840
Nothing.

630
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,239
You are so…

631
00:38:47,439 --> 00:38:48,800
It's allowed to light a candle here?

632
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:50,520
No.

633
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,840
You're violating the prison regulations.

634
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
I've always been violating
the prison regulations.

635
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,560
Aren't you afraid that
the police might catch you?

636
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,199
So far,

637
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,800
I have never been caught.

638
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,959
What book are you reading?

639
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:20,800
You wouldn't know even if I tell you.

640
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:23,000
"When Genius Failed"

641
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,600
by Roger Lowenstein.

642
00:39:27,919 --> 00:39:29,520
How did know that?

643
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,320
What about this?

644
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,719
"The Money Game"

645
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,479
by Adam Smith.

646
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,679
Cool.

647
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,560
No wonder they put us together.

648
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
