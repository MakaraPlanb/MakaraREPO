on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

please come in later and ask us.

Is it OK?

What happened to Lin Xiangyuan?

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,600
It is so late.

27
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,520
Dad. Let's go inside.

28
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,440
Whatever happens,

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,199
it shouldn't be you to wait for him.

30
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
Good morning, Mr. Lin.

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,279
Mr. Lin, we have to hurry up.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,479
There was a call from
the press conference.

33
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,679
Mr. Jiang is already there.

34
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:09,199
Is he? He is really free.

35
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:10,800
Then let him wait.

36
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,639
Sure. You're busy with work.

37
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,399
It's reasonable

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,080
to be a little bit late.

39
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,000
-Mr. Lin.
-Mr. Lin.

40
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,919
Mr. Lin, may I ask you a few questions?

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,240
Hello, Mr. Lin.

42
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,320
What do you think of

43
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
the press conference today?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,639
Mr. Lin, may I ask about

45
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,039
your comments
on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

46
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,919
-Tell us please.
-Tell us please.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
You were entrusted with the mission
at a critical moment,

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,399
and you brought the company
an investment.

49
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:55,440
How did you make it?

50
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,960
What's wrong with these journalists?

51
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,080
Dad,

52
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,759
you are the one who was entrusted

53
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,919
and also who steered Yutian.

54
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,479
Why is everyone focusing on him?

55
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,960
Actually, about these questions,

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,440
you should ask Mr. Jiang.

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,800
At the critical moment,

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
if it wasn't Mr. Jiang
who saved the critical situation,

59
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:11,679
there may not be this press conference.

60
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,320
Never mind.
Xiangyuan has also done a lot.

61
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,720
For young man as he is,

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,720
it's ok to show himself off
a little bit.

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,839
Mr. Jiang is not only my teacher,

64
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
but also my leader.

65
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,040
I owe everything I've done

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,559
to Mr. Jiang for his

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,079
help and support behind the scenes.

68
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,760
So, thanks to Mr. Jiang,

69
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,040
I can achieve success today.

70
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,359
Mr. Lin, can I ask you another question?

71
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,000
For further questions,

72
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,399
let's go inside and ask,
shall we?

73
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,239
Ok. Excuse me.

Bro,

78
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,440
you have to watch
even if you don't want to.

79

This is the rule in the prison.

80
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,880

this is the first press conference
of Yutian Group

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,920
after the imprisonment
of the former president, Lei Yuzheng.

87
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,119
Is it him?

88
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,760
Yes!

89
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:32,440
You don't look like that.

90
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,880
But I've been proven right.

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,320
I know you're not common.

92
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,200
So what?

93
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:43,200
Nobody is common in this room.

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,040
…Now he is in jail with us.

95
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,799
First of all, thank you all

96
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,279
for coming here. Today…

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
I guess,

98
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,959
your imprisonment

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,119
just gave this man a chance, right?

100
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,040
Make or break.

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
You can't blame others.

102
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,559
After the Entertainment Center project
is completed,

103
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,480
there will be

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
a grander celebration.

105
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm full of confidence about it.

106

The Entertainment Center project

107
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,640

along the way.

109

Thus, on behalf of Yutian Group,

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,839
I'd like to express my deep gratitude

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,119
to everyone
who has contributed to this project.

112
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:31,959
Dad.

113
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,440
I still remember

114
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,600
when Yuzheng signed with S.G.,

115
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,559
it was also like this.

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,119
There was
a spectacular press conference.

117
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,559
Probably you have forgot.

118
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,119
But I haven't.

119
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
The person standing here
to give the speech

120
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,839
shouldn't be Lin Xiangyuan.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,399
It should be Yuzheng.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,440
Yuzheng is a good boy.

123
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,679
It's just...What a pity.

124
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,000
Fine. Forget it.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My little girl.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not blaming you.

127
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:14,519
But since you're already engaged with
Lin Xiangyuan,

128
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,600
you shouldn't think about Lei Yuzheng
all the time.

129
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,839
What if Lin Xiangyuan is aware of this…

130
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,679
Dad,

131
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:24,359
I regret it.

132
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,000
At last.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,559
What?

134
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,440
Please allow me to thank...

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,559
What's wrong, Fanlv?

136
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,839
Nothing. I just feel something wrong
with my stomach.

137
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,040
…It's my teacher,

138
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,440
Mr. Jiang Jin.

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,880
He turns out to be a rich person.

140
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,119
So what?

141
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,600
He is still imprisoned here

142
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,119
like us.

143
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,200
Come on.
Let me have an interview with you.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,320
Talk about how you feel now.

145
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,480
-Yes. Tell us.
-Tell us.

What are you doing?

Wanna a fight?

148
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,959
If I don't know you're rich,

149
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,519
I will let it go.

150
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,559
Since I know that now,

151
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,880
I'll beat you up.

152
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,760
Yuzheng, what are you doing?

153
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,959
Don't bother.

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,720
There are guards at the door.

155
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,519
You are not content with that!

156
00:08:28,559 --> 00:08:29,640
Not content!

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,119
What are you doing?

158
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,119
What's going on here?

What's wrong with you?

163
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,599
Siyang, are you ok?

164
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,479
What happened?

165
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,919
He had a heart attack.

166
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,719
Please call the doctor!

167
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,880
Call the doctor!

168
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,400
Open all the windows.

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,320
Ventilate the room.

Siyang, come on.

171
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:53,479
Is he pretending?

172
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,320
Isn't he?

It's real.

175
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,200
It's all right.

176
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,679
Breathe in through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

Miss Jiang,

185
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,479
you don't look well.

00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,359
I'm fine.

188
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,300
(Qingpu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University)

189
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,479
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

190
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,960
You said that
Yutian has a press conference today?

191
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,320
Why don't you go there?

192
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:24,919
For what?

193
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,799
I am just nobody now.

194
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,919
It doesn't matter whether I go or not.

195
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,400
Besides,

196
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,479
I can't stand the showy look

197
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,719
of Lin Xiangyuan.

198
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,119
I'm afraid I'll punch him if I go there.

199
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:42,239
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

200
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,080
Xiaosu,

201
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,799
Mr. Lei's hand just moved!

202
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,840
Look!

203
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,599
It's really moving!

204
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,479
Doctor! Doctor!

205
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,440
Doctor.

206
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,359
Mr. Lei just moved his hand.

207
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,559
Mr. Lei.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
He's awake! Mr. Lei is awake!

209
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,559
Great！

210
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,320
Fanlv, how are you doing?

211
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,799
Are you still not feeling good?

212
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm fine. Much better.

213
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,559
Dad, I have something to deal with.
I've got to go.

214
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,159
Ok.

215
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,760
Why is she distracted?

216
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,479
Mr. Lin.

217
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,840
Mr. Jiang,

218
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll go to the construction site
with Mr. Xie.

219
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,280
Are you coming with us?

220
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:04,400
You go ahead.

221
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,640
I've been sitting all day,

222
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,479
and I've really got some backache.

223
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm old and useless.

224
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:11,280
Come on.

225
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,000
You're vigorous.

226
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,559
Let me drive you home.

227
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,719
As a man,

228
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,320
you shall not nag me!

229
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,080
Business comes first.

230
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,239
Ok, take care.

231
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:24,416
(Press Conference)

232
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,799
Mr. Lin, let's go.

233
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,440
Mr. Lin.

234
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,840
The Entertainment Center project is
in great demand for money.

235
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
A hundred million is just gone
in the blink of an eye.

236
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,919
How much more money is expected?

237
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,679
There is nothing to expect.

238
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,919
You mean...

239
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,520
Not even a penny.

240
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,799
Yutian has other projects
other than the Entertainment Center.

241
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,039
Just put the Entertainment Center
project aside.

242
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,760
By the way,

243
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,280
what's wrong with Miss Jiang just now?

244
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,599
I just saw her vomit.

245
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,840
Vomit?

246
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:09,559
Keep an eye on her these days.

247
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,760
No matter what happens,

248
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
you must let me know.

249
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,359
Ok.

250
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:12,479
Ok.

251
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:16,599
I'm telling you two that

252
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
the patient is incapable now

253
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,039
and can't express himself.

254
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,760
So, there must be someone
with him every minute.

255
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:24,239
Otherwise,

256
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,960
there will be problems.

257
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:26,880
Thank you.

258
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,039
Please leave.

259
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,119
Back off!

260
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,719
Bad guy.

261
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,479
Excuse me. Excuse me.

262
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,719
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,919
Mr. Lei.

265
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,320
Bad guy.

266
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,679
Excuse me. Excuse me.

267
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,039
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,200
Mr. Lei,

269
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,760
you can't talk like this.

270
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,479
You're bad, too. Back off!

271
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:55,440
Ask bad guys to leave! Leave!

272
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,760
Fine, fine, fine.

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,280
Well, he is leaving right now.

274
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
He is leaving right now.

275
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,239
Mr. Lei, you're right.

276
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm the bad guy.

277
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,520
Scold me.

278
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,799
He Qunfei, stop blaming yourself.

279
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,919
This is
the sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage.

280
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,799
He has no idea what he is talking about.

281
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,039
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

282
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,039
Xiaosu,

283
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,760
if Mr. Lei didn't wake up,

284
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,599
how could I explain to his son?

285
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,400
We were worried that

286
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,039
he could not wake up before.

287
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,719
But he's awake now.

288
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,960
So, we should be more confident now.

289
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:36,799
As long as he's not well,

290
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,400
we'll take care of him.

291
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
I believe that

292
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,559
he is gonna be fine one day.

293
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,880
Mr. Lei,

294
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,840
let's go home.

295
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,960
Here we go. Let's go home.

296
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,080
(Civilized Prison Cell)

297
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,960
Why are you back?

298
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,400
Why? You don't know me?

299
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,400
Are you fine?

300
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,119
Don't worry.

301
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm a cat

302
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,280
with nine lives, and I can't just die.

303
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,520
Come over here. Have a seat.

304
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,280
Did you do it on purpose that day?

305
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,039
On purpose?

306
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,320
Are you pretending to be sick,

307
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,479
as you are afraid that
I'm gonna get punished?

308
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,799
My heart

309
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,799
has problems.

310
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,039
If it was not you that day,

311
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,200
I would be gone.

312
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,760
Why? Wanna change your career?

313
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,679
Don't wanna be a boss anymore?

314
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,719
Wanna take a job in finance?

315
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,640
Just take a look.

316
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,559
It seems like

317
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,919
you've also studied abroad.

318
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:00,679
Stanford Graduate School of Business.

319
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,919
That explains.

320
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,479
Your father is very far-sighted.

321
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,679
For such a large Group like Yutian,

322
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,400
there has to be someone to take over.

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,520
I failed them.

324
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
You can't put it this way.

325
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,760
You're not the only one to stumble
in the business world.

326
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,159
After I

327
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,280
graduated from Lancaster University
in the UK,

328
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,159
I joined

329
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,840
BlackRock in the UK.

330
00:16:21,119 --> 00:16:22,320
In those years,

331
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,840
I was getting too arrogant.

332
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,039
See. This is where I am.

333
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,000
I haven't even asked you.

334
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,880
What's the reason?

335
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,799
Do you know
the Minsheng Road in Shanghai?

336
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:37,039
I

337
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,200
was the chief trader

338
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,479
in one of the fund management companies.

339
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,640
I don't need to tell you

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,799
the rest.

341
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:45,719
I don't get it.

342
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,880
I'm just like you.

343
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,440
Didn't you take all
the responsibilities on your own?

344
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,280
How do you know that?

345
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,840
Come out. It's time for exercise.

346
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:56,479
We have plenty of time. Take your time.

347
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,719
Mr. Lin, do you really wanna go there?

348
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,359
We should come sooner or later.

349
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,719
Since Lei Ting has been discharged
from the hospital,

350
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,560
we should come to see him.

351
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,920
He was the president of Yutian
after all.

352
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:37,079
Besides,

353
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,239
the one I hate is Lei Yuzheng,

354
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,680
not Lei Ting.

355
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:41,760
Let's go.

356
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,599
Mr. Lei.

357
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,520
Mr. Lei.

358
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,520
Guys.

359
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,680
Hello, uncle Duan.

360
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
This is our regard.

361
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,040
So sorry to cost you.
(Luxury Gifts)

362
00:18:22,199 --> 00:18:22,920
Thank you.

363
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,199
Not at all.

364
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,119
Mr. Lei is taking a nap.

365
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,400
He was here to get some sun, well...

366
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,920
He's awake.

367
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,680
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

368
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,040
I'll make you some tea.

369
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,920
Go ahead.

370
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,119
Mr. Lei, I'm Lin Xiangyuan.

371
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,719
Do you still remember?

372
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
Mr. Lei,

373
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,520
it seems you've recovered pretty well.

374
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,199
Great. That's great.

375
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,920
Then we can set our mind at rest.

376
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,479
Right, Mr. Lei.

377
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,959
Mr. Lin is very concerned about you.

378
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,479
As soon as he heard that
you were discharged,

379
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:03,920
he left his work

380
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,319
and came to see you.

381
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,199
Bad guys.

382
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,599
Mr. Lei, you're so good at joking.

383
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,319
We all work for you.

384
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,719
How can we be bad guys?

385
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:18,920
That's right.

386
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,920
Bad guys. Bad guys.

387
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,680
Back off! Back off!

388
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:30,719
Mr. Lin,
is Lei Ting really out of his mind?

389
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,079
Look at him.

390
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,119
He wants to eat us alive!

391
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,599
Mr. Lei,

392
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,800
don't you remember who I am?

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm Lei Yuzheng's colleague.

394
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,199
Yuzheng?

395
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,680
Right. Where is Yuzheng?

396
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:53,439
Where is Yuzheng?

397
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,280
Bad guy. Give Yuzheng back to me!

398
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,439
I'll kill you! Kill you!

399
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,280
Mr. Lin.

400
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,760
Back off!

401
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,640
Let's go.

402
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,319
Back off!

403
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,719
Or I'm gonna shoot!

404
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,439
Mr. Lei, calm down.

405
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,880
Can we take it easy?

406
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:11,199
Back off! Or I'll shoot!

407
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,119
Mr. Lei,

408
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,800
you wanna hit people with the stick?

409
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,160
All of you are bad guys! Bad guys!

410
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,760
Please don't. Give it to me.

411
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,280
What's going on?

412
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,199
Excuse me.

413
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,079
Mr. Lei suffered a bad illness.

414
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:23,400
He hasn't recovered yet.
He's still confused.

415
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Are you hurt?

416
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,640
It's fine. It's fine.

417
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,079
Yuzheng, they are all bad guys.

418
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,439
They're guests.

419
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:29,880
You're bad, too.

420
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,719
Bad guy. Back off!

421
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:32,199
Look!

422
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,079
Back off! All of you!

423
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,160
Good lord.

424
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,839
He's yelling at everyone like this now?

425
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,520
He's out of his mind sometimes.

426
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Let's make it another day, shall we?

427
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,199
Fine.

428
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:43,479
Ask them to leave!

429
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,479
They 're gone.

430
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
Excuse me.

431
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,800
What's that about?

432
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,079
It's bloody hell out of luck.

433
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:00,359
Got beaten for nothing.

434
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,680
He is out of your mind, isn't he?

435
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,400
Why is it so easy for him to get angry?

436
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,280
Never mind.

437
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
There is no need
to take offence at a patient.

438
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,199
Let him take it out.

439
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,719
Just consider it as

440
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,160
an apology I make to him.

441
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,040
Now Lei Yuzheng is in jail.

442
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,280
He is so sick.

443
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,479
Yutian shall count on me.

444
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,880
That's true.

445
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:25,920
You're the manager
of Yutian from now on.

446
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,079
You forgot about Jiang Jin and others.

447
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,880
Mr. Jiang is your future father-in-law.

448
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,800
He must be on your side.

449
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,479
Miss Jiang, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

450
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Pregnant?

451
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,439
How could that happen?

452
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,839
Are you making a mistake?

453
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,040
Look at the report.

454
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't worry. It's already
one month and a half.

Fanlv.

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,520
Why are you so grief when you see me?

462
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,119
Is it because I'm getting old?

463
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,719
I just didn't expect that

464
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,040
we would meet here.

465
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,479
Look at you now.

466
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,479
I feel very sorry.

467
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,239
Don't worry. I'm great.

468
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:15,199
If only
we could go back to our childhood.

469
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,839
I still remember that

470
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,079
lemon soda was your favorite drink.

471
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:25,640
You liked to make fun of girls
with caterpillars.

472
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,839
You also liked to defend Zhenrong.

473
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,439
We were carefree at that time.

474
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,520
We used to be together every day.

475
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,040
How wonderful it was!

476
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,719
This is fate.

477
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,479
You're too young for believing in fate.

478
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,880
Don't you think so?

479
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,239
I don' t believe in fate.

480
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,359
I am used to
making fate submitted to me.

481
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,719
But I've gradually realized that

482
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,599
fate will always give you a blow

483
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,040
out of surprise,

484
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,959
so that you'll know that
your previous ambitions

485
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,400
were just a joke.

486
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,920
Fanlv, remember that,

487
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,160
no matter when,

488
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,640
I'm your family.

489
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,920
I know.

490
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
I didn't want you to treat me
like a sister before.

491
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,040
Now I've realized

492
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,640
how much I rely on you.

493
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,880
As long as you're around,

494
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,199
no matter what serious things happen,

495
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,640
I won't be scared.

496
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,520
Now I've grown up.

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,680
Now that I've made my decision,

498
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:44,760
I have to face it on my own.

499
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,439
I just came to see you.

500
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,719
As long as I see you,

501
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,479
I'll feel peace.

502
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,560
Fanlv.

503
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,239
Tell me.

504
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,119
Is there anything wrong?

505
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,359
Yuzheng, stop asking.

506
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,719
You're right.

507
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,839
Some things are meant to be happening.

508
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,800
Yuzheng,

509
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:14,920
don't worry.

510
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:17,199
No matter what happened,

511
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,479
no matter what I did,

512
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,880
I'll be good.

513
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,599
I'll wait for you to come out.

514
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,839
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,280

516
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:32,760
I wish you are happy.

517
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,119
I will.

518
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,560
Don't worry about me.

520
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,640

522
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:08,800

524

525
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,599

Why don't you tell me earlier?

531

Yes! Yes! Yes!

532
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,640
I can be a father!

533
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm a father! Yes!

537
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,520
miss Jiang is going to see
the obstetrics doctor tomorrow.

538
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:12,160
Ok.

539
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,920
Help me decline the work tomorrow.

540
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,920
I'll go with her.

541
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,839

542

She called the doctor for abortion.

Abortion?

544
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:33,119
That is my child!

545
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,119
It's my family's blood.

546
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:35,439
How dare she?

547
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,719
You're right.

552
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,119
These are all Fanlv's favorite food.

553
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,839
And this.

554
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,560
Last time when you were in my office,

555
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,479
you said this was pretty tasty.

556
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,119

00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,439
Come over here.

559
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,359
Put them away.

560
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,079
Xiangyuan, you're really considerate.

561
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,520
I just said it,

562
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
and you keep it in your mind.

563
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
What's wrong?

564
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:20,800
Mr. Jiang, please don't tell Fanlv

565
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,280
those are from me.

566
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,520
Otherwise, she'll lose her appetite.

567
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,160
That's who she is.

568
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,199
Don't mind her words.

569
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
Come here. Have a seat.

570
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:37,800
Mr. Jiang,
Fanlv went to visit Lei Yuzheng?

571
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,800
Fanlv and Lei Yuzheng

572
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,920
grew up playing together.

573
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,400
It's natural to go to see him.

574
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,319
Mr. Jiang, you misunderstood me.

575
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,680
I'm just a little worried.

576
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,920
Although we are engaged,

577
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,959
but we're still not one family.

578
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm afraid I'm wasting her time.

579
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:01,160
To be honest,

580
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,880
even if Fanlv regrets it,

581
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,680
I have no complaints.

582
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:06,839
I just hope that

583
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,040
she can find someone
who really loves her,

584
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,520
instead of wasting her time
waiting for someone

585
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,920
who doesn't deserve her love.

586
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,719
You're right.

587
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,439
It seems that,
as long as you're not married,

588
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,959
Fanlv's mind

589
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
won't settle.

590
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,319
How about this?

591
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,760
You prepare whatever you need.

592
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,040
I'll talk to Fanlv later.

593
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,959
Hurry up with your marriage.

594
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,400
Yes, Mr. Jiang, thank you.

595
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,680
I gotta go.

596
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,599
(Civilized Prison Cell)

597
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,000
Lei Yuzheng.

598
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,079
Get ready. Go to the reception room.

599
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,599
I don't wanna meet her.

600
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:56,319
Ok.

601
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:10,439
That girl is here.
You still don't see her.

602
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
Not willing?

603
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,280
I can't.

604
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,359
Why? Are you afraid you can't
hold on yourself if you meet her?

605
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,400
Look at yourself.

606
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,040
If I meet her one time,
she will come for another time.

607
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,119
So, I can't meet her.

608
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,920
In my opinion,
that girl is pretty determined.

609
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,079
Even if you go on like this,

610
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,839
I don't think she'll give it up.

611
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:41,880
Then, I'll find a way to make her give up.

612
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,560
People like me

613
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:53,719
have to be cruel.

614
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,680
That's being responsible for others.

615
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,160
What's the girl's name again?

616
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,719
Du Xiaosu.

617
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,079
Du Xiaosu.

618
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,520
Du Xiaosu.

619
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:11,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:13,400
You are not cruel at all.

621
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,000
You love her deeply.

622
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,199
It really freaked me out

623
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,920
to take the flight of over ten hours.

624
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,920
Mrs. Shao, look at you.

625
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:55,599
Going abroad to recover really works.

626
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:58,560
You look much better
and are in a good mood.

627
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,439
What can I do?

628
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,040
Zhenrong has been gone
for more than one year.

629
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,920
I wanna be with him.
But the God doesn't allow me.

630
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,719
There is no way out.
I have to live a few more years.

631
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,680
Mrs. Shao, what are you talking about?

632
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,560
Fine. Forget it.

633
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,439
Could you please sort out the presents?

634
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,319
The nutrients are for Mr. Lei.

635
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,280
What happened to you?

636
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,079
Mrs. Shao, you have no idea.

637
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,640
When you're not around,

638
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:31,119
there was something wrong
with Lei's family.

639
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,359
We had a deal, right?

640
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,839
If you take the medicine seriously,

641
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,079
you'll get better soon.

642
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,800
I'm not sick. You are.

643
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,359
Mr. Lei, I'm coming.

644
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:43,400
Look.

645
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:45,040
Guess what I've brought to you.

646
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,920
Marshmallow.

647
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,040
Ok, here is the deal.

648
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,800
One bite of medicine,

649
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,199
one bite of marshmallow.

650
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,119
Come on.

651
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,479
Here.

652
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,839
Take it slow.

653
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,359
Great.

654
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,520
Take the marshmallow.
Take the marshmallow.

655
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:09,319
Actually,

656
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,680
there is no other way to coax him.

657
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,439
Just treat him like a kid.

658
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,280
Coax while persuading.

659
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,520
It depends on who it is.

660
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,560
Last time there were two guests.

661
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:22,280
Coax while persuading. It didn't work.

662
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,920
Mr. Lei kicked them out with the stick.

663
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,040
Who are they?

664
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,400
The last name of the boss is Lin.

665
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,880
They said they were Yuzheng's colleagues.

666
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,680
They specially came to see him.

667
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:32,959
Lin Xiangyuan?

668
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,160
It seems to be like him.

669
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,959
Du Xiaosu? What are you doing here?

670
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
Aunt Shao.

671
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Why don't you come in first?

672
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,160
I'll explain to you later.

673
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,560
Mr. Lei, what's wrong?

674
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
You have marshmallow on your lips.

675
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,239
Like a Santa Claus.

676
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,719
Let's take it off.

677
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,280
Done.

678
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,280
What did you just call me?

679
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,919
Marshmallow.

680
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Fine. Whatever you want.

681
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,639
As long as you're happy with it.

682
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,360
Marshmallow. Marshmallow.

683
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,520
Fine.

684
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,399
Mr. Lei, how about this?

685
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:35,399
As long as you're well behaved
in eating and sleeping,

686
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,879
every time I come to see you,

687
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,439
I'll bring you the marshmallow.

688
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,919
Fine. I promise.

689
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,120
Lei, this is Kaixuan.

690
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,239
Who is Kaixuan?

691
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:55,080
Mr. Lei, she's a friend.

692
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,520
Kaixuan is your friend.

693
00:34:57,919 --> 00:34:59,320
A good friend.

694
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,560
A good friend?

695
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,000
He's confused again.

696
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,239
Aunt Shao, don't be sad.

697
00:35:13,439 --> 00:35:14,439
The doctor said that

698
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,879
this is the sequela of
cerebral hemorrhage.

699
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,199
He'll get better in a while.

700
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,120
All we need to do is
to take good care of him.

701
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,760
You've been taking care of him recently?

702
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,560
Ms. Shao, you have no idea.

703
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,239
Thanks to Miss Du,

704
00:35:29,479 --> 00:35:31,040
she has been coming all the time to
take care of Mr. Lei.

705
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:32,479
Though Mr. Lei is

706
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,639
confused sometimes,

707
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:35,280
who is the good guy or bad guy,

708
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:36,879
he knows it.

709
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,760
Don't you, Mr. Lei?

710
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,479
Marshmallow, good guy.

711
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,479
See?

712
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Mr. Lei, how about this?

713
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,760
Let me talk with Aunt Shao.

714
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Uncle Duan will take a walk with you
and get some sun.

715
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,479
Ok.

716
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:55,959
Fine.

717
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:56,679
Ok?

718
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,320
Great!

719
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,840
Let' go. Slow down.

720
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,959
I'll leave you alone.

721
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,360
Mr. Lei is just like a child.

722
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:18,879
As long as you spend more time with him
and talk to him,

723
00:36:18,959 --> 00:36:20,360
he'll be happy.

724
00:36:23,239 --> 00:36:24,399
Have you ever thought about it?

725
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,840
After he is recovered,

726
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,520
how are you going to
explain about Yuzheng to him?

727
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:32,760
I think...

728
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:36,959
I can't even think about it now.

729
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,399
Take one day at a time.

730
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,239
Aunt Shao, I didn't expect

731
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,719
we could talk like this.

732
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,760
It's all the past.

733
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,840
Thank you for helping Yuzheng
in the difficult time.

734
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:02,080
Lei Yuzheng offered me a lot of help.

735
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,560
He's in trouble now. I feel responsible.

736
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,479
There is one thing.

737
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,080
I hope you can do me a favor.

738
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,399
Lei Yuzheng is very stubborn.

739
00:37:20,959 --> 00:37:22,639
He's in such a big trouble now.

740
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,000
He certainly doesn't need
the pity from others,

741
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,360
and doesn't want to get others
in trouble.

742
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,320
So, he doesn't wanna see me right now.

743
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,919
But I know,

744
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,760
whom he is most worried about
is his father.

745
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:36,879
If you visit him next time,

746
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,120
please help me take this picture to him.

747
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,840
Thank you.

748
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:46,280
Don't say that. That's what I should do.

749
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,919
Miss, have you really made up your mind

750
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:25,719
to give up this baby?

751
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,159
If you haven't figured it out,

752
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,080
calm down and think it over.

753
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,000
Generally speaking,

754
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
we don't suggest
to give up the first baby.

755
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:38,479
If you can keep it, keep it.

756
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:42,639
No, I've made up my mind.

757
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:58,239
Lin Xiangyuan, you are following me!

758
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,439
Fanlv.

759
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,320
I am concerned.
You've suffered from vomiting recently.

760
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,320
I'm begging you.

761
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,679
Could you please keep the baby?

762
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,239
This baby is ours after all.

763
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm his father.

764
00:39:10,879 --> 00:39:11,479
In any case,

765
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,760
you should discuss with me.

766
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,000
Yes, you're the father of the baby.

767
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,520
But you know that

768
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,239
it's not the right time for this baby.

769
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,879
I know.

770
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,840
This baby is not our plan.

771
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,520
You're not prepared yet.

772
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:29,239
No matter how much you hate me

773
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,199
or be mad at me,

774
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,439
We're the parents of this baby.

775
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,479
The baby is innocent.

776
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,439
I'm begging you.

777
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,560
Could you please keep this baby?

778
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,120
I know you're very angry.

779
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,199
I swear.

780
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,439
No matter what you wanna do to me,

781
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,959
I promise
I won't fight back or swear back.

782
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,000
Even if you ask me to disappear,

783
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
I'll be fine.

784
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,159
As long as you keep this baby.

785
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,560
Fanlv, I shouldn't be with you,

786
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,159
knowing that you don't love me.

787
00:40:16,879 --> 00:40:17,959
I promise you.

788
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:20,239
I can disappear from your life.

789
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
Tomorrow...

790
00:40:23,919 --> 00:40:25,760
No. At once...

791
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,479
I will resign at once,

792
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:29,399
and leave the company and the city.

793
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:35,280
But if you can give birth to this baby,

794
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,199
I'll try all my best to love him

795
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:37,800
and protect him.

796
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,679
As long as he can stay,

797
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,320
it'll be enough for me.

798
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,800
I swear.

799
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,600
Wait a minute.
