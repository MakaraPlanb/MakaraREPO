on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

please come in later and ask us.

Is it OK?

25
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,919
What happened to Lin Xiangyuan?

26
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,600
It is so late.

27
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,520
Dad. Let's go inside.

28
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:17,440
Whatever happens,

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,199
it shouldn't be you to wait for him.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
Good morning, Mr. Lin.

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,279
Mr. Lin, we have to hurry up.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,479
There was a call from
the press conference.

33
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,679
Mr. Jiang is already there.

34
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,199
Is he? He is really free.

35
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:35,800
Then let him wait.

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,639
Sure. You're busy with work.

37
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,399
It's reasonable

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,080
to be a little bit late.

39
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,000
-Mr. Lin.
-Mr. Lin.

40
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,919
Mr. Lin, may I ask you a few questions?

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,240
Hello, Mr. Lin.

42
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,320
What do you think of

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
the press conference today?

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,639
Mr. Lin, may I ask about

45
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,039
your comments
on Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment?

46
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,919
-Tell us please.
-Tell us please.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
You were entrusted with the mission
at a critical moment,

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,399
and you brought the company
an investment.

49
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,440
How did you make it?

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,960
What's wrong with these journalists?

51
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,080
Dad,

52
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,759
you are the one who was entrusted

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,919
and also who steered Yutian.

54
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,479
Why is everyone focusing on him?

55
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,960
Actually, about these questions,

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
you should ask Mr. Jiang.

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,800
At the critical moment,

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,600
if it wasn't Mr. Jiang
who saved the critical situation,

59
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,679
there may not be this press conference.

60
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:40,320
Never mind.
Xiangyuan has also done a lot.

61
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:41,720
For young man as he is,

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,720
it's ok to show himself off
a little bit.

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,839
Mr. Jiang is not only my teacher,

64
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,320
but also my leader.

65
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,040
I owe everything I've done

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,559
to Mr. Jiang for his

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,079
help and support behind the scenes.

68
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,760
So, thanks to Mr. Jiang,

69
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,040
I can achieve success today.

70
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,359
Mr. Lin, can I ask you another question?

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,000
For further questions,

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,399
let's go inside and ask,
shall we?

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,239
Ok. Excuse me.

Bro,

78
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:29,440
you have to watch
even if you don't want to.

79

This is the rule in the prison.

80
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880

this is the first press conference
of Yutian Group

86
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
after the imprisonment
of the former president, Lei Yuzheng.

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,119
Is it him?

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,760
Yes!

89
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,440
You don't look like that.

90
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,880
But I've been proven right.

91
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
I know you're not common.

92
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,200
So what?

93
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,200
Nobody is common in this room.

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,040
…Now he is in jail with us.

95
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,799
First of all, thank you all

96
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:22,279
for coming here. Today…

97
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,640
I guess,

98
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,959
your imprisonment

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,119
just gave this man a chance, right?

100
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,040
Make or break.

101
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,720
You can't blame others.

102
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,559
After the Entertainment Center project
is completed,

103
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,480
there will be

104
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,160
a grander celebration.

105
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:41,760
I'm full of confidence about it.

The Entertainment Center project

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,640

108

along the way.

109

Thus, on behalf of Yutian Group,

110
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,839
I'd like to express my deep gratitude

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,119
to everyone
who has contributed to this project.

112
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:56,959
Dad.

113
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,440
I still remember

114
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
when Yuzheng signed with S.G.,

115
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,559
it was also like this.

116
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,119
There was
a spectacular press conference.

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,559
Probably you have forgot.

118
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,119
But I haven't.

119
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
The person standing here
to give the speech

120
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,839
shouldn't be Lin Xiangyuan.

121
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,399
It should be Yuzheng.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,440
Yuzheng is a good boy.

123
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,679
It's just...What a pity.

124
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,000
Fine. Forget it.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My little girl.

126
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not blaming you.

127
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,519
But since you're already engaged with
Lin Xiangyuan,

128
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,600
you shouldn't think about Lei Yuzheng
all the time.

129
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,839
What if Lin Xiangyuan is aware of this…

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,679
Dad,

131
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,359
I regret it.

132
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:50,000
At last.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,559
What?

134
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:52,440
Please allow me to thank...

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,559
What's wrong, Fanlv?

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,839
Nothing. I just feel something wrong
with my stomach.

137
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,040
…It's my teacher,

138
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,440
Mr. Jiang Jin.

139
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,880
He turns out to be a rich person.

140
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,119
So what?

141
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,600
He is still imprisoned here

142
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,119
like us.

143
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:18,200
Come on.
Let me have an interview with you.

144
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,320
Talk about how you feel now.

-Yes. Tell us.
-Tell us.

What are you doing?

Wanna a fight?

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,959
If I don't know you're rich,

149
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,519
I will let it go.

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,559
Since I know that now,

151
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,880
I'll beat you up.

152
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:44,760
Yuzheng, what are you doing?

153
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,959
Don't bother.

154
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,720
There are guards at the door.

155
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,519
You are not content with that!

156
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:54,640
Not content!

157
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,119
What are you doing?

158
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,119
What's going on here?

What's wrong with you?

163
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,599
Siyang, are you ok?

164
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,479
What happened?

165
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,919
He had a heart attack.

166
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,719
Please call the doctor!

167
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:11,880
Call the doctor!

168
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,400
Open all the windows.

169
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,320
Ventilate the room.

Siyang, come on.

171
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:18,479
Is he pretending?

172
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,320
Isn't he?

It's real.

175
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,200
It's all right.

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,679
Breathe in through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

Miss Jiang,

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,479
you don't look well.

00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:23,359
I'm fine.

188
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,300
(Qingpu Branch of Zhongshan Hospital,
Fudan University)

189
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,479
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

190
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,960
You said that
Yutian has a press conference today?

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Why don't you go there?

192
00:09:48,719 --> 00:09:49,919
For what?

193
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,799
I am just nobody now.

194
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:54,919
It doesn't matter whether I go or not.

195
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,400
Besides,

196
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,479
I can't stand the showy look

197
00:09:59,479 --> 00:10:00,719
of Lin Xiangyuan.

198
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,119
I'm afraid I'll punch him if I go there.

199
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,239
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

200
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,080
Xiaosu,

201
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,799
Mr. Lei's hand just moved!

202
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,840
Look!

203
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,599
It's really moving!

204
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,479
Doctor! Doctor!

205
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
Doctor.

206
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,359
Mr. Lei just moved his hand.

207
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,559
Mr. Lei.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,200
He's awake! Mr. Lei is awake!

209
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,559
Great！

210
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,320
Fanlv, how are you doing?

211
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,799
Are you still not feeling good?

212
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,400
I'm fine. Much better.

213
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,559
Dad, I have something to deal with.
I've got to go.

214
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,159
Ok.

215
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,760
Why is she distracted?

216
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,479
Mr. Lin.

217
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,840
Mr. Jiang,

218
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,880
I'll go to the construction site
with Mr. Xie.

219
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you coming with us?

220
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,400
You go ahead.

221
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:30,640
I've been sitting all day,

222
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,479
and I've really got some backache.

223
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm old and useless.

224
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,280
Come on.

225
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:38,000
You're vigorous.

226
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,559
Let me drive you home.

227
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,719
As a man,

228
00:11:42,239 --> 00:11:43,320
you shall not nag me!

229
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,080
Business comes first.

230
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,239
Ok, take care.

231
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:49,416
(Press Conference)

232
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,799
Mr. Lin, let's go.

233
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,440
Mr. Lin.

234
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,840
The Entertainment Center project is
in great demand for money.

235
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,200
A hundred million is just gone
in the blink of an eye.

236
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,919
How much more money is expected?

237
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,679
There is nothing to expect.

238
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,919
You mean...

239
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,520
Not even a penny.

240
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,799
Yutian has other projects
other than the Entertainment Center.

241
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,039
Just put the Entertainment Center
project aside.

242
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,760
By the way,

243
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:22,280
what's wrong with Miss Jiang just now?

244
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,599
I just saw her vomit.

245
00:12:30,719 --> 00:12:31,840
Vomit?

246
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,559
Keep an eye on her these days.

247
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,760
No matter what happens,

248
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,000
you must let me know.

249
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,359
Ok.

250
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:37,479
Ok.

251
00:12:40,239 --> 00:12:41,599
I'm telling you two that

252
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,440
the patient is incapable now

253
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,039
and can't express himself.

254
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,760
So, there must be someone
with him every minute.

255
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,239
Otherwise,

256
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:50,960
there will be problems.

257
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:51,880
Thank you.

258
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,039
Please leave.

259
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,119
Back off!

260
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,719
Bad guy.

261
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,479
Excuse me. Excuse me.

262
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,559
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,719
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

264
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,919
Mr. Lei.

265
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,320
Bad guy.

266
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,679
Excuse me. Excuse me.

267
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,039
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

268
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,200
Mr. Lei,

269
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,760
you can't talk like this.

270
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,479
You're bad, too. Back off!

271
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,440
Ask bad guys to leave! Leave!

272
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,760
Fine, fine, fine.

273
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
Well, he is leaving right now.

274
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
He is leaving right now.

275
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,239
Mr. Lei, you're right.

276
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm the bad guy.

277
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,520
Scold me.

278
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,799
He Qunfei, stop blaming yourself.

279
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,919
This is
the sequelae of cerebral hemorrhage.

280
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,799
He has no idea what he is talking about.

281
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,039
I should be blamed
for what happened to the Leis.

282
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,039
Xiaosu,

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,760
if Mr. Lei didn't wake up,

284
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,599
how could I explain to his son?

285
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,400
We were worried that

286
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,039
he could not wake up before.

287
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,719
But he's awake now.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,960
So, we should be more confident now.

289
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:01,799
As long as he's not well,

290
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,400
we'll take care of him.

291
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
I believe that

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,559
he is gonna be fine one day.

293
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:09,880
Mr. Lei,

294
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,840
let's go home.

295
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
Here we go. Let's go home.

296
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,080
(Civilized Prison Cell)

297
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,960
Why are you back?

298
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,400
Why? You don't know me?

299
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,400
Are you fine?

300
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,119
Don't worry.

301
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm a cat

302
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,280
with nine lives, and I can't just die.

303
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,520
Come over here. Have a seat.

304
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,280
Did you do it on purpose that day?

305
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,039
On purpose?

306
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,320
Are you pretending to be sick,

307
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,479
as you are afraid that
I'm gonna get punished?

308
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,799
My heart

309
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,799
has problems.

310
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,039
If it was not you that day,

311
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,200
I would be gone.

312
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:05,760
Why? Wanna change your career?

313
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,679
Don't wanna be a boss anymore?

314
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,719
Wanna take a job in finance?

315
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,640
Just take a look.

316
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,559
It seems like

317
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,919
you've also studied abroad.

318
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,679
Stanford Graduate School of Business.

319
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,919
That explains.

320
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,479
Your father is very far-sighted.

321
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,679
For such a large Group like Yutian,

322
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,400
there has to be someone to take over.

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,520
I failed them.

324
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
You can't put it this way.

325
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,760
You're not the only one to stumble
in the business world.

326
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,159
After I

327
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
graduated from Lancaster University
in the UK,

328
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,159
I joined

329
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,840
BlackRock in the UK.

330
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,320
In those years,

331
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,840
I was getting too arrogant.

332
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,039
See. This is where I am.

333
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,000
I haven't even asked you.

334
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,880
What's the reason?

335
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:00,799
Do you know
the Minsheng Road in Shanghai?

336
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,039
I

337
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,200
was the chief trader

338
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,479
in one of the fund management companies.

339
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:06,640
I don't need to tell you

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,799
the rest.

341
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,719
I don't get it.

342
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,880
I'm just like you.

343
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,440
Didn't you take all
the responsibilities on your own?

344
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,280
How do you know that?

345
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,840
Come out. It's time for exercise.

346
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,479
We have plenty of time. Take your time.

347
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,719
Mr. Lin, do you really wanna go there?

348
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,359
We should come sooner or later.

349
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,719
Since Lei Ting has been discharged
from the hospital,

350
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,560
we should come to see him.

351
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,920
He was the president of Yutian
after all.

352
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,079
Besides,

353
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,239
the one I hate is Lei Yuzheng,

354
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,680
not Lei Ting.

355
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:06,760
Let's go.

356
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,599
Mr. Lei.

357
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,520
Mr. Lei.

358
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,520
Guys.

359
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,680
Hello, uncle Duan.

360
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,920
This is our regard.

361
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,040
So sorry to cost you.
(Luxury Gifts)

362
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:47,920
Thank you.

363
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,199
Not at all.

364
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,119
Mr. Lei is taking a nap.

365
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,400
He was here to get some sun, well...

366
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:54,920
He's awake.

367
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

368
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,040
I'll make you some tea.

369
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
Go ahead.

370
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,119
Mr. Lei, I'm Lin Xiangyuan.

371
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,719
Do you still remember?

372
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,640
Mr. Lei,

373
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,520
it seems you've recovered pretty well.

374
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,199
Great. That's great.

375
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,920
Then we can set our mind at rest.

376
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:22,479
Right, Mr. Lei.

377
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,959
Mr. Lin is very concerned about you.

378
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,479
As soon as he heard that
you were discharged,

379
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,920
he left his work

380
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,319
and came to see you.

381
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,199
Bad guys.

382
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,599
Mr. Lei, you're so good at joking.

383
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,319
We all work for you.

384
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,719
How can we be bad guys?

385
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:43,920
That's right.

386
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,920
Bad guys. Bad guys.

387
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,680
Back off! Back off!

388
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,719
Mr. Lin,
is Lei Ting really out of his mind?

389
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,079
Look at him.

390
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,119
He wants to eat us alive!

391
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,599
Mr. Lei,

392
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,800
don't you remember who I am?

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm Lei Yuzheng's colleague.

394
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,199
Yuzheng?

395
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,680
Right. Where is Yuzheng?

396
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:18,439
Where is Yuzheng?

397
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,280
Bad guy. Give Yuzheng back to me!

398
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,439
I'll kill you! Kill you!

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,280
Mr. Lin.

400
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:26,760
Back off!

401
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,640
Let's go.

402
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,319
Back off!

403
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,719
Or I'm gonna shoot!

404
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:32,439
Mr. Lei, calm down.

405
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,880
Can we take it easy?

406
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,199
Back off! Or I'll shoot!

407
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,119
Mr. Lei,

408
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,800
you wanna hit people with the stick?

409
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,160
All of you are bad guys! Bad guys!

410
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,760
Please don't. Give it to me.

411
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,280
What's going on?

412
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,199
Excuse me.

413
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,079
Mr. Lei suffered a bad illness.

414
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:48,400
He hasn't recovered yet.
He's still confused.

415
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,880
Are you hurt?

416
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,640
It's fine. It's fine.

417
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,079
Yuzheng, they are all bad guys.

418
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,439
They're guests.

419
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:54,880
You're bad, too.

420
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,719
Bad guy. Back off!

421
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:57,199
Look!

422
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,079
Back off! All of you!

423
00:19:58,439 --> 00:19:59,160
Good lord.

424
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,839
He's yelling at everyone like this now?

425
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,520
He's out of his mind sometimes.

426
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Let's make it another day, shall we?

427
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,199
Fine.

428
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,479
Ask them to leave!

429
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,479
They 're gone.

430
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,920
Excuse me.

431
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,800
What's that about?

432
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:24,079
It's bloody hell out of luck.

433
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,359
Got beaten for nothing.

434
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,680
He is out of your mind, isn't he?

435
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,400
Why is it so easy for him to get angry?

436
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,280
Never mind.

437
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,800
There is no need
to take offence at a patient.

438
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,199
Let him take it out.

439
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,719
Just consider it as

440
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,160
an apology I make to him.

441
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,040
Now Lei Yuzheng is in jail.

442
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,280
He is so sick.

443
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,479
Yutian shall count on me.

444
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,880
That's true.

445
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,920
You're the manager
of Yutian from now on.

446
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:55,079
You forgot about Jiang Jin and others.

447
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,880
Mr. Jiang is your future father-in-law.

448
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,800
He must be on your side.

449
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,479
Miss Jiang, congratulations.
You're pregnant.

450
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Pregnant?

451
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,439
How could that happen?

452
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,839
Are you making a mistake?

453
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,040
Look at the report.

454
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,640
Don't worry. It's already
one month and a half.

Fanlv.

461
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,520
Why are you so grief when you see me?

462
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,119
Is it because I'm getting old?

463
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,719
I just didn't expect that

464
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,040
we would meet here.

465
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,479
Look at you now.

466
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,479
I feel very sorry.

467
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,239
Don't worry. I'm great.

468
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:40,199
If only
we could go back to our childhood.

469
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,839
I still remember that

470
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,079
lemon soda was your favorite drink.

471
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:50,640
You liked to make fun of girls
with caterpillars.

472
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,839
You also liked to defend Zhenrong.

473
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,439
We were carefree at that time.

474
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,520
We used to be together every day.

475
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,040
How wonderful it was!

476
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,719
This is fate.

477
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,479
You're too young for believing in fate.

478
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,880
Don't you think so?

479
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,239
I don' t believe in fate.

480
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,359
I am used to
making fate submitted to me.

481
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,719
But I've gradually realized that

482
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,599
fate will always give you a blow

483
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,040
out of surprise,

484
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,959
so that you'll know that
your previous ambitions

485
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,400
were just a joke.

486
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,920
Fanlv, remember that,

487
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,160
no matter when,

488
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,640
I'm your family.

489
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,920
I know.

490
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I didn't want you to treat me
like a sister before.

491
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,040
Now I've realized

492
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,640
how much I rely on you.

493
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,880
As long as you're around,

494
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,199
no matter what serious things happen,

495
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,640
I won't be scared.

496
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:04,520
Now I've grown up.

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,680
Now that I've made my decision,

498
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,760
I have to face it on my own.

499
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,439
I just came to see you.

500
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,719
As long as I see you,

501
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,479
I'll feel peace.

502
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,560
Fanlv.

503
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,239
Tell me.

504
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,119
Is there anything wrong?

505
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,359
Yuzheng, stop asking.

506
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,719
You're right.

507
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,839
Some things are meant to be happening.

508
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,800
Yuzheng,

509
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:39,920
don't worry.

510
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,199
No matter what happened,

511
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,479
no matter what I did,

512
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,880
I'll be good.

513
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,599
I'll wait for you to come out.

514
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,839
Take good care of yourself.

515
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,280

516
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,760
I wish you are happy.

517
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,119
I will.

518
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,560
Don't worry about me.

520
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,640

522
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:33,800

524
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,079
This is what you want.

525
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,599
Leave it here.

526
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,880

Why don't you tell me earlier?

531
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,319
Yes! Yes! Yes!

532
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,640
I can be a father!

533
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,640
I'm a father! Yes!

Mr. Lin,

537
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,520
miss Jiang is going to see
the obstetrics doctor tomorrow.

538
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:37,160
Ok.

539
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,920
Help me decline the work tomorrow.

540
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,920
I'll go with her.

541
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,839

542
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:46,400

She called the doctor for abortion.

543

Abortion?

544
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,119
That is my child!

545
00:26:58,239 --> 00:26:59,119
It's my family's blood.

546
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:00,439
How dare she?

547
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,719
You're right.

548

from my hometown.

552
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,119
These are all Fanlv's favorite food.

553
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,839
And this.

554
00:27:14,959 --> 00:27:16,560
Last time when you were in my office,

555
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,479
you said this was pretty tasty.

556
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,119

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,439
Come over here.

559
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,359
Put them away.

560
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,079
Xiangyuan, you're really considerate.

561
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,520
I just said it,

562
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,160
and you keep it in your mind.

563
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What's wrong?

564
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,800
Mr. Jiang, please don't tell Fanlv

565
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,280
those are from me.

566
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,520
Otherwise, she'll lose her appetite.

567
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,160
That's who she is.

568
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,199
Don't mind her words.

569
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,400
Come here. Have a seat.

570
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,800
Mr. Jiang,
Fanlv went to visit Lei Yuzheng?

571
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,800
Fanlv and Lei Yuzheng

572
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,920
grew up playing together.

573
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,400
It's natural to go to see him.

574
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,319
Mr. Jiang, you misunderstood me.

575
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,680
I'm just a little worried.

576
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,920
Although we are engaged,

577
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,959
but we're still not one family.

578
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,800
I'm afraid I'm wasting her time.

579
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,160
To be honest,

580
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,880
even if Fanlv regrets it,

581
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,680
I have no complaints.

582
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,839
I just hope that

583
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:34,040
she can find someone
who really loves her,

584
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,520
instead of wasting her time
waiting for someone

585
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,920
who doesn't deserve her love.

586
00:28:39,479 --> 00:28:40,719
You're right.

587
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,439
It seems that,
as long as you're not married,

588
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,959
Fanlv's mind

589
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,760
won't settle.

590
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,319
How about this?

591
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,760
You prepare whatever you need.

592
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,040
I'll talk to Fanlv later.

593
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,959
Hurry up with your marriage.

594
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes, Mr. Jiang, thank you.

595
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,680
I gotta go.

596
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,599
(Civilized Prison Cell)

597
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,000
Lei Yuzheng.

598
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:17,079
Get ready. Go to the reception room.

599
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,599
I don't wanna meet her.

600
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,319
Ok.

601
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,439
That girl is here.
You still don't see her.

602
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,800
Not willing?

603
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,280
I can't.

604
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,359
Why? Are you afraid you can't
hold on yourself if you meet her?

605
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,400
Look at yourself.

606
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,040
If I meet her one time,
she will come for another time.

607
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,119
So, I can't meet her.

608
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,920
In my opinion,
that girl is pretty determined.

609
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,079
Even if you go on like this,

610
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,839
I don't think she'll give it up.

611
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,880
Then, I'll find a way to make her give up.

612
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,560
People like me

613
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:18,719
have to be cruel.

614
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,680
That's being responsible for others.

615
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,160
What's the girl's name again?

616
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,719
Du Xiaosu.

617
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:30,079
Du Xiaosu.

618
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,520
Du Xiaosu.

619
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,239
Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,400
You are not cruel at all.

621
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:45,000
You love her deeply.

622
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,199
It really freaked me out

623
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,920
to take the flight of over ten hours.

624
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,920
Mrs. Shao, look at you.

625
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,599
Going abroad to recover really works.

626
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,560
You look much better
and are in a good mood.

627
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,439
What can I do?

628
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,040
Zhenrong has been gone
for more than one year.

629
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,920
I wanna be with him.
But the God doesn't allow me.

630
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,719
There is no way out.
I have to live a few more years.

631
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,680
Mrs. Shao, what are you talking about?

632
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,560
Fine. Forget it.

633
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,439
Could you please sort out the presents?

634
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,319
The nutrients are for Mr. Lei.

635
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
What happened to you?

636
00:31:48,959 --> 00:31:51,079
Mrs. Shao, you have no idea.

637
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,640
When you're not around,

638
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:56,119
there was something wrong
with Lei's family.

639
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,359
We had a deal, right?

640
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,839
If you take the medicine seriously,

641
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,079
you'll get better soon.

642
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,800
I'm not sick. You are.

643
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,359
Mr. Lei, I'm coming.

644
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:08,400
Look.

645
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,040
Guess what I've brought to you.

646
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,920
Marshmallow.

647
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,040
Ok, here is the deal.

648
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,800
One bite of medicine,

649
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,199
one bite of marshmallow.

650
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,119
Come on.

651
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:25,479
Here.

652
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,839
Take it slow.

653
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,359
Great.

654
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,520
Take the marshmallow.
Take the marshmallow.

655
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,319
Actually,

656
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,680
there is no other way to coax him.

657
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,439
Just treat him like a kid.

658
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,280
Coax while persuading.

659
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,520
It depends on who it is.

660
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,560
Last time there were two guests.

661
00:32:44,719 --> 00:32:47,280
Coax while persuading. It didn't work.

662
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,920
Mr. Lei kicked them out with the stick.

663
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,040
Who are they?

664
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,400
The last name of the boss is Lin.

665
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,880
They said they were Yuzheng's colleagues.

666
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,680
They specially came to see him.

667
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,959
Lin Xiangyuan?

668
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,160
It seems to be like him.

669
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,959
Du Xiaosu? What are you doing here?

670
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,040
Aunt Shao.

671
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,280
Why don't you come in first?

672
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,160
I'll explain to you later.

673
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,560
Mr. Lei, what's wrong?

674
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,199
You have marshmallow on your lips.

675
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,239
Like a Santa Claus.

676
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:40,719
Let's take it off.

677
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,280
Done.

678
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:44,280
What did you just call me?

679
00:33:44,879 --> 00:33:45,919
Marshmallow.

680
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Fine. Whatever you want.

681
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,639
As long as you're happy with it.

682
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,360
Marshmallow. Marshmallow.

683
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:54,520
Fine.

684
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,399
Mr. Lei, how about this?

685
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:00,399
As long as you're well behaved
in eating and sleeping,

686
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:01,879
every time I come to see you,

687
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,439
I'll bring you the marshmallow.

688
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:06,919
Fine. I promise.

689
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,120
Lei, this is Kaixuan.

690
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,239
Who is Kaixuan?

691
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:20,080
Mr. Lei, she's a friend.

692
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,520
Kaixuan is your friend.

693
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:24,320
A good friend.

694
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,560
A good friend?

695
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:33,000
He's confused again.

696
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,239
Aunt Shao, don't be sad.

697
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:39,439
The doctor said that

698
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,879
this is the sequela of
cerebral hemorrhage.

699
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,199
He'll get better in a while.

700
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:46,120
All we need to do is
to take good care of him.

701
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,760
You've been taking care of him recently?

702
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,560
Ms. Shao, you have no idea.

703
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,239
Thanks to Miss Du,

704
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,040
she has been coming all the time to
take care of Mr. Lei.

705
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:57,479
Though Mr. Lei is

706
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,639
confused sometimes,

707
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:00,280
who is the good guy or bad guy,

708
00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:01,879
he knows it.

709
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,760
Don't you, Mr. Lei?

710
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,479
Marshmallow, good guy.

711
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,479
See?

712
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
Mr. Lei, how about this?

713
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,760
Let me talk with Aunt Shao.

714
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Uncle Duan will take a walk with you
and get some sun.

715
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,479
Ok.

716
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:20,959
Fine.

717
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:21,679
Ok?

718
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:22,320
Great!

719
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,840
Let' go. Slow down.

720
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,959
I'll leave you alone.

721
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,360
Mr. Lei is just like a child.

722
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,879
As long as you spend more time with him
and talk to him,

723
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:45,360
he'll be happy.

724
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:49,399
Have you ever thought about it?

725
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,840
After he is recovered,

726
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,520
how are you going to
explain about Yuzheng to him?

727
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:57,760
I think...

728
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:01,959
I can't even think about it now.

729
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:04,399
Take one day at a time.

730
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,239
Aunt Shao, I didn't expect

731
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:14,719
we could talk like this.

732
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,760
It's all the past.

733
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,840
Thank you for helping Yuzheng
in the difficult time.

734
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:27,080
Lei Yuzheng offered me a lot of help.

735
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,560
He's in trouble now. I feel responsible.

736
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,479
There is one thing.

737
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,080
I hope you can do me a favor.

738
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,399
Lei Yuzheng is very stubborn.

739
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:47,639
He's in such a big trouble now.

740
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,000
He certainly doesn't need
the pity from others,

741
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
and doesn't want to get others
in trouble.

742
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:54,320
So, he doesn't wanna see me right now.

743
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,919
But I know,

744
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:58,760
whom he is most worried about
is his father.

745
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:01,879
If you visit him next time,

746
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,120
please help me take this picture to him.

747
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
Thank you.

748
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:11,280
Don't say that. That's what I should do.

749
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,919
Miss, have you really made up your mind

750
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:50,719
to give up this baby?

751
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,159
If you haven't figured it out,

752
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,080
calm down and think it over.

753
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,000
Generally speaking,

754
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
we don't suggest
to give up the first baby.

755
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,479
If you can keep it, keep it.

756
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,639
No, I've made up my mind.

757
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,239
Lin Xiangyuan, you are following me!

758
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,439
Fanlv.

759
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,320
I am concerned.
You've suffered from vomiting recently.

760
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,320
I'm begging you.

761
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,679
Could you please keep the baby?

762
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,239
This baby is ours after all.

763
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm his father.

764
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,479
In any case,

765
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:37,760
you should discuss with me.

766
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,000
Yes, you're the father of the baby.

767
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,520
But you know that

768
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,239
it's not the right time for this baby.

769
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,879
I know.

770
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,840
This baby is not our plan.

771
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,520
You're not prepared yet.

772
00:38:52,959 --> 00:38:54,239
No matter how much you hate me

773
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,199
or be mad at me,

774
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,439
We're the parents of this baby.

775
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,479
The baby is innocent.

776
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,439
I'm begging you.

777
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,560
Could you please keep this baby?

778
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,120
I know you're very angry.

779
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,199
I swear.

780
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,439
No matter what you wanna do to me,

781
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,959
I promise
I won't fight back or swear back.

782
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Even if you ask me to disappear,

783
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,040
I'll be fine.

784
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,159
As long as you keep this baby.

785
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:37,560
Fanlv, I shouldn't be with you,

786
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,159
knowing that you don't love me.

787
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,959
I promise you.

788
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,239
I can disappear from your life.

789
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Tomorrow...

790
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,760
No. At once...

791
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,479
I will resign at once,

792
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,399
and leave the company and the city.

793
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,280
But if you can give birth to this baby,

794
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,199
I'll try all my best to love him

795
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:02,800
and protect him.

796
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,679
As long as he can stay,

797
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,320
it'll be enough for me.

798
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,800
I swear.

799
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,600
Wait a minute.
