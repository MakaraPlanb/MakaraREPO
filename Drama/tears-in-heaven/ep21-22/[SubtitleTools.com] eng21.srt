16
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,320
Mr. Lin.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,360
Lei Yuzheng had quite a fall this time.

18
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:41,520
It'll take a while for him
to make a comeback.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,080
I didn't expect that.

20
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:45,559
I…

21
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,279
What didn't you expect?

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,240
Nothing.

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,320
Mr. Lin, it's good that
Lei Yuzheng is gone now.

24
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,320
Why do you still seem
to worry a lot?

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,559
You can take this chance
to get promoted, right?

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,839
Promoted?

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,759
I, Lin Xiangyuan, will never
take advantage of other people.

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,839
I was gonna fight with
Lei Yuzheng face to face.

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,520
If I win then,

30
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,279
it means that
I am really more capable than him.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,800
But the result means everything.

32
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,919
As long as you become
the president of Yutian,

33
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:20,080
no one cares about
what means you took.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,119
They will all look up to you.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
Xieli,

36
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,839
what do you think
Lei Yuzheng is doing right now?

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,199
What else can he do?

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,839
He must be crying out loud at the court.

39
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,279
Now, the old is in hospital,

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,919
and the young is in jail.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,000
Now it's time for you, Mr. Lin,
to take charge.

42
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,880
Mr. Jiang, directors are waiting for you
to join the meeting.

43
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,440
Look at this,
these reporters are going way too far.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,360
They used such title as
"Yutian's stock market scandal" and

45
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,679
"Construction of Entertainment Center
project might be called off".

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,679
They are talking nonsense.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,039
Mr. Jiang,
that's what reporters usually do.

48
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,360
As long as they can make
a big news out of something,

49
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:20,000
they would exaggerate everything.

50
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,440
Speaking of that,

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,039
not only those reporters,

52
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,839
but also our employees are

53
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
talking about rumors right now.

54
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,839
What do you mean?

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,720
They are all saying that

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,119
it will take a while for Lei Yuzheng
to make a comeback.

57
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,960
And if no one takes the lead right now,

58
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,000
the Entertainment Center project
will be affected.

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,240
Mr. Jiang,

60
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,359
everyone is waiting for you
to take the lead.

61
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,760
But I don't know much about

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,760
the Entertainment City project.

63
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,559
If I take over right now,

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,399
isn't it too hasty?

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,079
I might trap myself

66
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,440
later on.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

68
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,079
is Fanlv feeling better?

69
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,559
How's her appetite?

70
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,679
I'm planning to go back to my hometown,

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,279
and bring some delicacies
for her to improve her health.

72
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,679
Fanlv is fine.

73
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,279
Xiangyuan, you are very thoughtful.

74
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,920
Ah, regarding the
Entertainment Center project,

75
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,880
you know it the best
besides Lei Yuzheng.

76
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:26,920
Come and join the meeting with me.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,799
Lin, have a seat.

78
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Regarding what happened to
Yutian recently,

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,959
I don't have to recap it.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,000
Why don't all of you

81
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,679
contribute your ideas?

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,279
Such a big company

83
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,720
needs a leader.

84
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,720
Jiang, you should think of a way.

85
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,600
Yuzheng is in trouble,

86
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,320
and brother Ting is in the hospital.

87
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,559
Everyone must be very anxious.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,760
But it's still important

89
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,079
to maintain the order
within the company.

90
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,480
Why don't we vote by raising hands

91
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,920
to elect a temporary president
to take charge for now?

92
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,679
How does that sound?

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
As far as I'm concerned,
we can skip that step.

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,440
The one who can take charge
is you, Mr. Jiang.

95
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,720
You should take this position.

96
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,000
Me?

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,119
No, no, no. How could it be me?

98
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,559
Don't be modest.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,920
The Entertainment Center project
belonged to Xinsheng in the first place.

100
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,640
Although Yutian is in charge of
the development,

101
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,079
you also have the responsibility.

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,239
Mr. Jiang, don't be so modest.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Mr. Jiang, you should take it.

104
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,160
Mr. Jiang, I will vote for you.

105
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:55,679
I agree.

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,679
Yes, I agree.

107
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,040
All right. Since everyone has
such high expectation in me,

108
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:04,160
and we should take the overall interests
of the company into account.

109
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,399
I will just take this position for now,

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
and hope everyone could understand.

111
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course.

112
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,720
But a leader cannot fight by oneself.

113
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,480
It's not enough to do it all

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,119
by myself.

115
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,119
Lin has been my assistant
for so many years.

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,160
We've built great rapport
with each other.

117
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Everyone here has witnessed

118
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,320
his ability.

119
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,079
So I suggest that I will supervise

120
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,880
the Entertainment Center project,
and Lin will be in charge.

121
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,959
I know that Lin is my future son-in-law,

122
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,799
and I should have left him out of this,
so that people won't gossip about it.

123
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,679
But to the benefit of Yutian
and the Entertainment Center project,

124
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
I think we can entrust Lin
with this task.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,640
Lin, the investment that
you were working on

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
is still possible, right?

127
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,760
I'll keep working on it.
I think it is possible for us to get it.

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,920
If Lin can collect money
for the Entertainment Center project,

129
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:15,959
he will be the hero of Yutian.

130
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,959
We can't even thank him enough.

131
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Everyone,

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,279
at the very beginning,
Xinsheng cooperated with Yutian

133
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,160
on the Entertainment Center project
by offering it as a gift.

134
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,119
Since the board has decided

135
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,959
that I will take charge of this project,

136
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,760
I know how much responsibility I have.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
I won't let anyone down.

138
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,239
(Police)

139
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,599
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

140
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:03,799
Get off the car.

141
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,579
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

142
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,760
According to Article 180

143
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,400
of the Criminal Law
of the People’s Republic of China,

144
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:24,280
the defendant Lei Yuzheng,
the prior president of Yutian,

145
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,200
is sentenced for 8-month detention
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

146
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,880
due to the charge of
disclosing confidential information,

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,760
and immediate execution is required.

148
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,499
(Silence)

149
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,880
Time is like a one-way road.

150
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,559
You can only move forward
without going back.

151
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,239
There's no pure luck in this world.

152
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,960
Everyone needs to pay the price
for their mistakes.

153
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
Go inside.

154
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:42,280
My name is Liu Siyang.

155
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,479
It must be the first time for you.

156
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,000
I can tell that
you're not used to here yet.

157
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,679
It will be better in a few days.

158
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,559
Here you are.

159
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,400
Xiaosu, it was on TV.

160
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,440
Did Lei Yuzheng actually go to jail?

161
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,239
I couldn't do anything about it.

162
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
There was no evidence and

163
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
nothing was beneficial towards him.

164
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,880
He also didn't want to explain about it,

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,239
and took all the responsibilities
by himself.

166
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,679
So,

167
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,159
I couldn't do anything
but watching him get accused.

168
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,799
It's all my fault.

169
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,760
I couldn't do anything.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,479
I couldn't help him.

171
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:52,599
What happened to Lei Yuzheng this time

172
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,520
is really a big issue.

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,159
Since when...

174
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,119
Siqi,

175
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,719
Let's break up.

176
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,679
What did you say?

177
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,559
Mr. Lei went to jail,

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,080
and the chairman is in a coma.

179
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:21,880
It's all because of me.

180
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,719
Since the past cannot be changed,

181
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,799
I cannot just sit here and

182
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,880
have date with you.

183
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,119
He Qunfei, what is wrong with you?

184
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,559
Don't regret if you say this.

185
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,159
There's nothing to regret.

186
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,080
Things are already this bad.

187
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,479
I deserve whatever it costs.

188
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,960
He Qunfei, don't be so impulsive.

189
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,159
You can leave this behind.

190
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:49,640
He Qunfei,

191
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,799
you wanna break up, right?

192
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,440
From now on, let's go our own ways.

193
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,799
Don't you dare regret it.

194
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,320
Siqi.

195
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:59,000
He Qunfei, get out of here now.

196
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,359
Now.

197
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,359
Siqi, calm down.

198
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:04,960
Xiaosu.

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,440
I really appreciate your help
this whole time.

200
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,599
See you.

201
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
What are you two doing?

202
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,919
You can't fall asleep, right?

203
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,880
There're only two of us

204
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,039
in this 9-square meter room.

205
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,159
If you keep silent like this,

206
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,039
it won't be long till

207
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,840
we both got crazy.

208
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,919
You seem to be

209
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:27,320
someone who has power,

210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,080
and can't bear with living in jail.

211
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:31,960
No wonder.

212
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,080
Rich people,

213
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,080
who's like you,

214
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,880
always seem proud when nothing happens.

215
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,239
As long as they get troubled,

216
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,559
they will look hopeless.

217
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,159
I look down on people like you.

218
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,880
What did you say?

219
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,239
Nothing.

220
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't have respect
for people like you.

221
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,440
Why?

222
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Too weak.

223
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,559
You hit me?

224
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,799
Hit me! Come, hit me!

225
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:21,359
Hit me!

226
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:26,799
Hit me!

227
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,119
Stop it!

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,159
Do it!

229
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,440
What are you doing?

230
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,599
What are you doing?

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,840
Stand aside.

232
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,880
Who started first?

233
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,119
Xiangyuan,

234
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,159
was what Fanlv said true?

235
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:50,159
Did He Qunfei really fight with you?

236
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,640
Yes.

237
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,200
So, you do have something to do

238
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,719
with Lei Yuzheng's trouble?

239
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,919
Mr. Jiang, I've been serving you
for such a long time.

240
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,400
How could you not trust me?

241
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,239
How could I possibly do such

242
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:04,640
disgraceful thing?

243
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:06,559
Yes.

244
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,000
He Qunfei fought with me
because of Lei Yuzheng.

245
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,119
But it was because
he cares about Lei Yuzheng so much

246
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,919
that he lost his mind.

247
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,840
He's been thinking of me
as Lei Yuzheng's enemy,

248
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
and always suspecting me.

249
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
But I can understand that,

250
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,880
because I was sent by Xinsheng anyway,

251
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,000
and I don't have a direct relationship
with Lei Yuzheng.

252
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,280
What do you mean by that?

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,559
It was my decision to send you to Yutian

254
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,200
for the Entertainment Center project.

255
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,640
If He Qunfei is opinionative towards you

256
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,039
just because of this,

257
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,880
he's really shortsighted.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,559
You don't have to care about him.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,719
Sure.

260
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,119
I will keep it in mind.

261
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,599
Dad, do you think it's that simple?

262
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,400
Fanlv,

263
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,799
do you think I can actually do

264
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,440
anything that hurts Lei Yuzheng?

265
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,320
Do I seem like a cunning person

266
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,119
to you?

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,960
I've never been fussy with you.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,080
You loved Lei Yuzheng,

269
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,719
but I don't care, because I love you.

270
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,520
This is my fate.

271
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not complaining about anything.

272
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,200
But you can't just get me wrong

273
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,880
because of him.

274
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm also flesh and blood,

275
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,719
and can get hurt.

276
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,319
Mr. Jiang, I swear that

277
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,000
I never did anything

278
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
against Lei Yuzheng,

279
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,439
not to mention anything
that would let you down.

280
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:46,959
If you don't believe me,

281
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:48,959
you can send me to jail

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,359
to replace Lei Yuzheng.

283
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,000
I won't say anything.

284
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,839
Don't get in a rage.

285
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,839
Fanlv,

286
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,160
I can understand that

287
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
you worry about Yuzheng.

288
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,640
But you shouldn't get Xiangyuan wrong

289
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,040
just because of Yuzheng.

290
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,119
He's your fiance after all.

291
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,760
If you don't even believe in him,

292
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,880
how do you expect him to feel?

293
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,040
Dad.

294
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:20,479
Mr. Jiang.

295
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,319
It's all worth it

296
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,599
after hearing your words.

297
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,800
Alright, I have nothing else to say.

298
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,160
Xiangyuan, have a seat.

299
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:49,599
She has been spoiled since

300
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:52,160
she was a kid.

301
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,079
Please understand and forgive her.

302
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,959
Mr. Jiang,

303
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:00,040
meeting Fanlv

304
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,319
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

305
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
Don't worry.

306
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,439
I will take care of her in my whole life

307
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,520
and treat her well.

308
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,352
(Medical Room)

309
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,439
Fine.

310
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,079
Who started fighting?

311
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,760
You sure can handle a lot.

312
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,959
Lei Yuzheng, you just came inside.

313
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:41,680
I can understand
that you are not in a good mood.

314
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,839
But still, you shouldn't vent your anger

315
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,680
by harming your cellmate.

316
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,680
Read the prison rules and regulations again.

317
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,219
(Prison Rules and Regulations)

318
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,520
Do you know why I keep you two together?

319
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,680
Because you two had similar charges,

320
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,239
you should both reflect on yourselves.

321
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,520
After you get out,

322
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,479
try to be someone
who's beneficial for the society.

323
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:02,040
Also, I'm telling you that

324
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:05,000
he has serious heart problems.

325
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,880
We wouldn't even let him do

326
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,640
the works that might exhaust him.

327
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,599
If you keep doing this,

328
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,239
you should know the consequences.

329
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,479
Take them away.

330
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:19,880
Go.

331
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,160
Don't worry, everything's fine at home.

332
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,280
Take care of yourself.

333
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
You too.

334
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,079
How was it?

335
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,400
I'm sorry,
but the prisoner rejected to see you.

336
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:49,079
He…

337
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,680
still didn't want to see me?

338
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,880
Yes.

339
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,400
And he told you not to come again.

340
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,439
But he's quite worried about his father.

341
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,920
Is his father alright?

342
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Please tell him that

343
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,199
his father…

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,079
his father is doing well.

345
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,719
Tell him not to worry.

346
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,640
Here, I brought him some books

347
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
and some food.

348
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,479
Please give these to him.

349
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,599
OK.

350
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,839
We'll give them to him after inspection.

351
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Thank you.

352
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:39,359
But he's quite worried about his father.

353
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,119
Is his father alright?

354
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:48,979
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

355
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,179
(He Qunfei)

356
00:20:59,079 --> 00:20:59,920
Hello, Qunfei.

357
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,560
Do you know
which hospital Yuzheng's dad stays in?

358
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,280
Miss, who are you looking for?

359
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,359
I'm here to see Mr. Lei.

360
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,239
You must be Miss Du.

361
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
Assistant He just called me.

362
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,719
How's he doing now?

363
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,560
Still the same.

364
00:22:01,719 --> 00:22:03,239
He doesn't have any consciousness.

365
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,880
So, we could just sit here and wait.

366
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,560
We couldn't help much.

367
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,920
Can I speak to him for a bit?

368
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,040
Sure.

369
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,079
Thank you.

370
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:39,400
Mr. Lei,

371
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,760
I went to see Yuzheng today.

372
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,880
He…

373
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,040
He's doing good.

374
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,239
He's just getting a little bored.

375
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
I know that the person

376
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,439
he worries about the most is you.

377
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,880
I also told him that

378
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,160
you are doing well too,

379
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,640
and waiting for him to come back

380
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,119
and kick his ass.

381
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
Mr. Lei,

382
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,959
please get better soon.

383
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,920
If you don't get better,

384
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,040
you may lose Yutian

385
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,199
and Yuzheng would have gone to jail
for nothing.

386
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,880
Please wake up soon.

387
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,560
Let's go and see together.

388
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,280
What's this?

389
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,479
What else can it be?

390
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,599
Isn't it obvious?
(Announcement of Personnel Adjustment)

391
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,040
The guy fired by Mr. Lei

392
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,439
got lucky and
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

393
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
came back.

394
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,560
Now, assistant He is doomed.
(List of redundant personnel: He Qunfei)

395
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,839
Mr. Lin, please tell me

396
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,239
why you fired me.

397
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,640
The reason is simple.

398
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,000
Yutian is experiencing
many difficulties.

399
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:25,000
In order to improve the efficiency
within the company,

400
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:26,400
the board decided to

401
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,359
simplify the company structure
and reduce the number of employees.

402
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:32,280
Is this reason good enough?

403
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,439
Fine.

404
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,800
So, is it the board's decision or

405
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:38,119
your decision?

406
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,839
What's the difference?

407
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,800
Is the job market so rigorous that

408
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,119
you don't want to leave?

409
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,199
You can't decide whether I leave or now.

410
00:24:48,439 --> 00:24:49,560
Mr. Lei should be the one
who decides it.

411
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:51,520
I knew you would bring Lei Yuzheng up.

412
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,319
Do you think it's okay
to mention him in front of me?

413
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,479
He can't even protect himself now.

414
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,280
How can he possibly
care about other people?

415
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,319
Lin Xiangyuan, I'm warning you.

416
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,199
Don't go too far.

417
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,959
Assistant He,

418
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,319
seriously,

419
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm doing this for your own good.

420
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,719
Even just for the punch I got from you,

421
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,079
it will be impossible for you
to stay in Yutian.

422
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,640
Not to mention that

423
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,239
Yutian is no longer
what it used to be anymore.

424
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,400
It's better for you to

425
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,439
work at somewhere else.

426
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,439
Ok.

427
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,160
Then, I will ask the board to decide.

428
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,640
The board?

429
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,079
Do you think that the board
has nothing to do

430
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,680
and they would even care about
such thing?

431
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,719
If they won't, I will.

432
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:57,880
Fanlv, why are you here?

433
00:25:58,839 --> 00:25:59,880
I've heard a while ago that Mr. Lin

434
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,479
made big moves after promotion,

435
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,479
and fired
many loyal employees in Yutian.

436
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,839
And now,

437
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,439
you are chasing He Qunfei away?

438
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,760
It's just career transfer.

439
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,199
And reducing staff is normal
for a company.

440
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,439
I don't care about other people,

441
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
but you cannot fire him.

442
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:21,800
You can think of it
as I'm pleading for him.

443
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,280
You can take this back.

444
00:26:33,439 --> 00:26:34,199
Fanlv,

445
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,160
you are making this hard for me.

446
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:39,880
Alright.

447
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:42,040
Since Mr. Lin is having difficulty,

448
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,680
I have to go ask the board.

449
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I will let Mr. An and uncle Wang

450
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:48,560
to grant my request.

451
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,319
Let's go.

452
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,000
Wait a second.

453
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:00,520
Fine.

454
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,280
Let him stay.

455
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,199
Miss Jiang,

456
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,199
thank you so much today.

457
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,959
You don't need to thank me.

458
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm not doing this for you.

459
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm doing this for Yuzheng.

460
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
I don't want his people to get affected.

461
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:53,880
That guy has been really loud
for the whole night.

462
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,280
I'm so sleepy.

463
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,079
Let the brother give him a lesson.

464
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:57,959
What happened yesterday?

465
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,839
Brother, brother.

466
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,000
Who was making so much noise

467
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,239
that I couldn't fall asleep?

468
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,520
Him.

469
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,079
That skinny guy. It's him.

470
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,280
That's the person.

471
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:28,800
Hey, skinny. You got hurt?

472
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,079
Seems like you've got temper too.

473
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,760
Are your ears beaten to deaf?

474
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,760
I'm talking to you.

475
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:39,560
You can't hear me, right?

476
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,896
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

477
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,359
Listen,

478
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,439
at this place,

479
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,319
don't go against me, got it?

480
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,479
Who are you?

481
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,479
Who do you think you are?

482
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Do you want to get beaten?

483
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,640
He's hitting people! Police!
He's hitting people.

484
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:09,520
He's beating people up.

485
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,479
Stop it.

486
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,439
Brother.

487
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,239
Police, he's beating people up.

488
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,359
Who started?

489
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,040
He. He started it.

490
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,880
It's him.

491
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:25,560
Don't you dare keep moving.

492
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,520
Qunfei, you have to help me.

493
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,719
I have to see Lei Yuzheng.

494
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,280
Ok.

495
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:48,019
(Civilized Prison Cell)

496
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,560
Lei Yuzheng,

497
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,479
your subordinate He Qunfei came again.

498
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Go see him.

499
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,319
Captain Liang,

500
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,640
is he by himself?

501
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,719
There's also a girl.

502
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,079
The girl who's been coming here
often to see you,

503
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,400
but you kept turning down.

504
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,719
They beg me to not tell you,

505
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:17,359
but you should go see them.

506
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,640
It's hard for them to keep

507
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,239
visiting here so often.

508
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,560
It's been several times already.

509
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
What happened?

510
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:31,640
I just had nose bleeding.
It's not a big deal.

511
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:39,239
Let's go.

512
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,560
Bro,

513
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,079
how are you?

514
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,199
I'm good.

515
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:28,599
I said that I don't want to see her.

516
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,199
Why did you bring her here?

517
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,880
Would I be able to see you

518
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,520
otherwise?

519
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,439
Mr. Lei,

520
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,920
you should talk to Xiaosu a little bit.

521
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,280
There's nothing to talk about.

522
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:40,959
Don't you even have the courage to

523
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:42,160
hear some words from me?

524
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,199
We all miss you a lot.

525
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,560
Please take care of yourself.

526
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,800
Soon you will be able to get out.

527
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,160
Du Xiaosu,

528
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,719
if you come here just to

529
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:07,920
tell me these things,

530
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,239
there's no such need.

531
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,479
Lei Yuzheng.

532
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,160
I said that I don't want to see you.

533
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,359
Why would you still come here?

534
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,880
I hate when you act

535
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,280
so self-righteous.

536
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,239
I'm here to see you

537
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,880
because we are friends.

538
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,439
I'm your friend

539
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,239
who just wants to help you
as much as possible.

540
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,319
How do you plan to help me?

541
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,680
You can stay in jail for me,

542
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,640
or you can help me fly out of here?

543
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,479
What's more,

544
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,119
I've never helped you.

545
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,680
Even if I have,

546
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,959
it was an impulsive act,

547
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:55,800
and you don't need to worry about it.

548
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
Regarding "friends",

549
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,599
I'm no longer the leader of Yutian,

550
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,000
and I'm just a prisoner.

551
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,359
Do you want to make friends
with a prisoner?

552
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,599
Lei Yuzheng,

553
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:11,800
what kind of person do you think I am?

554
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,239
Did I make friends with you because of

555
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:18,439
your fame or social status?

556
00:33:19,239 --> 00:33:20,079
Mr. Lei.

557
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,119
Xiaosu has been really
worried about you.

558
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,199
You didn't know it but

559
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,800
she has been running around

560
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,680
for you these days,

561
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,000
and she's pined away.

562
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,239
Du Xiaosu,

563
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
stop being mawkish.

564
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,000
Didn't you want to see me as a loser?

565
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,159
Watching a person who used to be proud

566
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,919
to fall to the bottom

567
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,679
like me

568
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,840
can satisfy your curiosity

569
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,280
and compassion, right?

570
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:53,719
I know what you are thinking.

571
00:33:54,239 --> 00:33:56,040
The once extremely arrogant Lei Yuzheng

572
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,520
is no different than other people

573
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,360
when he has lost everything.

574
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,040
Maybe even worse than other people,

575
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:05,479
isn't it?

576
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,120
If it can make you feel better

577
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,360
to see me like this,

578
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,760
then say it.

579
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:14,600
I'm listening.

580
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,280
Du Xiaosu,

581
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,520
save it.

582
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,239
No matter it's your compassion

583
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,560
or curiosity,

584
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,439
you should be satisfied now.

585
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,280
From now on, please

586
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,080
live your life well

587
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,000
and don't think about me again,

588
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,679
or come here to visit me.

589
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,959
Not to mention caring about me.

590
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
Please leave.

591
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,600
Lei Yuzheng,

592
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,560
I...

593
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,760
we will wait for you.

594
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,399
Qunfei, you two can have a chat.

595
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,639
I will be outside.

596
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,719
Mr. Lei,

597
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,719
I think you have some misunderstanding
about Xiaosu.

598
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,000
It's been hard for her.

599
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,399
I know that it's been hard for her.

600
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,600
Just because I know it,

601
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,000
I have to push her away.

602
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:41,840
Don't you think that it's too selfish

603
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:43,080
to waste all her time and effort

604
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:45,199
on a prisoner?

605
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,919
I don't want to
get her involved in this.

606
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,239
But you took her here anyway,

607
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,159
so I had no choice other than saying
all those words.

608
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:11,639
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

609
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,639
So, I had no choice
other than saying all those words.

610
00:36:56,199 --> 00:36:56,919
Bro,

611
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,080
try to think positively.

612
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,959
Women go check on you now

613
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,360
and cry in front of you.

614
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
But only few can last long.

615
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,560
I've seen too much.

616
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,639
Don't you want to talk about it?

617
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,199
What do you want to talk about?

618
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,560
You're talking now.

619
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,080
Actually, nothing much.

620
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,679
I just want to know how you got in here.

621
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,280
Financial case.

622
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:25,040
There're so many kinds of
financial cases.

623
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,120
What kind are you accused of?

624
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,959
Disclosing confidential information
of a public company.

625
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,560
How much did you earn

626
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,080
by doing it?

627
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,199
Not a cent.

628
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,239
Then, what did you do it for?

629
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:41,840
Nothing.

630
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,239
You are so…

631
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:13,800
It's allowed to light a candle here?

632
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,520
No.

633
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,840
You're violating the prison regulations.

634
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,760
I've always been violating
the prison regulations.

635
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,560
Aren't you afraid that
the police might catch you?

636
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,199
So far,

637
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,800
I have never been caught.

638
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:43,959
What book are you reading?

639
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,800
You wouldn't know even if I tell you.

640
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:48,000
"When Genius Failed"

641
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
by Roger Lowenstein.

642
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,520
How did know that?

643
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
What about this?

644
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,719
"The Money Game"

645
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,479
by Adam Smith.

646
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,679
Cool.

647
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,560
No wonder they put us together.

648
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,320
