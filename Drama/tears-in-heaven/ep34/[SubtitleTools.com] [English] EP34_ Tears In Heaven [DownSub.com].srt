00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,879
You should consider yourself lucky
that nothing happened to Fanlv.

17
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,600
If anything happens to her,

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,240
I won't forgive you.

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,080
Dad, it's my fault.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,119
I didn't make Fanlv happy.

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,080
So far,

22
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,559
I assume that it's time to end.

23
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,039
Dad.

24
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,559
You two should get divorced.

25
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:56,440
Ok.

26
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,240
If Fanlv can get better once
we get divorced,

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,479
I will do it right away.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,639
Sounds good.

29
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,240
Once Fanlv gets out of the hospital,

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,199
you should start handling
the divorce procedures.

31
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,080
I have a request before
getting divorced.

32
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,080
I know what you are about to say.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,399
After the divorce,

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,759
I will transfer the mutual shares

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,279
of you and Fanlv to you.

36
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,960
I've been opposed to Fanlv's will

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,800
of getting divorced before.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,759
I've been hoping that you could
try to communicate more and

39
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,320
solve these problems together.

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,559
Dad.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,759
Do you really think that I refused to
get divorced for the shares?

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,839
Even if you offer the shares to me now,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,399
I cannot get divorced right away.

44
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:39,720
Lin Xiangyuan,

45
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,399
you've been with me for long.

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,000
You should know very well about
my personality.

47
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you actually believe that
you can threaten me with this?

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,520
The doctor just said that

49
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,600
there will be significant side effects
if she takes medicine.

50
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,440
However, if she doesn't take medicine,

51
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,880
someone has to
take care of her all the time.

52
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,039
Alright.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,800
You don't need to say anything anymore.

54
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,720
As soon as Fanlv leaves hospital,
start the divorce procedure right away.

55
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:34,759
Siqi.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
He Qunfei.

57
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,080
Are Lei Yuzheng and
Xu You actually together?

58
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,160
Xu You?

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:39,919
What do you mean?

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,559
He's such a businessman,

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,399
even for relationships.

62
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,839
Is he doing investment diversification?

63
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,920
Wait, what are you talking about?

64
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,119
I couldn't follow.

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,160
You men have such a connection.

66
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,880
You didn't see those photos?

67
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,359
Weren't you there the other day
when we had meals?

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,160
What photos?

69
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,079
There're eight articles released
by City Entertainment,

70
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,200
with his intimate photos with Xu You.

71
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,679
Hold on, Siqi.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,760
You are actually believing
these gossips?

73
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Why shouldn't I believe

74
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:05,959
when there's the evidence with photos?

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
Alright. I'm done talking to you.

76
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:08,519
But please tell

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,839
Mr. Lei not to

78
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,760
hurt Du Xiaosu anymore.

79
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,000
Du Xiaosu is already sick.

80
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,880
Siqi.

81
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,079
So inexplicable.

82
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,000
What happened?

83
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,776
(Movie queen Xu You's first exposure of
romance. Secret meeting with Lei's heir)

84
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:38,160
These reporters are constantly
looking to stir up trouble.

85
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,920
Mr. Lei, Siqi said that
Du Xiaosu is sick.

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
How bad is it?

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,480
It seems to be pretty bad.

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,519
Quickly call her and ask
how she's doing.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,920
I assume that Du Xiaosu is probably sick

90
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,399
due to anxiety,
and there's no cure.

91
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
Or I can call Xiaosu and explain

92
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,119
about the photos.

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,119
There's no need.

94
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,920
Are you afraid that
I might spill the beans?

95
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,079
Qunfei, the fact that
we were in Guizhou

96
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,480
cannot be known by any other people,

97
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,480
including Du Xiaosu.

98
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,119
Fine, Mr. Lei.

99
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:19,760
But,

100
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,640
aren't you afraid that
this misunderstanding

101
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,839
will not be rectified?

102
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,959
Have a seat.

103
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:01,920
Which music are you listening to?

104
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:03,920
Movie Soundtrack.

105
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,279
Which movie?

106
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,640
The Avengers.

107
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,399
Hi there.

108
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:11,920
My goodness.

109
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,959
How come it is you?

110
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,559
I can't believe it's you.

111
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,600
What's wrong with Lei Yuzheng?

112
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:18,880
I thought that he would find me

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,399
some great partner.

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,480
I wouldn't come

115
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,279
if I knew it was you.

116
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,200
What do you mean?

117
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,279
That's not what I mean.

118
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,279
Considering our relationship,

119
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,440
we could've simply solved it
through phone call.

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,000
We need to stay alarmed.

121
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
He told us to be careful,

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,640
in case anyone follows us.

123
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,559
Did Lei Yuzheng tell you
everything before he left?

124
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,559
Yes, he did.

125
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,160
The priority is
to control Xie Li.

126
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:46,600
Regarding the approach,

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
we need to figure it out.

128
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,239
We figure it out by ourselves?

129
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,799
If Xie Li was a woman,

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,399
there are numerous ways
that I can control her.

131
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,399
But he's a guy.

132
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,880
What shall I do?

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,119
Keep your voice down.

134
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,519
How about this?

135
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,079
Let's think while we eat.

136
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,160
Exactly what I thought. Let's go.

137
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,959
Ye,

138
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
I heard that

139
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,239
although he's greedy,

140
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,640
he is not stupid.

141
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,679
He would not risk taking
anything recklessly.

142
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,399
How are we able to get closer?

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,920
What is his weakness?

144
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Being greedy, right?

145
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Then that's simple.

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,600
Let's feed him, until he's super full.

147
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,679
Feed him? With your money?

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,760
What do you mean by my money?
It won't cost a dime.

149
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,400
I'm telling you. Managing
this kind of people

150
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,200
requires wisdom instead of obtrusion.

151
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
It seems like you've already known
what to do.

152
00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:05,559
I will put on a good show for him.

153
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,880
Just wait and see.

154
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,960
Come on, cheer up, girls!

155
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,799
Dad.

156
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,640
Here you are.

157
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,479
Dad, I made something for Fanlv.

158
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,280
I'll just put this down and leave.

159
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Nurse.

160
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,000
It's alright. It's alright.

161
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
Nurse.

162
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,840
Dad, Fanlv doesn't have
much appetite recently.

163
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,840
So I made Bamboo stick rice
that she likes

164
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,239
along with millet porridge.

165
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,400
Dad, let me take care of her.

166
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:46,520
Fanlv.

167
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,760
Do you want to have rice or soup first?

168
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,239
Either is fine.

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Dad.

170
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,840
Doctor said that,

171
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Fanlv is not in a good condition
these days.

172
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,239
If you believe in me,

173
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
I really want to stay and
take care of her.

174
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,719
Are you saying that

175
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,119
I cannot even take care of

176
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,039
my own daughter?

177
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,479
Dad, that's not what I mean.

178
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,080
I've married Fanlv for so long.

179
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,880
I know her the best.

180
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,359
Alright.

181
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,880
Please list all her favorite
food and things,

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,760
so we will know clearly,

183
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:22,080
and we won't trouble you anymore.

184
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,679
Dad.

185
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,520
That's it.

186
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,159
I haven't changed my mind at all.

187
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,239
Once she gets better,

188
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,080
you two should
get divorced right away.

189
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,880
Fanlv is just not feeling well,

190
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,599
but she can still take care of herself.

191
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,799
So you can save it.

192
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,320
Fanlv, where are you going?

193
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,119
I will come with you.

194
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,679
It's fine, dad.

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,719
I want to be alone for a while.

196
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,000
Dad, I will check on her

197
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,200
and speak to you later.

198
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,479
Uncle.

199
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:31,919
Hello uncle.

200
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,400
Do you know how to

201
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,239
get to Mr. Lin's house?

202
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,400
Mr. Lin's house?

203
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,080
There're many villagers
with the surname of Lin.

204
00:12:39,239 --> 00:12:41,880
Are you looking for Scholar Lin?

205
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,080
Are you friends of Scholar Lin?

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,880
Yes.

207
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,479
It seems that you are from the city.

208
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,159
He's the only one who made it

209
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,400
to the big city these years.

210
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:54,719
He is successful and

211
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,159
he still remembers our village.

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,080
Check this out. This road,

213
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,880
and the primary school over there,

214
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,719
are all built with his support.

215
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,320
He's made such great
contributions for us.

216
00:13:05,599 --> 00:13:07,359
Excuse me,

217
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,679
is there anyone at his home?

218
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,239
It's hard to say.

219
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:13,239
He bought a house in the city last year,

220
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,880
and he hasn't come back often.

221
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,039
I'm not sure if

222
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,760
his mom is at home or not.

223
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,000
See, that's his house.

224
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,400
It's right over there.

225
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,080
I see. Thank you.

226
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,919
You're welcome.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
Have a good day!

228
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,280
Hello, anyone there?

229
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,719
Hello, anyone?

230
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,320
Qunfei.

231
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,080
Look
(Honor wall of Lin Xiangyuan)

232
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,200
There're certificates
of him all over here.

233
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:08,200
This... is this Lin Xiangyuan?

234
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
It has to be here.

235
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,320
Come on, let's check out the outside.

236
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,559
Who are you?

237
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
Why are you at my house?

238
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,840
We...

239
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,919
Aunt.

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,559
We came here from city,

241
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,239
and it took a long time
for us to get here.

242
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,039
We're so tired.
Could you bring us some water?

243
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,760
What are you here for in this village?

244
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
We want to ask you about someone.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,960
Li Lu.

246
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,679
Are you familiar with this person?

247
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,520
Li Lu? I don't know him.

248
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,280
You're still sick. Stop drinking.

249
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,919
Who said that I am sick?

250
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,960
What are you looking at?

251
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,760
You've never seen people
committing suicide?

252
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,479
What are you going?

253
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,239
Lin Xiangyuan,

254
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,400
don't you have work to do?

255
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,119
I've told you that I won't
do anything stupid.

256
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,719
Please go back.

257
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,599
Otherwise your dad will get worried.

258
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,440
As soon as we get divorced,

259
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,359
you are not the son-in-law.

260
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,960
Then you don't have to
follow his orders anymore.

261
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,159
Isn't this what you've been
expecting the whole time?

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,679
But don't worry.

263
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,799
My dad is very professional at work.

264
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,640
Even though you become an ex-son-in-law,

265
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,880
as long as you do a good job,

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,599
he won't treat you unfairly.

267
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
Let's go through the procedure

268
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,919
when you have time.

269
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,679
Come on. Drink some water.

270
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,479
Thank you! Thank you.

271
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,760
You've come this far.

272
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,320
You should have lunch here.

273
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,719
I will make you lunch.

274
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:19,840
You don't have to do that.

275
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,520
We will leave right after
drinking water.

276
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,200
Do you live here by yourself?

277
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,359
Yes.

278
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,039
My son bought me a house

279
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,119
in the city.

280
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
But it's such a waste for me to

281
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,719
live in such big house by myself.

282
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,479
I feel better just doing some housework

283
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,959
in this village.

284
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:41,040
He's always in a hurry
every time he comes back,

285
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,040
and he doesn't even have time
to talk to me.

286
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,119
Since you two came
all the way from city,

287
00:16:48,479 --> 00:16:50,199
you must have lunch here.

288
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:52,680
I will cook for you.

289
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,880
No, thanks. Aunt.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,040
Aunt.

291
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,319
Fanlv.

292
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,359
Lin Xiangyuan.

293
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,760
You don't have to save me, to be honest.

294
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,319
Life is so boring

295
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,439
for me.

296
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,160
If you are trying to
save this relationship

297
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,760
by treating me well.

298
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,199
Then you should give up.

299
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,640
Fanlv.

300
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:45,880
You're wrong.

301
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:47,959
I've never thought about

302
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,479
saving our relationship.

303
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,199
I know that

304
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:56,959
you became like this all because of me,

305
00:17:59,439 --> 00:18:01,199
and you will never forgive me.

306
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:04,920
I saved you because I must.

307
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,439
Life is so valuable.

308
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,000
I can't watch anyone

309
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,239
giving it up so easy.

310
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,119
Not to mention you are my family.

311
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
If something happens to me today,

312
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,199
you will save me too, right?

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
I've walked here so many times.

314
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,239
But it feels different

315
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,680
every time I'm here.

316
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:36,400
I still remember the first time

317
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:39,560
when I went to your home

318
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,959
to report to your dad.

319
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,119
It was early spring at that time,

320
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:47,199
and the whole city
was vibrant,

321
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,880
just like my hometown.

322
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,400
I just graduated at that time,

323
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,520
and I stood out from many competitors

324
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,839
to be your dad's assistant.

325
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,319
To be honest,

326
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,400
dad is really good to me.

327
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,719
He promoted me as best as he could.

328
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,640
I feel like that

329
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm like the bud on the tree,

330
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,079
and my life has just started.

331
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,119
Everything looked hopeful.

332
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:21,040
Last fall I was also here.

333
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,599
That day you had the abortion.

334
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:25,959
I was walking here by myself,

335
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,880
and the wind was so strong,

336
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,760
making me feel sad.

337
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:36,119
I feel regretful for not cherishing you.

338
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,839
I don't know why

339
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,359
life is still so harsh on me

340
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,560
when I'm trying this hard.

341
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,040
Today we are on this road again.

342
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,880
I hope there's no end on this road.

343
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,719
Then,

344
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,959
I will be able to walk with you forever.

345
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,680
If we reach the end of the road,

346
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,280
so does our marriage.

347
00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:25,239
You finally agreed to get divorced.

348
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,280
I've promised Mr Jiang that

349
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
once you get better,

350
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,040
we will get divorced.

351
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,359
Fanlv, you should know that

352
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,160
I care about you.

353
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,319
I don't want to get divorced either.

354
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:52,400
If fate brings you to me,

355
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,839
to hurt you or make you so desperate

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,839
that you want to destroy yourself,

357
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,959
then I'd rather fight the fate.

358
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,760
I'd rather step out of your life.

359
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,599
Your dad was right.

360
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,439
Our marriage might have been

361
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,680
a mistake from the very beginning.

362
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,920
It's like ocean versus fire.

363
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,439
One person has to disappear,

364
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,079
then everything can come to an end.

365
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,760
The best way that a person can get cured

366
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,319
is to forget about all the past.

367
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,439
Fanlv, we've been husband and wife.

368
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
I just hope that I'm able to

369
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,079
watch you from far away

370
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,680
without bothering you

371
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:47,239
until you have your new life.

372
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,560
Does this person look like Li Lu?

373
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
You are right.

374
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,839
He really does.

375
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,239
Qunfei, it's actually him.

376
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,719
It's been so quiet most of the time.

377
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,079
But it feels so lively today.

378
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,760
Two more dishes will be ready.

379
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,640
Aunt.

380
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,520
Excuse me, we want to
ask you about someone.

381
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,000
Do you know him?

382
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,119
This is the son of Li family
from the village nearby.

383
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:17,479
Do you know his full name?

384
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:18,640
No. I don't know.

385
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:20,199
Is he a friend of your son?

386
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:20,920
Yes.

387
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,199
They've grown up together
since they are kids.

388
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,439
They were good friends at school.

389
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,239
Qunfei, we gotta go.

390
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,079
Ok.

391
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,880
Aunt, we owe you this meal.

392
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,119
We will treat you to meal

393
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,520
when you come to Shanghai. Thank you.

394
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,160
Take care, aunt.

395
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
But I've cooked all the dishes.

396
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,599
What's the matter?

397
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,880
We should have left after eating.

398
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,640
I can see she was

399
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:52,479
so disappointed,

400
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:55,599
and I feel very bad.

401
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:58,479
Alright. I understand how you feel.

402
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:01,479
But I'm afraid that Li Lu's family

403
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,359
will be gone if we are late.

404
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,520
How is it possible?

405
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,359
They don't know we are coming.

406
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,079
Mr. Lei.

407
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
I really can't understand.

408
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,719
Both Lin Xiangyuan and I

409
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,359
came from the small village.

410
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,199
How come he becomes a person

411
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,560
who only cares for money and fame?

412
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,800
Qunfei, as for intrinsic quality,

413
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,439
Lin Xiangyuan might not be

414
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,959
as bad as we thought.

415
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,800
You saw it just now.

416
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,599
I guess that Lin Xiangyuan
used all the money

417
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,800
he made to build the road,

418
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,119
and school for this village.

419
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,479
All the kids in this village

420
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,760
may also know that

421
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,199
as long as they study well,

422
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,719
they can be like Lin Xiangyuan

423
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,239
and change their fates.

424
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,800
As he has a successful career,
he doesn't forget how he started.

425
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,640
Then why doesn't he bring his mom

426
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,319
to Shanghai?

427
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:57,560
Think about it.

428
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,599
His mom is his only family member

429
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,160
in this world.

430
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,959
She is also his biggest weakness.

431
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,000
Lin Xiangyuan seems to stay

432
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,800
in the center of hurricane.

433
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,880
If he makes one mistake,

434
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,560
then there might be

435
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,239
a huge price that he needs to pay.

436
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,119
So he wants his mom to be
far away from Shanghai.

437
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,880
I see, Mr. Lei.

438
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:23,479
Are you acting cold to Du Xiaosu recently

439
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,839
because of the same reason?

440
00:24:55,784 --> 00:24:56,552
(Lei Yuzheng)

441
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,599
Who are you looking for?

442
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,079
Excuse me, does Li Lu

443
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,079
live here?

444
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Are you asking about
the oldest son of Li's family?

445
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Yes.

446
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,719
He came back a few days ago

447
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,760
because he bought his dad
a house in the city.

448
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,479
So do you know where he lives now?

449
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
I remember it's a place called
Happy Neighborhood in Shanghai.

450
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,239
Happy Neighborhood.

451
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,959
Ok. Thank you very much.

452
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,160
Thank you!

453
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,880
Qunfei, let's go back to Shanghai.

454
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,079
Ok.

455
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,400
You don't have to follow me every day.

456
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,079
I said that I won't commit suicide

457
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,239
because there are things that I can't let go.

458
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:38,160
Dad is getting old and

459
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,119
he won't be able to take it.

460
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,479
Don't be upset.

461
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,680
Your illness will be cured.

462
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,719
I will take care of you as well.

463
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
Lin Xiangyuan,

464
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,199
I don't need you to feel pity for me.

465
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,520
Are you silly?

466
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:05,160
I don't feel pity for you.

467
00:27:06,439 --> 00:27:07,599
Trust me.

468
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,000
You will get better for sure
since you have me.

469
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:15,959
You can be with me for now,

470
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,680
but you can't be with me forever.

471
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,719
We are getting divorced soon.

472
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,880
Then we will be strangers to each other.

473
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,760
Are you going to care about me
at that time?

474
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,640
Like I said before, you are
my family member.

475
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,000
Of course I will care about you.

476
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,319
Even though after we get divorced,

477
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,040
as long as you need me,

478
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:41,239
I will be here any time

479
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,760
until you have a new life.

480
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,239
What's good about a new life?

481
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,079
It's just more new scars.

482
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,800
No, it won't be.

483
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:05,760
I won't let anyone hurt you,

484
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,719
including myself.

485
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,640
Where did she go?

486
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,079
Fanlv, finally here you are.

487
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:30,199
Come on.

488
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,280
Send her upstairs, quickly.

489
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,239
Come on.

490
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,079
Dad, I am leaving.

491
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,319
Hold on.

492
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:02,839
It's too late and it's cold outside.

493
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,199
You don't have to go back.

494
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,880
Stay in the guest room.

495
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,560
Thank you dad.

496
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:28,359
Fanlv.

497
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,760
The orchid in my hometown Guizhou
is very beautiful.

498
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,239
Do you want to check it out?

499
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,000
Xiangyuan, if our kid is still alive,

500
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,520
then everything would

501
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,800
be different, right?

502
00:29:59,272 --> 00:30:02,344
(Registration of Certificate Office)

503
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,479
Please come in.

504
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,328
(Marriage Certificate. Jiang Fanlv)

505
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,680
Would you like to have a second thought?

506
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,239
There's no such need.

507
00:30:28,439 --> 00:30:29,920
We've already decided.

508
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,560
Then tell me about

509
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,119
why you want to get divorced.

510
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,680
It has nothing to do with him.
It's all my fault.

511
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,760
No it's my bad. I got her into trouble.

512
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,560
He can have a normal life without me.

513
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
She can pursue her own happiness

514
00:30:44,239 --> 00:30:45,839
if she leaves me.

515
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,119
Wait for a moment.

516
00:30:47,439 --> 00:30:48,479
It's the first time that

517
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,280
I met couple like you.

518
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,280
All others were complaining
about each other,

519
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,959
but you two want each other to be happy.

520
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,079
If that's the case,

521
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,199
how about not getting divorced?

522
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,479
No, we must get divorced.

523
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,880
Our characteristics are too different.

524
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,079
She is right.

525
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,719
We don't match in many ways.

526
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,199
Such as?

527
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,920
Do we have to say?

528
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,760
Yes, you have to say it.

529
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,920
Alright.

530
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,160
I can tell the details.

531
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,880
I'm from a small village in Guizhou,

532
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,760
while she grew up in Shanghai,

533
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,000
and she went to study abroad.

534
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:28,040
She likes the kind of man

535
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:29,439
who is wise, brave, and humorous.

536
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
However, I have to act so carefully

537
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:35,599
all the time every day.

538
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,880
I admit that

539
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:39,040
when I first tried to get closer to her,

540
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,920
wealth was part of the reason.

541
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,800
Marriage is for two persons

542
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:48,119
to manage together.

543
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,520
Since Fanlv wants to get divorced,

544
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:54,920
I will support her.

545
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,839
Fanlv.

546
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,760
This is what my mom
asked me to give to you

547
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,479
when we got married.

548
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,479
I was afraid that you wouldn't like it
because of the style.

549
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,719
But please take it

550
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,239
as a memory.

551
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,800
The computer system is down.

552
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,439
It seems like we can't go through
the procedure today.

553
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,920
You two should come another day.

554
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,479
I know that you are trying to

555
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,160
save our marriage.

556
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,079
Thank you.

557
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,760
You know what I was trying to do.

558
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,560
Then listen to

559
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,239
a word from me.

560
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,280
Be sure to cherish the fate

561
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,479
once it's yours.

562
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,839
You have to fight for it.

563
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:05,079
Ok. I will fight for it.

564
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:06,800
I will try my best to

565
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:10,800
be your husband next life.

566
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:16,880
Well then.

567
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:20,319
Wait for a moment.

568
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,280
It's just a divorce.

569
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
We don't have to rush.

570
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Miss, you are right.

571
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,719
Marriage is fate.

572
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,280
Xiangyuan,

573
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,000
let's go back and think about it again.

574
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,919
Young man,

575
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,639
take the stuff and go after her.

576
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,959
Hurry up.

577
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,239
Li Lu.

578
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,159
Li Lu.

579
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,120
Li Lu.

580
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,040
Li Lu. Come out.

581
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,959
We just want to ask you one thing.

582
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,080
Look at you now.

583
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,360
Now it's so hard to work in
newspaper companies.

584
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,239
Soon they won't even be able to
offer the bonus.

585
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,479
Every month the salary

586
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,399
is barely enough to pay the rent.

587
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,679
Then why didn't you come to Mr. Lin?

588
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,760
Brother.

589
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:19,239
Xiangyuan has helped me too many times.

590
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,000
I also have my pride, right?

591
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Come on, brother.

592
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Now,

593
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,560
I'd like to ask you a favor.

594
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,919
What is the matter?

595
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,159
Write a special column.

596
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,320
Lei Yuzheng is suspected of
stock insider trading.

597
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:43,959
Take it.

598
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:45,600
Li Lu.

599
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,800
There's 200 thousand yuan in this card.

600
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,000
It's enough for you.

601
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:07,159
Don't let him go.

602
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,439
Who are you? Let go of me.

603
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,600
Help!

604
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,399
Qunfei.

605
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,080
Who are you guys?

606
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:16,959
Call the police.

607
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,159
What are you waiting for?

608
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,120
Let go of me. Let go of me!

609
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,959
Help! Help!

610
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
Lin Xiangyuan.

611
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,120
Can I still believe in your words?

612
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,040
Fanlv.

613
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:10,800
I will prove to you

614
00:37:11,919 --> 00:37:13,320
with my actions.

615
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,600
Did you go through the procedure?

616
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
Dad.

617
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,399
No.

618
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,280
What?

619
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,639
You didn't get divorced.

620
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,040
Did Lin Xiangyuan threaten you?

621
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,360
No.

622
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,879
It was my own decision.

623
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,439
Dad.

624
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,280
I was headstrong when I

625
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,639
married Lin Xiangyuan.

626
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,360
Now I can see that

627
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,199
there's unfairness in our marriage.

628
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:59,199
Marriage is not a game

629
00:37:59,879 --> 00:38:01,399
and we shouldn't deal with it
because of impulsion,

630
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,760
not to mention hurting each other.

631
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,280
So I want to calm down
and think through it.

632
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,320
Daughter.

633
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,879
Do you really think that Lin Xiangyuan

634
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,120
is worth thinking through?

635
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,959
Actually when I look back,

636
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:29,120
Lin Xiangyuan has also
gone through a lot.

637
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,399
From running after me to
tolerating me in marriage,

638
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:38,840
all the way to taking care of me
each day,

639
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
it's been hard for him too.

640
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,199
So what's your plan

641
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,600
for the future?

642
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,159
I don't know yet

643
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:53,879
but I haven't made up my mind
to get divorced.

644
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:56,760
As long as you won't act
so headstrong anymore

645
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,879
no matter whether
you decide to get divorced or not,

646
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,760
I will always support you.

647
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
Dad.

648
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,399
There's something
I'd like to ask you about.
