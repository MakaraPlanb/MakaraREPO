00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,879
You should consider yourself lucky
that nothing happened to Fanlv.

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,600
If anything happens to her,

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
I won't forgive you.

19
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Dad, it's my fault.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,119
I didn't make Fanlv happy.

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
So far,

22
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,559
I assume that it's time to end.

23
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,039
Dad.

24
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,559
You two should get divorced.

25
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,440
Ok.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,240
If Fanlv can get better once
we get divorced,

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,479
I will do it right away.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,639
Sounds good.

29
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,240
Once Fanlv gets out of the hospital,

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,199
you should start handling
the divorce procedures.

31
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,080
I have a request before
getting divorced.

32
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,080
I know what you are about to say.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,399
After the divorce,

34
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,759
I will transfer the mutual shares

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,279
of you and Fanlv to you.

36
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,960
I've been opposed to Fanlv's will

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
of getting divorced before.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,759
I've been hoping that you could
try to communicate more and

39
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:03,320
solve these problems together.

40
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,559
Dad.

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,759
Do you really think that I refused to
get divorced for the shares?

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,839
Even if you offer the shares to me now,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,399
I cannot get divorced right away.

44
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,720
Lin Xiangyuan,

45
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,399
you've been with me for long.

46
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,000
You should know very well about
my personality.

47
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you actually believe that
you can threaten me with this?

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
The doctor just said that

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,600
there will be significant side effects
if she takes medicine.

50
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,440
However, if she doesn't take medicine,

51
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,880
someone has to
take care of her all the time.

52
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,039
Alright.

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,800
You don't need to say anything anymore.

54
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,720
As soon as Fanlv leaves hospital,
start the divorce procedure right away.

55
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,759
Siqi.

56
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,800
He Qunfei.

57
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,080
Are Lei Yuzheng and
Xu You actually together?

58
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,160
Xu You?

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,919
What do you mean?

60
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,559
He's such a businessman,

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,399
even for relationships.

62
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Is he doing investment diversification?

63
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,920
Wait, what are you talking about?

64
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,119
I couldn't follow.

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,160
You men have such a connection.

66
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,880
You didn't see those photos?

67
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,359
Weren't you there the other day
when we had meals?

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,160
What photos?

69
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,079
There're eight articles released
by City Entertainment,

70
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,200
with his intimate photos with Xu You.

71
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:35,679
Hold on, Siqi.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,760
You are actually believing
these gossips?

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Why shouldn't I believe

74
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,959
when there's the evidence with photos?

75
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,920
Alright. I'm done talking to you.

76
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,519
But please tell

77
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,839
Mr. Lei not to

78
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,760
hurt Du Xiaosu anymore.

79
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,000
Du Xiaosu is already sick.

80
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,880
Siqi.

81
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,079
So inexplicable.

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
What happened?

83
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:07,776
(Movie queen Xu You's first exposure of
romance. Secret meeting with Lei's heir)

84
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:13,160
These reporters are constantly
looking to stir up trouble.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Mr. Lei, Siqi said that
Du Xiaosu is sick.

86
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,160
How bad is it?

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,480
It seems to be pretty bad.

88
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,519
Quickly call her and ask
how she's doing.

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,920
I assume that Du Xiaosu is probably sick

90
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,399
due to anxiety,
and there's no cure.

91
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
Or I can call Xiaosu and explain

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,119
about the photos.

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,119
There's no need.

94
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:41,920
Are you afraid that
I might spill the beans?

95
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,079
Qunfei, the fact that
we were in Guizhou

96
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,480
cannot be known by any other people,

97
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:48,480
including Du Xiaosu.

98
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,119
Fine, Mr. Lei.

99
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,760
But,

100
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,640
aren't you afraid that
this misunderstanding

101
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,839
will not be rectified?

102
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,959
Have a seat.

103
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:36,920
Which music are you listening to?

104
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,920
Movie Soundtrack.

105
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,279
Which movie?

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,640
The Avengers.

107
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,399
Hi there.

108
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:46,920
My goodness.

109
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,959
How come it is you?

110
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,559
I can't believe it's you.

111
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,600
What's wrong with Lei Yuzheng?

112
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:53,880
I thought that he would find me

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,399
some great partner.

114
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,480
I wouldn't come

115
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,279
if I knew it was you.

116
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,200
What do you mean?

117
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,279
That's not what I mean.

118
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,279
Considering our relationship,

119
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,440
we could've simply solved it
through phone call.

120
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
We need to stay alarmed.

121
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
He told us to be careful,

122
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,640
in case anyone follows us.

123
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,559
Did Lei Yuzheng tell you
everything before he left?

124
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,559
Yes, he did.

125
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,160
The priority is
to control Xie Li.

126
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,600
Regarding the approach,

127
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
we need to figure it out.

128
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,239
We figure it out by ourselves?

129
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,799
If Xie Li was a woman,

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,399
there are numerous ways
that I can control her.

131
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,399
But he's a guy.

132
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,880
What shall I do?

133
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,119
Keep your voice down.

134
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,519
How about this?

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,079
Let's think while we eat.

136
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,160
Exactly what I thought. Let's go.

137
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,959
Ye,

138
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,760
I heard that

139
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,239
although he's greedy,

140
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,640
he is not stupid.

141
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,679
He would not risk taking
anything recklessly.

142
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,399
How are we able to get closer?

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
What is his weakness?

144
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Being greedy, right?

145
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,480
Then that's simple.

146
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,600
Let's feed him, until he's super full.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,679
Feed him? With your money?

148
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,760
What do you mean by my money?
It won't cost a dime.

149
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm telling you. Managing
this kind of people

150
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,200
requires wisdom instead of obtrusion.

151
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
It seems like you've already known
what to do.

152
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,559
I will put on a good show for him.

153
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,880
Just wait and see.

154
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,960
Come on, cheer up, girls!

155
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,799
Dad.

156
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,640
Here you are.

157
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,479
Dad, I made something for Fanlv.

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,280
I'll just put this down and leave.

159
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Nurse.

160
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,000
It's alright. It's alright.

161
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
Nurse.

162
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Dad, Fanlv doesn't have
much appetite recently.

163
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,840
So I made Bamboo stick rice
that she likes

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,239
along with millet porridge.

165
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,400
Dad, let me take care of her.

166
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,520
Fanlv.

167
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,760
Do you want to have rice or soup first?

168
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,239
Either is fine.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,760
Dad.

170
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,840
Doctor said that,

171
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
Fanlv is not in a good condition
these days.

172
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,239
If you believe in me,

173
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,760
I really want to stay and
take care of her.

174
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,719
Are you saying that

175
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,119
I cannot even take care of

176
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,039
my own daughter?

177
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,479
Dad, that's not what I mean.

178
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,080
I've married Fanlv for so long.

179
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,880
I know her the best.

180
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,359
Alright.

181
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,880
Please list all her favorite
food and things,

182
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,760
so we will know clearly,

183
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:57,080
and we won't trouble you anymore.

184
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,679
Dad.

185
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,520
That's it.

186
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,159
I haven't changed my mind at all.

187
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,239
Once she gets better,

188
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,080
you two should
get divorced right away.

189
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,880
Fanlv is just not feeling well,

190
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,599
but she can still take care of herself.

191
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,799
So you can save it.

192
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:27,320
Fanlv, where are you going?

193
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,119
I will come with you.

194
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,679
It's fine, dad.

195
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,719
I want to be alone for a while.

196
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,000
Dad, I will check on her

197
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,200
and speak to you later.

198
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,479
Uncle.

199
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919
Hello uncle.

200
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:08,400
Do you know how to

201
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,239
get to Mr. Lin's house?

202
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,400
Mr. Lin's house?

203
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:14,080
There're many villagers
with the surname of Lin.

204
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,880
Are you looking for Scholar Lin?

205
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Are you friends of Scholar Lin?

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Yes.

207
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,479
It seems that you are from the city.

208
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,159
He's the only one who made it

209
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,400
to the big city these years.

210
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,719
He is successful and

211
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,159
he still remembers our village.

212
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,080
Check this out. This road,

213
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,880
and the primary school over there,

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,719
are all built with his support.

215
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,320
He's made such great
contributions for us.

216
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,359
Excuse me,

217
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,679
is there anyone at his home?

218
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,239
It's hard to say.

219
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,239
He bought a house in the city last year,

220
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,880
and he hasn't come back often.

221
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:52,039
I'm not sure if

222
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:52,760
his mom is at home or not.

223
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,000
See, that's his house.

224
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,400
It's right over there.

225
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,080
I see. Thank you.

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,919
You're welcome.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,960
Have a good day!

228
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:15,280
Hello, anyone there?

229
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:21,719
Hello, anyone?

230
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,320
Qunfei.

231
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,080
Look
(Honor wall of Lin Xiangyuan)

232
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,200
There're certificates
of him all over here.

233
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:43,200
This... is this Lin Xiangyuan?

234
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
It has to be here.

235
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,320
Come on, let's check out the outside.

236
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:57,559
Who are you?

237
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Why are you at my house?

238
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,840
We...

239
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:00,919
Aunt.

240
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,559
We came here from city,

241
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,239
and it took a long time
for us to get here.

242
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,039
We're so tired.
Could you bring us some water?

243
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,760
What are you here for in this village?

244
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,880
We want to ask you about someone.

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,960
Li Lu.

246
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,679
Are you familiar with this person?

247
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,520
Li Lu? I don't know him.

248
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,280
You're still sick. Stop drinking.

249
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,919
Who said that I am sick?

250
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
What are you looking at?

251
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,760
You've never seen people
committing suicide?

252
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,479
What are you going?

253
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,239
Lin Xiangyuan,

254
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,400
don't you have work to do?

255
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,119
I've told you that I won't
do anything stupid.

256
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,719
Please go back.

257
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,599
Otherwise your dad will get worried.

258
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,440
As soon as we get divorced,

259
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,359
you are not the son-in-law.

260
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,960
Then you don't have to
follow his orders anymore.

261
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,159
Isn't this what you've been
expecting the whole time?

262
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,679
But don't worry.

263
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,799
My dad is very professional at work.

264
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,640
Even though you become an ex-son-in-law,

265
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:24,880
as long as you do a good job,

266
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,599
he won't treat you unfairly.

267
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Let's go through the procedure

268
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,919
when you have time.

269
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,679
Come on. Drink some water.

270
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,479
Thank you! Thank you.

271
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,760
You've come this far.

272
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,320
You should have lunch here.

273
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,719
I will make you lunch.

274
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,840
You don't have to do that.

275
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,520
We will leave right after
drinking water.

276
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,200
Do you live here by yourself?

277
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,359
Yes.

278
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:00,039
My son bought me a house

279
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,119
in the city.

280
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
But it's such a waste for me to

281
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,719
live in such big house by myself.

282
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,479
I feel better just doing some housework

283
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,959
in this village.

284
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:16,040
He's always in a hurry
every time he comes back,

285
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,040
and he doesn't even have time
to talk to me.

286
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,119
Since you two came
all the way from city,

287
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:25,199
you must have lunch here.

288
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,680
I will cook for you.

289
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,880
No, thanks. Aunt.

290
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,040
Aunt.

291
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,319
Fanlv.

292
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,359
Lin Xiangyuan.

293
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:03,760
You don't have to save me, to be honest.

294
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,319
Life is so boring

295
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,439
for me.

296
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,160
If you are trying to
save this relationship

297
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,760
by treating me well.

298
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,199
Then you should give up.

299
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,640
Fanlv.

300
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:20,880
You're wrong.

301
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:22,959
I've never thought about

302
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,479
saving our relationship.

303
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,199
I know that

304
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,959
you became like this all because of me,

305
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,199
and you will never forgive me.

306
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,920
I saved you because I must.

307
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,439
Life is so valuable.

308
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't watch anyone

309
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,239
giving it up so easy.

310
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,119
Not to mention you are my family.

311
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,760
If something happens to me today,

312
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,199
you will save me too, right?

313
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I've walked here so many times.

314
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,239
But it feels different

315
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,680
every time I'm here.

316
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,400
I still remember the first time

317
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:14,560
when I went to your home

318
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:16,959
to report to your dad.

319
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,119
It was early spring at that time,

320
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,199
and the whole city
was vibrant,

321
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,880
just like my hometown.

322
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,400
I just graduated at that time,

323
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,520
and I stood out from many competitors

324
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:33,839
to be your dad's assistant.

325
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,319
To be honest,

326
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,400
dad is really good to me.

327
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:40,719
He promoted me as best as he could.

328
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,640
I feel like that

329
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm like the bud on the tree,

330
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,079
and my life has just started.

331
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,119
Everything looked hopeful.

332
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,040
Last fall I was also here.

333
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,599
That day you had the abortion.

334
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,959
I was walking here by myself,

335
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,880
and the wind was so strong,

336
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,760
making me feel sad.

337
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,119
I feel regretful for not cherishing you.

338
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,839
I don't know why

339
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,359
life is still so harsh on me

340
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
when I'm trying this hard.

341
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,040
Today we are on this road again.

342
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
I hope there's no end on this road.

343
00:20:26,719 --> 00:20:27,719
Then,

344
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,959
I will be able to walk with you forever.

345
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,680
If we reach the end of the road,

346
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,280
so does our marriage.

347
00:20:58,719 --> 00:21:00,239
You finally agreed to get divorced.

348
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,280
I've promised Mr Jiang that

349
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,000
once you get better,

350
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,040
we will get divorced.

351
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,359
Fanlv, you should know that

352
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,160
I care about you.

353
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,319
I don't want to get divorced either.

354
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:27,400
If fate brings you to me,

355
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,839
to hurt you or make you so desperate

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,839
that you want to destroy yourself,

357
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,959
then I'd rather fight the fate.

358
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,760
I'd rather step out of your life.

359
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:45,599
Your dad was right.

360
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,439
Our marriage might have been

361
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,680
a mistake from the very beginning.

362
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,920
It's like ocean versus fire.

363
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,439
One person has to disappear,

364
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,079
then everything can come to an end.

365
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,760
The best way that a person can get cured

366
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,319
is to forget about all the past.

367
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:10,439
Fanlv, we've been husband and wife.

368
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I just hope that I'm able to

369
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,079
watch you from far away

370
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,680
without bothering you

371
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,239
until you have your new life.

372
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,560
Does this person look like Li Lu?

373
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
You are right.

374
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,839
He really does.

375
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,239
Qunfei, it's actually him.

376
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,719
It's been so quiet most of the time.

377
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,079
But it feels so lively today.

378
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,760
Two more dishes will be ready.

379
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,640
Aunt.

380
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,520
Excuse me, we want to
ask you about someone.

381
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you know him?

382
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:51,119
This is the son of Li family
from the village nearby.

383
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,479
Do you know his full name?

384
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,640
No. I don't know.

385
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,199
Is he a friend of your son?

386
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:55,920
Yes.

387
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,199
They've grown up together
since they are kids.

388
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,439
They were good friends at school.

389
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:00,239
Qunfei, we gotta go.

390
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,079
Ok.

391
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,880
Aunt, we owe you this meal.

392
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,119
We will treat you to meal

393
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,520
when you come to Shanghai. Thank you.

394
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,160
Take care, aunt.

395
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,640
But I've cooked all the dishes.

396
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,599
What's the matter?

397
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,880
We should have left after eating.

398
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,640
I can see she was

399
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:27,479
so disappointed,

400
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:30,599
and I feel very bad.

401
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,479
Alright. I understand how you feel.

402
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,479
But I'm afraid that Li Lu's family

403
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,359
will be gone if we are late.

404
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,520
How is it possible?

405
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,359
They don't know we are coming.

406
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,079
Mr. Lei.

407
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,920
I really can't understand.

408
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,719
Both Lin Xiangyuan and I

409
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,359
came from the small village.

410
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,199
How come he becomes a person

411
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,560
who only cares for money and fame?

412
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:05,800
Qunfei, as for intrinsic quality,

413
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,439
Lin Xiangyuan might not be

414
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,959
as bad as we thought.

415
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,800
You saw it just now.

416
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,599
I guess that Lin Xiangyuan
used all the money

417
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,800
he made to build the road,

418
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,119
and school for this village.

419
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,479
All the kids in this village

420
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,760
may also know that

421
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,199
as long as they study well,

422
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,719
they can be like Lin Xiangyuan

423
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,239
and change their fates.

424
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,800
As he has a successful career,
he doesn't forget how he started.

425
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:28,640
Then why doesn't he bring his mom

426
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,319
to Shanghai?

427
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,560
Think about it.

428
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,599
His mom is his only family member

429
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,160
in this world.

430
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,959
She is also his biggest weakness.

431
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,000
Lin Xiangyuan seems to stay

432
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,800
in the center of hurricane.

433
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,880
If he makes one mistake,

434
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,560
then there might be

435
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,239
a huge price that he needs to pay.

436
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,119
So he wants his mom to be
far away from Shanghai.

437
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,880
I see, Mr. Lei.

438
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,479
Are you acting cold to Du Xiaosu recently

439
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,839
because of the same reason?

440
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:31,552
(Lei Yuzheng)

441
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,599
Who are you looking for?

442
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,079
Excuse me, does Li Lu

443
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,079
live here?

444
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,280
Are you asking about
the oldest son of Li's family?

445
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:10,800
Yes.

446
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,719
He came back a few days ago

447
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,760
because he bought his dad
a house in the city.

448
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,479
So do you know where he lives now?

449
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,280
I remember it's a place called
Happy Neighborhood in Shanghai.

450
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,239
Happy Neighborhood.

451
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,959
Ok. Thank you very much.

452
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,160
Thank you!

453
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,880
Qunfei, let's go back to Shanghai.

454
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,079
Ok.

455
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,400
You don't have to follow me every day.

456
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,079
I said that I won't commit suicide

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,239
because there are things that I can't let go.

458
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,160
Dad is getting old and

459
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,119
he won't be able to take it.

460
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,479
Don't be upset.

461
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,680
Your illness will be cured.

462
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,719
I will take care of you as well.

463
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,760
Lin Xiangyuan,

464
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,199
I don't need you to feel pity for me.

465
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,520
Are you silly?

466
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,160
I don't feel pity for you.

467
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,599
Trust me.

468
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
You will get better for sure
since you have me.

469
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,959
You can be with me for now,

470
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,680
but you can't be with me forever.

471
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,719
We are getting divorced soon.

472
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,880
Then we will be strangers to each other.

473
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,760
Are you going to care about me
at that time?

474
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,640
Like I said before, you are
my family member.

475
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,000
Of course I will care about you.

476
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,319
Even though after we get divorced,

477
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,040
as long as you need me,

478
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,239
I will be here any time

479
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,760
until you have a new life.

480
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,239
What's good about a new life?

481
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,079
It's just more new scars.

482
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,800
No, it won't be.

483
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,760
I won't let anyone hurt you,

484
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:43,719
including myself.

485
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,640
Where did she go?

486
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,079
Fanlv, finally here you are.

487
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,199
Come on.

488
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,280
Send her upstairs, quickly.

489
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,239
Come on.

490
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,079
Dad, I am leaving.

491
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,319
Hold on.

492
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:37,839
It's too late and it's cold outside.

493
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,199
You don't have to go back.

494
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,880
Stay in the guest room.

495
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,560
Thank you dad.

496
00:30:02,439 --> 00:30:03,359
Fanlv.

497
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:06,760
The orchid in my hometown Guizhou
is very beautiful.

498
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,239
Do you want to check it out?

499
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,000
Xiangyuan, if our kid is still alive,

500
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,520
then everything would

501
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,800
be different, right?

502
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:37,344
(Registration of Certificate Office)

503
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:46,479
Please come in.

504
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,328
(Marriage Certificate. Jiang Fanlv)

505
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,680
Would you like to have a second thought?

506
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,239
There's no such need.

507
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,920
We've already decided.

508
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,560
Then tell me about

509
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,119
why you want to get divorced.

510
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,680
It has nothing to do with him.
It's all my fault.

511
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,760
No it's my bad. I got her into trouble.

512
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,560
He can have a normal life without me.

513
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
She can pursue her own happiness

514
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,839
if she leaves me.

515
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:22,119
Wait for a moment.

516
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:23,479
It's the first time that

517
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,280
I met couple like you.

518
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,280
All others were complaining
about each other,

519
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,959
but you two want each other to be happy.

520
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,079
If that's the case,

521
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,199
how about not getting divorced?

522
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:36,479
No, we must get divorced.

523
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,880
Our characteristics are too different.

524
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,079
She is right.

525
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,719
We don't match in many ways.

526
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,199
Such as?

527
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,920
Do we have to say?

528
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,760
Yes, you have to say it.

529
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,920
Alright.

530
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,160
I can tell the details.

531
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm from a small village in Guizhou,

532
00:31:58,199 --> 00:31:59,760
while she grew up in Shanghai,

533
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,000
and she went to study abroad.

534
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,040
She likes the kind of man

535
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:04,439
who is wise, brave, and humorous.

536
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
However, I have to act so carefully

537
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,599
all the time every day.

538
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,880
I admit that

539
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,040
when I first tried to get closer to her,

540
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,920
wealth was part of the reason.

541
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,800
Marriage is for two persons

542
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,119
to manage together.

543
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,520
Since Fanlv wants to get divorced,

544
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:29,920
I will support her.

545
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,839
Fanlv.

546
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:39,760
This is what my mom
asked me to give to you

547
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,479
when we got married.

548
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,479
I was afraid that you wouldn't like it
because of the style.

549
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,719
But please take it

550
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,239
as a memory.

551
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,800
The computer system is down.

552
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:17,439
It seems like we can't go through
the procedure today.

553
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,920
You two should come another day.

554
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,479
I know that you are trying to

555
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,160
save our marriage.

556
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,079
Thank you.

557
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,760
You know what I was trying to do.

558
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,560
Then listen to

559
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,239
a word from me.

560
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:32,280
Be sure to cherish the fate

561
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,479
once it's yours.

562
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,839
You have to fight for it.

563
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,079
Ok. I will fight for it.

564
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,800
I will try my best to

565
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:45,800
be your husband next life.

566
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:51,880
Well then.

567
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:55,319
Wait for a moment.

568
00:33:55,959 --> 00:33:57,280
It's just a divorce.

569
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
We don't have to rush.

570
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,400
Miss, you are right.

571
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:05,719
Marriage is fate.

572
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,280
Xiangyuan,

573
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,000
let's go back and think about it again.

574
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,919
Young man,

575
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,639
take the stuff and go after her.

576
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,959
Hurry up.

577
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,239
Li Lu.

578
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,159
Li Lu.

579
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,120
Li Lu.

580
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:28,040
Li Lu. Come out.

581
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:29,959
We just want to ask you one thing.

582
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,080
Look at you now.

583
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,360
Now it's so hard to work in
newspaper companies.

584
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,239
Soon they won't even be able to
offer the bonus.

585
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,479
Every month the salary

586
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,399
is barely enough to pay the rent.

587
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,679
Then why didn't you come to Mr. Lin?

588
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,760
Brother.

589
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,239
Xiangyuan has helped me too many times.

590
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,000
I also have my pride, right?

591
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,360
Come on, brother.

592
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
Now,

593
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,560
I'd like to ask you a favor.

594
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,919
What is the matter?

595
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:13,159
Write a special column.

596
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,320
Lei Yuzheng is suspected of
stock insider trading.

597
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:18,959
Take it.

598
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,600
Li Lu.

599
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:23,800
There's 200 thousand yuan in this card.

600
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,000
It's enough for you.

601
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,159
Don't let him go.

602
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:45,439
Who are you? Let go of me.

603
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,600
Help!

604
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,399
Qunfei.

605
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,080
Who are you guys?

606
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:51,959
Call the police.

607
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,159
What are you waiting for?

608
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Let go of me. Let go of me!

609
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,959
Help! Help!

610
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Lin Xiangyuan.

611
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,120
Can I still believe in your words?

612
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,040
Fanlv.

613
00:37:44,439 --> 00:37:45,800
I will prove to you

614
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:48,320
with my actions.

615
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:51,600
Did you go through the procedure?

616
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,560
Dad.

617
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,399
No.

618
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,280
What?

619
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,639
You didn't get divorced.

620
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,040
Did Lin Xiangyuan threaten you?

621
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,360
No.

622
00:38:11,879 --> 00:38:13,879
It was my own decision.

623
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,439
Dad.

624
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,280
I was headstrong when I

625
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,639
married Lin Xiangyuan.

626
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,360
Now I can see that

627
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,199
there's unfairness in our marriage.

628
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,199
Marriage is not a game

629
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,399
and we shouldn't deal with it
because of impulsion,

630
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,760
not to mention hurting each other.

631
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,280
So I want to calm down
and think through it.

632
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
Daughter.

633
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,879
Do you really think that Lin Xiangyuan

634
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:53,120
is worth thinking through?

635
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,959
Actually when I look back,

636
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,120
Lin Xiangyuan has also
gone through a lot.

637
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,399
From running after me to
tolerating me in marriage,

638
00:39:11,879 --> 00:39:13,840
all the way to taking care of me
each day,

639
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
it's been hard for him too.

640
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,199
So what's your plan

641
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,600
for the future?

642
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,159
I don't know yet

643
00:39:25,439 --> 00:39:28,879
but I haven't made up my mind
to get divorced.

644
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:31,760
As long as you won't act
so headstrong anymore

645
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,879
no matter whether
you decide to get divorced or not,

646
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,760
I will always support you.

647
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Dad.

648
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,399
There's something
I'd like to ask you about.
