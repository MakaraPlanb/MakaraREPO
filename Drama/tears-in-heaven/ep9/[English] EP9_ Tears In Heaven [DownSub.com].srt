16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,399
How could it be so unlucky!

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,160
This happened on the first day
of construction.

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,839
I heard that

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,039
the workers thought the
cost of demolition was too low.

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,600
That's why it was a mess.

21
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
Mr. Lin,

22
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,679
what's wrong with Xinsheng?

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,679
Your company dumped such a mess,

24
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,039
and now Yutian takes all of it?

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,839
I really didn't know about this.

26
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,880
Is it an unexpected situation?

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,759
Mr. Wang,

28
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
do you think Yutian now

29
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,039
gets into trouble?

30
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,600
Mr. Lin is afraid of getting Yutian
into tough situation,

31
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,479
or expecting it to be in trouble?

32
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,960
Mr. Lei,

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,399
you are so funny.

34
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,240
Xinsheng can't even apologize enough to
Yutian.

35
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
How can we expect something to
happen to Yutian?

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,960
Really?

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
I remember that I've communicated
with Mr. Lin

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,520
about the demolition costs.

39
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,839
Mr. Lin told me that

40
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,199
the workers were fine with it.

41
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,960
Now we are faced with
such a big mistake.

42
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,520
What does Mr. Lin want to say

43
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,160
except for apology?

44
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,360
Mr. Lei,

45
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
I suppose that

46
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,000
these workers are not well-educated.

47
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,919
Their words can be untrustworthy.

48
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:20,119
Do you think so?

49
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,559
Of course,

50
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,119
Xinsheng has responsibilities for that

51
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,919
because we should not have trusted them.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,199
Yuzheng,

53
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,240
has this been resolved yet?

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
Let's all relax.

55
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:32,160
It has been resolved.

56
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:33,919
We have talked to workers.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,119
A new agreement was reached.

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,479
For the old and decrepit workers,

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,440
the company will pay placement fees
at its discretion.

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,960
For the rest of those

61
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,479
young and strong workers,

62
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:46,119
their only claim

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,600
is just to get a job.

64
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,399
When the Entertainment Center
is completed,

65
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,080
we will recruit more people.

66
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,080
And then,

67
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:53,440
we will put priority

68
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,880
on this group of people.

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
If there is no person with
an ulterior motive

70
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,279
fanning the flames in it,

71
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,279
I think this kind of conflict

72
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,919
can be avoided.

73
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,279
Are you awake?

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,399
Why am I here?

75
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,440
You fainted yesterday with
low blood sugar

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,279
and high fever.

77
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,519
You are sent here by someone.

78
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,519
Here.

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,519
It's fine.

80
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,760
The fever has finally subsided.

81
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,959
Who sent me here?

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,359
Isn't he your boyfriend?

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,040
Boyfriend?

84
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,679
Yes.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,760
The man who carried you in yesterday.

86
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,760
I think he was in a hurry,

87
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,760
running up and down,

88
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,079
without a moment to have a rest.

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,160
Where is he now?

90
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,559
Where did he go?

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,640
He seems to have left early
in the morning.

92
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,480
However,

93
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,399
he was here all night yesterday to
watch over you.

94
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,200
This morning,

95
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,959
he bought you so much food.

96
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,079
He's very careful.

97
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:07,920
Wait for the doctor to come later.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He'll check again for you.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,279
If there is nothing wrong with you,

100
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,760
you will be discharged today.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay, thanks.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,959
Good.

103
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,520
(Back to work in Boyuan)

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,440
Back to work in Boyuan.

105
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,480
Uncle Lei, I have a friend in France.

106
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,399
I asked him to bring you the
best deep-sea fish oil,

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,559
spirulina,

108
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,799
these cordyceps sinensis,

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
ganoderma lucidum and other things.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,799
Remember to make tea and
drink it.

111
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,880
Oh, Uncle Lei,

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,679
I got a VIP card for you

113
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,119
at the spa resort.

114
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,399
This place is convenient,

115
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,559
especially to the golf course.

116
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,079
The doctor said

117
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,839
the minerals in hot springs

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,200
is helpful for your recovery

119
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,119
from this cardiovascular disease.

120
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:14,880
Great!

121
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,720
I'll be there.

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,600
It's better to have a daughter, right?

123
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,600
Ting,

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
my little girl

125
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,600
was spoiled when she was a child.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,920
But today,

127
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,200
it's for the first time

128
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,720
that I've seen her working so hard.

129
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,600
As her father,

130
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,559
I am relieved.

131
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,920
But from the deep of my heart,

132
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,320
I get to feel some sort of bitterness.

133
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,880
Jiang,

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,399
I still envy you.

135
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,480
You have such a considerate daughter,

136
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,200
unlike my son.

137
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,559
People say that raising children is
for our old time.

138
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,640
But no matter how filial a son is,

139
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,839
he will not be as careful as a daughter.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,959
Uncle Lei,

141
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,200
Yuzheng has to be

142
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:01,040
busy with such a big company.

143
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,279
He must be tired.

144
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
That's not a big deal.

145
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,160
But don't worry.

146
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,320
Now, I'm also in Yutian.

147
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,600
I will try to help him.

148
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,119
Then, I really want to

149
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,279
thank you sincerely.

150
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,920
Miss Jiang is very considerate.

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,760
At this distance,

152
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
you still send good stuff to our home.

153
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,480
Since you are really caring,

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
everyone praises you.

155
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,959
Yuzheng,

156
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,200
why are you walking so silently?

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
Uncle Lei, look at him.

158
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
He calls me Miss Jiang even at home.

159
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,720
He seems like a stranger.

160
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,399
Like a stranger.

161
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,640
Okay.

162
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,399
He's back.

163
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,279
We'll leave it.

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,359
Let's have dinner.

165
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,079
Let's go, daughter.

166
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,279
Hello, I'm here to pay.

167
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,279
Your medical and hospital bills
have been settled.

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Settled?

169
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,200
The fee was paid this morning.

170
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,119
Thank you!

171
00:08:11,296 --> 00:08:12,608
(Lei Yuzheng)

172
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:17,959
Xiaosu.

173
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
How are you? Are you okay?
I'm scared to death.

174
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
Take it.

175
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,920
I'm OK.

176
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,920
What are you two doing here?

177
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,119
Mr. Lei asked me to pick you up.

178
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,839
Xiaosu,

179
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,959
how dare you?

180
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,799
That's a group of bullies
and you dare to pounce on them.

181
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,599
You're really impulsive.

182
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,799
He Qunfei said that

183
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,760
you fought the bully
at the construction site.

184
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,799
I thought you gave up
your life heroically.

185
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,719
I've heard that

186
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,799
Lei Yuzheng sent you to the hospital.

187
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,119
And he accompanied you all night.

188
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,239
He also left me a note,

189
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,359
and allowed me to
go back to work in Boyuan.

190
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,479
Really?

191
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
You know what?

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,039
This is the realistic version of

193
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,159
the domineering president falling
in love with a clerk.

194
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:03,359
What are you talking about?

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,880
However,

196
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:09,200
he did help me pay
all the medical bills.

197
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,679
What's the sign of Mr. Lei,

198
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,000
Virgo or Gemini?

199
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,119
He was as cold as ice
one second ago.

200
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,719
And one second later,

201
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,280
he is kind-hearted,

202
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,799
and rescues the female employee
without leaving the name!

203
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,880
This change of style is really fast.

204
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,320
To be honest,

205
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,919
Mr. Lei is a nice person in fact.

206
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,039
He is not good at expressing himself.

207
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:32,159
I'm telling you,

208
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,239
this is a typical

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,960
routine of rich people.

210
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,799
How to describe that?

211
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,200
Pretending to be deep and
making people wonder.

212
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,039
Right?

213
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,719
I'll tell you that

214
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,200
this character of Mr. Lei

215
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,039
actually has a lot to do with
his family upbringing.

216
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,919
I heard that

217
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,880
his mother left him
when he was very young.

218
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:49,239
So, I reckon it's

219
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,719
maybe the reason why

220
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,280
he seems a little lonely.

221
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:58,239
Fanlv,

222
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,719
eat more vegetables.

223
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,080
Look at you. You are too thin.

224
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,159
Uncle Lei,

225
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,960
if I become fat,

226
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,479
no one will marry me.

227
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:10,640
That's just right.

228
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,520
You can be my daughter-in-law.

229
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,000
Dad,

230
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,559
what did you say?

231
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,320
Look at Fanlv.

232
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,919
She is both pretty

233
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,359
and talented.

234
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:24,359
She casually said she can't get married.

235
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,599
You've got it right here.

236
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,919
You don't have confidence in Fanlv?

237
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,719
Ting, listen.

238
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,520
These kids

239
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,200
have their ideas.

240
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,719
We don't need to be in such a hurry.

241
00:10:36,239 --> 00:10:37,080
Useless.

242
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,799
But we can't let them do
whatever they want.

243
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,760
Fanlv is a good girl.

244
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
You are not worried.

245
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
Look at my son.

246
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,440
I'm really afraid that he will be
worse off than me.

247
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,960
Be a bachelor for life
when getting old.

248
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:57,200
Yuzheng has big ambitions
for his career.

249
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,679
It's because that

250
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,559
you set an example.

251
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,760
Speaking of Yutian,

252
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,239
I heard Lin say that,

253
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,000
at a demolition site of
the Entertainment Center,

254
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,679
some workers are causing troubles.

255
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
There seems to be a lot of things.

256
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,719
There is such a thing?

257
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:15,359
How come I didn't hear you say that?

258
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,400
Uncle Jiang,

259
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:18,200
you really have multiple sources

260
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,200
from different aspects.

261
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,280
Much better informed than my dad.

262
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
I am ashamed of myself.

263
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,760
Dad,

264
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,080
there is such a thing.

265
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,239
But all of them have been solved.

266
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,599
You are assured.

267
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,719
Dad,

268
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,359
Yuzheng got home so late.

269
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,239
Just leave all the things
at the company.

270
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,719
Can you let him have a good meal?

271
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,960
Look at this girl!

272
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,719
There's not much yet.

273
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,919
She then helps Yuzheng
teach his father a lesson.

274
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,440
Ungrateful！

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Jiang,

276
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,000
you have taught your daughter well.

277
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,799
Look at my son.

278
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,159
So impolite.

279
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,280
You need to bear more about him.

280
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,640
Yuzheng,

281
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,200
about the company,

282
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,880
don't put too much pressure on yourself.

283
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm here!

284
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,520
I'll help you.

285
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,200
Thank you, Fanlv.

286
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,239
I beg you.

287
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:35,320
You just left the hospital.

288
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
Could you please have a rest?

289
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,080
You've been counting all afternoon.

290
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,520
My head is about to explode.

291
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,799
I'm still livestreaming here.

292
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,218
(Drive all the way
New order notification please check)

293
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,080
Here comes my fortune.

294
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,919
I'm going out now.

295
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,719
Then don't wait for me to
come back for dinner.

296
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,640
I'll be back later.

297
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,200
Bye.

298
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you.

299
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,400
Girl, the money has been paid.

300
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,159
OK. Your key.

301
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:41,919
Thanks.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,320
Okay.

303
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,080
Bye-bye.

304
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:44,960
Bye-bye.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,640
Mr. Lei,

306
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,760
this is the medical bill
you paid for me last time.

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
One thousand seven hundred in total.

308
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Please take it.

309
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
What's wrong?

310
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:27,039
Is that not enough for you?

311
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,640
Xiaosu,

312
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,159
you'd better take the money.

313
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
You work so hard for the company.

314
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,559
Medical expenses should be
borne by the company.

315
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,640
You don't have to be so serious.

316
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,440
How's your recovery going?

317
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,119
Thank you for your concern.

318
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,400
But for me,

319
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,400
sometimes I am really serious.

320
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:48,919
I am sure to give you the money.

321
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,679
Okay.

322
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,159
I can see it.

323
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,039
Miss Du doesn't want to owe me.

324
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,320
Right?

325
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,119
Then I have nothing more to say.

326
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
If there's nothing else,

327
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm going out.

328
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:10,640
Oh.

329
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,000
Thank you for letting me
go back to Boyuan.

330
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,039
Xiaosu is back.

331
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,400
Xiaosu is back.

332
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,520
Xiaosu is back.

333
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:30,799
I'm back again.

334
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,719
Xiaosu.

335
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,679
Xiaosu is back.

336
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
Xiaosu, you're finally back.

337
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,840
We've all heard about it.

338
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:37,479
We know what you did
at the demolition site.

339
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,880
Xiaosu, you're great!

340
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,159
Yes, it's great!

341
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,359
So cool!

342
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,119
Xiaosu,

343
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,880
welcome back!

344
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:46,880
Mr. Ning.

345
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,000
You'll not leave this time, will you?

346
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,640
I hope so.

347
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,359
Xiaosu, don't leave.

348
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,320
Don't leave us.

349
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,400
Let's go out for dinner tonight, okay?

350
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,520
It's my treat today.

351
00:15:58,679 --> 00:15:59,640
Du Xiaosu,

352
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,799
come to my office.

353
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,719
I'll go there first.

354
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,919
Nothing, you guys get busy first.

355
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,760
Okay.

356
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,039
You go first.

357
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,119
This doesn't feel like
the right atmosphere.

358
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:21,280
What does this mean?

359
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,599
Miss Jiang.

360
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,400
Come in.

361
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,799
Congratulations, you're back so soon!

362
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,280
I know that

363
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,000
yuzheng is taking care of you

364
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,200
for the sake of Zhenrong.

365
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,000
Since this is the case,

366
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,719
I have a new task for you.

367
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,159
What does Miss Jiang want?

368
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
This is the design
for core function areas

369
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:02,080
in Universal Entertainment Center.

370
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,400
Yuzheng and I are not
too satisfied with

371
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,280
the designs that these people submit.

372
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,479
I heard you have good ability.

373
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,439
Then,

374
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll give you three days.

375
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,719
You can make several designs.

376
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,119
And let me check out these designs.

377
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,239
Three days.

378
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,239
Several designs.

379
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
You majored in design.

380
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,599
I'm helping you to prove yourself.

381
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,280
We value talent at Boyuan.

382
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,839
Ok.

383
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,199
My Lazybones.

384
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,160
I can't believe you are working
overtime this weekend.

385
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,160
My Beautiful Boss

386
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,439
will have an afternoon tea
with her friend.

387
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,880
My colleagues are dating,

388
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,119
or staying with the kids.

389
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,560
This overtime heavy duty

390
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,880
can only be left to me to enjoy alone.

391
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,760
So poor... hard work...

392
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,760
Really comfortable.

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
You should be free today, right?

394
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Let's eat hot pot?

395
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,319
No.

396
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,959
He Qunfei wants to ask me
to go shopping in Reel.

397
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,800
He wants to give me a New Year's gift.

398
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,479
I have to go.

399
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,359
I think Qunfei is sincere to you.

400
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,359
Don't keep tantalizing him.

401
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,839
Which side are you on?

402
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,959
Why are you hitting so hard?

403
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Talking like my mother every day.

404
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,319
Marriage is the most important
event in a woman's life.

405
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,280
Do you know?

406
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:05,880
I can't be in a hurry.

407
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Go this way please.

408
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,760
How's it going? Are you happy?

409
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,400
Sit here.

410
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,119
Siqi.

411
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,199
You look great with this bag.

412
00:19:40,239 --> 00:19:41,400
It is more beautiful

413
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,000
than the models on the posters.

414
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,199
Really expensive.

415
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,719
But it really looks good.

416
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,079
Qunfei, tell me the truth.

417
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,079
Were you painful
when you swipe your card?

418
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,959
No.

419
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,000
As long as you are happy,

420
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,119
it is worth.

421
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,520
What do you want from me?

422
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:14,000
Siqi,

423
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,719
see.

424
00:20:16,239 --> 00:20:17,839
This will soon be Chinese New Year.

425
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,680
Hang on.

426
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,000
I know you buy me a bag for some reason.

427
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,280
Waiting for me here.

428
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,839
How many times have I told you

429
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,280
it's not appropriate for us
to meet our parents yet.

430
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,920
I'm not going home with you
for Chinese New Year.

431
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,520
But that's what you said last year.

432
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
It's been a year.

433
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,479
We both have to
take a step forward, right?

434
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,560
Two days ago, my mom called,

435
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,079
saying she'd like to meet you.

436
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,680
We've been in a relationship
for so long.

437
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,040
So why can't we
meet our parents?

438
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Why is it necessary?

439
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,839
After meeting your parents,

440
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,119
we have to meet your aunts and uncles.

441
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,199
They will ask endlessly

442
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,119
when to get married?
when to have children?

443
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,599
That is annoying.

444
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,920
I promise you

445
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,520
all you need to do is
coming home with me.

446
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Don't worry about the rest.

447
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,800
I'll handle it.

448
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,439
You think I'm a little girl?

449
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,079
Easy to tell a lie?

450
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:11,160
After meeting your mother,

451
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:12,959
we must still be rushed to get married.

452
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,760
But is it wrong for my mom
to be anxious?

453
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,800
We are not young.

454
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Then marriage is a matter of time.

455
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,479
Marriage? What marriage?

456
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,599
I'm not going home with you anyway.

457
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,000
It's useless even if you buy me a bag.

458
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,800
I heard you have good ability.

459
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,920
So,

460
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,000
you have three days.

461
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,479
You can give me a few options
to choose from.

462
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,719
Xiaosu,

463
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:51,920
I want to take you somewhere.

464
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,359
A beautiful island.

465
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,160
There is an elementary school
on the island.

466
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,000
Teacher Sun is there.

467
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,199
And the cute kids.

468
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,599
This is what you said before.

469
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,199
The children you sponsor.

470
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,199
Let me introduce you.

471
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,880
Look at this.

472
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,839
This one is called Xiao Mei.

473
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,239
This is Teacher Sun and Doudou.

474
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,839
This one is called Shanwa.

475
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,439
Teacher Sun is so young and handsome.

476
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
But why Shanwa is so black?

477
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,280
He runs every day on the mountains.

478
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:33,479
No one can even catch him.

479
00:24:59,253 --> 00:25:00,460
(Driver Service)

480
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,599
Miss Du.

481
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,079
Selling wine again?

482
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,439
Good cost control.

483
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
Transportation costs are saved.

484
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,520
Mr. Lei, don't bother me.

485
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,800
I have business to attend to.

486
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,520
Hello, I am...

487
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,199
Mr. Lei.

488
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:18,959
You are the one
who called the chauffeur.

489
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,800
What's the matter?

490
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,760
Shall I show you the order number?

491
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:25,839
No.

492
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,199
Then I'll call a new order for you.

493
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
I can't take this.

494
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,280
Why?

495
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,000
We know each other.

496
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,839
It should be good.

497
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:40,119
You are assured but I am not assured.

498
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,680
How?

499
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,680
Miss Du, are you afraid that
I will hurt you?

500
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,079
Are you okay?

501
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,239
Why are you holding me?

502
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
You're the one holding me, okay?

503
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm telling you, show some respect.

504
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,719
Chauffeurs do not offer this service.

505
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,439
Or

506
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,640
you walk to the car by yourself.

507
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,079
Du Xiaosu.

508
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:23,800
Why are you so noisy all the time?

509
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:26,560
Can't be quiet for a while?

510
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,880
Chauffeurs like you

511
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,280
often meet the drunk persons like me

512
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
who don't let go the hold?

513
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,359
Get on the car.

514
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,239
What are you doing?

515
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:04,280
Go.

516
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:12,800
What are you looking for?

517
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,640
This car does not have a keyhole.

518
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Start.

519
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,119
Foot on brake.

520
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,280
Look there. Tap on it.

521
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,040
Are you a chauffeur?

522
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,079
Hey, I said you.

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Hang up the gear.

524
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,119
Shut up.

525
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,640
I said Driver Du.

526
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,640
Are you driving a senior mobility
scooter here?

527
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
At your speed,

528
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:08,119
I won't even get home
tomorrow morning.

529
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,199
Cut the crap.

530
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
You asked me to drive.

531
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
If you don't like it,
you can return the order.

532
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,640
How bad is that?

533
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,760
It seems I am mean,
don't you think?

534
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,160
There are not many pretty

535
00:29:21,719 --> 00:29:25,319
female drivers like you, right?

536
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,280
What if you run into a pervert?

537
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Before you take the job,

538
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,560
is there any training on
preventing perverts given to you?

539
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,839
At this low speed,

540
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,479
I can't get home for a while.

541
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,760
We are free now.

542
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,199
How about chatting?

543
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,599
It's dangerous enough to run into you.

544
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,040
Good! Driver Du.

545
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,800
You're in the gutter!

546
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,239
Good job.

547
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
Sorry.

548
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
I didn't mean to.

549
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,040
Your car is too tall.

550
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,800
I didn't even see

551
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,359
there's a curb,

552
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,160
nor

553
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,239
a flower bed in front of us.

554
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:35,199
I have to stretch my neck out to see.

555
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,920
Stretch one more for me.

556
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,119
Don't make excuses.

557
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,920
Call the police. Get a tow truck.

558
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:46,319
If you hadn't just talked to me,

559
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,479
and distracted me,

560
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,439
I...

561
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,319
I…

562
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,359
I'm calling the police
for a tow truck first.

563
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,280
Don't talk to me.

564
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,079
Yes, yes, on Qingshi Road.

565
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:03,880
Then there is

566
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,079
a bank building.

567
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:10,040
Okay.

568
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,199
Thanks.

569
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,079
The tow truck

570
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,199
will arrive in thirty minutes.

571
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,520
Delay your schedule.

572
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,199
Really.

573
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,400
I am so sorry.

574
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,959
Why are you saying that?

575
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,439
Are you going to cry?

576
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,959
What are you crying about?

577
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:43,000
No, I am not.

578
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
I am not crying.

579
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,280
How could you cry suddenly?

580
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,680
Really?

581
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,800
I am just...

582
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,880
just want to earn more money
as a designated driver.

583
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:59,479
Now the car is hit.

584
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,520
Wait.

585
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,479
I didn't say anything.

586
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,000
You broke my car.

587
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm not complaining.

588
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,439
On the other hand.

589
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,079
I didn't ask you to pay for it.

590
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,239
I can't afford to pay if you ask me to.

591
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:16,119
You say that your rich people.

592
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,079
Why do you drive such an expensive car?

593
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,880
If I had known this,
I should have returned the order.

594
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,760
Okay, fine.

595
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,239
Stop yelling.

596
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,359
If you keep yelling like that,

597
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,760
the police will be called by you.

598
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,760
Wait for the tow truck.

599
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,520
Wait for a second.

600
00:32:39,439 --> 00:32:40,719
You hit me car.

601
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:45,319
You drive my Lincoln like a classic car.

602
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,520
You hit the flower bed.

603
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,719
I didn't ask you to compensate.

604
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,479
Now you're here for crying out loud,

605
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
and I am here to comfort you.

606
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:54,959
Why?

607
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:57,479
I should be the one crying.

608
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:01,599
Anyway,

609
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,199
I cannot afford that.

610
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:04,359
It's up to you.

611
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:10,520
Why am I so unlucky?

612
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,959
Originally, I wanted to drive a car
to earn money.

613
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,079
But I met you by chance.

614
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,040
Fine.

615
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,479
Stop now.

616
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,239
All you think is earning money.

617
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,040
Is that for that house?

618
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,119
You are so stubborn.

619
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,880
That's the only thing he left me.

620
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,359
I have to get it back.

621
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,479
Did you call the tow truck?

622
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,959
-This way.
-Yes, it's me.

623
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:02,019
(Jiang Fanlv)

624
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:07,839
Mr. Lei.

625
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,280
Last year's financial report
is here.

626
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,239
Please check it out.

627
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,520
Although the net profit

628
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,520
increased by twenty percent
over the previous year,

629
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,959
the assets and liabilities were
already up to 75 percent.

630
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,600
Already close to the red line of the
real estate company.

631
00:34:23,439 --> 00:34:24,600
What departments are handlers

632
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,879
of these debts in?

633
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,199
Well.

634
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,560
This is mainly what your father was
responsible for at that time.

635
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,360
Excuse me.

636
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,120
Mr. Lin.

637
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,399
Yes, I'm with Mr. Lei.

638
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,600
Tonight?

639
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,560
Wait for a moment.

640
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,199
I'll confirm the time with Mr. Lei.

641
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:58,320
Mr. Lin said he had a friend

642
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,399
who introduced several domestic

643
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:01,000
well established investment fund.

644
00:35:01,479 --> 00:35:03,560
They are very interested in our
Entertainment Center project.

645
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,520
Do you want to meet them

646
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,439
tonight?

647
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:07,679
When?

648
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:09,439
Wing Kee Restaurant 7:30 p.m.

649
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,840
OK.

650
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,120
Miss Jiang,

651
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,159
the dinner tonight is quite important.

652
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,239
You see.

653
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,159
I wear it like this.

654
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,760
It seems not quite right.

655
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,159
Or...

656
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,399
The dinner tonight

657
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,600
is about Boyuan's advertising
revenue for one year.

658
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I brought you here just to support.

659
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,760
You don't need to say anything more.

660
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:49,840
I am here.

661
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,919
Mr. Wei.

662
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,000
I have to introduce to you in a big way.

663
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,600
The one next to me is our talented
girl from Boyuan.

664
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,560
Du Xiaosu.

665
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:12,159
She is also a popular figure.

666
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,439
Miss Jiang, you're exaggerating.

667
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:20,320
Xiaosu.

668
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:23,320
Mr. Wei is a big player
in our media group.

669
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,479
On Huaihai Road,

670
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,879
half of the billboard space
belongs to him.

671
00:36:26,959 --> 00:36:28,360
Mr. Wei usually has a low profile.

672
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,320
He never attends a dinner party
without some big issue.

673
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,199
He greatly values us today.

674
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,600
Xiaosu, remember to treat him well.

675
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,159
Miss Jiang, you have wronged me.

676
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,639
Today let us have a drink, shall we?

677
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,320
Let's also drink for past together.

678
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,080
Mr. Wei,

679
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,959
for you.

680
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,760
I've seen a lot of beauties.

681
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,120
But the talented woman is not common.

682
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,280
Miss Du is beautiful and talented.

683
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,399
I willingly drink it.

684
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:21,719
Great!

685
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,439
Miss Du cannot have the bias.

686
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,439
Only propose a toast
to Mr. Wei, not to us.

687
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:26,879
We're all waiting in line.

688
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:28,399
Exactly.

689
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,399
We are here, Miss Du.

690
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,399
You shall also propose a toast to me.

691
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,679
As you like.

692
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,879
It's my turn for the third cup!

693
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,199
Cool.

694
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,520
Ms Du is a good drinker.

695
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,479
Yes.

696
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,399
Exactly.

697
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,919
Here.

698
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,439
Miss Du, I'll propose a toast
to you too.

699
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,840
Mr. Lei, you are here!

700
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,320
Why is Mr. Lin out too?

701
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,639
It seems we are all out
to avoid drinking.

702
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,600
Isn't this my classmate Du Xiaosu?

703
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,040
Long time no see.

704
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,320
Then I'll go back to my client.

705
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,879
Talk to you next time.

706
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,399
Goodbye Xiaosu.

707
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,679
What is it?

708
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:47,239
Miss Du and Mr. Lin know each other?

709
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,639
Yes.

710
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,280
We've known each other for a long time.

711
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,760
Miss Du is my schoolmate in college.

712
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,399
We haven't had much contact
since graduation.

713
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:03,399
I didn't expect that

714
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,800
we can meet in this place.

715
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,199
Miss Du is working in Boyuan.

716
00:40:08,879 --> 00:40:11,679
Xinsheng is now cooperating with Yutian.

717
00:40:12,439 --> 00:40:14,959
Small world.

718
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:16,760
