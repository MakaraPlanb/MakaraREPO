00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Xiaosu,

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,800
I personally

18
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,880
admit your working ability,

19
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,520
but it's really inappropriate for me

20
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,119
to interfere with personnel transfer.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,279
Mr. Ning, sorry for the inconvenience.

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,440
But I need money for urgent use.

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,919
These 30 days mean a lot to me.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,399
I'm willing to work in any position

25
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,600
only if you can put me in one,

26
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,119
only if I can make money.

27
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,880
There's indeed one position open.

28
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,600
Then, please let me do it.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,639
It is supervising the construction site

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,440
of the Entertainment Center.

31
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,160
Think it over.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,199
Working on construction site means

33
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,880
working in all weathers
from dawn to dusk,

34
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:58,520
together with the workers.

35
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:01,360
Can you manage that as a girl?

36
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,600
Yes, I can. Don't worry.

37
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,320
And this job pays quickly,

38
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,320
which is exactly what I'm looking for.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,559
Mr. Lei,

40
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,240
would you like to visit the sales office

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
where you can see the whole view

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,199
through sand table?

43
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,559
Yes.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Please.

45
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,080
OK.

46
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,800
Mr. Lei,
that girl just showed up a moment ago.

47
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,279
This time she didn't insist to come in

48
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,160
and just stood there
staring at the building.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,119
So I didn't send her away.

50
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,240
Manager Li,

51
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,679
take Mr. Li and Mr. Wang

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,080
to take a look at the sand table.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,880
I will be there later.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:08,720
OK.

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,039
Mr. Li, Mr. Wang, this way please.

56
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,800
Excuse me.

57
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,839
See you later.

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,640
Miss Du,

59
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
what a nice mood you have.

60
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,959
You even have time to stand here
looking at the view.

61
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,119
I'm curious how things are going

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
with gathering money for the house.

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,640
Mr. Lei, it has been only 2 days.

64
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,600
Don't tell me that you are going to
go back on your word.

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,559
Why would I?

66
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,359
As long as you are not
giving up in the middle.

67
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,040
Miss Du, once the time limit is up,

68
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,480
and you have all the money,

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,119
I would for sure hand over the house.

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,640
Of course,

71
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,480
if you cannot last any longer,

72
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,600
I'd love to accept your defeat.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,799
Watching me suffer

74
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,760
must be very relieved for you.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,920
Actually, it feels good
to have one more person hating me.

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,959
Being hated means that

77
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,000
someone still cares
about your existence.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,359
Then remember this hatred.

79
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:28,959
At least,

80
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
it can make you live more easily.

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
Don't worry.

82
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
It doesn't matter how hard it is,

83
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,119
for this gambling,

84
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,239
I will stay until the end

85
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,760
and never give up.

86
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,040
Please wait for my good news.

87
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,519
Recruitment.

88
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,519
Miss Du.

89
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,559
Don't force yourself.

90
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,679
Don't wear yourself out.

91
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Siqi,

92
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,519
do you have any part-time job

93
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,799
that you can introduce me to?

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,359
It won't help
even if I introduce you to 10 jobs.

95
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,559
How could you gather millions of yuan

96
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,119
within such short time?

97
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,880
I'm telling you that

98
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,959
you can fight against Lei Yuzheng
as you wish.

99
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,640
But you cannot fight against god
or your life.

100
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,119
But I don't have any other choice.

101
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,559
One of my friends operates a bar
at the Bund.

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,839
I heard that it's doing really good
and the payment is good too.

103
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,679
I will ask for you.

104
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,399
Thanks.

105
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:10,839
Thanks.

106
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,119
Hi, I'm a friend of Zou Siqi.

107
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,000
She should have told you about me,
right?

108
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,200
Yes.

109
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,359
Here's my resume.

110
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,079
We don't look at resume here.

111
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
You only need to

112
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,399
answer one question.

113
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,239
Can you drink a lot?

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,600
You are such a direct person.

115
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,079
Although I cannot drink,

116
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,519
I can sell.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,200
When I was in college,

118
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,079
I sold phones in a hypermarket

119
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:44,239
and used to rank 1st place every month.

120
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,279
I was just wondering

121
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,359
if one can earn a lot
by selling alcohol.

122
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,880
Yes, if you work really hard.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,959
How about this?

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,320
You come here tonight and give it a try.

125
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,160
All right,
I will be here on time for sure.

126
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:05,679
Thank you.

127
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Here, dad.

128
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,640
See, there's no place better than home.

129
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,679
The inpatient ward is big enough,

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,799
but the sanitizer smell makes me

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,519
lose all my appetite.

132
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,040
Here, dad. Try this fish.

133
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,880
The doctor said that
fish can help with recovering the brain.

134
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Yuzheng,

135
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:37,679
after I got sick, I realized that

136
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,599
it's useless to pretend to be strong.

137
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,640
After working so hard for decades,

138
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,239
it's time when I should accept my fate.

139
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,640
It's good to see you
making progress so fast.

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,039
I feel relieved

141
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,599
trusting Yutian to you.

142
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Dad,
Yutian is what you've built for life.

143
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,119
I'm only taking care of it for you.

144
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,400
Everyone is waiting for you to go back

145
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,359
after you feel better.

146
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,280
You don't have to comfort me.

147
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,479
I know that

148
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:16,080
Yutian is doing well

149
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:18,479
under your management.

150
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,799
And the Entertainment Center project

151
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,799
is going to have its
foundation-stone laying ceremony soon.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,960
Those stakeholders don't say it aloud,

153
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,320
but I can tell that

154
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,880
they admire you sincerely.

155
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,880
Mr. Lei.

156
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Same as always, two glasses of Brandy.

157
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,239
OK.

158
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,960
Bad guy, since when did you go to a bar?

159
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,359
A doctor

160
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,359
also needs relaxation sometimes.

161
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,960
Their Whiskey tastes really good.

162
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,239
Try it.

163
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,280
Just tell me what it is.

164
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,000
Why does there have to be something
for us to have a drink?

165
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,880
I know you too well.

166
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,479
That's why I take you as my brother.

167
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,479
Let's cheer first.

168
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,359
Let me take it.

169
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,919
Mr. Shangguan,

170
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,400
how about this?

171
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,280
I will take 3 more glasses

172
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,520
and you buy three more bottles.

173
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:21,280
Miss Du,

174
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,559
how about you finish this bottle and

175
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,960
I will buy all the alcohol.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,880
All.

177
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,840
You drank too much.

178
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:38,919
Brother Lei.

179
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:43,719
Who are you?

180
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,159
I don't know you.

181
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
Move.

182
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
Shangguan,

183
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,719
you can't fool me.

184
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,640
You never planned to buy the alcohol.

185
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,119
Well, well.

186
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,159
What are you doing?

187
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,640
I haven't finished my drink.

188
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,679
Leaving now.

189
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,440
I haven't finished my drink.

190
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
Put me down.

191
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,599
Lei Yuzheng, put me down.

192
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,479
Why would you bother with me?

193
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,960
Because you owe me.

194
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,599
I owe you?

195
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,919
I have nothing left now.

196
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:19,520
I owe you?

197
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,799
Put me down.

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,119
Are you crazy?

199
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes, I am crazy.

200
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
I have been crazy for a long time.

201
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,640
Did you just realize that I'm crazy?

202
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,880
I,

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,200
I don't have a lover

204
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,119
or a job,

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
not even the house anymore.

206
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm a crazy person with nothing left.

207
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,880
Why would you bother?

208
00:13:01,359 --> 00:13:04,080
Why would you bother?

209
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,400
You should've left me alone.

210
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:10,200
I'm just a lonely soul,

211
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,640
who can die anywhere.

212
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,919
No one should bother with me.

213
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,119
Let me go.

214
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,039
You think that I want to bother?

215
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:25,960
If it's not for Shao,

for him,

217
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:32,640
I would not care
whether you die or live.

218

Du Xiaosu,

219
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,440
who do you want to show it to
by acting like this?

220
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,359
Do you think that I would give you

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,640
the key to the house

222
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,280
if you drink to death today?

223
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,080
Of course not,

224
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
because you hate me,

225
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,679
and you are dying to see me
losing the deal.

226
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,679
Do you think that I don't feel any pain?

227
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:09,640
He's gone,

228
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,799

Where do you live?

296
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,079
What?

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,839

298
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,680
Why?

299
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,560
Did I say it right?

300
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,599

313
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,280

I

325
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,280
harass you?

326

to my apartment.

335
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,119
Size?

336
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,439
How do I know the size?

337
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,319
Mr. Lei,
here's the clothes you asked for.

338
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,319
Thanks.

339
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,079

341
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,400

from here.

342
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
It's so cool.

343
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,400

344
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,959
have such luck

345
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,079
to sleep here?

346
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,239
Miss Du,

347
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:06,920
are you planning to leave
without saying anything?

348
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:16,640
Mr. Lei,

349
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm sorry.

350
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,439
I should go back now.

351
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:22,319
Oh,

352
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,319

another day.

353
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,359

354
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,719
OK.

355
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,280
But you might not be able to get a taxi
now.

356
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,520
I'll take bus.

357
00:26:38,239 --> 00:26:40,319
The earliest bus would arrive
in an hour.

358
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,560
If you still want to leave,

359
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:43,760
please go ahead.

360
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,000
Eat something first.

361
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,199
What?

362
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,520
You dare not?

363
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,680
Don't worry, no poison.

364
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,959
Last night, Miss Du

365
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,000
told me many things

366
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,560
from your heart.

367
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,319
Mr. Lei, it was an accident.

368
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,479
If I said anything weird,

369
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,000
I apologize.

370
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,079
Talking about weird stuff
is not a big deal,

371
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,160
but acting recklessly is.

372
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,479
You were lucky to meet me.

373
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:45,079
If it was someone else,

374
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,319
you might have been robbed or harassed.

375
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,560
Mr. Lei, I'm not a three-year-old girl.

376
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,760
Who are you trying to scare
by saying that?

377
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,959
I really appreciate that

378
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,359
you saved me in the bar,

379
00:27:58,239 --> 00:28:00,079
but you shouldn't scold me

380
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,920
just because you did something right.

381
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,199
Besides,

382
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,000
I didn't ask you to do that.

383
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,400
You should've just left me alone.

384
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,920
You think that I wanted to bother?

385
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,119
I'm done.

386
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:29,680
Xiaosu,

387
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,439
here is your reward.

388
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,479
Take it.

389
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,520
This much?

390
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,680
Too much for you?

391
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,920
Then I will switch to
a smaller package for you.

392
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,719
Never too much.

393
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,599
Thank you, boss.

394
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,479
You're welcome.

395
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,880
You were such a topic last night.

396
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,119
The sales last night

397
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,160
was more than what we sold in a week.

398
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Keep going and we will pay you well.

399
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:05,359
OK.

400
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,040
Thank you, boss.

401
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,520
Young lady, it is you.

402
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,160
You haven't been here for a while.

403
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,880
Why are you here so early today?

404
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,004
(Wishing wall)

405
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:52,128
(Du Xiaosu is piggy Du)

406
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,520
Why are you giving me this pig?

407
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
Because you are piggy Du.

408
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,599
But don't worry,

409
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,400
even if you really become a pig one day,

410
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,280
I will not leave you.

411
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:07,359
You are more like a pig.

412
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,680
Who did you say is pig?

413
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,719
Mr. Lei.

414
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,040
OK, thank you, Mr. Lei.

415
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,160
Anything else?

416
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,280
Mr. Lei,

417
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,719
I heard that

418
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,920
the Entertainment Center project
is going to kick off soon, right?

419
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,479
You are well informed.

420
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,239
Why?

421
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,719
It seems that Mr. Lin doesn't trust us.

422
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,680
No,

423
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,439
Mr. Lei, that's not what I mean.

424
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:04,880
The Entertainment Center

425
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,119
is just a small project for Yutian.

426
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,400
Mr. Jiang and I

427
00:32:07,719 --> 00:32:09,160
feel very assured.

428
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:10,719
I was just wondering,

429
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,280
since it's quite a big news
to start construction,

430
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,199
why don't we make some noise?

431
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,119
You and Mr. Jiang?

432
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,839
Mr. Lin,

433
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,560
shouldn't the ranking be re-ordered?

434
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,560
It's none of my business,

435
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:28,560
but I would love to know,

436
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:29,959
Mr. Lin,

437
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,520
what kind of noise do you want to make.

438
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:34,079
Mr. Lei, you got me wrong.

439
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,239
It was a slip of the tongue.

440
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,560
I just want to know about the noise.

441
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,000
Tell me about it.

442
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,959
I'm thinking that

443
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,359
we can have an opening ceremony

444
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,599
where we invite all the social elites

445
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,000
as well as media.

446
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,160
As soon as the news release comes out,

447
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,239
everyone would know that,

448
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:51,000
you, Mr. Lei,
have made a great achievement

449
00:32:51,239 --> 00:32:52,319
for Yutian,

450
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,479
so that the stock price of Yutian

451
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,000
may keep increasing.

452
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,319
Why didn't I figure that out earlier.

453
00:32:58,439 --> 00:33:00,640
Mr. Lin, you are such a talent.

454
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,599
I'm flattered.

455
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,400
Then I want to ask,

456
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,640
Mr. Lin,

457
00:33:06,199 --> 00:33:08,560
is this idea actually helping me

458
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:10,319
or ruining me?

459
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,199
Brother Xie,

460
00:33:20,719 --> 00:33:22,640
Lei Yuzheng really doesn't buy it.

461
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,079
Why?

462
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,439
I said a lot to convince him,

463
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,719
but the opening ceremony wouldn't work.

464
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,119
He rejected it

465
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:31,599
and blamed me.

466
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,920
I've told you

467
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:38,479
that Lei Yuzheng is very low key.

468
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,160
I've found the people,

469
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,479
and you can just sit and wait.

470
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,119
Be careful, Xie.

471
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Don't make troubles for me.

472
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640
Right there.

473
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,920
Let's stop here, stop, stop.

474
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:53,880
Stop working,

475
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,199
unless you want to be a cripple.

476
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Supervisor Du, something happened.

477
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,560
Engineer Wang,

478
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,160
a bunch of people coming from nowhere

479
00:34:00,199 --> 00:34:00,839
wouldn't let us work

480
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,680
and said they would break the arms
of anyone who dares to work.

481
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,560
What shall we do?

482
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,199
Leave your work for now and follow me.

483
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,079
Quickly.

484
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,360
Let's get armed. Let's go.

485
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,679
Quickly, run!

486
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:14,479
But I would love to know,

487
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,280
what kind of noise do you want to make.

488
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,080
I think that we can

489
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,120
have an opening ceremony

490
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:19,879
where we invite all the social elites

491
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:20,879
as well as media.

492
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,280
When the news release comes out,

493
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,879
everyone will know that you, Mr. Lei,

494
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,280
have made great achievement for Yutian.

495
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,280
Qunfei, turn around
and head to the construction site.

496
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
What happened? Calm down.

497
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,120
Why would you ask me that?

498
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,800
What did you do?

499
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,760
Calm down.

500
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,800
I'm the supervisor here.

501
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:43,879
You can tell me

502
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,120
if anything happened.

503
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,840
Yutian has broken down our factory.

504
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,360
You think that by leaving us some money

505
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,159
this can all be settled?

506
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,639
This is ruining our way
to make a living.

507
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,360
How are we going to make money?

508
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,080
Right.
It has cut off our way to make money.

509
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,199
How are we going to make money?

510
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Everyone, calm down.

511
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:02,159
The contract was signed with Xinsheng,

512
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:04,199
and the price was decided by Xinsheng.

513
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,040
It has nothing to do with Yutian.

514
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,879
You should go ask Xinsheng

515
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:08,919
instead of Yutian.

516
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:13,520
How is there nothing to do with Yutian?

517
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,639
Now we can't make money,

518
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,239
then there's something to do with you.

519
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:20,639
We don't care
who you signed the contract with.

520
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,399
Whoever takes apart the building
is who we are looking for.

521
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,479
We need to live, right?

522
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,320
Right, we need to live.

523
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,399
We want our money.

524
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,439
What's wrong with that?

525
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,000
We want the money that belongs to us.

526
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,000
That is nonsense.

527
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:31,959
Who's talking nonsense?

528
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,800
You or I?

529
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,360
There are many of them.
Don't irritate them.

530
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:37,439
Then we will go to Yutian

531
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,840
and ask their boss for money.

532
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:41,080
If you cannot take the responsibility,
there will be someone who can.

533
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,520
We need to live. We need money.

534
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,600
No, you can't go to the company.

535
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:46,120
How can you go to the company?

536
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:48,560
Calm down, calm down.

537
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:51,439
You can't go to the company,
please don't.

538
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,199
It won't change anything. Everyone,

539
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,479
calm down, calm down, calm down.

540
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,639
You, yes, it's you.

541
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,439
Why would you incite everyone
to make trouble?

542
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,959
How am I making trouble?

543
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,399
This is big deal for us.

544
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,360
Let me go.

545
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,080
Let me go, let me go.

546
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,080
No.

547
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,520
I can't let you go to the company.

548
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,360
Although you are a girl,

549
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,439
I may also hit you.

550
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,239
Let me go.

551
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,199
I can't let you go there.

552
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,120
You.

553
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,399
It hurts.

554
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,600
Who are you?

555
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,199
Let me go.

556
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,040
Trust me,

557
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,439
I can destroy you now.

558
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,879
It hurts.

559
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,120
It hurts.

560
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,280
How dare you

561
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:34,919
to be a gangster.

562
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,879
Who asked you here?

563
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,399
If you have the power,
don't bully a girl.

564
00:36:43,439 --> 00:36:45,320
Try me.

565
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,199
Who are you?

566
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,760
Where did you come from?

567
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,239
It's none of your business.

568
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,639
President of Yutian,

569
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,040
Lei Yuzheng.

570
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,080
This guy is trying to fool us.

571
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,239
Who knows if he's actually the boss.

572
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,360
I have heard why

573
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,000
you came here to make trouble.

574
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,439
You think the relocation fee is too low.

575
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,360
I can understand how you feel,

576
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,399
but have ever you thought about

577
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:17,959
talking peacefully

578
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,560
about the relocation fee?

579
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,800
Gathering around against the law

580
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,280
and affecting the construction progresses

581
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,560
will cost you a lot.

582
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:28,600
Wait.

583
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:29,959
The construction progress

584
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,399
has nothing to do with us.

585
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,520
We can't even live now, can we?

586
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,199
We just want to live.

587
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,520
We want our money.

588
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,199
There's nothing wrong with it, right?

589
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,000
Yes.

590
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,199
We want our money.

591
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,120
What's wrong with it?

592
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,600
Give us money.

593
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,959
Give us money.

594
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,760
Why can't we?

595
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,639
You can't go.

596
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,360
We want our money.

597
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,159
What are you doing? Stop it.

598
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,320
Calm down. Let's calm down.

599
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,639
What are you doing?

600
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,439
No, no.

601
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,520
Let's talk about it.

602
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,719
What's there to talk about?

603
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,760
What are you doing?

604
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,879
Du Xiaosu.

605
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,280
Du Xiaosu.

606
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,159
Are you ok, Du Xiaosu?

607
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:06,639
You have made a big trouble.

608
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,120
No one shall leave. Surround them.

609
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,399
Surround them.

610
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,639
You cannot leave,

611
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:12,560
especially you.

612
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,080
She fell off by herself.

613
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:18,280
She fell off by herself.
It has nothing to do with me.

614
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,040
Surround all of them. No one can leave.

615
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,399
You are all my witness.

616
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,600
You can't leave.

617
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:25,080
She fell off herself.
It has nothing to do with me.

618
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,040
Sir,

619
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,879
faster please.

620
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,360
The patient fell off
due to long term fatigue

621
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,879
and severe malnutrition

622
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,360
which caused hypoglycemia and dizziness.

623
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,600
I have injected
nutrient solution for her.

624
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:59,800
Remember to rest well.
It's going to be fine.

625
00:39:00,959 --> 00:39:01,840
Thank you.

626
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,560
Zhenrong,

627
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,959
don't leave.

628
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:09,719
Zhenrong.
