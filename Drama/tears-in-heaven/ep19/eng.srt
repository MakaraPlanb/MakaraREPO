=Episode 19=

16
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,679
Everyone, look at this.

17
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,759
The data shows that

18
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,880
the Entertainment Center project
is doing well.

19
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,080
The investors also saw
how much progress we had made

20
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,160
and changed their attitude

21
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,960
towards this project.
They no longer feel worried.

22
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,080
Now, they have great confidence in us,

23
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
and are hopeful about this project.

24
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,479
It seems that now

25
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,160
we don't have any financial problems

26
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,279
for the Entertainment Center project
anymore.

27
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,440
Mr. Ye,

28
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,360
please have a look.

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,559
This is the meeting room.

30
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,479
This table has a unique design

31
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,880
in a pentagon shape.

32
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,000
Also, this light.

33
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:19,519
I personally really like this light.

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,920
Miss Du has good taste as expected.

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,119
Thanks.

36
00:04:24,239 --> 00:04:26,239
On the outside, I also used some

37
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,760
unique decorations on the lights

38
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,480
and chose some matching plants

39
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,559
to make the whole office cozy

40
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,480
and comfortable.

41
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:36,720
How do you like it?

42
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,320
It turns out that
Miss Du is really professional.

43
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
To be honest,

44
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,839
I didn't expect much from you.

45
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,119
It now appears that

46
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm very satisfied.

47
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,959
It is great working with you.

48
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,399
Thank you for your compliment.

49
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,720
To be honest,

50
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,119
if you didn't contact me
for this project,

51
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,040
I wouldn't have confidence

52
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,959
to keep doing this.

53
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,480
Aren't you curious about

54
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,119
how I found you?

55
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,760
Forget it!

56
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
If I tell you the truth,

57
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,920
someone is going to kill me.

58
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,679
All you have to know is that

59
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,959
someone is trying to help you.

60
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,399
Miss Du,

61
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,239
this person cares a lot about you.

62
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,600
Mr. Lei Yuzheng, I've earned money.

63
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,279
Let me treat you a meal.
How does that sound?

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,959
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

65
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,480
Why did you seem

66
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,640
to be distracted recently?

67
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,600
Did anything happen?

68
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,640
No, nothing.

69
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,640
This one,

70
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,640
this one,

71
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,880
and this one.

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,959
Ok, that's all.

73
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,600
How were you so quiet?

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,119
When did you come in?

75
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,399
Ok, that's all. Order is placed.

76
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:31,839
Wait, Du Xiaosu,

77
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,799
you have just placed the order without

78
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:34,760
asking what the guest wants?

79
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,519
What kind of treat is that?

80
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,399
It's my treat. I've told you.

81
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:40,799
So, you have to listen to me.

82
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,880
Is that how it works?

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,480
What are you doing?

84
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
Braised baby cabbage in broth,

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,480
boiled Chinese broccoli,

86
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,200
1 serving of small steamed buns,

87
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,040
and 2 servings of instant noodles
in chicken soup.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,440
You might as well

89
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,959
order two clay oven rolls for us.

90
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,799
Make some changes.

91
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,359
Crab meat bean curd,

92
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:02,600
salmon nori,

93
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,200
and sashimi set.

94
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,279
As for drinks...

95
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,040
Why did you step on me?

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,959
Who stepped on you?

97
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,359
Rich people like you

98
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,880
must have tried everything.

99
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,760
Why are you doing this to me?

100
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,079
Aren't you also rich now?

101
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
You need to admit that

102
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
the large-scale project
you recently worked on

103
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,160
must be very profitable.

104
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,480
Am I right?

105
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,799
What large-scale project?

106
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,399
You made that up. Ok?

107
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,119
If you are trying to
destroy my reputation,

108
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,040
I...

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,359
I will ask you for
mental damage compensation.

110
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:46,399
You won't be able to afford it.

111
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,559
I'm sorry, sir and madam.

112
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,119
Whom should I listen to?

113
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,320
-Me.
-Me.

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
Well,

115
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,000
just listen to him then.

116
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
Forget about the drinks.
Just place order for the rest.

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
Ok, sir.

118
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,760
Lei Yuzheng,

119
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,920
you think that you are nice to me,
right?

120
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,200
Actually,
I would order abalone and trepang.

121
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,600
Just consider yourself lucky.

122
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:18,160
Here, Du Xiaosu,

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,799
try a small steamed bun.

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,359
Eat quickly, or it will get cold.

125
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:32,559
Wait,

126
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
it's my treat.

127
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,679
Why did you act more hospitable
than I did?

128
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,520
If one doesn't want to do something,

129
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,000
no one can force him.

130
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:40,039
Right?

131
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,640
Whether you eat or not, it's up to you.

132
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,640
Just eat.

133
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,840
Are we eating small steamed buns?

134
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,440
No, they are my flesh and blood.

135
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:55,479
Your flesh and blood?

136
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,280
I finally know what animal you are like.

137
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:00,159
Pixiu,

138
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,440
who only takes things in
but never lets anything out.

139
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:05,119
No matter how I think about it,

140
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:06,880
you can earn at least this much
with the office building project.

141
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,039
You are not willing
to even take a fraction out?

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,119
How did you know
it was an office building?

143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,320
Don't tell me that

144
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,320
you helped me find this project.

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
Aren't you curious about

146
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,320
how I found you?

147
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,840
If I tell you the truth,

148
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,599
someone is going to kill me.

149
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,479
What are you thinking?

150
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,799
Am I the kind of person
who looks for projects for you?

151
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,039
I don't have that much free time.

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
I just guessed.

153
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,559
That's what I thought.

154
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,479
You are so busy as a businessman.

155
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,719
How is it possible for you to worry
about lower-income people like me?

156
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,400
I got it because I was lucky.

157
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,799
That's correct.

158
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:48,000
I really like your face
when you are eating.

159
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:51,719
I might not be able to

160
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:52,520
eat such delicious food for a while.

161
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
For a while? Why?

162
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm going for a business trip abroad.

163
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,200
Abroad?

164
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:06,200
I've never been abroad.

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,080
What's good about going abroad?

166
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,280
Studying.

167
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,479
Do you know
the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar?

168
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,000
It's my dream school.

169
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Their department of architecture.

170
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:20,000
Professor Oam

171
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,599
is my idol.

172
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,000
I remember that during the first lesson

173
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,799
in my college,

174
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,159
our teacher was holding
the Introduction to Architecture

175
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,159
and telling us that

176
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:31,640
this book was written by professor Oam.

177
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,880
He is the originator of
architecture industry.

178
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,239
Ever since then,

179
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,559
I started dreaming about

180
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,840
meeting this master one day.

181
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,840
If I saw him,

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,919
I can take pictures with him
and get his signature.

183
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,679
Then my life is all worth it.

184
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,359
What kind of dream is that?

185
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,320
Just eat.

186
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,919
Hello.

187
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,039
Please check out.

188
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,320
Ok, wait a second.

189
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,359
Hello, your order has been paid.

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,880
You did it?

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,280
Who else can it be?

192
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,200
You finally did something right.

193
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
Otherwise, I would

194
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,159
curse you every day,

195
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,359
and hope you will be single forever.

196
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,479
Really?

197
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,320
I'd be happy about it.

198
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,760
Lei Yuzheng,

199
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,719
how did I never know

200
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,080
that you can also be humorous.

201
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,880
There're many things
that you haven't known about me.

202
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,760
Well, there will be
lots of time in the future,

203
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,080
and you can know about me slowly.

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,719
Let's go.

205
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,440
We're here.

206
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,719
I'm going inside then.

207
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,919
Thank you for your dinner.

208
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:03,919
My dinner?

209
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,960
Wasn't it your treat?

210
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,559
It was my treat, and you paid the bill.

211
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,760
It's fair.

212
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,880
Next time,

213
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,479
it'll be your treat and I will pay.

214
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:14,000
Then, we will be equal.

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,280
Next time?

216
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,039
I don't even know
when the next time would be.

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,719
How long will you stay abroad?

218
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:23,119
If everything goes as planned,
it might be a week.

219
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,559
Just a week.

220
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,400
Maybe, you will be back sooner.

221
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,479
Then, I will go up for now.

222
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:31,039
Take care of yourself. Bye!

223
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:32,960
Xiaosu.

224
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:40,119
Forget it!

225
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,039
Nothing!

226
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:45,280
President Lei,

227
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:46,880
it's not like you.

228
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,320
Say whatever you want.

229
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,559
Why are you so hesitating?

230
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,039
I was wondering if you could

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,640
come to see me off
at the airport tomorrow.

232
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,799
I…

233
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,239
see you off?

234
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:06,440
Why?

235
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,039
Xiaosu,

236
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,880
we've known each other for long.

237
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,919
You don't really understand how I feel?

238
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:25,799
I know.

239
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,599
It might be hard for you
to make this decision,

240
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
but I'm willing to wait.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,599
My flight will leave at 10 am tomorrow.

242
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm leaving now.

243
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
Dad, drink some water.

244
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,039
Siqi, have a seat.

245
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,520
Dad, why did you

246
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
come to Shanghai this time?

247
00:14:47,359 --> 00:14:48,840
It's okay. You can tell me.

248
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,159
Siqi is not an outsider.

249
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,679
Well,

250
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,200
your brother is getting married.

251
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:58,080
He's going to marry the daughter
of Dr. Liu in the town.

252
00:14:58,239 --> 00:14:59,400
That's great news.

253
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,239
It's great news,
but it's also stressful.

254
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,080
Without the property
ownership certificate,

255
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,880
nobody is willing to marry him.

256
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,320
So,

257
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,799
your mom and I
took out all the money we have,

258
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,080
but it is still not enough.

259
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,520
So, I came here to see

260
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,080
if you have any money available.

261
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,000
Dad, how much do you want?

262
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,440
I can definitely give out
20 to 30 thousand yuan.

263
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,520
That's not enough.

264
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,840
Your mom and I
gathered 300 thousand yuan,

265
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,760
and we still need 200 thousand yuan.

266
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,000
What? 200 thousand yuan?

267
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,719
Since when did it cost so much
to buy a house in that town?

268
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:48,359
Not just for down payment.
It's the full payment.

269
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,239
You must know

270
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,080
how much your brother

271
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:54,919
has gone through

272
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,760
in order to pay your college tuition.

273
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,280
Now,

274
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,719
he's finally met the girl

275
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,880
he can marry and likes.

276
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,640
The family of the girl didn't
ask for too much

277
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,760
other than a house for marriage.

278
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:13,440
We planned to

279
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:16,119
make the down payment for your brother,

280
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,640
and leave the rest for them

281
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,400
to pay back slowly.

282
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,760
But on second thought, we figured that

283
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,520
it doesn't seem right to have her start

284
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,679
paying debt after joining our family.

285
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,359
If the words spread out,

286
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,479
it would be so embarrassing
for our family.

287
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,440
That's why I came to see

288
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,119
if you are able to help your brother

289
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,039
gather 200 thousand yuan,

290
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:41,119
so that he can marry the girl.

291
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,400
It will be a dream come true

292
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,719
for both your brother and us.

293
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,440
Dad,
of course my brother should get married.

294
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,679
About the money,

295
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,719
don't worry.

296
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:00,960
I will try to take care of it.

297
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,799
I'm relieved to hear that.

298
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,359
Your mom will also be happy
to hear about it.

299
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,079
Qunfei, it was right for your brother

300
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,599
to care so much about you all time.

301
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Well, dad,

302
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,959
it's getting late.

303
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,400
I should send Siqi home.

304
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,359
Let's go.

305
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
See you, uncle.

306
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,439
Okay, see you.

307
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,199
Siqi, were you mad?

308
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:36,439
Mad?

309
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,160
200 thousand is not a small number.

310
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,199
Adding up all your savings

311
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:40,119
can barely reach this number.

312
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,520
My brother will return it to me.

313
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,040
So, it means that

314
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,839
you have already decided to
lend him the money.

315
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,160
My brother has been very nice to me
since we were kids.

316
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,640
You don't know about this,

317
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,400
but he used to take care of me well

318
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,239
when my parents were working
in other cities.

319
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
It was because of my brother

320
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,599
that I was able to come to Shanghai,

321
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,439
attend university,

322
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,959
and know you.

323
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,040
All right.

324
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,920
It's your brother who's getting married,

325
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,680
and it's your dad
who's asking for the money.

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,880
As for me, I'm just an outsider.

327
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,079
Siqi,

328
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:10,560
that's not what I mean.

329
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:12,040
I just think that

330
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,719
we cannot even buy a bathroom

331
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,319
with 200 thousand yuan in Shanghai.

332
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,760
So, there's no harm to

333
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,160
give it to my family to
solve this emergency, right?

334
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,800
Yes.

335
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:22,400
We cannot even buy a bathroom here.

336
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,520
But just because we cannot buy it,

337
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
it doesn't mean that

338
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,760
you should lend this money
to your brother,

339
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,800
and live in a rented apartment.

340
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,079
Does it?

341
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,520
And your dad.

342
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,520
He knows that
your brother needs a house for marriage.

343
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,000
But what about us?

344
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,000
Have your family ever

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,839
thought about how I feel?

346
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:38,920
I'm sorry, Siqi.

347
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:41,520
But there're things that are more urgent
than others.

348
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:42,839
Great.

349
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,439
If you want to be an obedient son

350
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,040
and a good brother,

351
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,319
I'm not stopping you.

352
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:48,719
But, He Qunfei,

353
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,199
please ask yourself

354
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,839
if you are a competent boyfriend to me.

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,959
Why is it so hard for you to

356
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:57,040
buy a house

357
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,280
and provide a stable life

358
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
to your beloved woman in front of you?

359
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,920
Siqi, I will keep

360
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,400
all my promises to you.

361
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,800
Please wait a little longer.

362
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,640
Endless waiting.

363
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,359
We've been together for so long,

364
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,439
and the words I've heard the most
is "wait".

365
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,839
I waited three years ago,

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,599
and I'm still waiting.

367
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:18,760
Qunfei,

368
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,560
I'm really tired of waiting,

369
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,199
and I've done enough waiting.

370
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,560
You can lend him the money.

371
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,680
As long as you buy a house,

372
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,920
I don't care even if you lend
200 million yuan to your dad.

373
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:39,119
Siqi!

374
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:51,880
While I'm abroad,

375
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:53,760
please take care of everything for me,

376
00:19:54,439 --> 00:19:55,719
especially the Entertainment Center.

377
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:56,800
If anything occurs,

378
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,959
call me immediately.

379
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,599
Ok.

380
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Mr. Lei,

381
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
you really don't need me
to go to the airport with you?

382
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,920
No.

383
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Someone else will.

384
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,359
Mr. Lei,

385
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,239
you seem different compared to before.

386
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:15,599
You are in better moods,

387
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,000
and you smile more.

388
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,520
Before,

389
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:20,599
you always had such a straight face

390
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,959
that I didn't even dare to breathe.

391
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:23,719
Come on.

392
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,800
Take a good charge of the work
I left you with.

393
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,280
Otherwise, I will kick your ass
when I'm back.

394
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:28,560
Yes, sir.

395
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,160
Bye.

396
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
Do you know why did Lei Yuzheng
go abroad?

397
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,400
No one knows what he's going to do there

398
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,000
besides going on a business trip.

399
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,239
My intuition tells me that

400
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,680
he's going to make a big move this time.

401
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,280
But no one knows exactly

402
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,839
what he's going to do.

403
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,680
He Qunfei must know about it.

404
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,239
I was wondering

405
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,040
if you can see me off
at the airport tomorrow.

406
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,040
Xiaosu,

407
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
we've known each other for long.

408
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,199
You don't really understand how I feel?

409
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,800
I know.

410
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,520
It might be hard for you
to make this decision now,

411
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:42,319
but I'm willing to wait!

412
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:45,479
My flight will leave at 10 am tomorrow.

413
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:52,079
I'm leaving now.

414
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,199
Hello, Teacher Sun, long time no see!

415
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,119
Fine,

416
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,640
I'll watch it now.

417
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,719
Ok.

418
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,719
Mr. Lei, take your time
and have a good trip.

419
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,439
Sir, please drive faster.

420
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,400
Are you in a hurry?

421
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,439
You should have come out earlier

422
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,239
when you go to the airport at this time.

423
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Then, would you please drive
as fast as you can?

424
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,540
(Du Xiaosu)

425
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,520
Lei Yuzheng.

426
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,959
Have a good trip.

427
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,920
Xiaosu, in fact,

428
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,839
I'm very satisfied that you can come.

429
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,359
Hello, Siqi,

430
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,599
this is Qunfei.

431
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:20,400
Sorry,

432
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,479
the subscriber you dialed
can't be connected…

433
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,119
Mr. Lin!

434
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,959
Assistant He!

435
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,040
You had a fight with your girlfriend?

436
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,680
My bad, Mr. Lin.

437
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,839
Come on, have a drink!

438
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,880
What's the big deal about

439
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,199
buying a house?

440
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,680
As the saying goes,

441
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,560
a problem that can be solved with money

442
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,439
wouldn't be called a problem.

443
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,560
But you have to have money.

444
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,239
You can't do anything without money.

445
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:09,920
How about this?

446
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:15,079
There's one million yuan in this card.

447
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,520
Take it.

448
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,479
Are you kidding me, Mr. Lin?

449
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,199
I can't take this money.

450
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,719
Do you know why I'm helping you?

451
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,520
Because you remind me of myself
when I was at your age.

452
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:37,560
Although,

453
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,479
I'm luckier than you,

454
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,640
and I have a girlfriend
who doesn't ask for too much from me.

455
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,239
So what?

456
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,959
I can't let her down

457
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,400
just because she's nice.

458
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,160
So,

459
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,599
I beat my own retreat,

460
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,800
and missed the best woman

461
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,199
in my life.

462
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:01,959
You also…

463
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,319
Take this card,

464
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,959
and buy a house

465
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,800
for her.

466
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,560
Don't worry about paying back.
Take your time.

467
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,439
Bro,

468
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:34,239
are you Ok?

469
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:36,280
I'm Ok.

470
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,680
By the way, could you tell me

471
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,119
if Lei Yuzheng is going abroad

472
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:46,439
to prepare for any large project?

473
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:49,160
Yes, of course.

474
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,280
Mr. Lei is going to discuss with S.G.
about collaboration.

475
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,800
With S.G.'s investment,

476
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,719
the Entertainment Center project
won't be short of money anymore.

477
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,079
Assistant He?

478
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Assistant He?

479
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,239
The project of the Entertainment Center

480
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,839
of Yutian corporate

481
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,599
is not only a milestone

482
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,959
in the Chinese architect business,

483
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:25,560
but it also carries
enormous business potential.

484
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,000
I mean that all of us have reasons
to believe that,

485
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,520
if S.G. is willing to invest

486
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:34,239
and cooperate with us,

487
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:38,359
not only that in between,
both companies to get a good reputation

488
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,199
and praise & profits,
and interests as well.

489
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,160
Lei, I have to say

490
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,479
I am very interested in this project,

491
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,160
and I look forward
to cooperating with you.

492
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:52,560
Fantastic.

493
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
Here is the deal.

494
00:29:57,479 --> 00:29:59,199
Look forward to working with S.G.

495
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,680
I have to go to Shanghai with you, then.

496
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,359
It's definitely my treat.

497
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:05,280
You have to taste the Shanghai buns.

498
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,479
I am looking forward to that.

499
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:08,640
Hey, look, Linton,

500
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,800
there is somebody
I want to consult you about.

501
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:33,619
(Lei Yuzheng. Imperialist burgers are
not for people, but pigs)

502
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,560
That's just for you.

503
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,560
Byebye.

504
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,800
Fanlv, you must have waited for a while.

505
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:03,079
It's too cold. Put on the clothes.

506
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,439
Lin Xiangyuan,

507
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,359
you're upset right now, aren't you?

508
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,040
Upset?

509
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:40,520
Why am I upset?

510
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,280
Stop pretending.

511
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,280
I know you're upset.

512
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,880
I hide from you every day.

513
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:50,560
Because of this?

514
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,920
Yes, that's true.

515
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,280
But you didn't do anything wrong.

516
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,599
You have your own freedom.

517
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,239
Fanlv, you may rest assured

518
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,000
that I will try my best,

519
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,119
and I won't let you down.

520
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,280
We were engaged because...

521
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,359
For whatever reason,

522
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,119
since you are my fiancee now,

523
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,319
I should be responsible for you

524
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,520
and treat you well.

525
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,839
I know that

526
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:23,839
you have some prejudice against me.

527
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,119
But I believe that

528
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,079
time will change everything.

529
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,319
I also believe that

530
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,880
you won't regret it.

531
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:37,000
Fanlv, give me a chance.

532
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,280
Let me protect you.

533
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000
Mr. He and Miss Zou,

534
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,000
congratulations.

535
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,119
You have already pre-purchased
the house.

536
00:32:52,239 --> 00:32:53,760
Please make the down payment

537
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,839
within two weeks.

538
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,959
Otherwise,
the deposit will not be returned.

539
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,119
Thanks.

540
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:04,800
Are we really going to buy a house?

541
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:06,959
This feels like a dream.

542
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,000
Stupid girl.

is right here,

544

I do, I do.

547
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,680
I'm just really surprised.

548
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,959
Why does every word

549
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,119
in this subscription agreement

550
00:33:22,199 --> 00:33:24,839
seem so nice?

551
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,439
I think we should think about

552
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:32,800
how to decorate the house now.

553
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,880
Retro style or minimalist style?

554
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:36,760
We need to make a decision soon.

555
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,959
Why do I feel that

556
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,640
you are more intimate with this house
than with me?

557
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,160
Do you only care about this house?

558
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:45,319
Of course I like the house.

559
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,680
I want to sleep with the house.

560
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,479
What you gonna do?

561
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,640
Listen,

562
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,439
this is my baby now.

563
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,800
As for you…

564
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,280
Why are you so narrow-minded?

565
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:59,319
Are you out of your mind?

566
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,719
I'm telling you,

567
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,479
you'll be the wife of He Qunfei.

568
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,280
You can't run away.

569
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,119
Why should I run?

570
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,639
I have a house now.

571
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,280
I'll be where the house is.

572
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:11,639
You can't even get rid of me.

573
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,439
By the way,

574
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,560
is your father leaving today?

575
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,919
Has your brother solved the money?

576
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,879
If it's not enough,

577
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,159
I will try to

578
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,639
see if I can make up 30 to 50 thousand.

579
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,800
Also, I think

580
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,639
we still have to buy some gifts for him,

581
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,800
so that he can bring them back,

582
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,919
and have something to show off.

583
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,800
Ok.

584
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,840
Let's go!

585
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,120
Sure.

586
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,120
Look who's here, Dr. Oam!

587
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,360
Xiaosu!

588
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,919
Xiaosu, Dr. Oam.

589
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
She's beautiful.

590
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,120
Oh my goodness!

591
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:23,879
Miss Du, nice to meet you.

592
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,959
Mr. Oam!

593
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,280
Nice to meet you.

594
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,760
Can I have a hug?

595
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:39,879
Xiaosu,

596
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,919
you're too excited.

597
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,199
Dr. Oam.

598
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:48,520
It's so nice to see you today.

599
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,120
You're my idol.

600
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,439
I really never thought that,

601
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,159
one day I could meet you in person.

602
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,840
I feel like dreaming.

603
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,879
What did she say?

604
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,800
As you can see, she was flattered.

605
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,280
She respects your reputation

606
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,360
and she's been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

607
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,159
Miss Du,

608
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,159
I'd much rather that you flatter me as
"young and handsome".

609
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,919
You are still young.

610
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,560
"Respects" my "reputation"!

611
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,040
Come on, guys, grab a seat.

612
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,040
Come on.

613
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I majored in design.

614
00:36:26,879 --> 00:36:28,120
The Introduction to Architecture
that I learned...

615
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,760
All in triangles.

616
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
On the Bund,

617
00:36:30,959 --> 00:36:32,959
I want to design skyscrapers
on the Bund.

618
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,360
Mind in heart.

619
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,000
Heart.

620
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,800
Look up!

621
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:42,159
Cheers! Excellent!

622
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,719
These are the best dishes in Shanghai.

623
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,520
Look at this.
This is the steamed bun. It's famous.

624
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,239
Wait!

625
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,800
No, no, no!

626
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:51,320
Chopsticks should be used like this.

627
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:52,760
Have a toast.

628
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,959
-Welcome!
-Cheers!

629
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,080
To our architecture on the bottom.

630
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,439
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

631
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,040
May I be excused? I will be back.

632
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,040
I can bite for you.

633
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:07,959
Mr. Oam, please have some more.

634
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,159
Try this.

635
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,919
This one, this one. This is not spicy.

636
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Miss Du.

637
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:16,159
Your boyfriend loves you

638
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,320
very much.

639
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,840
Mr. Oam, I think you have misunderstood.

640
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,840
He's not my boyfriend yet.

641
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,360
Boyfriend,

642
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,120
no!

643
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,360
Miss Du,

644
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,080
even though I'm middle aged,

645
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,639
I have the eyes of a hawk.

646
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,439
Do you know how Yuzheng invited me?

647
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:53,399
One day, Yuzheng came to my home.

648
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,679
Ever since

649
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,600
my wife, Anna, passed away,

650
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,120
I have always been in the fall mood.

651
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,959
And I don't like visits from strangers.

652
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:05,800
No doubt,

653
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:09,199
on that day,
he was slammed out in the cold.

654
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:13,000
Excuse me. Hi, there.

655
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,840
Was this place for
Professor Oam's residence?

656
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,560
Who is it, and what do you want?

657
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,760
Sorry, my name is Lei,
and I came from China.

658
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,479
I have an appointment
with professor Oam.

659
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,600
Sir.

660
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,360
Sir.

661
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,840
Professor.

662
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,639
Sure you have an appointment.

663
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,600
Professor.

664
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,959
Why haven't you left yet?

665
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,719
I really want to talk to you.

666
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,919
I've been up all night,
working on the design.

667
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,800
I am very tired.

668
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,679
No matter what you want to say.

669
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:05,080
I don't want to hear it.

670
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,959
Look, Professor.

671
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,399
I'm deeply sorry for the intrusion,

672
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:12,000
but a friend of mine in China,
whose major is architect,

673
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,399
she would love an autograph from you.

674
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,639
Could you do me a favor, please?

675
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,520
