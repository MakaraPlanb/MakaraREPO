=Episode 19=

16
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,679
Everyone, look at this.

17
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,759
The data shows that

18
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,880
the Entertainment Center project
is doing well.

19
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,080
The investors also saw
how much progress we had made

20
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,160
and changed their attitude

21
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,960
towards this project.
They no longer feel worried.

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,080
Now, they have great confidence in us,

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,320
and are hopeful about this project.

24
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,479
It seems that now

25
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,160
we don't have any financial problems

26
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:27,279
for the Entertainment Center project
anymore.

27
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,440
Mr. Ye,

28
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:32,360
please have a look.

29
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,559
This is the meeting room.

30
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,479
This table has a unique design

31
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,880
in a pentagon shape.

32
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,000
Also, this light.

33
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,519
I personally really like this light.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,920
Miss Du has good taste as expected.

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,119
Thanks.

36
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,239
On the outside, I also used some

37
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,760
unique decorations on the lights

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,480
and chose some matching plants

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,559
to make the whole office cozy

40
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,480
and comfortable.

41
00:04:00,679 --> 00:04:01,720
How do you like it?

42
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,320
It turns out that
Miss Du is really professional.

43
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
To be honest,

44
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,839
I didn't expect much from you.

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,119
It now appears that

46
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,600
I'm very satisfied.

47
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,959
It is great working with you.

48
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,399
Thank you for your compliment.

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
To be honest,

50
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,119
if you didn't contact me
for this project,

51
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,040
I wouldn't have confidence

52
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,959
to keep doing this.

53
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,480
Aren't you curious about

54
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,119
how I found you?

55
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:25,760
Forget it!

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,160
If I tell you the truth,

57
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,920
someone is going to kill me.

58
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,679
All you have to know is that

59
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,959
someone is trying to help you.

60
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,399
Miss Du,

61
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,239
this person cares a lot about you.

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,600
Mr. Lei Yuzheng, I've earned money.

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,279
Let me treat you a meal.
How does that sound?

64
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,959
-Qunfei.
-Yes?

65
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:16,480
Why did you seem

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,640
to be distracted recently?

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
Did anything happen?

68
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,640
No, nothing.

69
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,640
This one,

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,640
this one,

71
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:42,880
and this one.

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,959
Ok, that's all.

73
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,600
How were you so quiet?

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,119
When did you come in?

75
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,399
Ok, that's all. Order is placed.

76
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,839
Wait, Du Xiaosu,

77
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,799
you have just placed the order without

78
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,760
asking what the guest wants?

79
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,519
What kind of treat is that?

80
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:04,399
It's my treat. I've told you.

81
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:05,799
So, you have to listen to me.

82
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,880
Is that how it works?

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,480
What are you doing?

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
Braised baby cabbage in broth,

85
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,480
boiled Chinese broccoli,

86
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,200
1 serving of small steamed buns,

87
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,040
and 2 servings of instant noodles
in chicken soup.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,440
You might as well

89
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,959
order two clay oven rolls for us.

90
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,799
Make some changes.

91
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,359
Crab meat bean curd,

92
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,600
salmon nori,

93
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,200
and sashimi set.

94
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,279
As for drinks...

95
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,040
Why did you step on me?

96
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,959
Who stepped on you?

97
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,359
Rich people like you

98
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,880
must have tried everything.

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,760
Why are you doing this to me?

100
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,079
Aren't you also rich now?

101
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
You need to admit that

102
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,040
the large-scale project
you recently worked on

103
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,160
must be very profitable.

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,480
Am I right?

105
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:03,799
What large-scale project?

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,399
You made that up. Ok?

107
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,119
If you are trying to
destroy my reputation,

108
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,040
I...

109
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,359
I will ask you for
mental damage compensation.

110
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:11,399
You won't be able to afford it.

111
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,559
I'm sorry, sir and madam.

112
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,119
Whom should I listen to?

113
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,320
-Me.
-Me.

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Well,

115
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,000
just listen to him then.

116
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,320
Forget about the drinks.
Just place order for the rest.

117
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Ok, sir.

118
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:30,760
Lei Yuzheng,

119
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,920
you think that you are nice to me,
right?

120
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,200
Actually,
I would order abalone and trepang.

121
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,600
Just consider yourself lucky.

122
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,160
Here, Du Xiaosu,

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,799
try a small steamed bun.

124
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,359
Eat quickly, or it will get cold.

125
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,559
Wait,

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,400
it's my treat.

127
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,679
Why did you act more hospitable
than I did?

128
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:02,520
If one doesn't want to do something,

129
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,000
no one can force him.

130
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,039
Right?

131
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,640
Whether you eat or not, it's up to you.

132
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:09,640
Just eat.

133
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Are we eating small steamed buns?

134
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,440
No, they are my flesh and blood.

135
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:20,479
Your flesh and blood?

136
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
I finally know what animal you are like.

137
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,159
Pixiu,

138
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,440
who only takes things in
but never lets anything out.

139
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,119
No matter how I think about it,

140
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,880
you can earn at least this much
with the office building project.

141
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,039
You are not willing
to even take a fraction out?

142
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,119
How did you know
it was an office building?

143
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,320
Don't tell me that

144
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,320
you helped me find this project.

145
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
Aren't you curious about

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,320
how I found you?

147
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,840
If I tell you the truth,

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,599
someone is going to kill me.

149
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,479
What are you thinking?

150
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,799
Am I the kind of person
who looks for projects for you?

151
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,039
I don't have that much free time.

152
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I just guessed.

153
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,559
That's what I thought.

154
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,479
You are so busy as a businessman.

155
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,719
How is it possible for you to worry
about lower-income people like me?

156
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,400
I got it because I was lucky.

157
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,799
That's correct.

158
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,000
I really like your face
when you are eating.

159
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:16,719
I might not be able to

160
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,520
eat such delicious food for a while.

161
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
For a while? Why?

162
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,799
I'm going for a business trip abroad.

163
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,200
Abroad?

164
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,200
I've never been abroad.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,080
What's good about going abroad?

166
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Studying.

167
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,479
Do you know
the Bauhaus-Universität Weimar?

168
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,000
It's my dream school.

169
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
Their department of architecture.

170
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:45,000
Professor Oam

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,599
is my idol.

172
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
I remember that during the first lesson

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,799
in my college,

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,159
our teacher was holding
the Introduction to Architecture

175
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,159
and telling us that

176
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,640
this book was written by professor Oam.

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
He is the originator of
architecture industry.

178
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,239
Ever since then,

179
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,559
I started dreaming about

180
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,840
meeting this master one day.

181
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,840
If I saw him,

182
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,919
I can take pictures with him
and get his signature.

183
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,679
Then my life is all worth it.

184
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,359
What kind of dream is that?

185
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,320
Just eat.

186
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,919
Hello.

187
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,039
Please check out.

188
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,320
Ok, wait a second.

189
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,359
Hello, your order has been paid.

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,880
You did it?

191
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
Who else can it be?

192
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,200
You finally did something right.

193
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,760
Otherwise, I would

194
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,159
curse you every day,

195
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:51,359
and hope you will be single forever.

196
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,479
Really?

197
00:10:54,359 --> 00:10:55,320
I'd be happy about it.

198
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,760
Lei Yuzheng,

199
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,719
how did I never know

200
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,080
that you can also be humorous.

201
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,880
There're many things
that you haven't known about me.

202
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,760
Well, there will be
lots of time in the future,

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
and you can know about me slowly.

204
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,719
Let's go.

205
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,440
We're here.

206
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,719
I'm going inside then.

207
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,919
Thank you for your dinner.

208
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,919
My dinner?

209
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
Wasn't it your treat?

210
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,559
It was my treat, and you paid the bill.

211
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,760
It's fair.

212
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,880
Next time,

213
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,479
it'll be your treat and I will pay.

214
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,000
Then, we will be equal.

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Next time?

216
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,039
I don't even know
when the next time would be.

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,719
How long will you stay abroad?

218
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:48,119
If everything goes as planned,
it might be a week.

219
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,559
Just a week.

220
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:51,400
Maybe, you will be back sooner.

221
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,479
Then, I will go up for now.

222
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,039
Take care of yourself. Bye!

223
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:57,960
Xiaosu.

224
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,119
Forget it!

225
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,039
Nothing!

226
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,280
President Lei,

227
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:11,880
it's not like you.

228
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,320
Say whatever you want.

229
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,559
Why are you so hesitating?

230
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,039
I was wondering if you could

231
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,640
come to see me off
at the airport tomorrow.

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,799
I…

233
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,239
see you off?

234
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,440
Why?

235
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,039
Xiaosu,

236
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,880
we've known each other for long.

237
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,919
You don't really understand how I feel?

238
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,799
I know.

239
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,599
It might be hard for you
to make this decision,

240
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,840
but I'm willing to wait.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,599
My flight will leave at 10 am tomorrow.

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm leaving now.

243
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Dad, drink some water.

244
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:48,039
Siqi, have a seat.

245
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,520
Dad, why did you

246
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,960
come to Shanghai this time?

247
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,840
It's okay. You can tell me.

248
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,159
Siqi is not an outsider.

249
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,679
Well,

250
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,200
your brother is getting married.

251
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,080
He's going to marry the daughter
of Dr. Liu in the town.

252
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,400
That's great news.

253
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,239
It's great news,
but it's also stressful.

254
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,080
Without the property
ownership certificate,

255
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:32,880
nobody is willing to marry him.

256
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,320
So,

257
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,799
your mom and I
took out all the money we have,

258
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
but it is still not enough.

259
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,520
So, I came here to see

260
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,080
if you have any money available.

261
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,000
Dad, how much do you want?

262
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,440
I can definitely give out
20 to 30 thousand yuan.

263
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,520
That's not enough.

264
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Your mom and I
gathered 300 thousand yuan,

265
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:00,760
and we still need 200 thousand yuan.

266
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,000
What? 200 thousand yuan?

267
00:15:08,359 --> 00:15:10,719
Since when did it cost so much
to buy a house in that town?

268
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,359
Not just for down payment.
It's the full payment.

269
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,239
You must know

270
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,080
how much your brother

271
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,919
has gone through

272
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,760
in order to pay your college tuition.

273
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,280
Now,

274
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,719
he's finally met the girl

275
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,880
he can marry and likes.

276
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,640
The family of the girl didn't
ask for too much

277
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,760
other than a house for marriage.

278
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,440
We planned to

279
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:41,119
make the down payment for your brother,

280
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,640
and leave the rest for them

281
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,400
to pay back slowly.

282
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,760
But on second thought, we figured that

283
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,520
it doesn't seem right to have her start

284
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:53,679
paying debt after joining our family.

285
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,359
If the words spread out,

286
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:58,479
it would be so embarrassing
for our family.

287
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,440
That's why I came to see

288
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,119
if you are able to help your brother

289
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,039
gather 200 thousand yuan,

290
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,119
so that he can marry the girl.

291
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,400
It will be a dream come true

292
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,719
for both your brother and us.

293
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,440
Dad,
of course my brother should get married.

294
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,679
About the money,

295
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,719
don't worry.

296
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,960
I will try to take care of it.

297
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,799
I'm relieved to hear that.

298
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,359
Your mom will also be happy
to hear about it.

299
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
Qunfei, it was right for your brother

300
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,599
to care so much about you all time.

301
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Well, dad,

302
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:43,959
it's getting late.

303
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
I should send Siqi home.

304
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,359
Let's go.

305
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,560
See you, uncle.

306
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,439
Okay, see you.

307
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,199
Siqi, were you mad?

308
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:01,439
Mad?

309
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,160
200 thousand is not a small number.

310
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,199
Adding up all your savings

311
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,119
can barely reach this number.

312
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,520
My brother will return it to me.

313
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
So, it means that

314
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,839
you have already decided to
lend him the money.

315
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,160
My brother has been very nice to me
since we were kids.

316
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,640
You don't know about this,

317
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,400
but he used to take care of me well

318
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,239
when my parents were working
in other cities.

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,560
It was because of my brother

320
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,599
that I was able to come to Shanghai,

321
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,439
attend university,

322
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,959
and know you.

323
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,040
All right.

324
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:27,920
It's your brother who's getting married,

325
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,680
and it's your dad
who's asking for the money.

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
As for me, I'm just an outsider.

327
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:33,079
Siqi,

328
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:35,560
that's not what I mean.

329
00:17:35,719 --> 00:17:37,040
I just think that

330
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,719
we cannot even buy a bathroom

331
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:40,319
with 200 thousand yuan in Shanghai.

332
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,760
So, there's no harm to

333
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,160
give it to my family to
solve this emergency, right?

334
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes.

335
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,400
We cannot even buy a bathroom here.

336
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,520
But just because we cannot buy it,

337
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
it doesn't mean that

338
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:51,760
you should lend this money
to your brother,

339
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
and live in a rented apartment.

340
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,079
Does it?

341
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,520
And your dad.

342
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,520
He knows that
your brother needs a house for marriage.

343
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:00,000
But what about us?

344
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,000
Have your family ever

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,839
thought about how I feel?

346
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:03,920
I'm sorry, Siqi.

347
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,520
But there're things that are more urgent
than others.

348
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,839
Great.

349
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,439
If you want to be an obedient son

350
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,040
and a good brother,

351
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,319
I'm not stopping you.

352
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,719
But, He Qunfei,

353
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,199
please ask yourself

354
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,839
if you are a competent boyfriend to me.

355
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,959
Why is it so hard for you to

356
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,040
buy a house

357
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
and provide a stable life

358
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
to your beloved woman in front of you?

359
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,920
Siqi, I will keep

360
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:29,400
all my promises to you.

361
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,800
Please wait a little longer.

362
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,640
Endless waiting.

363
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,359
We've been together for so long,

364
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,439
and the words I've heard the most
is "wait".

365
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,839
I waited three years ago,

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,599
and I'm still waiting.

367
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,760
Qunfei,

368
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm really tired of waiting,

369
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,199
and I've done enough waiting.

370
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,560
You can lend him the money.

371
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,680
As long as you buy a house,

372
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,920
I don't care even if you lend
200 million yuan to your dad.

373
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,119
Siqi!

374
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,880
While I'm abroad,

375
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,760
please take care of everything for me,

376
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,719
especially the Entertainment Center.

377
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,800
If anything occurs,

378
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,959
call me immediately.

379
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,599
Ok.

380
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Mr. Lei,

381
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,880
you really don't need me
to go to the airport with you?

382
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,920
No.

383
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Someone else will.

384
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,359
Mr. Lei,

385
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,239
you seem different compared to before.

386
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,599
You are in better moods,

387
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,000
and you smile more.

388
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,520
Before,

389
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,599
you always had such a straight face

390
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:46,959
that I didn't even dare to breathe.

391
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,719
Come on.

392
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,800
Take a good charge of the work
I left you with.

393
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,280
Otherwise, I will kick your ass
when I'm back.

394
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes, sir.

395
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,160
Bye.

396
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Do you know why did Lei Yuzheng
go abroad?

397
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,400
No one knows what he's going to do there

398
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,000
besides going on a business trip.

399
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,239
My intuition tells me that

400
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,680
he's going to make a big move this time.

401
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,280
But no one knows exactly

402
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,839
what he's going to do.

403
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,680
He Qunfei must know about it.

404
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,239
I was wondering

405
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,040
if you can see me off
at the airport tomorrow.

406
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:52,040
Xiaosu,

407
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,160
we've known each other for long.

408
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,199
You don't really understand how I feel?

409
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,800
I know.

410
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,520
It might be hard for you
to make this decision now,

411
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,319
but I'm willing to wait!

412
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,479
My flight will leave at 10 am tomorrow.

413
00:21:16,199 --> 00:21:17,079
I'm leaving now.

414
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,199
Hello, Teacher Sun, long time no see!

415
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,119
Fine,

416
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,640
I'll watch it now.

417
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,719
Ok.

418
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,719
Mr. Lei, take your time
and have a good trip.

419
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,439
Sir, please drive faster.

420
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
Are you in a hurry?

421
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,439
You should have come out earlier

422
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,239
when you go to the airport at this time.

423
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,920
Then, would you please drive
as fast as you can?

424
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,540
(Du Xiaosu)

425
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,520
Lei Yuzheng.

426
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:32,959
Have a good trip.

427
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Xiaosu, in fact,

428
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,839
I'm very satisfied that you can come.

429
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,359
Hello, Siqi,

430
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,599
this is Qunfei.

431
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:45,400
Sorry,

432
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,479
the subscriber you dialed
can't be connected…

433
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,119
Mr. Lin!

434
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,959
Assistant He!

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,040
You had a fight with your girlfriend?

436
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:01,680
My bad, Mr. Lin.

437
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,839
Come on, have a drink!

438
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,880
What's the big deal about

439
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,199
buying a house?

440
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,680
As the saying goes,

441
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,560
a problem that can be solved with money

442
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,439
wouldn't be called a problem.

443
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,560
But you have to have money.

444
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,239
You can't do anything without money.

445
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:34,920
How about this?

446
00:26:37,439 --> 00:26:40,079
There's one million yuan in this card.

447
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,520
Take it.

448
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,479
Are you kidding me, Mr. Lin?

449
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,199
I can't take this money.

450
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,719
Do you know why I'm helping you?

451
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Because you remind me of myself
when I was at your age.

452
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,560
Although,

453
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,479
I'm luckier than you,

454
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,640
and I have a girlfriend
who doesn't ask for too much from me.

455
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,239
So what?

456
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,959
I can't let her down

457
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:14,400
just because she's nice.

458
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,160
So,

459
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,599
I beat my own retreat,

460
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,800
and missed the best woman

461
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,199
in my life.

462
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:26,959
You also…

463
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,319
Take this card,

464
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,959
and buy a house

465
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,800
for her.

466
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,560
Don't worry about paying back.
Take your time.

467
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,439
Bro,

468
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,239
are you Ok?

469
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm Ok.

470
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:05,680
By the way, could you tell me

471
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,119
if Lei Yuzheng is going abroad

472
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,439
to prepare for any large project?

473
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,160
Yes, of course.

474
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,280
Mr. Lei is going to discuss with S.G.
about collaboration.

475
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,800
With S.G.'s investment,

476
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,719
the Entertainment Center project
won't be short of money anymore.

477
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,079
Assistant He?

478
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
Assistant He?

479
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,239
The project of the Entertainment Center

480
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,839
of Yutian corporate

481
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,599
is not only a milestone

482
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,959
in the Chinese architect business,

483
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:50,560
but it also carries
enormous business potential.

484
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,000
I mean that all of us have reasons
to believe that,

485
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,520
if S.G. is willing to invest

486
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,239
and cooperate with us,

487
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,359
not only that in between,
both companies to get a good reputation

488
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,199
and praise & profits,
and interests as well.

489
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:11,160
Lei, I have to say

490
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,479
I am very interested in this project,

491
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,160
and I look forward
to cooperating with you.

492
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,560
Fantastic.

493
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Here is the deal.

494
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:24,199
Look forward to working with S.G.

495
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,680
I have to go to Shanghai with you, then.

496
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,359
It's definitely my treat.

497
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,280
You have to taste the Shanghai buns.

498
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,479
I am looking forward to that.

499
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,640
Hey, look, Linton,

500
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,800
there is somebody
I want to consult you about.

501
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:58,619
(Lei Yuzheng. Imperialist burgers are
not for people, but pigs)

502
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,560
That's just for you.

503
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,560
Byebye.

504
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,800
Fanlv, you must have waited for a while.

505
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:28,079
It's too cold. Put on the clothes.

506
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,439
Lin Xiangyuan,

507
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:59,359
you're upset right now, aren't you?

508
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,040
Upset?

509
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:05,520
Why am I upset?

510
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,280
Stop pretending.

511
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,280
I know you're upset.

512
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,880
I hide from you every day.

513
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,560
Because of this?

514
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,920
Yes, that's true.

515
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,280
But you didn't do anything wrong.

516
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,599
You have your own freedom.

517
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,239
Fanlv, you may rest assured

518
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,000
that I will try my best,

519
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,119
and I won't let you down.

520
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,280
We were engaged because...

521
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,359
For whatever reason,

522
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,119
since you are my fiancee now,

523
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:43,319
I should be responsible for you

524
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,520
and treat you well.

525
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,839
I know that

526
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:48,839
you have some prejudice against me.

527
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,119
But I believe that

528
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,079
time will change everything.

529
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,319
I also believe that

530
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:58,880
you won't regret it.

531
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:02,000
Fanlv, give me a chance.

532
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,280
Let me protect you.

533
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
Mr. He and Miss Zou,

534
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:15,000
congratulations.

535
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,119
You have already pre-purchased
the house.

536
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:18,760
Please make the down payment

537
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,839
within two weeks.

538
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,959
Otherwise,
the deposit will not be returned.

539
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:23,119
Thanks.

540
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,800
Are we really going to buy a house?

541
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:31,959
This feels like a dream.

542
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,000
Stupid girl.

is right here,

544

I do, I do.

547
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,680
I'm just really surprised.

548
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,959
Why does every word

549
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,119
in this subscription agreement

550

seem so nice?

551
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,439
I think we should think about

552
00:32:56,479 --> 00:32:57,800
how to decorate the house now.

553
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,880
Retro style or minimalist style?

554
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,760
We need to make a decision soon.

555
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,959
Why do I feel that

556
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,640
you are more intimate with this house
than with me?

557
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
Do you only care about this house?

558
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:10,319
Of course I like the house.

559
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,680
I want to sleep with the house.

560
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,479
What you gonna do?

561
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,640
Listen,

562
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:17,439
this is my baby now.

563
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,800
As for you…

564
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,280
Why are you so narrow-minded?

565
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,319
Are you out of your mind?

566
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,719
I'm telling you,

567
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,479
you'll be the wife of He Qunfei.

568
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,280
You can't run away.

569
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,119
Why should I run?

570
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,639
I have a house now.

571
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:35,280
I'll be where the house is.

572
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,639
You can't even get rid of me.

573
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:39,439
By the way,

574
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
is your father leaving today?

575
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,919
Has your brother solved the money?

576
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,879
If it's not enough,

577
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,159
I will try to

578
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,639
see if I can make up 30 to 50 thousand.

579
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,800
Also, I think

580
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,639
we still have to buy some gifts for him,

581
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:56,800
so that he can bring them back,

582
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,919
and have something to show off.

583
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,800
Ok.

584
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:03,840
Let's go!

585
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,120
Sure.

586
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,120
Look who's here, Dr. Oam!

587
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,360
Xiaosu!

588
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,919
Xiaosu, Dr. Oam.

589
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
She's beautiful.

590
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,120
Oh my goodness!

591
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,879
Miss Du, nice to meet you.

592
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,959
Mr. Oam!

593
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,280
Nice to meet you.

594
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,760
Can I have a hug?

595
00:35:03,919 --> 00:35:04,879
Xiaosu,

596
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,919
you're too excited.

597
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,199
Dr. Oam.

598
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,520
It's so nice to see you today.

599
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,120
You're my idol.

600
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,439
I really never thought that,

601
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,159
one day I could meet you in person.

602
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,840
I feel like dreaming.

603
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,879
What did she say?

604
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:27,800
As you can see, she was flattered.

605
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,280
She respects your reputation

606
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,360
and she's been looking forward
to this day for a long time.

607
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,159
Miss Du,

608
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,159
I'd much rather that you flatter me as
"young and handsome".

609
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,919
You are still young.

610
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:45,560
"Respects" my "reputation"!

611
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,040
Come on, guys, grab a seat.

612
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,040
Come on.

613
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
I majored in design.

614
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:53,120
The Introduction to Architecture
that I learned...

615
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,760
All in triangles.

616
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
On the Bund,

617
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:57,959
I want to design skyscrapers
on the Bund.

618
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,360
Mind in heart.

619
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,000
Heart.

620
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
Look up!

621
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:07,159
Cheers! Excellent!

622
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,719
These are the best dishes in Shanghai.

623
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,520
Look at this.
This is the steamed bun. It's famous.

624
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,239
Wait!

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,800
No, no, no!

626
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,320
Chopsticks should be used like this.

627
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:17,760
Have a toast.

628
00:36:17,919 --> 00:36:18,959
-Welcome!
-Cheers!

629
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,080
To our architecture on the bottom.

630
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:26,439
Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

631
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,040
May I be excused? I will be back.

632
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,040
I can bite for you.

633
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,959
Mr. Oam, please have some more.

634
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,159
Try this.

635
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,919
This one, this one. This is not spicy.

636
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Miss Du.

637
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:41,159
Your boyfriend loves you

638
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,320
very much.

639
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
Mr. Oam, I think you have misunderstood.

640
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,840
He's not my boyfriend yet.

641
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,360
Boyfriend,

642
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,120
no!

643
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,360
Miss Du,

644
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:03,080
even though I'm middle aged,

645
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,639
I have the eyes of a hawk.

646
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,439
Do you know how Yuzheng invited me?

647
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,399
One day, Yuzheng came to my home.

648
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:19,679
Ever since

649
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,600
my wife, Anna, passed away,

650
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,120
I have always been in the fall mood.

651
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,959
And I don't like visits from strangers.

652
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,800
No doubt,

653
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:34,199
on that day,
he was slammed out in the cold.

654
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:38,000
Excuse me. Hi, there.

655
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,840
Was this place for
Professor Oam's residence?

656
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,560
Who is it, and what do you want?

657
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,760
Sorry, my name is Lei,
and I came from China.

658
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,479
I have an appointment
with professor Oam.

659
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,600
Sir.

660
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:58,360
Sir.

661
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,840
Professor.

662
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,639
Sure you have an appointment.

663
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,600
Professor.

664
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,959
Why haven't you left yet?

665
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,719
I really want to talk to you.

666
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,919
I've been up all night,
working on the design.

667
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,800
I am very tired.

668
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:27,679
No matter what you want to say.

669
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,080
I don't want to hear it.

670
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,959
Look, Professor.

671
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,399
I'm deeply sorry for the intrusion,

672
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,000
but a friend of mine in China,
whose major is architect,

673
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,399
she would love an autograph from you.

674
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,639
Could you do me a favor, please?

675
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,520
