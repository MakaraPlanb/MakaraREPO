16
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,839
I'm deeply sorry for the intrusion,

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
but a friend of mine in China,
whose major is architect,

18
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,039
she would love your autographed photo.

19
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,160
Can you do me a favor, please.

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,160
Your wife?

21
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:26,559
Come on in.

22
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,800
I've decided to go with you to Shanghai.

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,479
You know why I'm going to help you.

25
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,039
Because you remind me of myself

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,759
when I was young.

27
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,399
When I met my wife Anna,

28
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,080
I was in love with her at first sight.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,399
Anna likes chocolate,

30
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,279
so every day I bring it to her.

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
I couldn't bear to
see her disappointed.

32
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,639
So sometimes,
I would wait outside the pastry shop,

33
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,559
just begging the pastry chef to
make her another one.

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,960
You remind me when I still have that

35
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,639
'If I don't achieve my goal,
I won't give up' spirit.

36
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,039
I can see you really like this girl.

37
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,320
I do.

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,039
And I hope she knows that
you got such pains for her.

39
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,679
And I hope you get her.

40
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,720
I've got your blessing.

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you very much, Professor Ohm.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,559
What?

43
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:48,720
Yuzheng hasn't told you any of this?

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,919
No.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,160
You should be very happy.

46
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,360
Yuzheng loves you,

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,839
just like I love Anna.

48
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
You need to treasure him.

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,080
Speak of the devil.

50
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,399
Welcome back.

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,720
What's the secret talk?

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,959
That's a little secret.

53
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,519
A toast

54
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
to the Shanghai trial,
Shanghai architecture.

55
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,160
Thank you.

56
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,279
I'm very happy today.

57
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,679
Helping you

58
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,239
makes me happy too.

59
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to know...

60
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,760
Why me?

61
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:56,480
I don't know why.

62
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,760
I just feel that

63
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,920
you are not like the others to me.

64
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,559
I don't know

65
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,200
when this feeling started.

66
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,760
But when I found that,

67
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,399
I was already deep in it.

68
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,320
But this feeling is kind of interesting.

69
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,079
Because even for me, Lei Yuzheng,
there's still something I can't control.

70
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:31,559
But…

71
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,880
It seems that I'm not that good.

72
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,440
You know what,

73
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,760
someone once told me that

74
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,559
you didn't understand love

75
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,600
because you'd never met it.

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
At that time,

77
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,239
I was contemptuous of

78
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:51,480
this theory.

79
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,160
I even thought it was ridiculous.

80
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
Are there really
that many people in the world

81
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,239
who want to give their heart
to each other?

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
What is better than

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,720
money and material desire?

84
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,119
But when I meet you now,

85
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,519
I eventually understand that

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,040
love exists.

87
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,440
Indeed, I'd never met it before.

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,720
Maybe this is how it feels
to love someone.

89
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,399
Xiaosu.

90
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:30,600
In this world,

91
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,640
it's easy to create relationships
between people,

92
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,119
but it's hard to produce feelings.

93
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,359
Because it's very hard to

94
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,799
find someone who is close to your heart.

95
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,799
Especially between men and women,

96
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,160
it's so complicated.

97
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,559
"Love once began,

98
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,040
will never end."

99
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,200
I start to understand that phrase now.

100
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:59,519
You asked me why I treated you well.

101
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,559
In fact,

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,040
it's hard for me to
give you a satisfactory answer.

103
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,959
This seems to

104
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,000
make sense.

105
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
But...

106
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,720
I am a particularly insecure person.

107
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,480
This is just the difference
between a man and a woman.

108
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,399
A woman always asks why.

109
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,040
But when a man

110
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,519
falls in love with a woman,

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
there is no reason.

112
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,000
Men and women are different, so what?

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,399
Regardless of men or women,

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,200
there's always a reason
to love each other.

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,480
Xiaosu, to be honest,

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
we had misunderstandings and prejudices

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
since we knew each other
from the very beginning.

118
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,679
But just because of this,

119
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,040
we are getting to
know each other better.

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,160
I got used to your presence.

121
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
It hurts me that you are sad.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,799
I'm happy that you're happy.

123
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,279
I can't help but want to
care for you, pamper you,

124
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,959
and do everything for you.

125
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,200
I've never done
what I did for you before.

126
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,959
Xiaosu, do you trust me?

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
Yes, I do.

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
And you?

129
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,320
Are you willing to give me an answer?

130
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,440
It's OK.

131
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,239
I know that
you need some time to consider.

132
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,760
I want to tell you that

133
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,679
I can wait.

134
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:52,559
Let's go. I'm sending you home.

135
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,679
Mr. An, have you noticed that

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,719
Yutian's stock

137
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,320
has been very strong recently?

138
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,719
The stock price has been climbing.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,760
The stock often reaches the limit up.

140
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,880
The trading volume of a week is

141
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,039
as much as that of a month in the past.

142
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
That's true.

143
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:19,320
In recent days,
many people have asked me

144
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,320
if Yutian has any big move.

145
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,960
Why does the money
keep flowing to our stock?

146
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,640
Maybe there is something hidden from us.

147
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,919
I think everyone would like to know

148
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,520
why did I go abroad

149
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,359
last week?

150
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,400
Yes,

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,080
I have been hiding
the details from everyone.

152
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Now, I can tell you.

153
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,320
Linton, president of
the famous listed group S.G.,

154
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,479
has arrived in Shanghai now.

155
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
At this time tomorrow,

156
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:57,880
S.G. will sign a contract
with the Yutian Group

157
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,280
in Bin Jiang Hotel

158
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,200
to create
the Entertainment Center project.

159
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,159
Yes.

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,359
After signing the contract,

161
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:07,200
the S.G. Group will invest
large amount of money into the project,

162
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,440
and work with us to build a new brand

163
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,159
in the field of global entertainment.

164
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Great!

165
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,799
The S.G. Group is a big financial group.

166
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
With its help,

167
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,159
our Entertainment Center Project

168
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,719
is no longer under financial pressure.

169
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,320
Yuzheng,

170
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,880
you really bring us

171
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,559
a big surprise.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,960
No wonder our stock

173
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,719
has been so hot lately.

174
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,719
Stock?

175
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,520
Mr. Lei,

176
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,320
here's the agreement

177
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,880
Mr. Linton just sent over.

178
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,239
Several details have been adjusted.

179
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,559
Please check soon.

180
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,760
Excuse me for my absence.

181
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,239
My son, just in time.

182
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,000
Help me check

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,640
which one is appropriate

184
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,119
at your signing ceremony.

185
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,200
Daddy,

186
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,919
you'd better not go.

187
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,520
Bin Jiang Hotel is far from our home,

188
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,640
and you just recover.

189
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,159
No need to be so tired.

190
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,799
I'm not tired,

191
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,559
because your cooperation with S.G.

192
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,919
makes me very happy.

193
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,000
Not to mention the Bin Jiang Hotel.

194
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:17,559
I will support you on site

195
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
even in a place much further away.

196
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,239
OK.

197
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,359
What? You think your father is too old

198
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,599
and will embarrass you

199
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,599
on such big occasion?

200
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,960
Of course not, daddy.

201
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:35,239
I think

202
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,960
this black suit looks better.

203
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,039
Daddy,

204
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,400
this tie

205
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,119
is very suitable for you.

206
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,039
Let's see.

207
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,080
My good boy.

208
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,679
Mr. Lei, it's eight o'clock now,

209
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,719
and we have to go.

210
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,960
Let's go.

211
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,359
Next,

212
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,000
we invite you all

213
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,799
to witness this great moment.

214
00:12:30,239 --> 00:12:32,760
Mr. Lei Yuzheng,
the president of the Yutian Group,

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,080
and Mr. Linton,
the president of the S.G. Group,

216
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,440
will sign the contract of

217
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,440
Universal Entertainment Center.

218
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,679
They will cooperate with
this great project sincerely.

219
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,640
Please.

220
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:15,640
Why did the police come?

221
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,119
Hello, Mr. Lei.

222
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,239
We suspect that you are involved in

223
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,479
a case of illegal trading.

224
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,799
Please come with us

225
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,479
and cooperate with the investigation.

226
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,280
Police comrade,

227
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,320
is there any misunderstanding?

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
We are holding the signing ceremony
of the Yutian Group today.

229
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
It's impossible that
Mr. Lei has any problem.

230
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,440
Mr. Lei, we received a report about you.

231
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:45,840
Please come with us.

232
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,919
Mr. Lei, what's going on?

233
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,359
I don't know.

234
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,119
Yuzheng, you can't go with them.

235
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:01,479
It's OK.

236
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,400
I will go with you.

237
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,479
Mr. Lei, you can't go.

238
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,359
You must be mistaken.

239
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,599
Qunfei, stop.

240
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,359
I dare go with them,

241
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,880
just because I am not guilty.

242
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
Please take care of my father
during this period.

243
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,520
Daddy, I'm going to make a statement

244
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,599
and will be back soon.

245
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,799
Yuzheng.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,880
- Mr. Lei.
- Yuzheng.

247
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Mr. Lei.

248
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,400
Uncle Lei, uncle Lei.

249
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,760
-Mr. Lei.
-Don't touch him.

250
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't touch him.

251
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:00,400
- Uncle Lei.
- Mr. Lei.

252
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:01,320
Call an ambulance!

253
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,840
-Unbutton his suit.
-Make a call quickly.

254
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,799
Hello, is that the Emergency Center?

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
Move!

256
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,200
Quickly, quickly.

257
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,479
Excuse me, please give way.

258
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,080
Be careful!

259
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,080
Take it slow and be careful.

260
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,599
Excuse me. The family must wait outside.

261
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,744
(Lei Yuzheng)

262
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,520
Oh my God.

263
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,479
These people all finally left.

264
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,080
These reporters chased me

265
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,719
and made my blood pressure raised.

266
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,840
Well, that's true.

267
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,840
The contract was about to be signed.

268
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,599
Suddenly,

269
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,919
it turned to a great disaster.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,960
What a nightmare.

271
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:00,479
What will we do about this?

272
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,280
Xiangyuan.

273
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,239
How's it going?

274
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,640
Xiangyuan, it's urgent.

275
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't hesitate in speech.

276
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,960
Say now.

277
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,599
I've asked around.

278
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,440
Someone took advantage of
the news of our cooperation with S.G.

279
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,159
to buy many stocks of Yutian

280
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:20,599
and maliciously overstock.

281
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,000
No way.

282
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,359
Except for Lei Yuzheng,

283
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,359
everyone just knew that

284
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,039
we are going to
sign contract with S.G. yesterday.

285
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:27,880
Yes.

286
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,159
But they all said that.

287
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,200
Nonsense,

288
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
Yuzheng would never do this.

289
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,239
Daddy, it's impossible.

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,159
Yes, Xiangyuan.

291
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,960
Lei Yuzheng

292
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,880
is not a rookie in the business.

293
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
He clearly knows what he can do
and what he can't do.

294
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,320
He is very clear about that.

295
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,719
To say the least,

296
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,159
even though he did that,

297
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,559
he would hide it completely

298
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,719
and never give any chance
of being threatened.

299
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,919
Xiangyuan,

300
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,400
you must be mistaken.

301
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:54,760
I was afraid I was wrong,

302
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,000
so I double-checked,

303
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,679
and it is absolutely true.

304
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,680
Mr. Jiang, this is a crime.

305
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,599
I really don't know
what Yuzheng is thinking.

306
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,439
He looks smart,

307
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,520
but how could he do such a silly thing.

308
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,599
No.

309
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,520
Yuzheng would never do this.

310
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,640
I will investigate by myself.

311
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,760
Fanlv.

312
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,079
Come back, Fanlv.

313
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
Mr. Lei, according to our investigation,

314
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,880
you plan to sign
the contract with S.G. today

315
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,920
for strategic cooperation, right?

316
00:17:37,479 --> 00:17:38,239
Yes.

317
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,119
But the evidences
provided by related parties show that

318
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,400
someone has known the news

319
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,839
of your cooperation with S.G.

320
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
before you sign the contract.

321
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,319
So, he bought a lot of stocks

322
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,640
to boost the stock trading volume and

323
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:48,800
maliciously increase the stock price.

324
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,359
That is to say, your company
is suspected of insider trading

325
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,719
and disrupting the stock market.

326
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,280
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,560
I'm not trying to pass the buck,

328
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:58,839
but I did just get back from overseas.

329
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,319
I haven't had time to notice

330
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
the anomaly in our stock.

331
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:05,119
Mr. Lei,

332
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,640
about this cooperation,

333
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,160
except you,

334
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,439
did anyone else know that?

335
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:10,280
Qunfei,

336
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,560
some investments are good for us

337
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,719
and some are not.

338
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,839
Lin Xiangyuan is a mercenary person,

339
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,280
and I'm afraid

340
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,680
the money he found can't be used.

341
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,760
But the Entertainment Center is spending
a lot of money every day.

342
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,119
I'm afraid
we're running out of available capital.

343
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,520
If this situation continues,

344
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,520
the capital chain will break.

345
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
So,

346
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,359
I will disclose to you today,

347
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,119
that our cooperation with S.G.
has been finalized.

348
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,439
We just have to sign the contract.

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,920
Mr. Lei,

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,160
did anyone come into your mind?

351
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,119
I want to know that,

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,280
in this case,

353
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,239
will there be

354
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,119
any legal consequences?

355
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,640
Non-public information was used
for insider trading.

356
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,119
In addition to the fine,

357
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,160
involved persons are liable for

358
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,920
certain legal responsibilities
in serious cases.

359
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,560
In very bad cases,

360
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,800
involved persons may be
sentenced to detention

361
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,040
or imprisonment.

362
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,319
Mr. Lei,

363
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,199
you are the principal
of the Yutian Group,

364
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,800
and also a public figure.

365
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,560
I think
you should be clear about the stake.

366
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,920
If you hide anything on purpose,

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,359
it will only harm yourself.

368
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,680
We just want to know

369
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,160
who else knew

370
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:14,280
your company has strategic cooperation
with S.G., besides you.

371
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,280
Besides me,

372
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,839
no one knows that.

00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,400
Doctor,

375
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,359
how is Mr. Lei doing?

376
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,839
The surgery was successful,

377
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,439
and the patient's life
is not in danger for now.

378
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,000
But...

379
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,280
Will he wake up

380
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,280
or when will he wake up,

381
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,800
we are not sure.

382
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Maybe,

383
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,520
he will never wake up in this life.

384
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:48,280
You need to be prepared for this.

385
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
You mean...

386
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,599
The patient has this disease
for a long time.

387
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,359
Once the disease recurs,
it can be very dangerous.

388
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,119
To be honest,
it's a great luck

389
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,479
to get his life back.

390
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,719
We can only do our best

391
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:07,000
and leave the rest to God.

392
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,560
Assistant He,

393
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,760
Mr. Jiang asked me to
take over for a while.

394
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,040
Go back to have a rest now.

395
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:23,239
I know that
you and Mr. Lei are close to each other,

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,520
but you need to take care of yourself.

397
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,239
I'm sorry for Mr. Lei this time.

398
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,119
I know that

399
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,839
what he did was for the capital of
the Entertainment Center Project.

400
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:30,359
Otherwise,

401
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:32,040
he would never
make such a stupid mistake.

402
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,920
What do you mean?

403
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,760
What stupid mistake?

404
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,000
You don't know that?

405
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:40,199
Mr. Lei was taken to
the police station,

406
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,319
because someone took advantage of

407
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,439
the news of our cooperation with S.G.

408
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,760
to buy stocks and sell short.

409
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,359
Think about that,
in addition to Mr. Lei,

410
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,119
who else knows our cooperation?

411
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,599
Someone must be trying to sell the stock
in his hand and borrow stock to sell.

412
00:20:48,719 --> 00:20:50,000
He wanted to
raise money for the company.

413
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,199
Nonsense!

414
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Who told you that?

415
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,560
This information was obtained by Mr. Lin
from the Public Security Bureau.

416
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,479
All people in the company knew that.

417
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,439
Is Lei Yuzheng going abroad
to talk about a big business?

418
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,920
He goes abroad to
talk with S.G. about cooperation.

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You...

420
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,359
Crab Roe Cake,

421
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:09,719
Toutiao Pastry,

422
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,000
and fermented bean curd.

423
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,839
Excuse me, foreigners do not
eat fermented bean curd.

424
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,880
It could be.

425
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,079
Maybe Professor Ohm likes it.

426
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:23,040
I'm going to call Lei Yuzheng,

427
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,199
and ask him
when will Professor Ohm go back.

428
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:27,319
(Lei Yuzheng)

429
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,160
Sorry,

430
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,479
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

431
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,520
Please…

432
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,420
(Lei Yuzheng)

433
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
(Lei Yuzheng)

434
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,400
Sorry,

435
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,839
the subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

436
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:48,880
What's wrong?

437
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,400
His phone is powered off.

438
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,280
Lei Yuzheng said that

439
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,079
he never turned off his phone.

440
00:22:10,719 --> 00:22:12,000
Qunfei, why do you come here?

441
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,040
What's up?

442
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,479
An upright man

443
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,199
isn't afraid of anything.

444
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,319
Did you do something bad?

445
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,839
You must be guilty.

446
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,000
Look at you.

447
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,839
You're kidding.

448
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,040
Let's go to my home.

449
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,239
We can talk while drinking.

450
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm not kidding you.

451
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,479
Answer me,

452
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,000
did you take advantage of the news

453
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,920
of our cooperation with S.G.
to set Mr. Lei up?

454
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,839
You deliberately disclosed
this news to someone.

455
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:38,800
What do you mean?

456
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,319
Don't play dumb with me.

457
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,239
In addition to Mr. Lei,

458
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,760
only I knew this news.

459
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,560
The day I got drunk and

460
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,040
spilt the beans,
and you heard that.

461
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,119
Otherwise,

462
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,880
except you,

463
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:56,079
could anyone else know that?

464
00:22:58,599 --> 00:22:59,640
Assistant He,

465
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,000
I think
you read too many detective novels.

466
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,160
You said I did this.

467
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,680
Do you have evidences?

468
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,880
I have no evidences.

469
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,479
Fine. Stop talking crap to me.

470
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,479
We'll talk tomorrow.

471
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:14,520
Lin Xiangyuan,
don't play dumb with me.

472
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,479
You've been planning this
for a long time.

473
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,359
I know that, Lin Xiangyuan,

474
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,319
you set a trap for me.

475
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,719
That day you got me drunk on purpose

476
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,520
to collect information from me, right?

477
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
How dare you beat me.

478
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,959
So what?

479
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,079
You forgot complaining of being hard up?

480
00:23:32,479 --> 00:23:34,599
You forget who lent you money
to buy a house?

481
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,160
I warn you.

482
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,079
Don't talk nonsense here.

483
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,040
Be careful I sue you for defamation.

484
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,680
You are so mean.

485
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,800
He Qunfei,

486
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,400
stop talking like this.

487
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,920
Who made the trouble?

488
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,800
I think you're clearer than me.

489
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,000
You beat me indiscriminately.

490
00:23:53,439 --> 00:23:54,599
Do you think you are right?

491
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,160
He Qunfei,

492
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,959
remember that

493
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,479
it's not me who set Lei Yuzheng up.

494
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:08,959
It's himself.

495
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,800
It was his ego
that got him into trouble.

496
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:35,239
Qunfei?

497
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,599
What's wrong with you?

498
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,400
Come on in.

499
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:44,560
What's wrong with you?

500
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:46,959
Are you foolish?

501
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,920
The rain is so heavy,

502
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,119
and you did not bring an umbrella.

503
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:51,719
Siqi,

504
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,640
dry him off.

505
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,560
Give it to me.

506
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,439
Squat down, you're too tall.

507
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,800
Qunfei, what's wrong with you?

508
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,959
What's wrong with him?
His is just so self-willed.

509
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,959
I have to take care of him
if he is sick.

510
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,680
Siqi,

511
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:12,839
return the deposit.

512
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:16,000
We will not buy the house.

513
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,800
What? What do you mean?

514
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:23,479
Are you playing a trick of having
yourself tortured to win my confidence?

515
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,839
The house is not a cabbage
in the vegetable market,

516
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,160
and you cannot return it at will.

517
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,000
What happened?

518
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,040
You've borrowed the money, right?

519
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,000
We have to return the money.

520
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,439
Why are you so stubborn?

521
00:25:41,719 --> 00:25:42,839
We can buy the house first,

522
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,640
and pay back the money slowly.

523
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,920
Are you silly?

524
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,680
Return the money!

525
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,319
Why are you yelling at me?

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,199
Siqi, calm down first.

527
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,680
Stop quarreling.

528
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,920
What happened? Qunfei.

529
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
In the daytime,

530
00:25:59,719 --> 00:26:02,520
Lei Yuzheng,
the president of the Yutian Group,

531
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,280
was taken away by the police
before he signed the contract with S.G.

532
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,000
It is reported that

533
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,439
Lei Yuzheng is suspected of

534
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,119
using undisclosed information
for profiteering.

535
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:10,760
The specific result will
depend on the legal decision.

536
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
According to the insiders,

537
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,599
this event will have an impact on

538
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,119
the Universal Entertainment Center
project of the Yutian Group.

539
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,400
It's my fault.

540
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:21,040
I spilt the beans

541
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,199
and got Mr. Lei in trouble.

542
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:26,520
Siqi,

543
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,280
Lin Xiangyuan gave me the money.

544
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,920
We can't take it.

545
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,000
Lin Xiangyuan?

546
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,280
You mean that
Lin Xiangyuan set Lei Yuzheng up?

547
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,880
I'm not sure.

548
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:42,400
What I know is I was drunk that day

549
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,119
and said a lot of things
I shouldn't have said.

550
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,599
OK.

551
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,079
I understand.

552
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,280
Daddy, what's going on?

553
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,800
Fanlv,

554
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,520
it's not that
I don't want to help Lei Yuzheng.

555
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,000
You see that,

556
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,359
I have made so many calls
and asked many people for help.

557
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,319
But all of them said it was troublesome.

558
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,479
What's troublesome about?

559
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:14,800
Just check the account from which

560
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,640
the stock money came.

561
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,599
It is an offshore account.

562
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,680
Even though Yuzheng did this,

563
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:25,319
he was not the only one
who did that.

564
00:27:25,439 --> 00:27:26,800
Why was he the only one
taken to the police?

565
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,760
Don't say childish words.

566
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,520
Maybe Lei Yuzheng was not the only one
who did this,

567
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,439
but it just happened to him.

568
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,800
I don't care.
Yuzheng must be fine.

569
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:39,000
Daddy, I beg you.

570
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,760
You must find a way to save him.

571
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,800
Fine, fine, fine.

572
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,239
I'll figure out.

573
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,719
You're worried about Lei Yuzheng.

574
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
I understand that.

575
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,040
After all, you were...

576
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,719
But now, you're the fiancée
of Xiangyuan.

577
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:57,239
This time,

578
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,719
just do what you can do,
and don't go too far.

579
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,880
Or Xiangyuan may mind you doing this.

580
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,199
Daddy,

581
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,119
in such a circumstance,

582
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,359
I'm not in the mood

583
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,359
for Lin Xiangyuan's feelings.

584
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,839
You've sent Qunfei back to his home?

585
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,359
Yes.

586
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,760
Lei Yuzheng is arrested now,

587
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,400
and Qunfei looks like
almost losing his soul.

588
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,920
We also lost our house.

589
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,520
How do you think

590
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,079
was the news disclosed?

591
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,359
I just know that

592
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,880
Lei Yuzheng would never do this.

593
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,079
I trust him.

594
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,359
I have to find a way to help him.

595
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:07,640
Fine.

596
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,800
Stop thinking about it anymore,
and go to bed earlier.

597
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:12,959
As long as I think about him

598
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,400
still in the detention house,

599
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,560
I'm distracted.

600
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,119
I want to know
how is he doing now.

601
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:47,839
Hello, Mr. Lei.

602
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,000
We suspect that you are involved

603
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,920
in a case of illegal trading.

604
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,160
Please come with us and

605
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,280
cooperate with the investigation.

606
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,439
Mr. Lei,

607
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,760
in addition to you, who else knew that

608
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:01,239
your company carries out
strategic cooperation with S.G.?

609
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,479
Non-public information was used
for insider trading.

610
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,079
In addition to the fine,
involved persons are liable for

611
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,839
certain legal responsibilities
in serious cases.

612
00:30:09,239 --> 00:30:10,479
In very bad cases,
involved persons may be

613
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,719
sentenced to detention

614
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,079
or imprisonment.

615
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:39,779
(Xie Li)

616
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,319
Xie Li,

617
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,439
what's the matter?

618
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,680
Bro,

619
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,719
such a breaking news about Lei Yuzheng.

620
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,119
Yes.

621
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,680
To be honest,
I didn't expect things

622
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,239
will turn out to become like this.

623
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,760
The police were so fast

624
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,199
and took Lei Yuzheng
to the police station without more ado.

625
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:58,839
Of course.

626
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,359
Such being the case,

627
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,560
it means that everything is providence.

628
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,680
Bad luck to Lei Yuzheng.

629
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,760
But a thing occurs to me.

630
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,079
He Qunfei

631
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,880
is loyal to Lei Yuzheng.

632
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,079
If he goes to the police

633
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:12,560
and says that he did all this...

634
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,040
You don't know Lei Yuzheng.

635
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,479
He is proud and arrogant.

636
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,719
He would never let someone else
take the blame.

637
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,400
Even though He Qunfei agrees,

638
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
he will never accept.

639
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,280
Now is the critical time.

640
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,199
We have to keep calm.

641
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:29,920
Don't gloat.

642
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,479
This is not that easy.

643
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,800
Mr. Lin, I'm still worried...

644
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,520
Keep in touch.

645
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,199
Mr. Lin...

646
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:34,959
That's all.

647
00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:54,300
(Du Xiaosu)

648
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,199
Hello, Mr. Lin.

649
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,719
Hi, my old classmate.

650
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,239
It's rare to receive your call.

651
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,439
May I buy you a cup of coffee?

652
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
Sure. I'll see you this afternoon.

653
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,460
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

654
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,479
Attorney Fang,

655
00:32:17,959 --> 00:32:19,719
is the situation not good for me now?

656
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,319
To be honest,

657
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,319
all the evidences point to you now.

658
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,079
In addition, you have admitted that

659
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,760
no one else knows about it.

660
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,599
So, the situation is not good for you.

661
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,199
It seems that

662
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,920
I'm definitely going to jail.

663
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,079
Mr. Lei, don't be discouraged.

664
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,000
We're working hard to find

665
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,359
evidences in your favor.

666
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,680
You don't have to comfort me.

667
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,800
We all understand clearly that,

668
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,079
regardless of the finding results,

669
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,000
I have a certain responsibility.

670
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,880
It's almost impossible to

671
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,199
hold me completely blameless.

672
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,520
I'm unreconciled.

673
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,599
But as long as Yutian survives,

674
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,640
I accept it.

675
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,280
Mr. Lei.

676
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
The Entertainment Center

677
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,680
is my father's greatest wish
in his life.

678
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,199
Everything must make way for this.

679
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,560
Yes, I believe you can find evidences,

680
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:18,800
but it takes time,

681
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,359
and the company also needs to
cooperate with the investigation.

682
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,160
I'm afraid of causing a big scandal,

683
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:25,439
which will definitely affect

684
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,920
the financing and progress
of the Entertainment Center Project.

685
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,319
I accept the result of this event.

686
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,479
As long as the reputation of
the Entertainment Center is maintained,

687
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:36,560
I would like to bear
all the responsibilities alone.

688
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,359
No, Mr. Lei.

689
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,719
Even if someone has to go to jail,

690
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,560
I will be the one.

691
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,719
No, Mr. Lei.

692
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,000
It's my fault,

693
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,400
my fault.

694
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,400
Qunfei,

695
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,119
I hope I was wrong,

696
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
but the result was as I expected.

697
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,839
Mr. Lei,

698
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,719
I was so silly.

699
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,439
I shouldn't have got drunk.

700
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,119
Mr. Lei,

701
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,639
you can scold me.

702
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,560
Go.

703
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,520
No,

704
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,719
Mr. Lei,

705
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,320
I'm going to
tell the truth to the police now.

706
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,399
It's me who should go to jail.

707
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:23,439
Qunfei.

708
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,439
Keep it down.

709
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,280
Don't waste your efforts.
It will not work.

710
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,959
This is the end.

711
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,360
But... Mr. Lei…

712
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,840
I've decided.

713
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
Do as I say.

714
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,879
How's my father doing?

715
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,000
The chairman is good.

716
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,199
Good.

717
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:04,760
He had a stroke before
and can't be stimulated.

718
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,840
Take care of him for me.

719
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,280
About me,

720
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,840
hide this from him as long as you can.

721
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,120
That's all.

722
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
I'm tired and leaving.

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,980
(Silence)

725
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,959
Attorney Fang,

726
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,520
is there really no way out?

727
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,080
As long as I can save Mr. Lei,

728
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,360
I can do anything.

729
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:56,399
Even if I have to
be in jail for eight or ten years,

730
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
I don't care.

731
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,639
I mean it.

732
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,000
Assistant He, calm down.

733
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,879
I understand your feelings now,

734
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,080
but the law is all about evidences.

735
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,280
We can't act impetuously.

736
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,000
Moreover,
it's my job to defend Mr. Lei.

737
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,199
I will do my best.

738
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,040
But...

739
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,239
You heard what Mr. Lei said.

740
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,800
We also need to
consider the overall situation.

741
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:24,040
You're right,

742
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,360
but Mr. Lei can't go to jail.

743
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,879
The longer this case lasts,

744
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,679
the greater the impact on the company.

745
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:35,159
No one can afford it.

746
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,919
I believe that
Mr. Lei takes all responsibilities

747
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,679
to make Yutian survive

748
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,959
and keep
the Entertainment Center project smooth.

749
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,959
He did this for the company

750
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,679
and for me,
a good-for-nothing subordinate.

751
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:53,520
But who can help him?

752
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,999
(Silence)

753
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,899
(Silence)

754
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:08,099
(Du Xiaosu: Qunfei, I'm gonna
meet with Lin Xiangyuan)

755
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:09,299
(Silence)

756
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:19,239
Xiaosu,

757
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,479
you came to me for Lei Yuzheng, right?

758
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,199
Why did you mention him?

759
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,439
I didn't come to you for him.

760
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:29,719
I just want to have a cup of coffee
with my old classmate. Is that OK?

761
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,479
You really surprised me today.

762
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:33,919
Did I?

763
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,800
I heard that you lent Qunfei a million
to buy a house.

764
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,080
It seems that
you've been flush with cash lately.

765
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,439
Yes, I got a windfall.

766
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,879
Windfall? What windfall?

767
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,439
I invested in a one-bedroom house,

768
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,760
the price of which was increased
after the opening of the metro station.

769
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,159
I sold it and earned a lot of money.

770
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,199
Isn't it a windfall?

771
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,520
This is what you're talking about?

772
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:01,159
What else?

773
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:04,120
Du Xiaosu,

774
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,479
I think you're weird today.

775
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,280
Why? Are you interested in
real estate investment?

776
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,959
No, I just casually ask.

777
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,159
By the way, about Lei Yuzheng...

778
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,320
You...

779
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,840
Do you think that
someone set him up on purpose?

780
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,840
Who knows?

781
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:31,239
So many rumors.

782
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,040
But I can tell you that

783
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,919
the things of Lei Yuzheng
have nothing to do with me.

784
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,520
Really?

785
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Assistant He.

786
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:55,679
Assistant He,

787
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,679
lending money to you
is my personal decision

788
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,959
and has nothing to do with others.

789
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:01,800
Why are you in such a hurry?

790
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,800
Qunfei, what are you doing here?

791
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Stand up.

792
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,239
Don't be like this.

793
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,439
It's my fault.

794
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,919
It's all my fault.

795
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,959
I beg you to save Mr. Lei.

796
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,439
You're making it hard for me.

797
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,800
I don't know who told you that

798
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:27,199
this event has something do to with me.

799
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,040
I have explained

800
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,840
all that should be explained.

801
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,080
I can't help with the other things.

802
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,679
Excuse me.

803
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,000
Lin Xiangyuan, you jerk.

804
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,760
He Qunfei.

805
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,040
He Qunfei, calm down.

806
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,320
Calm down.

807
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,159
Mr. Lin,

808
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,879
Lei Yuzheng was in big trouble
this time.

809
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,040
I'm afraid he won't be able to
stand up for a while.

810
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,639
I didn't expect this too.

811
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,040
I...

812
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,719
