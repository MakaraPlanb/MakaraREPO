16
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,839
I'm deeply sorry for the intrusion,

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,800
but a friend of mine in China,
whose major is architect,

18
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,039
she would love your autographed photo.

19
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,160
Can you do me a favor, please.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,160
Your wife?

21
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:51,559
Come on in.

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,800
I've decided to go with you to Shanghai.

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I don't know what to say. Thank you.

24
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,479
You know why I'm going to help you.

25
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,039
Because you remind me of myself

26
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,759
when I was young.

27
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,399
When I met my wife Anna,

28
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,080
I was in love with her at first sight.

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,399
Anna likes chocolate mousse,

30
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,279
so every day I bring it to her.

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
I couldn't bear to
see her disappointed.

32
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,639
So sometimes,
I would wait outside the pastry shop,

33
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,559
just begging the pastry chef to
make her another one.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,960
You remind me when I still have that

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,639
'If I don't achieve the goal,
I won't give up' spirit.

36
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,039
I can see you really like this girl.

37
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:52,320
I do.

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,039
And I hope she knows that
you got such pains for her.

39
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,679
And I hope you get her.

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
I've got your blessing.

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you very much, Professor Ohm.

42
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,559
What?

43
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:13,720
Yuzheng hasn't told you any of this?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,919
No.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,160
You should be very happy.

46
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,360
Yuzheng loves you,

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,839
just like I love Anna.

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,080
You need to treasure him.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
Speak of the devil.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,399
Welcome back.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,720
What's the secret talk?

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,959
That's a little secret.

53
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,519
A toast

54
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:48,040
to the Shanghai trial,
Shanghai architecture.

55
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,160
Thank you.

56
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:06,279
I'm very happy today.

57
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,679
Helping you

58
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,239
makes me happy too.

59
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,000
I want to know...

60
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,760
Why me?

61
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,480
I don't know why.

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
I just feel that

63
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,920
you are not like the others to me.

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,559
I don't know

65
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:36,200
when this feeling started.

66
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:41,760
But when I found that,

67
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,399
I was already deep in it.

68
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,320
But this feeling is kind of interesting.

69
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,079
Because even for me, Lei Yuzheng,
there's still something I can't control.

70
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,559
But…

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,880
It seems that I'm not that good.

72
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,440
You know what,

73
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,760
someone once told me that

74
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,559
you didn't understand love

75
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,600
because you'd never met it.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,640
At that time,

77
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,239
I was contemptuous of

78
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,480
this theory.

79
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,160
I even thought it was ridiculous.

80
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
Are there really
that many people in the world

81
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,239
who want to give their heart
to each other?

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
What is better than

83
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,720
money and material desire?

84
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,119
But when I meet you now,

85
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,519
I eventually understand that

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
love exists.

87
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,440
Indeed, I'd never met it before.

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,720
Maybe this is how it feels
to love someone.

89
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,399
Xiaosu.

90
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,600
In this world,

91
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
it's easy to create relationships
between people,

92
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,119
but it's hard to produce feelings.

93
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,359
Because it's very hard to

94
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,799
find someone who is close to your heart.

95
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,799
Especially between men and women,

96
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,160
it's so complicated.

97
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,559
"Love once begun,

98
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,040
will never end."

99
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,200
I start to understand that phrase now.

100
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,519
You asked me why I treated you well.

101
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,559
In fact,

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
it's hard for me to
give you a satisfactory answer.

103
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:33,959
This seems to

104
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,000
make sense.

105
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
But...

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,720
I am a particularly insecure person.

107
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,480
This is just the difference
between a man and a woman.

108
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,399
A woman always asks why.

109
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,040
But when a man

110
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,519
falls in love with a woman,

111
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
there is no reason.

112
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:00,000
Men and women are different, so what?

113
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,399
Regardless of men or women,

114
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,200
there's always a reason
to love each other.

115
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,480
Xiaosu, to be honest,

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,720
we had misunderstandings and prejudices

117
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,000
since we knew each other
from the very beginning.

118
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,679
But just because of this,

119
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:20,040
we are getting to
know each other better.

120
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
I got used to your presence.

121
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,440
It hurts me that you are sad.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,799
I'm happy that you're happy.

123
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,279
I can't help but want to
care for you, pamper you,

124
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:37,959
and do everything for you.

125
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,200
I've never done
what I did for you before.

126
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:46,959
Xiaosu, do you trust me?

127
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Yes, I do.

128
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,600
And you?

129
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,320
Are you willing to give me an answer?

130
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,440
It's OK.

131
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,239
I know that
you need some time to consider.

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,760
I want to tell you that

133
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:13,679
I can wait.

134
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,559
Let's go. I'm sending you home.

135
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:28,679
Mr. An, have you noticed that

136
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,719
Yutian's stock

137
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:32,320
has been very strong recently?

138
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,719
The stock price has been climbing.

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,760
The stock often reaches the limit up.

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,880
The trading volume of a week is

141
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,039
as much as that of a month in the past.

142
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,640
That's true.

143
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
In recent days,
many people have asked me

144
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,320
if Yutian has any big move.

145
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,960
Why does the money
keep flowing to our stock?

146
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,640
Maybe there is something hidden from us.

147
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,919
I think everyone would like to know

148
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,520
why did I go abroad

149
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,359
last week?

150
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,400
Yes,

151
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,080
I have been hiding
the details from everyone.

152
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
Now, I can tell you.

153
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,320
Linton, president of
the famous listed group S.G.,

154
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,479
has arrived in Shanghai now.

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,320
At this time tomorrow,

156
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,880
S.G. will sign a contract
with the Yutian Group

157
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,280
in Bin Jiang Hotel

158
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,200
to create
the Entertainment Center project.

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,159
Yes.

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,359
After signing the contract,

161
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,200
the S.G. Group will invest
large amount of money into the project,

162
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,440
and work with us to build a new brand

163
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,159
in the field of global entertainment.

164
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
Great!

165
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,799
The S.G. Group is a big financial group.

166
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,520
With its help,

167
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,159
our Entertainment Center Project

168
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:43,719
is no longer under financial pressure.

169
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,320
Yuzheng,

170
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,880
you really bring us

171
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,559
a big surprise.

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,960
No wonder our stock

173
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,719
has been so hot lately.

174
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,719
Stock?

175
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,520
Mr. Lei,

176
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,320
here's the agreement

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
Mr. Linton just sent over.

178
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,239
Several details have been adjusted.

179
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,559
Please check soon.

180
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,760
Excuse me for my absence.

181
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,239
My son, just in time.

182
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,000
Help me check

183
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,640
which one is appropriate

184
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,119
at your signing ceremony.

185
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,200
Daddy,

186
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,919
you'd better not go.

187
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,520
Bin Jiang Hotel is far from our home,

188
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,640
and you just recover.

189
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,159
No need to be so tired.

190
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,799
I'm not tired,

191
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,559
because your cooperation with S.G.

192
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,919
makes me very happy.

193
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,000
Not to mention the Bin Jiang Hotel.

194
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:42,559
I will support you on site

195
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,280
even in a place much further away.

196
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,239
OK.

197
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,359
What? You think your father is too old

198
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,599
and will embarrass you

199
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,599
on such big occasion?

200
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:56,960
Of course not, daddy.

201
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,239
I think

202
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,960
this black suit looks better.

203
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,039
Daddy,

204
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,400
this tie

205
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:11,119
is very suitable for you.

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,039
Let's see.

207
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,080
My good boy.

208
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,679
Mr. Lei, it's eight o'clock now,

209
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,719
and we have to go.

210
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,960
Let's go.

211
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,359
Next,

212
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,000
we invite you all

213
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,799
to witness this great moment.

214
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,760
Mr. Lei Yuzheng,
the president of the Yutian Group,

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,080
and Mr. Linton,
the president of the S.G. Group,

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,440
will sign the contract of

217
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,440
Universal Entertainment Center.

218
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,679
They will cooperate with
this great project sincerely.

219
00:12:05,719 --> 00:12:06,640
Please.

220
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:40,640
Why did the police come?

221
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,119
Hello, Mr. Lei.

222
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,239
We suspect that you are involved in

223
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,479
a case of illegal trading.

224
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,799
Please come with us

225
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,479
and cooperate with the investigation.

226
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,280
Police comrade,

227
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,320
is there any misunderstanding?

228
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,640
We are holding the signing ceremony
of the Yutian Group today.

229
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,000
It's impossible that
Mr. Lei has any problem.

230
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,440
Mr. Lei, we received a report about you.

231
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:10,840
Please come with us.

232
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,919
Mr. Lei, what's going on?

233
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,359
I don't know.

234
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,119
Yuzheng, you can't go with them.

235
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:26,479
It's OK.

236
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:31,400
I will go with you.

237
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,479
Mr. Lei, you can't go.

238
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,359
You must be mistaken.

239
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,599
Qunfei, stop.

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,359
I dare go with them,

241
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,880
just because I am not guilty.

242
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,960
Please take care of my father
during this period.

243
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,520
Daddy, I'm going to make a statement

244
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,599
and will be back soon.

245
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,799
Yuzheng.

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,880
- Mr. Lei
- Yuzheng

247
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,760
Mr. Lei.

248
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,400
Uncle Lei, uncle Lei.

249
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,760
-Mr. Lei.
-Don't touch him.

250
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't touch him.

251
00:14:24,119 --> 00:14:25,400
- Uncle Lei.
- Mr. Lei.

252
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:26,320
Call an ambulance!

253
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,840
-Unbutton his suit.
-Make a call quickly.

254
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,799
Hello, is that the Emergency Center?

255
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,520
Move!

256
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,200
Quickly, quickly.

257
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,479
Excuse me, please give way.

258
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,080
Be careful!

259
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:41,080
Take it slow and be careful.

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,599
Excuse me. The family must wait outside.

261
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,744
(Lei Yuzheng)

262
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,520
Oh my God.

263
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,479
These people all finally left.

264
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,080
These reporters chased me

265
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,719
and made my blood pressure raised.

266
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,840
Well, that's true.

267
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,840
The contract was about to be signed.

268
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,599
Suddenly,

269
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,919
it turned to a great disaster.

270
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,960
What a nightmare.

271
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,479
What will we do about this?

272
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,280
Xiangyuan.

273
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,239
How's it going?

274
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,640
Xiangyuan, it's urgent.

275
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,000
Don't hesitate in speech.

276
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,960
Say now.

277
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,599
I've asked around.

278
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,440
Someone took advantage of
the news of our cooperation with S.G.

279
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,159
to buy many stocks of Yutian

280
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,599
and maliciously overstock.

281
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,000
No way.

282
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,359
Except for Lei Yuzheng,

283
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,359
everyone just knew that

284
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,039
we are going to
sign contract with S.G. yesterday.

285
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:52,880
Yes.

286
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,159
But they all said that.

287
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,200
Nonsense,

288
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Yuzheng would never do this.

289
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,239
Daddy, it's impossible.

290
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,159
Yes, Xiangyuan.

291
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960
Lei Yuzheng

292
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,880
is not a rookie in the business.

293
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
He clearly knows what he can do
and what he can't do.

294
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,320
He is very clear about that.

295
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:09,719
To say the least,

296
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,159
even though he did that,

297
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:12,559
he would hide it completely

298
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,719
and never give any chance
of being threatened.

299
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,919
Xiangyuan,

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,400
you must be mistaken.

301
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:19,760
I was afraid I was wrong,

302
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
so I double-checked,

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,679
and it is absolutely true.

304
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,680
Mr. Jiang, this is a crime.

305
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,599
I really don't know
what Yuzheng is thinking.

306
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,439
He looks smart,

307
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,520
but how could he do such a silly thing.

308
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,599
No.

309
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
Yuzheng would never do this.

310
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,640
I will investigate by myself.

311
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:48,760
Fanlv.

312
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,079
Come back, Fanlv.

313
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,400
Mr. Lei, according to our investigation,

314
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:57,880
you plan to sign
the contract with S.G. today

315
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,920
for strategic cooperation, right?

316
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,239
Yes.

317
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,119
But the evidences
provided by related parties show that

318
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
someone has known the news

319
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,839
of your cooperation with S.G.

320
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
before you sign the contract.

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,319
So, he bought a lot of stocks

322
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
to boost the stock trading volume and

323
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,800
maliciously increase the stock price.

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,359
That is to say, your company
is suspected of insider trading

325
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,719
and disrupting the stock market.

326
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm sorry.

327
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,560
I'm not trying to pass the buck,

328
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,839
but I did just get back from overseas.

329
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,319
I haven't had time to notice

330
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,040
the anomaly in our stock.

331
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,119
Mr. Lei,

332
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,640
about this cooperation,

333
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,160
except you,

334
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,439
did anyone else know that?

335
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,280
Qunfei,

336
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,560
some investments are good for us

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,719
and some are not.

338
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,839
Lin Xiangyuan is a mercenary person,

339
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,280
and I'm afraid

340
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,680
the money he found can't be used.

341
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,760
But the Entertainment Center is spending
a lot of money every day.

342
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:47,119
I'm afraid
we're running out of available capital.

343
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:48,520
If this situation continues,

344
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:50,520
the capital chain will break.

345
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
So,

346
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,359
I will disclose to you today,

347
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,119
that our cooperation with S.G.
has been finalized.

348
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,439
We just have to sign the contract.

349
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,920
Mr. Lei,

350
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
did anyone come into your mind?

351
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,119
I want to know that,

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,280
in this case,

353
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,239
will there be

354
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,119
any legal consequences?

355
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,640
Non-public information was used
for insider trading.

356
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,119
In addition to the fine,

357
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,160
involved persons are liable for

358
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,920
certain legal responsibilities
in serious cases.

359
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,560
In very bad cases,

360
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,800
involved persons may be
sentenced to detention

361
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,040
or imprisonment.

362
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,319
Mr. Lei,

363
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,199
you are the principal
of the Yutian Group,

364
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,800
and also a public figure.

365
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,560
I think
you should be clear about the stake.

366
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,920
If you hide anything on purpose,

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,359
it will only harm yourself.

368
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:32,680
We just want to know

369
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,160
who else knew

370
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:39,280
your company has strategic cooperation
with S.G., besides you.

371
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,280
Besides me,

372
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,839
no one knows that.

00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:55,400
Doctor,

375
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,359
how is Mr. Lei doing?

376
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:58,839
The surgery was successful,

377
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,439
and the patient's life
is not in danger for now.

378
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,000
But...

379
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,280
Will he wake up

380
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,280
or when will he wake up,

381
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,800
we are not sure.

382
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Maybe,

383
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,520
he will never wake up in this life.

384
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,280
You need to be prepared for this.

385
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,760
You mean...

386
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,599
The patient has this disease
for a long time.

387
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,359
Once the disease recurs,
it can be very dangerous.

388
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,119
To be honest,
it's a great luck

389
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,479
to get his life back.

390
00:19:28,719 --> 00:19:30,719
We can only do our best

391
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,000
and leave the rest to God.

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,560
Assistant He,

393
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,760
Mr. Jiang asked me to
take over for a while.

394
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,040
Go back to have a rest now.

395
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:48,239
I know that
you and Mr. Lei are close to each other,

396
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,520
but you need to take care of yourself.

397
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:52,239
I'm sorry for Mr. Lei this time.

398
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,119
I know that

399
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,839
what he did was for the capital of
the Entertainment Center Project.

400
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:55,359
Otherwise,

401
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:57,040
he would never
make such a stupid mistake.

402
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
What do you mean?

403
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,760
What stupid mistake?

404
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,000
You don't know that?

405
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:05,199
Mr. Lei was taken to
the police station,

406
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,319
because someone took advantage of

407
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:07,439
the news of our cooperation with S.G.

408
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,760
to buy stocks and sell short.

409
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,359
Think about that,
in addition to Mr. Lei,

410
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:12,119
who else knows our cooperation?

411
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,599
Someone must be trying to sell the stock
in his hand and borrow stock to sell.

412
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,000
He wanted to
raise money for the company.

413
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,199
Nonsense!

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
Who told you that?

415
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,560
This information was obtained by Mr. Lin
from the Public Security Bureau.

416
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,479
All people in the company knew that.

417
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,439
Is Lei Yuzheng going abroad
to talk about a big business?

418
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,920
He goes abroad to
talk with S.G. about cooperation.

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You...

420
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,359
Crab Roe Cake,

421
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:34,719
Toutiao Pastry,

422
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,000
and fermented bean curd.

423
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,839
Excuse me, foreigners do not
eat fermented bean curd.

424
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:42,880
It could be.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,079
Maybe Professor Ohm likes it.

426
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm going to call Lei Yuzheng,

427
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,199
and ask him
when will Professor Ohm go back.

428
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,160
Sorry,

429
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,479
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

430
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,520
Please…

431
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,400
Sorry,

432
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,839
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

433
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:13,880
What's wrong?

434
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,400
His phone is powered off.

435
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,280
Lei Yuzheng said that

436
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,079
he never turned off his phone.

437
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:37,000
Qunfei, why do you come here?

438
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,040
What's up?

439
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,479
An upright man

440
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,199
isn't afraid of anything.

441
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,319
Did you do something bad?

442
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,839
You must be guilty.

443
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,000
Look at you.

444
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,839
You're kidding.

445
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,040
Let's go to my home.

446
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,239
We can talk while drinking.

447
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm not kidding you.

448
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,479
Answer me,

449
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,000
did you take advantage of the news

450
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,920
of our cooperation with S.G.
to set Mr. Lei up?

451
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,839
You deliberately disclosed
this news to someone.

452
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:03,800
What do you mean?

453
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,319
Don't play dumb with me.

454
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,239
In addition to Mr. Lei,

455
00:22:07,479 --> 00:22:09,760
only I knew this news.

456
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,560
The day I got drunk and

457
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:15,040
spilt the beans,
and you heard that.

458
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,119
Otherwise,

459
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,880
except you,

460
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,079
could anyone else know that?

461
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:24,640
Assistant He,

462
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,000
I think
you read too many detective novels.

463
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,160
You said I did this.

464
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,680
Do you have evidences?

465
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,880
I have no evidences.

466
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,479
Fine. Stop talking crap to me.

467
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,479
We'll talk tomorrow.

468
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,520
Lin Xiangyuan,
don't play dumb with me.

469
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:42,479
You've been planning this
for a long time.

470
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:45,359
I know that, Lin Xiangyuan,

471
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,319
you set a trap for me.

472
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,719
That day you got me drunk on purpose

473
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,520
to collect information from me, right?

474
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
How dare you beat me.

475
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,959
So what?

476
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:57,079
You forgot complaining of being hard up?

477
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:59,599
You forget who lent you money
to buy a house?

478
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,160
I warn you.

479
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,079
Don't talk nonsense here.

480
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:08,040
Be careful I sue you for defamation.

481
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,680
You are so mean.

482
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
He Qunfei,

483
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,400
stop talking like this.

484
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Who made the trouble?

485
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,800
I think you're clearer than me.

486
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,000
You beat me indiscriminately.

487
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,599
Do you think you are right?

488
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:26,160
He Qunfei,

489
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,959
remember that

490
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,479
it's not me who set Lei Yuzheng up.

491
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:33,959
It's himself.

492
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,800
It was his ego
that got him into trouble.

493
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:00,239
Qunfei?

494
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,599
What's wrong with you?

495
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,400
Come on in.

496
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,560
What's wrong with you?

497
00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:11,959
Are you foolish?

498
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,920
The rain is so heavy,

499
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,119
and you did not bring an umbrella.

500
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:16,719
Siqi,

501
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,640
dry him off.

502
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,560
Give it to me.

503
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,439
Squat down, you're too high.

504
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,800
Qunfei, what's wrong with you?

505
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,959
What's wrong with him?
His is just so self-willed.

506
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,959
I have to take care of him
if he is sick.

507
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:33,680
Siqi,

508
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,839
return the deposit.

509
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,000
We will not buy the house.

510
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,800
What? What do you mean?

511
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,479
Are you playing a trick of having
yourself tortured to win my confidence?

512
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,839
The house is not a cabbage
in the vegetable market,

513
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:51,160
and you cannot return it at will.

514
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,000
What happened?

515
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,040
You've borrowed the money, right?

516
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,000
We have to return the money.

517
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,439
Why are you so stubborn?

518
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:07,839
We can buy the house first,

519
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:09,640
and pay back the money slowly.

520
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,920
Are you silly?

521
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,680
Return the money!

522
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,319
Why are you yelling at me?

523
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,199
Siqi, calm down first.

524
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,680
Stop quarreling.

525
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,920
What happened? Qunfei.

526
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,640
In the daytime,

527
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:27,520
Lei Yuzheng,
the president of the Yutian Group,

528
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,280
was taken away by the police
before he signed the contract with S.G.

529
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,000
It is reported that

530
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,439
Lei Yuzheng is suspected of

531
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:33,119
using undisclosed information
for profiteering.

532
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,760
The specific result will
depend on the legal decision.

533
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
According to the insiders,

534
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,599
this event will have an impact on

535
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,119
the Universal Entertainment Center
project of the Yutian Group.

536
00:25:42,199 --> 00:25:43,400
It's my fault.

537
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:46,040
I spilt the beans

538
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,199
and got Mr. Lei in trouble.

539
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,520
Siqi,

540
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,280
Lin Xiangyuan gave me the money.

541
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,920
We can't take it.

542
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
Lin Xiangyuan?

543
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,280
You mean that
Lin Xiangyuan set Lei Yuzheng up?

544
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm not sure.

545
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,400
What I know is I was drunk that day

546
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,119
and said a lot of things
I shouldn't have said.

547
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,599
OK.

548
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,079
I understand.

549
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,280
Daddy, what's going on?

550
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Fanlv,

551
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,520
it's not that
I don't want to help Lei Yuzheng.

552
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,000
You see that,

553
00:26:30,199 --> 00:26:32,359
I have made so many calls
and asked many people for help.

554
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,319
But all of them said it was troublesome.

555
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,479
What's troublesome about?

556
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:39,800
Just check the account from which

557
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,640
the stock money came.

558
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,599
It is an offshore account.

559
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,680
Even though Yuzheng did this,

560
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:50,319
he was not the only one
who did that.

561
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,800
Why was he the only one
taken to the police?

562
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:53,760
Don't say childish words.

563
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,520
Maybe Lei Yuzheng was not the only one
who did this,

564
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,439
but it just happened to him.

565
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,800
I don't care.
Yuzheng must be fine.

566
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,000
Daddy, I beg you.

567
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,760
You must find a way to save him.

568
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,800
Fine, fine, fine.

569
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,239
I'll figure out.

570
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,719
You're worried about Lei Yuzheng.

571
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,760
I understand that.

572
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,040
After all, you were...

573
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,719
But now, you're the fiancée
of Xiangyuan.

574
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,239
This time,

575
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,719
just do what you can do,
and don't go too far.

576
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,880
Or Xiangyuan may mind you doing this.

577
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:29,199
Daddy,

578
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,119
in such a circumstance,

579
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,359
I'm not in the mood

580
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,359
for Lin Xiangyuan' feelings.

581
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:03,839
You've sent Qunfei back to his home?

582
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,359
Yes.

583
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,760
Lei Yuzheng is arrested now,

584
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,400
and Qunfei looks like
almost losing his soul.

585
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
We also lost our house.

586
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,520
How do you think

587
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,079
the news being disclosed?

588
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,359
I just know that

589
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,880
Lei Yuzheng would never do this.

590
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,079
I trust him.

591
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,359
I have to find a way to help him.

592
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,640
Fine.

593
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,800
Stop thinking about it anymore,
and go bed earlier.

594
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,959
As long as I think about him

595
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:39,400
still in the detention house,

596
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,560
I'm distracted.

597
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,119
I want to know
how is he doing now.

598
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:12,839
Hello, Mr. Lei.

599
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,000
We suspect that you are involved

600
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,920
in a case of illegal trading.

601
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,160
Please come with us and

602
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
cooperate with the investigation.

603
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,439
Mr. Lei,

604
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,760
in addition to you, who else knew that

605
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:26,239
your company carries out
strategic cooperation with S.G.?

606
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,479
Non-public information was used
for insider trading.

607
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,079
In addition to the fine,
involved persons are liable for

608
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,839
certain legal responsibilities
in serious cases.

609
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,479
In very bad cases,
involved persons may be

610
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:36,719
sentenced to detention

611
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,079
or imprisonment.

612
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:04,779
(Xie Li)

613
00:30:06,479 --> 00:30:07,319
Xie Li,

614
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,439
what's the matter?

615
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Bro,

616
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,719
such a breaking news about Lei Yuzheng.

617
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,119
Yes.

618
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:15,680
To be honest,
I didn't expect things

619
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,239
will turn out to become like this.

620
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,760
The police were so fast

621
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,199
and took Lei Yuzheng
to the police station without more ado.

622
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:23,839
Of course.

623
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,359
Such being the case,

624
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,560
it means that everything is providence.

625
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,680
Bad luck to Lei Yuzheng.

626
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,760
But a thing occurs to me.

627
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,079
He Qunfei

628
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,880
is loyal to Lei Yuzheng.

629
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,079
If he goes to the police

630
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,560
and says that he did all this...

631
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,040
You don't know Lei Yuzheng.

632
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,479
He is proud and arrogant.

633
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,719
He would never let someone else
take the blame.

634
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:47,400
Even though He Qunfei agrees,

635
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,000
he will never accept.

636
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,280
Now is the critical time.

637
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,199
We have to keep calm.

638
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:54,920
Don't gloat.

639
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,479
This is not that easy.

640
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,800
Mr. Lin, I'm still worried...

641
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,520
Keep in touch.

642
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,199
Mr. Lin...

643
00:30:59,199 --> 00:30:59,959
That's all.

644
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,199
Hello, Mr. Lin.

645
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,719
Hi, my old classmate.

646
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,239
It's rare to receive your call.

647
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,439
May I buy you a cup of coffee?

648
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,000
Sure. I'll see you this afternoon.

649
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,479
Attorney Fang,

650
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:44,719
is the situation not good for me now?

651
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,319
To be honest,

652
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,319
all the evidences point to you now.

653
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,079
In addition, you have admitted that

654
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,760
no one else knows about it.

655
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,599
So, the situation is not good for you.

656
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:58,199
It seems that

657
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,920
I'm definitely going to jail.

658
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,079
Mr. Lei, don't be discouraged.

659
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,000
We're working hard to find

660
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,359
evidences in your favor.

661
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,680
You don't have to comfort me.

662
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,800
We all understand clearly that,

663
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,079
regardless the finding results,

664
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,000
I have a certain responsibility.

665
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,880
It's almost impossible to

666
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,199
hold me completely blameless.

667
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,520
I'm unreconciled.

668
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:25,599
But as long as Yutian survives,

669
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,640
I accept it.

670
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,280
Mr. Lei.

671
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
The Entertainment Center

672
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,680
is my father's greatest wish
in his life.

673
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,199
Everything must make way for this.

674
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,560
Yes, I believe you can find evidences,

675
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:43,800
but it takes time,

676
00:32:44,839 --> 00:32:46,359
and the company also needs to
cooperate with the investigation.

677
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm afraid of causing a big scandal,

678
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,439
which will definitely affect

679
00:32:50,439 --> 00:32:51,920
the financing and progress
of the Entertainment Center Project.

680
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,319
I accept the result of this event.

681
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,479
As long as the reputation of
the Entertainment Center is maintained,

682
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:01,560
I would like to bear
all the responsibilities alone.

683
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,359
No, Mr. Lei.

684
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,719
Even if someone has to go to jail,

685
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,560
I will be the one.

686
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,719
No, Mr. Lei.

687
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
It's my fault,

688
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,400
my fault.

689
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,400
Qunfei,

690
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,119
I hope I was wrong,

691
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
but the result was as I expected.

692
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,839
Mr. Lei,

693
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,719
I was so silly.

694
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,439
I shouldn't have got drunk.

695
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,119
Mr. Lei,

696
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,639
you can scold me.

697
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,560
Go.

698
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,520
No,

699
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,719
Mr. Lei,

700
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,320
I'm going to
tell the truth to the police now.

701
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:47,399
It's me who should go to jail.

702
00:33:47,879 --> 00:33:48,439
Qunfei.

703
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,439
Keep it down.

704
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,280
Don't waste your efforts.
It will not work.

705
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,959
This is the end.

706
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
But... Mr. Lei…

707
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
I've decided.

708
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,560
Do as I say.

709
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,879
How's my father doing?

710
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,000
The chairman is good.

711
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,199
Good.

712
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,760
He had a stroke before
and can't be stimulated.

713
00:34:31,479 --> 00:34:32,840
Take care of him for me.

714
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
About me,

715
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,840
hide this from him as long as you can.

716
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,120
That's all.

717
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,760
I'm tired and leaving.

718
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,959
Attorney Fang,

719
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,520
is there really no way out?

720
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,080
As long as I can save Mr. Lei,

721
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,360
I can do anything.

722
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:21,399
Even if I have to
be in jail for eight or ten years,

723
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
I don't care.

724
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,639
I mean it.

725
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:26,000
Assistant He, calm down.

726
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,879
I understand your feelings now,

727
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,080
but the law is all about evidences.

728
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,280
We can't act impetuously.

729
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,000
Moreover,
it's my job to defend Mr. Lei.

730
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,199
I will do my best.

731
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,040
But...

732
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,239
You heard what Mr. Lei said.

733
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,800
We also need to
consider the overall situation.

734
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,040
You're right,

735
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:52,360
but Mr. Lei can't go to jail.

736
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,879
The longer this case lasts,

737
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,679
the greater the impact on the company.

738
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:00,159
No one can afford it.

739
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:03,919
I believe that
Mr. Lei takes all responsibilities

740
00:36:04,959 --> 00:36:06,679
to make Yutian survive

741
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,959
and keep
the Entertainment Center project smooth.

742
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,959
He did this for the company

743
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,679
and for me,
a good-for-nothing subordinate.

744
00:36:16,919 --> 00:36:18,520
But who can help him?

745
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,239
Xiaosu,

746
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,479
you came to me for Lei Yuzheng, right?

747
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,199
Why did you mention him?

748
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,439
I didn't come to you for him.

749
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:54,719
I just want to have a cup of coffee
with my old classmate. Is that OK?

750
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,479
You really surprised me today.

751
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,919
Did I?

752
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:02,800
I heard that you lent Qunfei a million
to buy a house.

753
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:05,080
It seems that
you've been flush with cash lately.

754
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,439
Yes, I got a windfall.

755
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,879
Windfall? What windfall?

756
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,439
I invested in a one-bedroom house,

757
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,760
the price of which was increased
after the opening of the metro station.

758
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,159
I sold it and earned a lot of money.

759
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,199
Isn't it a windfall?

760
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,520
This is what you're talking about?

761
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,159
What else?

762
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,120
Du Xiaosu,

763
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,479
I think you're weird today.

764
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,280
Why? Are you interested in
real estate investment?

765
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,959
No, I just casually ask.

766
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,159
By the way, about Lei Yuzheng...

767
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,320
You...

768
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:48,840
Do you think that
someone set him up on purpose?

769
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,840
Who knows?

770
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,239
So many rumors.

771
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,040
But I can tell you that

772
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,919
the things of Lei Yuzheng
have nothing to do with me.

773
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:01,520
Really?

774
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
Assistant He.

775
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,679
Assistant He,

776
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,679
lending money to you
is my personal decision

777
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,959
and has nothing to do with others.

778
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:26,800
Why are you in such a hurry?

779
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,800
Qunfei, what are you doing here?

780
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
Stand up.

781
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,239
Don't be like this.

782
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,439
It‘s my fault.

783
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,919
It's all my fault.

784
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,959
I beg you to save Mr. Lei.

785
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,439
You're making it hard for me.

786
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:49,800
I don't know who told you that

787
00:38:49,919 --> 00:38:52,199
this event has something do to with me.

788
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,040
I have explained

789
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,840
all that should be explained.

790
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:59,080
I can't help with the other things.

791
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,679
Excuse me.

792
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,000
Lin Xiangyuan, you jerk.

793
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,760
He Qunfei.

794
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,040
He Qunfei, calm down.

795
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,320
Calm down.

796
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,159
Mr. Lin,

797
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,879
Lei Yuzheng was in big trouble
this time.

798
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,040
I'm afraid he won't be able to
stand up for a while.

799
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,639
I didn't expect this too.

800
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,040
I...

801
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:33,719
