18
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,119
Did you go out with Dr. Shao?

I am talking to you!

Here it is.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,279
I asked her out for dinner today.

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
But she didn't show up.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,360
She didn't answer the call
or even reply WeChat.

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,080
I've been worrying about her.

40
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,520
Well...

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
Would you like to come up?

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
I'll wake her up.

43
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:33,160
No, no.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,279
Let her sleep.

45
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,199
Thank you.

46
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,960

Du Xiaosu,

48
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,440
I've sent

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,759
your Dr. Shao away.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
He said he was waiting you for dinner.

51
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,479
You didn't show up.

52
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:53,160
And you didn't answer the call.

53
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,960
He was worried about you.
So he came to check on you.

54
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,800
I think you need to stop being stubborn.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,839
Dr. Shao is pretty nice to you.

56
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,919
He's nice guy, don't be silly, Ok?

57
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Why are you here?

58
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:22,559
What do you think?

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,679
You didn't answer my call,
no reply for WeChat neither.

Except to see you on your way to work,

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,359
what else can I do?

62
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:32,640
I have something to talk to you.

63
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,040
I'm going to work now.

64
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,559
Isn't this Xiaosu's boyfriend?

65
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:37,799
Having a fight.

66
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,720
Tell me what happened!

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,839
Why do you avoid me all of a sudden?

68
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,720
Don't do this! It's time to work!

69
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,279
There are so many colleagues around.

70
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,239

72

It's not convenient to talk here.

73
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Then let's talk in the car!

74
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,359

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,399

Xiaosu, are you not feeling well?

81
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,040
Xiaosu, just tell me what happened!

If it's nothing,
why are you hiding from me?

86
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,839

why you're hiding from me!

00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:22,119
is not in service at the moment.

189
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,679
Please try again later.

190
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:29,880
Mr. Lei,

191
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:30,559
if it's ok to schedule the meeting

192
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,039
with Planning Department at 4 p.m.?

193
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,359
Postpone the meeting for now.

194
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,760
I need go out now.

195
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,719
OK.

196
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,500
(Shao Zhenrong)

197
00:13:58,699 --> 00:13:59,919
(End Call)

198
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,320
I've only been in love
with him all along!

199
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,479
Shao Zhenrong, in my heart,

200
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,119
you've been nothing!

201
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,559
You're just substitute for him

202
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,400
when I'm lonely,

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,719
a shadow of him.

204
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,039
Brother, here you are.

205
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,960
In this world,

206
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,719
you're the only one who knows I'm here.

207
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:15,200
Had a fight?

208
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,159
You broke up?

209
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:24,440
Am I useless?

210
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,679
Is it her decision?

211
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,799
Why did she wanna break up?

212
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,599
Any reason?

213
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Brother.

214
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,440
You were right.

215
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,119
Probably I don't really know women.

216
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,119
I'm asking you why.

217
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,679
She said

218
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,400
I wasn't the one she loved.

219
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,080
It was her ex-boyfriend.

220
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,799
I'm just her spare.

221
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,679
Did she really say that?

222
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,280
I feel like she's lying to me, too.

223
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,159
I know her. She's not like that!

224
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,919
She must be hiding something from me!

225
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,719
But why didn't she just tell me?

226
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,919
She didn't answer my call,

227
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,760
and she broke up with me when I met her.

228
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:25,679
It must be because I'm too busy

229
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,679
to care about her.

230
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,440
Zhenrong,

231
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,760
she broke up with you,

232
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,280
and you're still excusing her!

233
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,440
She's back to her ex.

234
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,119
You're free again.

235
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:44,960
You two are even.

236
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,280
But I love her!

237
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I've never loved anyone so much.

238
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,000
What's good about Du Xiaosu?

239
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,799
Is it worth dying for her?

240
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,760
Yes!

241
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,319
I know,

242
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,800
I'm not in position to say this,

243
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,839
but Du Xiaosu,

244
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,319
actually you don't know her at all!

245
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
She's not as simple as you think.

246
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,839
Do you know that she is actually...

247
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Never mind.

248
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:30,839
The way I see it,

249
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,599
it's not bad for you to break up.

250
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,680
Bro, I'm leaving for Yunnan.

251
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,280
Are you going to Yunnan?

252
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:47,239
Zhenrong,

253
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,760
some things can't be solved

254
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,640
by escaping like you do...

255
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,079
Brother, it's not like what you think.

256
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,439
It is our hospital that in Yunnan has

257
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,400
a long-term partner hospital down there.

258
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:03,719
Every year our medical team

259
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,079
will organize a free clinic.

260
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,400
I signed up for it months ago.

261
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,239
I was supposed to leave next month.

262
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,199
Now they need extra hands over there.

263
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,359
So,

264
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,560
I wanna start off early.

265
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,400
Brother.

266
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,800
When we get old,

267
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,079
can we still drink and talk
under this banyan?

268
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,400
Of course.

269
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,439
Why? Are you gonna leave me behind?

270
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,560
Me?

271
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,359
Are you kidding me?

272
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:44,160
You're the one to leave me behind!

273
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,319
We don't know

274
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,079
what Yutian is gonna be like.

275
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,479
You must be too busy to remember me.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Shut up!

277
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,040
We are brothers for lifetime.

278
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,520
A lifetime brother.

279
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,000
Mom.

280
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,400
Zhenrong,

281
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,920
why are you so late?

282
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
You had a drink?

283
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll ask Mrs. Zhao to
make you a sober soup.

284
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,719
No, no need, mom.

285
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,199
I'm just tired.

286
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,640
You go sleep first.

287
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,479
I wanna sit here for a little while.

288
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,040
Zhenrong,

289
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,839
recently,

290
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:44,640
have you met with Miss Du?

291
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
We broke up.

292
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
She asked for it?

293
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,719
Well...

294
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,199
Did she tell you why?

295
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,280
But I always feel that

296
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,439
she must be hiding something from me.

297
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,079
Actually our life is pretty long.

298
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,239
To experience the on-off

299
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,839
is inevitable.

300
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,800
But I don't wanna give up so easily.

301
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,640
I think

302
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm gonna insist on it.

303
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,520
Insist on what?

304
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,079
Some things

305
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:27,079
don't work out
just because you insist on them.

306
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,640
How about I marry you?

307
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,520
OK.

308
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,439
You said yes!

309
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,839
You said you're gonna marry me.

310
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,800
From now on,

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
Shao Zhenrong belongs to Du Xiaosu.

312
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:32,199
I really don't understand.

313
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,199
Are you natural enemy with Mr. Lei?

314
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:37,439
You two never stop...

315
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
Mr. Lei,

316
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,680
are you looking for me?

317
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,000
Miss Du,

318
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:04,520
I wanted to meet you somewhere else,

319
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,319
but here is more private.

320
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,400
I guess Miss Du

321
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,239
won't like others know we meet.

322
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,959
Strange to say,

323
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:24,680
I always thought the one unlucky in love

324
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:25,959
is my stupid brother.

325
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Miss Du,

326
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,000
you don't look that good.

327
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,239
Are you also feeling trapped?

328
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,400
Mr. Lei,

329
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,280
if you wanna say something, just say it.

330
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
Miss Du,

331
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:43,760
I obviously underestimated
your importance to him.

332
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:48,640
For the first time over years,
I saw him so sad.

333
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,199
What's the reason?

334
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,239
I think he has already told you.

335
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:57,359
I

336
00:22:59,079 --> 00:22:59,959
don't love him anymore.

337
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
You don't love him?

338
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you still remember our conversation
a few days ago?

339
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,199
I have warned you!

340
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,400
Now you've got what you want,

341
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,640
you should cherish it.

342
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:19,359
You also told me honestly you loved him.

343
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,520
Even if you have to give up everything,
you won't give up on him!

344
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,119
Now you're telling me that
you don't love him anymore!

345
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,599
Miss Du,

346
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,040
your promise

347
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,040
is really worthless!

348
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,520
How can you forget

349
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,479
the words you just said?

350
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,319
Mr. Lei,

351
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,400
my love is none of your business.

352
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,640
Right.

353
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:45,239
It's none of my business.

354
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:48,680
But Miss Du,

355
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,199
let me tell you something.

356
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,079
Since the childhood,

357
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,000
Zhenrong is like a family to me.

358
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,680
No one dares to bully him
as long as I'm around.

359
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,079
In other words,

360
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,719
If he is well, I will be well.

361
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,119
If someone makes him suffer,

362
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
I will make someone suffer.

363
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:19,800
If you see me today

364
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,119
is for Zhenrong,

365
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,000
please feel free to scold me.

366
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:27,959
Scold you?

367
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,920
Miss Du, it seems that

368
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,439
you really overestimated yourself.

369
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,640
I suggest you

370
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,839
to make up a better story next time.

371
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,920
Because Miss Du is not a woman

372
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:39,239
with deep feeling of love.

373
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,640
Besides,

374
00:24:50,439 --> 00:24:52,680
you don't have ex-boyfriend, do you?

375
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,920
You just have a richer man,

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,959
and you wanna kick Zhenrong away.

377
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,599
Think as you like.

378
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,640
I know I've hurt Zhenrong.

379
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,439
But...

380
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
But what?

381
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,359
You wanna tell me you have your reasons.

382
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,479
Miss Du, I'm very curious

383
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,680
what kind of ex-boyfriend

384
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:17,359
can make you

385
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,839
so difficult

386
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,719
to forget?

387
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,839
To be honest,

388
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,959
you're more than welcome
to break up with Zhenrong.

389
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,239
Because you don't deserve him at all!

390
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,160
But since he doesn't wanna break up,

391
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,119
I suggest you

392
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,439
don't send him away with only few words.

393
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,359
I'm gonna warn you again!

394
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,920
You'd better go back to him!

395
00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:42,199
Don't make yourself suffer.

396
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
If that's the case,

397
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,439
I can quit right away!

398
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,000
Quit?

399
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
Quit is the least of your worries!

400
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
Du Xiaosu,

401
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,439
believe it or not,

402
00:25:58,479 --> 00:25:59,959
I can make you out of the business.

403
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,680
I have a story

404
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,920
which is exactly about how fish
turned into the dragon.

405
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,520
Miss Du,

406
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:15,160
are you interested?

407
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,680
Of course.

408
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,760
Three decades ago,

409
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:21,439
when I was as young as you,

410
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,880
like all the girls,

411
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,839
I had a beautiful vision of love.

412
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:29,079
I met my first man in my life.

413
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,199
He was a fine-looking man,

414
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,520
and took good care of me.

415
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,040
We fell in love.

416
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:36,119
I thought

417
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:38,319
I was the happiest one in the world.

418
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,319
But I was so stupid.

419
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,800
I wanted to be with him forever.

420
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,079
However,

421
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,479
he

422
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,400
destroyed everything by himself.

423
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,479
Who

424
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,079
is that man?

425
00:27:01,719 --> 00:27:02,680
Du Maokai.

426
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,079
Your father.

427
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,239
Miss Du,

428
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,959
maybe you're a very nice girl.

429
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:13,800
But I totally can't accept that

430
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,280
you're with Zhenrong.

431
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:16,640
It's not even possible to

432
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,040
accept you as part of our family.

433
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,439
If you were as

434
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,359
wishful thinking as me,

435
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,680
but with disappointment
and betrayal at the end,

436
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,920
can you just let it go?

437
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,239
If I accept you,

438
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,719
that means

439
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,040
everyday

440
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,640
I will be reminded of

441
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,680
my past with your father.

442
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Miss Du,

443
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,520
you father owes me.

444
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,800
Do you still want to torture me?

445
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,800
My Zhenrong is a filial son.

446
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,599
Do you want him

447
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,000
to be our dilemma?

448
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,239
Leaving him

449
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920
is your only choice.

I was almost gonna call 110!

473
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:55,640
I was so worried.

474
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,119
I broke up with Zhenrong,

475
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
and

476
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm going to resign.

477
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,479
Are you really stupid or not?

478
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,839
Is it still Stone Age?

479
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,079
Your love is still up to his mother?

480
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,199
If you were me,

481
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,160
what would you do?

482
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,239
It would be simple if I were you.

483
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,079
I won't act like a coward like you.

484
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,280
I‘ll tell him straight away.

485
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,160
Tell him?

486
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,599
Yes.

487
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,040
If he loves you,

488
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,040
he'll definitely talk to his mother.

489
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
But if he gives you up for his mother,

490
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,319
that means he doesn't love you much.

491
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,160
It's just...Xiaosu...

492
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,920
You broke up with him
with no clear thinking.

493
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,160
You don't give him an explanation

494
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,239
and a reason.

495
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
It's torturing him,

496
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,400
and it's torturing you at the same time.

497
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,160
Xiaosu, I have to tell you,

498
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,520
what you're doing now

499
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,680
is escaping.

500
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,959
Besides,

501
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,640
you shouldn't take away
his right to choose.

502
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:15,199
Dad,

503
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,959
the doctor said that

504
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,160
your condition

505
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:19,359
has been more stable now.

506
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,640
But you still have to rest assured.

507
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,920
Pay more attention.

508
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,439
The most concerned of your sickness

509
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,920
is the recurrence.

510
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
I was fine actually.

511
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,400
It's all because of you!

512
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
Be oversensitive to

513
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,920
every little thing.

514
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Am I?

515
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,599
If you are really healthy and strong,

516
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,640
I must say,

517
00:32:37,719 --> 00:32:39,400
I don't need to take care of
the company, do I?

518
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:40,560
How dare you!

519
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
If you dare to leave,

520
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,439
I‘m going back to the hospital tomorrow!

521
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,599
You silly boy!

522
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,199
Don't even think of escape!

523
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,160
Especially

524
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,560
the project of the Entertainment Center!

525
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,359
Dad,

526
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,479
I just want to talk to you about it.

527
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,160
I've studied that project thoroughly,

528
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:02,239
and I also visited the site.

529
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,640
My instinct tells me

530
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,319
there's something wrong here.

531
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,079
What's the problem?

532
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,640
I'm worried that

533
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,520
the ownership of the land is not clear.

534
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,520
It could be like a time bomb.

535
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,479
You know

536
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,880
what to be concerned the most

537
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,800
is when the project is halfway through,

538
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,439
something happened out of nowhere.

539
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,199
By then, we will have no help,

540
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,439
and have nothing.

541
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,719
Well,

542
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,439
your Uncle Jiang came to
see me yesterday,

543
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,760
he already told me.

544
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,839
He said he's working on it.

545
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,959
It will be alright.

546
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,040
Has he already told you?

547
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,479
Good, fast enough.

548
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
I guess he's already figured out

549
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,359
that I'll be telling you on him.

550
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,439
He came to let you know first,

551
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,680
and ask you to put pressure on me.

552
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,959
What are you talking about?

553
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,199
I've spent half my life in the business,

554
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:58,719
and cannot tell who is
loyal or treacherous?

555
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:00,959
I didn't mean that.

556
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,520
Let's not talk about this.

557
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,199
Just get the project started right away!

558
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,959
Yuzheng,

559
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,919
you misunderstood your Uncle Jiang.

560
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,199
Such a big project!

561
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,919
He could've done it by himself.

562
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:19,600
But he insists on giving you
and Lin Xiangyuan a chance.

563
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,639
This is the opportunity

564
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,760
for you to make your own name!

565
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,120
You should be broad-minded,

566
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,639
watch and learn, my son.

567
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,159
Tell me if you are wronged.

568
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,320
You know,

569
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:45,159
my Zhenrong is a filial son.

570
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,399
Do you want him

571
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,639
to be our dilemma?

572
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,399
Leaving him

573
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,000
is your only choice.

574
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,159
Xiaosu.

575
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,560
Yuzheng,

576
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,600
when you used to do your own business,

577
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:17,959
you never went out with me.

578
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:20,840
Now you're in charge of Yutian,

579
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:23,239
your social life is becoming more active.

580
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah,

581
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:26,479
it's my father's business after all.

582
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,879
I have to be positive.

583
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:36,840
Why?

584
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,959
Nothing. Right,

585
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,479
something just came to my mind.

586
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,520
You go first.

587
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,320
When I'm done,

588
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:44,479
I'll come to you.

589
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,719
Let's go.

590
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,120
Did you drink?

591
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,919
It's none of your business.

592
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,399
I'm off the work now.

593
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Leave me alone!

594
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,280
Have you made the decision yet?

595
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,639
When are you gonna get back to Zhenrong?

596
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,159
Am I not clear enough?

597
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,479
It's not possible for us!

598
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,040
Why can't you understand?

599
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,719
Who's crazy? You or me?

600
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:45,000
No, it's both of us!

601
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,840
Du Xiaosu!

602
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,439
What makes you think so?

603
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,479
Why take advantage of
someone's trust in you?

604
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,639
Zhenrong loved you with all his heart.

605
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
But you,

606
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,959
not only don't appreciate,

607
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,959
also destroy his love!

608
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,479
What do you want from me?

609
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:07,120
What can I do?

610
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,679
You tell me!

611
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,040
Do you think I want him to suffer?

612
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,399
Do you think I want to hurt him?

613
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,399
Would I wanna see him suffer?

614
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,360
Wouldn't you?

615
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,040
You'd rather come to bar for a drink

616
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,320
than meeting him.

617
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,959
Why?

618
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,719
Miss Du is feeling sad.

619
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,800
I think you're crying for joy.

620
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,439
To celebrate getting rid of him.

621
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,600
Yes!

622
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,639
You're right.

623
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm crying for joy.

624
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,639
It's my fault.

625
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,280
Everything is my fault.

626
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,600
I shouldn't have broken into your life.

627
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,919
I spared Shao Zhenrong.

628
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,919
Should you let me go, too?

629
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,280
Mr. Lei,

630
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,840
it will be no good end if not fit.

631
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:23,080
Mr. Lei, don't you understand?

632
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,199
Taxi!

633
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,719
Go straight, please.

634
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:56,239
Dr. Shao! Dr. Shao!

635
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:01,959
Dr. Shao,

636
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,159
I heard that you joined
the medical team to Yunnan.

637
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,600
Then we won't see you
for very long time.

638
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,479
I suppose so.

639
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,600
Well, Dr. Shao,

640
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,040
wish you a good journey.

641
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,040
Thank you.

642
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:43,199
Where is my bag?

643
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,399
Dr. Shao is off the work.

644
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:54,879
Bye.

645
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:55,800
Bye.

646
00:39:58,639 --> 00:39:59,719
Have a rest early.

647
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,000
OK, bye. See you tomorrow.

648
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,919
Bye.

649
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,719
Hello.

650
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,320
Xiaosu.

651
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:12,239
Miss Du Xiaosu's bag

652
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,040
was left in my car.

653
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,120
Can you find her?

654
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:17,479
You're looking for Du Xiaosu?

655
00:40:31,959 --> 00:40:33,080
Siqi.

656
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,679
I left my bag in the car.

657
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,239
I can't get in.
