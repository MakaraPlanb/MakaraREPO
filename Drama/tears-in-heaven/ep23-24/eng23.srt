Get married?

17
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:05,839
Really?

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,680
Yes.

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,960
We just discussed it today.

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,960
Such good news.

21
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,759
I didn't expect my baby girl

22
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,199
to figure it out so quickly.

23
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,759
Mr. Jiang,
I have another good news for you.

24
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
You will be a grandfather.

25
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
Fanlv, is that true?

26
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,279
Great!

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,759
By the way, Xiangyuan,

28
00:02:34,839 --> 00:02:36,240
you should get your mother here

29
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,960
as soon as possible.

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,639
Fanlv is pregnant.

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
We should discuss

32
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,919
the wedding and arrange it soon.

33
00:02:44,119 --> 00:02:46,240
OK. I'll inform them right away.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,320
I have determined the hotel,

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,559
the best hotel in Shanghai,
Binjiang Hotel.

36
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,520
In addition to friends,

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,080
I will invite business partners.

38
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,800
Yes, invite all of them.

39
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,600
It is a great occasion for the Jiang's
to marry our girl.

40
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,199
We have to organize a large wedding.

41
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,800
Mr. Jiang,
that's what I'm thinking too.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,039
Don't worry.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,600
I will hold a grand wedding for Fanlv.

44
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:20,600
So, your father is not in good health.

45
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,880
I understand your feelings now.

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,919
If your father is not present,

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,320
who will be in charge of Yutian?

48
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,960
The rival.

49
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:36,080
The one who set you up here, right?

50
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,119
Maybe.

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,199
It seems that you want to
give up a rook to save the king.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Just like the pieces in your hand.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,399
When you hold them in your hand,

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,759
they seem useless.

55
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
But when you put them on the chessboard,

56
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,360
they will play their roles.

57
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,800
No matter you
give up a rook to save the king,

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,360
or the opposite,

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
there will be sacrifice.

60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,039
Playing chess is the same as
being a human being.

61
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,479
There are losses and wins.

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,479
The cumulative number of losses

63
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,639
may lead to the final win.

64
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,959
Miss Jiang, these wedding rings
are selected by Mr. Lin.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,359
Please have a look.

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,720
You can select a ring you like.

67
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:33,040
Miss Jiang, please take a look.

68
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
These three wedding dresses are
the most popular ones we have this year.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,079
Is there any one you like?

70
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,720
Do you need a reservation?

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,399
Mom,

72
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,519
I have good news for you.

73
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm going to get married.

74
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,160
Of course, it's true.

75
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,959
Get ready to

76
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,359
come to Shanghai in the next few days.

77
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,239
Mr. Wei,

78
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,559
hello, this is Lin.

79
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,119
What? You already knew?

80
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,440
This is Xiangyuan,

81
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,839
and I'm going to get married.

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,279
I will definitely share his work

83
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,200
in the future,

84
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,239
and our business will be smoother.

85
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,119
Miss Jiang,

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,720
this is our most popular bouquet
of the year.

87
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,720
Are you satisfied with that?

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,519
Mr. Lin thought...

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,440
Enough! Get out.

90
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,880
I want to be alone for a while.

91
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,420
(Lin Xiangyuan)

92
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,239
Lin Xiangyuan, go to my father's office.

93
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:30,720
I want to talk to you.

94
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,799
Cancel the wedding?

95
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,000
It seems that
Miss Jiang is disrespectful to you.

96
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,399
Even if she is disrespectful to you,

97
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,880
she should not be disrespectful to
your mother.

98
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,920
She is your mother!

99
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,760
Take it slow.

100
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,279
Be careful.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Mr. Lin,
you can have a nap in the car.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,079
I will wake you up
when we arrive at your place.

103
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,920
Mr. Jiang,
there may be a problem with the car.

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,200
The car cannot be started.

105
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,440
What should I do?

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
I have to meet Mr. Xu.

107
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,799
How about taking Mr. Lin's car?

108
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,640
I just saw that
he went out with Miss Jiang.

109
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,839
Zhang, is your mobile phone ringing?

110
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,160
No.

111
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
Mr. Lin,

112
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,839
is it convenient to talk?

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,839
Mr. Yu let me tell you that

114
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,799
he earned a lot this time,

115
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,359

but you achieved
unintentional positive outcomes.

has responsibility,

he was indeed wronged.

don't blame me for talking too much.

and several guests.

Mr. Jiang?

163
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Don't flatter me.

164
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,919

Lin Xiangyuan,

166

don't play the fool with me.

167

You're really good at business.

168
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,080
You killed three hawks with one arrow.

169
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,599
You ruined Lei Yuzheng,

170
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:04,000
built yourself up,

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,679

Mr. Jiang, calm down.

174
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,960
There must be misunderstanding.

175
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,159
Misunderstanding?

176
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,239
Tell me, who is Mr. Yu
that Xie Li was talking about?

Mr. Jiang.

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,679
You disappointed me too much.

179
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,239
I didn't expect that
the person I promoted

180
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,919
would do such a thing.

181
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Jiang,

182
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,400
Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment really
has nothing to do with me.

183
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,039
I would never

184
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,400
dare to do that.

I saw Lei Yuzheng looked down on you

187
00:11:47,599 --> 00:11:49,479
because he is the major shareholder

188
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,679
of Yutian Group.

189
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
I was very angry.

190
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,159
I just don't like him,

191
00:11:56,239 --> 00:11:57,919
but I never set him up on purpose

192
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,760
to such a serious extent.

193
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,440
Mr. Jiang, I swear

194
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,119
I didn't do it.

195
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,559
Shut up!

196
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,400
Lin Xiangyuan, still treating me
like a fool?

197
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,239
I've been in the business field
for decades.

198
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:18,440
I know one is always trying to
cheat the other in the business field.

199
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,280
But I have a bottom line.

200
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,320
Mr. Jiang.

201
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,119
Tell me,

202
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,719
how would I dare
to keep someone like you

203
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,760
with no moral bottom line around me?

204
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,159
How would I dare to let Fanlv
live with you for the rest of her life?

205
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,039
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
I know that you don't trust me,

207
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,159
but I'm wholehearted to

208
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,359
you and Fanlv.

209
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,479
Shut up!

210
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,359
Mr. Jiang,

211
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,000
I have no complaints
no matter how you punish me,

212
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,719
but Fanlv and I are married,

213
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,719
and she is carrying my baby now.

214
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
If you put me in jail,

215
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,559
your grandson will be born

216
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,400
without a father.

217
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,239
Mr. Jiang,
I will make up for my mistakes.

218
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,559
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

219
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
I will return Yutian to him.

220
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,400
OK?

221
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,159
What's the use of making up for

222
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,239
what's already happened?

223
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:29,359
You know that

224
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,400
Fanlv and I
just registered our marriage.

225
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,799
Now, do you want her…

226
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,159
I swear that

227
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,039
I will love Fanlv and treat her well.

228
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:47,679
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

229
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,359
I will definitely return Yutian to him.

230
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:20,039
Fanlv, you're married today,

231
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,640
and I'm very happy for you.

232
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,159
You're my baby girl,

233
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,200
and I always hope that

234
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:31,520
you can marry a good man who loves you.

235
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,280
But I also would like to warn you,

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,880
there is a gap
between the ideal and reality.

237
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
You need to learn to protect yourself.

238
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:44,359
Keep an eye on everything.

239
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,479
Remember?

240
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,440
Don't worry, dad.

241
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,719
I won't leave you anyway.

242
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,400
If you have any grievance, just tell me.

243
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,679
Dad will always support you.

244
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:02,280
Mr. Jiang, a toast to you.

245
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,599
Since what is done cannot be undone,
I have nothing to say.

246
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,440
Xiangyuan, you should call me dad now.

247
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,640
Thank you, dad.

248
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,520
I have a word for you.

249
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,799
The moon waxes only to wane,
and water brims only to overflow.

250
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,039
Cherish what you've got now.

251
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,280
Leave some leeway for everything,

252
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,559
or you will lose more than
you've gained sooner or later.

253
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,359
Dad, I will keep that in mind.

254
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,919
Dad,

255
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,599
why are you being so weird today?

256
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,239
Nothing.

257
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,479
I just want to give some advice

258
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:48,760
about business to Xiangyuan.

259
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,119
Come on.

260
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:54,919
I wish you all the happiness.

261
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,919
May we have family harmony.

262
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,039
Here.

263
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:25,792
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

264
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,719
Lei Yuzheng.

265
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,359
Yes.

266
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,520
A woman called Shao Kaixuan
is here to see you,

267
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
and she is waiting in the audience room.

268
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,160
Hello, Aunt Shao.

269
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,959
Yuzheng, how are you doing there?

270
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,079
I'm fine. Don't worry.

271
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,959
Yuzheng, take care of yourself.

272
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,920
Zhenrong is gone,

273
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,880
and you're all that I have.

274
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,839
Remember,

275
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,199
where there is life, there is hope.

276
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
Be sure to take care of yourself.

277
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,400
Understand?

278
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,520
Aunt Shao, don't worry.

279
00:17:52,479 --> 00:17:53,880
I've long since adapted to this place.

280
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,000
How is my father doing?

281
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
I forgot to tell you that

282
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,239
your father is doing well.

283
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,920
He is on vacation abroad.

284
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,479
Look,

285
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:22,160
your farther is getting old,

286
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,800
and he is worried about you

287
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,359
because he cannot see you.

288
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,040
But Assistant He told him that

289
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,239
you were busy
doing your own thing abroad.

290
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,359
And your father asked no more questions.

291
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,040
Aunt Shao,
you don't have to say any more.

292
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,040
I trust you.

293
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
When I see my father in this situation,

294
00:18:44,439 --> 00:18:45,800
I feel bad.

295
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,719
He is quite old now,

296
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,640
but I still have him worried.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,160
I'm not filial.

298
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,119
Yuzheng, I know that

299
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,400
what you've done is

300
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,520
to make Yutian

301
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,359
and the project survive.

302
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,040
Aunt Shao, don't worry.

303
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm fine.

304
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
You and my father

305
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,760
should take care of yourselves.

306
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,040
When I get out,
I will show filial piety to you.

307
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,800
I'm leaving.

308
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:29,728
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

309
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,439
Yes.

310
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,959
I understand.

311
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,920
OK, OK.

312
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,280
Mr. Jin, you can rest assured that

313
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,959
I will definitely show the simple,

314
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,640
modern, fashionable, high-end,
and magnificent style you like

315
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,000
at the lowest cost.

316
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,400
Do you think this is OK?

317
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,319
OK. Goodbye.

318
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,479
Du Xiaosu,

319
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,160
you're such a moneygrubber.

320
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
Only half a month left
before the Spring Festival,

321
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,800
and you receive so many orders.
Can you finish them in time?

322
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:04,959
Life is about making money.

323
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,680
Isn't that your motto?

324
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:07,520
No.

325
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:10,000
My motto is,
even if you don't earn money...

326
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,079
Who is that?

327
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,319
My mom.

328
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:17,199
Hello, mom.

329
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,119
Hello, daughter. When will you be home
for the Spring Festival break?

330
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,719
It's not easy to buy a ticket
if it's too late.

331
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
You need to book your flight
for the festival break earlier.

332
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,280
Don't be muddleheaded,

333
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,640
or you will be in a rush and muddle.

334
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,959
Xiaosu,

335
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
your mom started making

336
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,719
your favorite smoked fish yesterday.

337
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
We'll wait for you to eat that
when you return for the Spring Festival.

338
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,359
Dad and mom,

339
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,199
I was just about to
speak to you about this.

340
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,839
I may not go back home this year.

341
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,760
The studio is too busy,

342
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,959
and I cannot go back.

343
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,599
Fanlv.

344
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,400
Dad.

345
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:06,760
You're pregnant.

346
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,359
Why do you still
drive to work by yourself?

347
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,640
Where is Xiangyuan?

348
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:11,400
He drives you every day, doesn't he?

349
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,359
I sent him on an errand,

350
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,599
and he went out early in the morning.

351
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,560
Really?

352
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,920
He didn't bully you, right?

353
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:19,839
Him?

354
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,760
No. He treats me like a bodhisattva.

355
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,479
Don't worry.

356
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,839
Do you know who is

357
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,359
the model husband in our company?

358
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,719
Mr. Lin, right?

359
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,439
Of course.

360
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,479
Mr. Lin is so nice to Miss Jiang
to be nominated for "Touching China".

361
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,599
After Miss Jiang gets pregnant,

362
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,800
Mr. Lin even doesn't
dare to speak loudly.

363
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,160
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.

364
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,079
Dad, don't listen to their nonsense.

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
Xiangyuan treats you well,

366
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,800
and everyone sees that.

367
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,719
But you should have
a sense of propriety,

368
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,239
or they will think that

369
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,040
the Jiangs did not educate you well.

370
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
Mr. Jiang.

371
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,839
Mr. Lin is here.

372
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:10,880
Fanlv,

373
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,000
here are the yellow crab
and chicken porridge

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,359
I bought these especially for you.

375
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,119
I walked several blocks to get these.

376
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
Eat while they are still warm.

377
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:22,479
Xiangyuan,

378
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,119
come to my office later.

379
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,040
OK.

380
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,680
Let's go.

381
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,959
Xiangyuan,

382
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,719
I can see that
you have been treating Fanlv well

383
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
in the last few months,

384
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,079
and I'm delighted.

385
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,239
Mr. Jiang, I promised you that

386
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,560
I'd be nice to her.

387
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,520
And I will treat you as my own father.

388
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,560
That's all I should do.

389
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,520
As a parent,

390
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,880
my biggest wish is for my daughter

391
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:59,280
to marry a good man.

392
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,359
If you and Fanlv can

393
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,920
live a peaceful life,

394
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:06,199
it's the greatest filial piety to me.

395
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,560
About the mistake you made,

396
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,479
learn lessons from it

397
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,199
and never do that again.

398
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,640
I understand.

399
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,719
Tomorrow, I will go abroad
on a business trip,

400
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:20,479
and may not be back
until Spring Festival's Eve.

401
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,959
During my absence,

402
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:26,640
you take charge of the company.

403
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,359
Mr. Jiang, don't worry.

404
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:31,280
I will not disappoint you.

405
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,479
Bro,

406
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,319
what are you thinking about?

407
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,439
It seems that my father is really sick.

408
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,760
I didn't know my father might be sick,

409
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,680
until the day
Aunt Shao gave me this photo.

410
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
To say the least,

411
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,479
if my father is good,

412
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,119
why doesn't he come to see me?

413
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Bro,

414
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,719
I know you are painful.

415
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:22,439
But all people living in this world

416
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,839
are painful more or less.

417
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,040
You should hide such pains
in your heart.

418
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,920
The more painful it is now,

419
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,000
the more you will want to live well

420
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:36,520
when you get out

421
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,640
in the future.

422
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
And in this way,
you can endure the life here.

423
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,599
Mr. Lin, you have obvious dark circles.

424
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,359
Are you OK?

425
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,719
Were you too tired last night?

426
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,319
Take care of yourself.

427
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,959
Lin Xiangyuan.

428
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,119
Lin Xiangyuan.

429
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,479
What are you doing
in the midnight?

430
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Can you just sleep silently?

431
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,119
How can I fall asleep

432
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,479
when you keep snoring like that?

433
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,040
Don't be angry.
I will sleep on the sofa.

434
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,119
Annoying.

435
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,959
Can you just sleep silently?

436
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,319
How can I fall asleep

437
00:25:40,479 --> 00:25:41,800
when you keep snoring like that?

438
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,880
Yes, it's me.

439
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:23,000
OK, I will notify Mr. Lin.

440
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,199
What?

441
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,560
Ning Weicheng said

442
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:27,760
Miss Jiang just threw up again
in the office,

443
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,599
so she asked for a month's leave.

444
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,439
He asked me to tell you this.

445
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,520
OK. Tell Ning Weicheng

446
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
to find someone to send her home.

447
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,079
Don't let her go alone.

448
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:40,239
OK.

449
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,280
He Qunfei was assigned
to the data and file room

450
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,319
as a clerk

451
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,239
to do odds and ends.

452
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,319
You thought about firing him before,
didn't you?

453
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:57,479
But Miss Jiang stopped it.

454
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,239
How do you know that?

455
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,920
I know a lot of things.

456
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,280
You don't have to fire him.

457
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:09,040
You can transfer him to
the logistics department

458
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,800
to manage the cleaning
of the entire building, instead.

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,160
Make him inspect the hygiene every day.

460
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,800
You're so mean.

461
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:19,920
Mr. Lin, you complimented me again。

462
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:22,119
Let's walk and talk.

463
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,560
Supervisor He, you mean I have to leave?

464
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,079
I'm surprised too.

465
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,400
You were here just a few days ago,

466
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
and did nothing wrong.

467
00:27:46,719 --> 00:27:47,800
But look,

468
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,439
the executive office
suddenly issued an order

469
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,040
to transfer you to the logistics
department to manage the hygiene.

470
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,599
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

471
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,000
It's right for you to be loyal
to Mr. Lei,

472
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,560
but now it is not like the old days.

473
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:00,959
You have to accommodate
yourself to the circumstance.

474
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:07,239
Mr. Lin, Mr. Xie, what brought you here?

475
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,719
I'll get you two cups of tea.

476
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:17,359
Lin Xiangyuan, you're so mean
to get me in trouble on purpose.

477
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,160
Listen, a small-minded person like you

478
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:24,079
will never achieve great things.

479
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,119
Achieving great things or not

480
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:29,520
seems to have nothing to do with you.

481
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,119
But at least for now,

482
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,880
you have to do whatever

483
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,599
Mr. Lin wants you to do.

484
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,100
(Employee Job Adjustment Notice)

485

(Recruitment. Interviewees wait here)

488
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,199
Who is No. 10, He Qunfei?

489
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,760
Nice to meet you.

490
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,859
(Resume of He Qunfei)

491
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,439
Mr. He, I'm curious that

492
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,760
why do you leave Yutian

493
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,119
where so many people want

494
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,800
to work.

495
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,040
Because...

496
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,160
As far as I know,

497
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:41,880
you and the current CEO of Yutian,

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,479
Mr. Lin Xiangyuan, have disputes.
(Applicant)

499
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,599
That's not the case.

500
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,959
Then,

501
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,040
why are you applying for a job here?
(Interviewer. Assistant)

502
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,680
Sorry, Mr. He.

503
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,640
You'd better go to another company

504
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,439
to take a chance,

505
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,239
or change the industry.

506
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,920
Thank you.

507
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,199
Such a beautiful girl.

508
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,839
Me?

509
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,160
Of course, it's you.

510
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,319
What will we eat later?

511
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,760
As you want.

512
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,640
Eat…

513
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,640
Shangguan.

514
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,640
What a coincidence!

515
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,199
What a coincidence!

516
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:15,760
Who is this beautiful girl?

517
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,280
Hello, I'm his girlfriend.

518
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,400
She is my cousin.

519
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,439
Shopping with your cousin?

520
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,199
OK. See you.

521
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,359
-Bye.
-Bye.

522
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,760
What?

523
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,760
What do you mean?

524
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,000
I'm your cousin?

525
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,199
Am I embarrassing you?

526
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,599
You misunderstood me.

527
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,239
This friend of mine

528
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,560
is gossipy.

529
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,560
If he knows that you're my girlfriend,

530
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,599
everyone will know that.

531
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,319
So what? Is it embarrassing

532
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,560
to have a girlfriend?

533
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,400
You just have fun with me?

534
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,760
What are you talking about?

535
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,959
I am true to you.

536
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:55,199
Even the sun and moon can see.

537
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,479
But...

538
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm actually a very low-key person.

539
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,160
I really don't want to be
the subject of gossip

540
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,040
among those friends.

541
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,880
I swear,

542
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,599
if I'm not true to you,

543
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,280
I will...

544
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:11,439
All right.

545
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,119
I trust you.

546
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,079
Show me your smile.

547
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:17,280
No.

548
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,359
Smile.

549
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,040
No.

550
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,439
Smile.

551
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,520
I'm fine.

552
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm a little uncomfortable.

553
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
Can you send me back?

554
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,920
Hello, sir.

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,280
Look, highly paid recruitment.

556
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,840
(High Salary Recruitment)

557
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,719
OK.

558
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,839
Here?

559
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,479
Yes, here.

560
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,479
I've checked on the phone.

561
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,760
Right.

562
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:14,040
You didn't even tell our daughter,

563
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,199
and you directly came to Shanghai.

564
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,640
You're not afraid of delaying her work?

565
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,359
-304.
-304.

566
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:20,839
301.

567
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,400
-301.
-Right, here.

568
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,400
Hello.

569
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,040
Hello.

570
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,239
Who are you looking for?

571
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,280
Hello. We are looking for Du Xiaosu.

572
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,959
We... We're her parents.

573
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,640
We just came from our hometown.

574
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,199
Is she there?

575
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:37,599
Uncle and aunt,

576
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,520
please have a rest.

577
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,959
Where is Xiaosu?
She's not at work?

578
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,800
Is she sick?

579
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,880
No, no.

580
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,239
Xiaosu is fine.

581
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,319
But she is not here now.

582
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,479
She went to Lei's house
to look after an elderly person.

583
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,839
Lei's house?

584
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,800
To look after an elderly person?

585
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,520
Mr. Lei, look.

586
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,479
This is your favorite
red bean and glutinous rice porridge.

587
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:04,160
There are so many red beans.

588
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,599
Come on, take a sip.

589
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:10,880
Are you OK?

590
00:33:10,959 --> 00:33:12,040
Let me wipe you off.

591
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:14,439
Go away.

592
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,520
I don't know you.

593
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,839
Don't you remember?

594
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,119
I'm the Marshmallow.

595
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,959
We're good friends.

596
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
I'm not your good friend.

597
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,319
You're all bad people.

598
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,079
You imprison me here.

599
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,160
You want me to die.

600
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,079
Yuzheng, Yuzheng.

601
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:31,400
Get out.

602
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,239
Mr. Lei,

603
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,800
it's night time

604
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,280
over there now.

605
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,959
Your son is sleeping.

606
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,599
You'd better not to disturb him.

607
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,760
Let's go to bed too.

608
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,839
Have a rest, OK?

609
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,359
I'm not sick. I don't take medicine.

610
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,959
It's OK. It's OK.

611
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,880
Let me clean here.

612
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,719
Marshmallow.

613
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,479
I'm OK. I'm fine.

614
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:08,159
Xiaosu, are you OK?

615
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:10,679
Are you injured?

616
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,239
Dad, mom,

617
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,919
why are you here?

618
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,120
If we're not here,

619
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,959
how long are you going
to hide this from us?

620
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,159
So much has happened.

621
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,760
Why didn't you tell us?

622
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:30,520
It's OK.

623
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,959
Marshmallow,

624
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:33,879
who are they?

625
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,479
Mr. Lei, don't worry or panic.

626
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,479
They're my parents, not bad people.

627
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,199
-Come here.
-Good people, good people.

628
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,120
You said you are busy and cannot
go back home during Spring Festival,

629
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,120
so this is what you are busy for?

630
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,719
I cannot believe you were lying to us.

631
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,080
If your father and I didn't see this,

632
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,560
we will never believe that

633
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:00,399
you're an accompanying nurse now.

634
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,840
Yes, Xiaosu,

635
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,879
how could you lie to us?

636
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,040
A girl in your company told us

637
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,159
that you are here.

638
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,879
I wanted to tell you this before,

639
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,320
but...

640
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm afraid I cannot explain it clearly.

641
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:16,959
Tell us,

642
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:19,159
what's the relationship
between you and Lei?

643
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:20,959
If there is nothing between you,

644
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,360
why are you taking care of his father?

645
00:35:25,879 --> 00:35:27,520
We're friends.

646
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:30,320
If the family of my friend have trouble,

647
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:31,919
I should help take care of them.

648
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,159
Help take care?

649
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,520
You think I don't know?

650
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:36,479
I have inquired before I came.

651
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,000
You make friends
with a person in the jail...

652
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,399
Mom, keep your voice down.

653
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,639
Mr. Lei doesn't know yet.

654
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:45,800
Go back with me right now.

655
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,840
No, I cannot go.

656
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,600
Mr. Lei is here alone,

657
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,760
and the butler went out.

658
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:52,040
I have to stay here.

659
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:54,080
Marshmallow, I want to watch TV.

660
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
OK, I'm coming.

661
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,760
I really cannot go.

662
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:57,439
How about this?

663
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,919
You two go back first.

664
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,840
When the butler comes back,

665
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:01,280
I will go back. OK?

666
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,320
Fine.

667
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,320
Listen to Xiaosu. We go back first.

668
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,800
What's done is done.

669
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,560
No hurry at this moment.

670
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,320
You...
I don't know what to say about you.

671
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,159
Let's go.

672
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,639
Go.

673
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,439
The Big Head Son and Little Head Father
is going to start.

674
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,520
Hurry up.

675
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,560
Let's go.

676
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:24,439
Go, go, go.

677
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,399
She is so...

678
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,000
Don't be angry.

679
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
Your daughter is playing the fool,

680
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,719
and you didn't stop her

681
00:36:29,879 --> 00:36:31,040
but helped her instead.

682
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:32,919
I didn't help her.

683
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,919
No matter how serious the matter is,

684
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,479
we cannot make a noise
in other people's home.

685
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,120
Isn't it right?

686
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,399
She is spoiled by you.

687
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:38,719
You both...

688
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:41,439
It's weird.

689
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,520
Does Xiaosu like Mr. Lei?

690
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,199
Don't think so much.

691
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,600
Let's talk to her
after she comes back home.

692
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,159
She must give us a good explanation.

693
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:13,679
Maokai, move.

694
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,280
I'm coming.

695
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,399
Mr. Lei,

696
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,280
let me pour you a cup of tea.

697
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:45,239
No, I want yogurt.

698
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,120
OK, yogurt.

699
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,719
But you have to take the medicine

700
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,239
after yogurt, OK?

701
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,879
Then I will take it away.

702
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:56,000
OK, OK, OK.

703
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,399
Ok. Have only one.

704
00:37:58,679 --> 00:37:59,479
Drink.

705
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,000
Aunt Shao, you're here.

706
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,479
What's wrong with you?
You don't look very well.

707
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,239
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

708
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,800
It's him.

709
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,600
You often come here?

710
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,959
I came here sometimes for work.

711
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,840
Come and sit.

712
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,199
Waiter, open a bottle
of champagne.

713
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,360
Sit over here.
Don't be so far away from me.

714
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,399
Come on.

715
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,199
It's OK.

716
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,040
Sir, here is your champagne.

717
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,919
Thank you.

718
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:55,800
He Qunfei?

719
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,919
Why are you here?

720
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,919
He Qunfei.

721
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,040
You're Du Xiaosu's friend, right?

722
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,959
He is Du Xiaosu's friend.

723
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,199
We met before.

724
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,679
Why are you here?

725
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,040
Part-time job?

726
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:14,080
I'm on probation.

727
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,760
I don't know if they want me or not.

728
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
What a coincidence today!

729
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,479
So many acquaintances have met here.

730
00:39:25,919 --> 00:39:27,199
Is this Assistant He?

731
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,280
Why are you here?

732
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,959
Part-time job, right?

733
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,479
That's reasonable. I'm afraid
the low salary of a cleaning supervisor

734
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,360
cannot even be enough to pay the rent.

735
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,919
Look at what you're wearing.

736
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,879
Is the small red bellyband

737
00:39:43,879 --> 00:39:45,120
comfortable?

738
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:46,919
Mr. Lin,

739
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,239
if Lei Yuzheng sees that

740
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,239
Assistant He is serving us,
