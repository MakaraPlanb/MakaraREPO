Qunfei,

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,800
this bar is just so so.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
Anyone can come here.

19
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,360
What do you mean?

20
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,399
There is someone here
who has done bad things behind.

21
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,800
Well, Mr. Lin,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
does that sound bad?

23
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,800
Shangguan,

24
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,639
if you really want to help Lei Yuzheng,

25
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,399
don't waste time here with me.

26
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,759
Lin Xiangyuan,

27
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,679
don't be too complacent.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,000
There will be a day when
you admit defeat.

29
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,279
Is it useful to talk to me like that?

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
What are you doing, He Qunfei?

31
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,600
Come out, He Qunfei.

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,279
Go.

33
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,440
Let's go.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,199
OK.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,880
Lost your partner?

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
Siqi, don't be like this.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,399
I'm still an intern.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
I will be fired if I'm not doing my job.

39
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,080
Just one simple question.

40
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,800
Is Lin Xiangyuan torturing you?

41
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,039
Yes.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
Even if he's torturing you,

43
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,759
there is nothing else you can try?

44
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,199
Why do you have to be a waiter?

45
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:31,839
It's my own business.

46
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,320
Just leave me alone.

47
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,000
You still hate me, don't you?

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,880
You give yourself up like this.

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,720
It is intentional, isn't it?

50
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,759
I don't hate you.

51
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,639
You're a woman.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,520
You deserve a better life.

53
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,639
I am such a loser.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,240
I'm nothing now and

55
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,160
a mixture of failure.

56
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,559
It is a right choice

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,080
for us to be apart.

58
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:20,079
Look, what time is it?

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,959
Why hasn't the child come back?

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,200
Du, you have to join me later.

61
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:28,760
Teach her a lesson.

62
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,040
You cannot let her
do whatever she wants.

63
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,399
Are you listening?

64
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,119
Du, since you came back from Lei's,

65
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:46,000
you're always absent-minded.

66
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,399
What is wrong with you?

67
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,359
Do you have anything on your mind?

68
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,040
What's the matter with you?

69
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,320
I'm fine.

70
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,760
Maybe I'm a little tired today.

71
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,440
You're back.

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,799
Dad, mom.

73
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,799
Your supper is so late.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,720
Look, what time is it now?

75
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,559
We are waiting for you.

76
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,440
Why are you doing this to us?

77
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,920
Your father and I came all
the way here to see you.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,760
And you...

79
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
A babysitter in
someone else's house now.

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,079
Mom...

81
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,079
Close the studio.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,480
Come back to hometown with us tomorrow.

83
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,279
I'm doing very well in Shanghai.

84
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,880
Why going back?

85
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:32,720
You are doing well?

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,359
OK, you can decide by yourself.

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,559
You have to promise me

88
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,519
that you will not
go to Lei's house anymore.

89
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:39,959
How is that going to work?

90
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,160
Lei Yuzheng is not convenient now.

91
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
His father needs someone
to take care of him.

92
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,320
It's his own business,

93
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,040
and has nothing to do with you.

94
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,359
You are a girl,

95
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,359
and now you are taking care of
a prisoner's family.

96
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,679
It's a shame!

97
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,760
You know?

98
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:56,559
Luckily, it's in Shanghai.

99
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,799
If it is in our hometown,

100
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,040
you'll be gossiped about.

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,279
What are you doing? Say something.

102
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,519
Xiaosu just wanted to offer help.

103
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,799
How about this?

104
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,200
It's late today.

105
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,679
Everyone stays calm.

106
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,119
Let's talk about it in a couple of days.

107
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,760
Well,

108
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,040
you've had a hard time
coming here all the way.

109
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,920
Let's go to bed early after dinner.

110
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,399
I'm going back to my room.

111
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,359
Du Maokai, what's wrong with you?

112
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,440
She is the child of my own?

113
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,160
I have to worry about her all by myself?

114
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,079
I don't want to eat anymore.

115
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,839
Dad,

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,279
is my mom still mad at us?

117
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,079
It's been several days

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,799
and she still doesn't
want to talk to us.

119
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,079
You didn't do it right
in the first place.

120
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,200
I can't blame your mother
for being angry.

121
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you mad at me?

122
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,600
You are not a little girl anymore
and it's useless to blame you.

123
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,440
But Xiaosu,

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,519
when you do a good thing,
you have to do it properly.

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,399
You can help him for a while.

126
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,200
But you can't help him forever.

127
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,760
There are some things

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,959
that you can just show your kindness.

129
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:27,399
Dad, you and Aunt Shao,

130
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,480
do you know each other?

131
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,679
How do you know that?

132
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,239
In fact, I never told you that

133
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,200
Aunt Shao is Zhenrong's mother.

134
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,320
I also know that

135
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,079
when you two were young,

136
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
you were in love.

137
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,959
I just wanted to tell you

138
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,359
no matter what happened between

139
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,880
you and Aunt Shao,

140
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,440
you two must make it clear.

141
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
Don't keep it in heart

142
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,920
and make it a regret.

143
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,279
Mr. Lin.

144
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:19,480
Lei Yuzheng's golf club is nice to use.

145
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,640
What's the matter?

146
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,279
I have booked flight tickets
for you and Miss Jiang.

147
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,799
The plane leaves the day
after tomorrow in the morning.

148
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,200
As for when you get off the plane...

149
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,119
All right, you don't have to
worry about that.

150
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,440
I'll take care of it.

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,440
OK.

152
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,159
You will go home with your wife
and your kid for the Spring Festival.

153
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
When aunt knows,

154
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,479
she must be very happy.

155
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,200
Exactly.

156
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,039
I worked so hard these years,

157
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,479
just for this day to come.

158
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,479
Yes.

159
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:49,619
(Jiang Fanlv)

160
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:51,559
Fanlv.

161
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,679
Dad came back?

162
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,239
All right. I'll be right back.

163
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,679
Mom.

164
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,679
Go away.

165
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Get up.

166
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,039
Mom, do you remember?

167
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,799
When I was a little kid,

168
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,039
there was an old lady downstairs.

169
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,640
That was an old woman
without any relatives.

170
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,320
You and my dad sometimes

171
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,719
sent her some oil, rice or others.

172
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,039
You taught me since I was young

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,880
that I should be kind and helpful.

174
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,760
I'm following your advice.

175
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
That's why I went to look after Mr. Lei.

176
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:29,599
Mom.

177
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,640
Mom.

178
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
To be honest,

179
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,239
Lei Yuzheng is very pathetic now.

180
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,719
He was being set up.

181
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,359
And Mr. Lei was shocked by this.

182
00:09:38,479 --> 00:09:39,880
That's why he's like that now.

183
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
Also,

184
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,719
in fact, Lei Yuzheng
helped me a lot.

185
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,559
Once I was working on
a construction site,

186
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,400
suddenly I fainted.

187
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,679
It was Lei Yuzheng who
sent me to the hospital.

188
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
The house that Zhenrong and I lived in,

189
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,159
Lei Yuzheng saved it for us.

190
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,159
Actually, he's a good guy.

191
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:04,000
I apologize now. Will you accept it?

192
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:06,760
Will you forgive me?

193
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,039
A girl's youth is more
precious than gold.

194
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,000
If he'd be in jail for
three or five years,

195
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,679
you don't care?

196
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,000
It's his own business.

197
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,599
There's nothing to do with me.

198
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,400
I am serious.

199
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,119
Look at me.

200
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,159
Tell me the truth.

201
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:27,599
Do you like him?

202
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,159
I am just worrying about you.

203
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,760
You have been hurt once,

204
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,760
and you've had a rough time.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,520
Why do you choose such a tough way?

206
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,799
My silly girl.

207
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,960
I hope you can be happy.

208
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,960
Then I can be settled.

209
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,400
Xiangyuan,

210
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,599
everything is OK in the company?

211
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,080
Dad,

212
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,119
you can rest assured.

213
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:10,239
Everything goes well.

214
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:13,960
Here.

215
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:17,559
It's going to be Spring Festival.

216
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,039
Do you two have any plans?

217
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,000
-Dad…
-Dad, we are staying with you.

218
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,200
Dad,

219
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,359
I want to take Fanlv to my hometown.

220
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:30,840
Go back to your hometown?

221
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,960
Lin Xiangyuan, are you kidding me?

222
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:35,599
Fanlv,

223
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,799
it's time for you to go back with him.

224
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,239
You got married very simply.

225
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,520
His mom has not even seen
her daughter-in-law.

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
It's Spring Festival.

227
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,559
If you don't go back and see her,

228
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:50,400
it's too rude.

229
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,599
My mother is dying to have you back.

230
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,679
She knows you will come back,

231
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,719
so she redecorated

232
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,520
the house in the hometown.

233
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,919
So what?

234
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,119
It doesn't matter.

235
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,159
Dad, you don't even know.

236
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,599
His hometown is a place
with poor transportation.

237
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:09,640
I'm pregnant.

238
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,440
I cannot go there in an ox cart.

239
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,440
That was years ago.

240
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,559
You can't even see an ox cart right now.

241
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,239
Last year, the train station was ready.

242
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,119
We can go to Guiyang by plane.

243
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:25,119
When we get off the plane,
we can take the high-speed train.

244
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,280
When we get off the high-speed train,
we are home.

245
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,440
So what?

246
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,280
I won't get used to it there.

247
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,359
Am I going there for hardship,
or for the Spring Festival?

248
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
How about this?

249
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,880
We take things from Shanghai with us.

250
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,080
Whatever you want to eat, I'll buy.

251
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,000
You're just trying to convince me.

252
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:45,000
You go back on your own,
and I won't stop you.

253
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,080
Or,

254
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,239
you ask your mom to come to Shanghai.

255
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,880
That's a way to deal with it.

256
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,719
Xiangyuan,

257
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,039
how about letting them come over.

258
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
And they can have fun in Shanghai.

259
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:04,520
Dad,

260
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,559
you don't know our customs.

261
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,599
A new daughter-in-law
in the first year

262
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,000
has to go back.

263
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:13,840
If Fanlv doesn't come home with me,

264
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:19,080
the neighbors will laugh at my mom.

265
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,039
Is it your mother's face that matters

266
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
or my child's safety that matters?

267
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,919
The doctor told me to be
careful and rest quietly.

268
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,799
Emotions must not fluctuate.

269
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,640
I feel not good even in Shanghai.

270
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,280
And now you want me to
take a long journey.

271
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,479
If there's anything wrong,

272
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,799
who should take the responsibility?

273
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:36,239
Exactly.

274
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,679
It's OK if you don't want to go with me.

275
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,119
It's fine.

276
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,640
I will just go by myself.

277
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,400
Fanlv, remember that

278
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,239
you should buy some gifts for her mom.

279
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,359
When it's New Year's Eve,

280
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:59,200
call his mother and present greetings.

281
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,159
Tell her that you are
sorry and explain it.

282
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,559
Do you hear that?

283
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,159
Got it.

284
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,159
Xiangyuan, this time

285
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,239
I brought back a lot of nourishment.

286
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,760
You can pick up some good ones later.

287
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
Take them back to your mother.

288
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,960
And say hello to her.

289
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,080
OK, dad.

290
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,320
Got it.

291
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:38,559
Welcome.

292
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,559
How have you been these years?

293
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:12,640
I let you down for what happened.

294
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,719
I shouldn't have promised to
go with you but didn't show up.

295
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,200
Can you forgive me for what I did?

296
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Forgive?

297
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:28,440
Impossible.

298
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,840
Du Maokai,

299
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,159
I wish we have never met each other.

300
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,039
I'd rather wish

301
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
we shall never meet in the future.

302
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,919
Kaixuan!

303
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,400
I had reasons at the time.

304
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,000
On my way to meet you,

305
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,719
I ran into a car accident.

306
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,520
Please wait. I need to get off.

307
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,960
God, oh my god.

308
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,119
I don't know how bad it is.

309
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,599
Yes, I cannot tell.

310
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,080
What are you still wondering
about? Call the doctor.

311
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,400
-Give me a hand.
-Give him a hand.

312
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,400
The woman I sent to the hospital

313
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,200
was Ruohua, Xiaosu's mother.

314
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,719
Doctor, is she all right?

315
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:51,400
Temporarily out of danger.

316
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,119
You'd better pay the bill first.

317
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,840
You misunderstood. I don't know her.

318
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,719
Didn't you send her over?

319
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,119
Yes, it is me.

320
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,039
But I met her on the way
to somewhere.

321
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,919
Seriously, just let me go.

322
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,559
I have other things to do.

323
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,079
It will be too late.

324
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
I don't think so.

325
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,239
You'd better wait until the
patient wakes up.

326
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,839
Later on,

327
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,160
she was rescued with much effort

328
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,199
and woke up.

329
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,560
I was going to buy a ticket to
Shanghai to see you.

330
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,680
But who could predict
the sequela after bumping?

331
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,520
Ruohua suddenly lost her sight.

332
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,719
Later, I knew she was an orphan.

333
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,959
She suffered a lot,

334
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,599
and there was no one around
to take care of her.

335
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,959
I was...

336
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:47,800
I couldn't be assured.

337
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,479
I saved her after all,

338
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,319
so I stayed to look after her.

339
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,599
I thought I should wait
until she recovered.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,199
And then I could decide whatever.

341
00:18:02,479 --> 00:18:04,199
I kept taking care of her.

342
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,280
And when she recovered,

343
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,920
it was the next spring.

344
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,319
You are awake.

345
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:18,160
Then why didn't you tell me?

346
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,400
You thought I was unreasonable?

347
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,400
If I had known that

348
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
you did not keep your words
because of that,

349
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,800
I would not have blamed you.

350
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,520
I haven't been able to
reach you since then.

351
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I thought you were blaming me
and wanting to break up with me.

352
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,359
And I gave it up.

353
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,599
And afterwards,

354
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,040
I married Ruohua

355
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,520
and we had Xiaosu.

356
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,680
Kaixuan, it's been so many years.

357
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,800
Look at us.

358
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,319
We are both middle-aged.

359
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,119
We should let it go. Am I right?

360
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,520
Spring Festival is coming.

361
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,839
Are you going back to your hometown?

362
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:24,920
I...

363
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:27,680
I broke up with my girlfriend.

364
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,119
I lost my job.

365
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,319
How should I have the guts to go back?

366
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,160
I heard about that from Siqi.

367
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,479
What about you, Xiaosu?

368
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,880
Will you go back?

369
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,479
My parents came to Shanghai.

370
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,400
We decided to celebrate in Shanghai.

371
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,079
Qunfei,

372
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,680
I suddenly got a good idea.

373
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,719
You have a great daughter.

374
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,079
She not only takes care of Lei's father,

375
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,199
but also moves to his house
during Spring Festival.

376
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,920
Mr. Lei, look.
(Blessing)

377
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,439
Happiness is here.

378
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,400
That's what it means.

379
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,959
Come and tell me, Mr. Lei.

380
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,000
Where should I paste it?

381
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,400
Great, higher, higher.

382
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,800
OK, here.

383
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,079
-Good-looking.
-Cheese!

384
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,599
You spoiled the child.

385
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,040
Increasingly absurd.

386
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,160
You are blaming me?

387
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,680
Who said yes to that?

388
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,479
What else can I do?

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,839
Mr. Lei is old now.

390
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,560
And he is not clear in his mind.

391
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
His child is not around
even during Spring Festival.

392
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,119
I cannot bear that.

393
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,319
Yes.

394
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,560
Uncle Duan took nice pictures for us.

395
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,959
Look at your smiling eyes.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Xiaosu,

397
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,199
you are so clever

398
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,719
to let us stay together
for the Spring Festival.

399
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,359
We haven't had so many
people in the house

400
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,760
for a long time.

401
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,520
It would be nice if Yuzheng is here.

402
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,640
Uncle Duan, don't be like this.

403
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,920
It's Spring Festival.

404
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,479
If it is heard by Mr. Lei,

405
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
he would be upset.

406
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,839
OK, got it.

407
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,439
You two talk with Mr. Lei.

408
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll go to see how my parents' cooking

409
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,319
is going.

410
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:16,880
Must be very good.

411
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,079
Mr. Lei,

412
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:20,160
Miss Du's parents

413
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,920
come here today for cooking for us.

414
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,319
All delicious food.

415
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,640
Delicious food?

416
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,920
Hurry up, I'm hungry.

417
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,079
OK, let's eat.

418
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:27,760
It's great to be hungry.

419
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,079
Eat more later.

420
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,959
It smells good.

421
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,520
So much dishes already.

422
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,280
And my favorite meatballs.

423
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,280
Let me...

424
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,239
Did you wash your hands?

425
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,280
Come, come, have a bite.

426
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,479
I'm just following my dad's lead.

427
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,079
If my dad wasn't kind and righteous

428
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,839
to take you in,

429
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,359
how could you have me?

430
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,439
Is that right?

431
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:55,640
My dear baby girl

432
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,199
is all your dad's credit,

433
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,079
not mine?

434
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,280
That's right.

435
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,520
Thank him for giving you
such a fine daughter.

436
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,719
Fine. Appreciated.

437
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,000
Thank you.

438
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,439
Dad, mom,

439
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,239
thank you both very much this time.

440
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,560
Show me that with some actions.

441
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,000
A kiss.

442
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
A kiss.

443
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,239
Oh, my dear girl.

444
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,640
Xiaosu,

445
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,119
don't you have friends coming?

446
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,680
Already here or not?

447
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,680
Not yet.

448
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,319
But I think she'll come.

449
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,079
What are you doing?

450
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,160
Hiding something from us?

451
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,839
Go back to your hometown?

452
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,760
Are you kidding me?

453
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
Xiangyuan,

454
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,959
be sure to come back this time

455
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,280
with your wife.

456
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,599
Mom wasn't there when you got married.

457
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,439
Everyone in the village laughed at me.

458
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,839
I can't even lift my head
in front of them.

459
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,959
It's your mother's face that matters

460
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:09,280
or the safety of my child?

461
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,599
Xiangyuan,

462
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,839
there's no reason not to have us meet.

463
00:23:17,719 --> 00:23:19,920
This year, no matter what happens,

464
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,079
you have to take Fanlv back.

465
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,400
We people in the countryside

466
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,400
particularly care about

467
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,000
being together in the Spring Festival.

468
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,880
Mom's got nothing to say.

469
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,439
It's up to you.

470
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
(Shanghai Police Supervision)

471
00:24:24,719 --> 00:24:28,800
Liu Sanjie who is good at singing
and dancing is waiting for you.

472
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,640
OK, it's done.

473
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,599
Mr. Lei,

474
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,640
these are all from my parents.

475
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,319
Which one you want to try first?

476
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,839
Mr. Lei, you have a good taste.

477
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,959
These meatballs

478
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,959
are my mother's specialty.

479
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,880
I've never stopped loving it
since my childhood.

480
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,640
Here, try one.

481
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,239
How's that?

482
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:57,800
Great.

483
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Let's have a toast.

484
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,359
Wish Mr. Lei Happy New Year.

485
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:06,359
Be happy and live long.

486
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,280
And

487
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:10,079
get well soon in good mood.

488
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,800
Here, cheers.

489
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,160
Get well soon.

490
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,520
Ms. Shao is here.

491
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,359
-Aunt Shao.
-Ms. Shao, come on.

492
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,280
Hello, I am late.

493
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,800
Lei, Happy New Year.

494
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,839
Xiaosu,

495
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,199
this is the mysterious
friend you spoke of?

496
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:29,079
Yes.

497
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,359
Come and have a seat.

498
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,000
Aunt Shao, please come.

499
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,400
You sit over here.

500
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,880
This is the seat
I have reserved for you.

501
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:44,839
All right, everybody's here.

502
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:46,000
Let's begin.

503
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,079
OK.

504
00:25:47,239 --> 00:25:48,359
Let's toast

505
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:49,479
to wish the new year

506
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,239
to be happy and prosperous.

507
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,880
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

508
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,520
Xiangyuan.

509
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,439
Mom.

510
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,040
I have something to tell you.

511
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,199
We have an emergency in our company.

512
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,160
I won't go home for the
Spring Festival this year.

513
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,800
You need to work during
the Spring Festival?

514
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,520
Yes, there's some emergency.

515
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:38,959
I have to go abroad for business stuff.

516
00:26:39,239 --> 00:26:40,520
You are going abroad?

517
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,719
What about Fanlv?

518
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,040
Fanlv...

519
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,839
She's not in good health.

520
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,119
You are not lying to me, aren't you?

521
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
No, I am not.

522
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,640
It's true.

523
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,400
I don't believe it.

524
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,920
Mom, don't be upset.

525
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,000
It's true.

526
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,680
I can go back to home next year.

527
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,439
I don't care.

528
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,160
Well...

529
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,560
You have to bring Fanlv back.

530
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:01,199
Mom, listen to me. Don't be mad.

531
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:01,880
Mom...

532
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,640
It's hard to get everyone
together today.

533
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,640
I would like to take this
opportunity to say a few words.

534
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,800
Firstly, to Mr. Lei.

535
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,800
Happy New Year!

536
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,719
I hope Yuzheng will come back soon.

537
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,079
What Aunt Shao means is that

538
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,560
she hopes Yuzheng can come back soon
to accompany you.

539
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,119
Yes, back, back.

540
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,439
Yes, come back.

541
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,959
Then, to Xiaosu.

542
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Aunt Shao.

543
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,040
Aunt Shao did something wrong to you

544
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,319
out of misunderstanding.

545
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,599
I apologize to you.

546
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,680
Will you forgive me?

547
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,599
What are you talking about, Aunt Shao?

548
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,839
You are Zhenrong's mom.

549
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,520
For me,

550
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,119
you are like my own mom.

551
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,359
There's no daughter

552
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,439
feeling angry to parents.

553
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,280
Here, bottoms up.

554
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,920
Happy New Year!

555
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,280
Happy New year!

556
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,599
Here.

557
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
The third one,

558
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,359
to everyone here.

559
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,880
In the past year,

560
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:50,959
a lot of things happened.

561
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,880
Everyone worked hard.

562
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:54,640
So, I hope that,

563
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,239
in the coming new year,

564
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,000
everyone is going well,

565
00:28:58,239 --> 00:28:59,359
and everyone's dreams come true.

566
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:01,880
OK, to all of us in the new year

567
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,920
to be happy

568
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,520
and lucky with dreams coming true.

569
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,719
Lucky with dreams coming true.

570
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,839
Great.

571
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,839
Yes.

572
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:22,560
There's still a guest

573
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,599
who's drinking alone.

574
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,560
Wait for me.

575
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:30,359
I will convince him to go home.

576
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:38,760
Young man,

577
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,400
it's Spring Festival.

578
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,239
Don't drink too much.

579
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,640
My husband

580
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,880
is urging me to go home for
festival dinner.

581
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,839
Could you please let me close up early?

582
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,319
Are you from Guizhou?

583
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,880
I come from Huaxi.

584
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,599
Are you from Guizhou too?

585
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:01,599
My hometown is not far from there.

586
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,920
It's already late,

587
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,439
but I don't know where to go.

588
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,160
Just for the sake of us
coming from the same place,

589
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,079
let me stay a little longer.

590
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,920
OK?

591
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,359
Young man,

592
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,079
why don't you go home?

593
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,040
Home?

594
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:37,400
I am different with you.

595
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:41,280
You have someone
waiting for you at home.

596
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,079
And me?

597
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,400
I don't want to go back to
my house in Shanghai.

598
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,760
I have no face to go back to Guizhou.

599
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,400
You have a house in Shanghai?

600
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,760
What else do you want?

601
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,079
Yes.

602
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,400
I bought my own house in Shanghai

603
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,079
and married a Shanghai lady.

604
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,640
You are so lucky.

605
00:31:10,959 --> 00:31:12,719
My husband and I

606
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,199
get up early every day,

607
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,640
keeping busy in this restaurant.

608
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:19,959
We have been in Shanghai
for more than a decade.

609
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,560
But now,

610
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,520
we're still living in
a small rented apartment.

611
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,680
It's small even for a dog to live in.

612
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,880
My mom knows I'm married
to a Shanghai lady.

613
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,319
And she was happy to
prepare for our wedding.

614
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,760
Everything was done back in my hometown.

615
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,959
But my wife decided not
to have a ceremony.

616
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,079
It's Spring Festival now.

617
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:44,920
She should go home with me at least.

618
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,079
Let my mom see her in person.

619
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,199
But she doesn't want to.

620
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,160
She does not have a good temper.

621
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,839
And I don't want to let her win.

622
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:59,400
Did you work out after you got married?

623
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,760
It's hard.

624
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,959
Because my family is poor.

625
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,920
I was looked down upon all my life.

626
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,359
So, I studied hard,

627
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,040
very hard.

628
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,599
I got the first place
in exams every year.

629
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
And I went to a good university finally.

630
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,160
When other students were enjoying love

631
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:22,760
and campus life,

632
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,319
I kept studying.

633
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,560
I remembered when I was in school,

634
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,040
all male students were living
in the same floor in the dormitory.

635
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,640
It's about something of food,

636
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,160
and I argued with another student.

637
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:41,560
He bought two boxes of milk,

638
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,800
and he shouted at the dormitory

639
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,520
that everyone got one

640
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,239
except Lin Xiangyuan.

641
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,000
I cried all the night,

642
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,880
thinking about

643
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,280
why I was so poor.

644
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,280
Other students were enjoying their life.

645
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:11,319
But me,

646
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,400
I had to work and earn money.

647
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,119
I had to pay the tuition.

648
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,160
After the graduation,

649
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,439
I found a job.

650
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,239
I was careful all the time,

651
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,920
hiding my tempers and feelings.

652
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,400
OK, now,

653
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,599
I got some achievements.

654
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,800
So what?

655
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,239
I could buy a house,

656
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,719
but not a home.

657
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,800
I worked so hard with my efforts,

658
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,400
and it turns out that I am still poor

659
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,000
with nothing left.

660
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,359
Young man,

661
00:34:05,239 --> 00:34:06,280
we, as humans,

662
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:09,120
cannot expect all things to be perfect.

663
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,760
We all have tough times.

664
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,840
That's true for everyone.

665
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
You've got so many things.

666
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,800
You don't understand.

667
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,159
You are richer than me.

668
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,800
At least when it's New Year's Eve,

669
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,479
you've got someone waiting for you.

670
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,479
OK.

671
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
I shall not keep you
away from your families.

672
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,760
Thank you for listening to me.

673
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:06,959
I'm leaving.

674
00:35:07,456 --> 00:35:08,960
(Business Hour. Reservation Number)

675
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Come back. This is too much.

676
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,040
Money doesn't matter.

677
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,399
Happy New Year!

678
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,600
Happy New Year!

679
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,280
OK, got it. Please rest assured.

680
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,679
Next one.

681
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,719
Mr. Lei, look.

682
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,879
It's really nice.

683
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,919
Is it nice?

684
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,439
Your phone.

685
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:54,960
(Unknown number)

686
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,919
-Hello.
-Dad, it's me.

687
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,840
Yuzheng...

688
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,520
Where are you?

689
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm abroad.

690
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,520
Today is Spring Festival's Eve.

691
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:18,040
I shall say Happy New Year to you.

692
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,600
Wish you healthy and live long.

693
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:29,360
Dad, I miss you.

694
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,879
Me too.

695
00:36:32,959 --> 00:36:35,479
But don't worry about me.

696
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,399
You focus on your work.

697
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,719
I am here

698
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,959
with many good people.

699
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,719
I will find someone to talk to you.

700
00:36:45,344 --> 00:36:46,176
(Unknown number)

701
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,399
You talk to him.

702
00:36:54,399 --> 00:36:55,239
It's me.

703
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,919
Happy New Year!

704
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,040
You too!

705
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,919
Yuzheng,

706
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:19,439
we are very happy this year,

707
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,439
with so many people together.

708
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,639
Well, my parents,

709
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,439
Aunt Shao and Qunfei,

710
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,399
we are here having dinner together.

711
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:31,840
It's fun.

712
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
Also,

713
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,800
they were snatching red
packets during dinner.

714
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,399
We are all doing very well.

715
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,520
So, take care of yourself.

716
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,919
Mr. Lei, I am Qunfei.

717
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,239
Yuzheng, can you hear me?

718
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,800
I am Aunt Shao.

719
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,879
I can hear everyone,

720
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:02,760
Qunfei

721
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,000
and Aunt Shao.

722
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,239
Yuzheng, Happy New Year and take care!

723
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:12,840
Wish you Happy New Year!

724
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,199
I miss you so much.

725
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,719
This is it.

726
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:31,639
I gotta go.

727
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,800
I'm wondering
where is Lin Xiangyuan now.

728
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,399
Give him a call.

729
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,159
Dad.

730
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,639
Xiangyuan, are you at home already?

731
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,199
Dad, I just got off the plane.

732
00:39:18,879 --> 00:39:20,199
Just got off the plane?

733
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,679
When you are home,

734
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:23,959
send us a message.

735
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,919
Say hello to your mom on behalf of us.

736
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,800
OK, thanks, dad. Happy New Year!

737
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:32,560
Fanlv, talk to Xiangyuan.

738
00:39:33,919 --> 00:39:35,040
Just a few words.

739
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:45,399
Where are you now?

740
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,879
Just got off the plane.

741
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:53,399
I'm going to catch the high-speed train.

742
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,679
Sounds quiet around you.

743
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,679
People are celebrating spring festival.

744
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,560
