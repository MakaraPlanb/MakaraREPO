Qunfei,

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,800
this bar is just so so.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Anyone can come here.

19
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:38,360
What do you mean?

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,399
There is someone here
who has done bad things behind.

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,800
Well, Mr. Lin,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,600
does that sound bad?

23
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:46,800
Shangguan,

24
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:49,639
if you really want to help Lei Yuzheng,

25
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,399
don't waste time here with me.

26
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,759
Lin Xiangyuan,

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,679
don't be too complacent.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,000
There will be a day when
you admit defeat.

29
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,279
Is it useful to talk to me like that?

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,520
What are you doing, He Qunfei?

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,600
Come out, He Qunfei.

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,279
Go.

33
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:23,440
Let's go.

34
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,199
OK.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
Lost your partner?

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,520
Siqi, don't be like this.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,399
I'm still an intern.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,360
I will be fired if I'm not doing my job.

39
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:42,080
Just one simple question.

40
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,800
Is Lin Xiangyuan torturing you?

41
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,039
Yes.

42
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,360
Even if he's torturing you,

43
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,759
there is nothing else you can try?

44
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,199
Why do you have to be a waiter?

45
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,839
It's my own business.

46
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,320
Just leave me alone.

47
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,000
You still hate me, don't you?

48
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,880
You give yourself up like this.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,720
It is intentional, isn't it?

50
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,759
I don't hate you.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,639
You're a woman.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,520
You deserve a better life.

53
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,639
I am such a loser.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,240
I'm nothing now and

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,160
a mixture of failure.

56
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,559
It is a right choice

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,080
for us to be apart.

58
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,079
Look, what time is it?

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,959
Why hasn't the child come back?

60
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,200
Du, you have to join me later.

61
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,760
Teach her a lesson.

62
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,040
You cannot let her
do whatever she wants.

63
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,399
Are you listening?

64
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:10,119
Du, since you came back from Lei's,

65
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,000
you're always absent-minded.

66
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,399
What is wrong with you?

67
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,359
Do you have anything on your mind?

68
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,040
What's the matter with you?

69
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm fine.

70
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,760
Maybe I'm a little tired today.

71
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,440
You're back.

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,799
Dad, mom.

73
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,799
Your supper is so late.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,720
Look, what time is it now?

75
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,559
We are waiting for you.

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,440
Why are you doing this to us?

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Your father and I came all
the way here to see you.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,760
And you...

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,640
A babysitter in
someone else's house now.

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,079
Mom...

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,079
Close the studio.

82
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
Come back to hometown with us tomorrow.

83
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,279
I'm doing very well in Shanghai.

84
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,880
Why going back?

85
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,720
You are doing well?

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,359
OK, you can decide by yourself.

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,559
You have to promise me

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,519
that you will not
go to Lei's house anymore.

89
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,959
How is that going to work?

90
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,160
Lei Yuzheng is not convenient now.

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,320
His father needs someone
to take care of him.

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,320
It's his own business,

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,040
and has nothing to do with you.

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,359
You are a girl,

95
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,359
and now you are taking care of
a prisoner's family.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,679
It's a shame!

97
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:19,760
You know?

98
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:21,559
Luckily, it's in Shanghai.

99
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,799
If it is in our hometown,

100
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:25,040
you'll be gossiped about.

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,279
What are you doing? Say something.

102
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,519
Xiaosu just wanted to offer help.

103
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,799
How about this?

104
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
It's late today.

105
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,679
Everyone stays calm.

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,119
Let's talk about it in a couple of days.

107
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:40,760
Well,

108
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,040
you've had a hard time
coming here all the way.

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,920
Let's go to bed early after dinner.

110
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,399
I'm going back to my room.

111
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,359
Du Maokai, what's wrong with you?

112
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,440
She is the child of my own?

113
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,160
I have to worry about her all by myself?

114
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,079
I don't want to eat anymore.

115
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,839
Dad,

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,279
is my mom still mad at us?

117
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,079
It's been several days

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,799
and she still doesn't
want to talk to us.

119
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,079
You didn't do it right
in the first place.

120
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,200
I can't blame your mother
for being angry.

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you mad at me?

122
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,600
You are not a little girl anymore
and it's useless to blame you.

123
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,440
But Xiaosu,

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,519
when you do a good thing,
you have to do it properly.

125
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,399
You can help him for a while.

126
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,200
But you can't help him forever.

127
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:40,760
There are some things

128
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,959
that you can just show your kindness.

129
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:52,399
Dad, you and Aunt Shao,

130
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:54,480
do you know each other?

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,679
How do you know that?

132
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,239
In fact, I never told you that

133
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
Aunt Shao is Zhenrong's mother.

134
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,320
I also know that

135
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,079
when you two were young,

136
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
you were in love.

137
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,959
I just wanted to tell you

138
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,359
no matter what happened between

139
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,880
you and Aunt Shao,

140
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
you two must make it clear.

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't keep it in heart

142
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,920
and make it a regret.

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,279
Mr. Lin.

144
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,480
Lei Yuzheng's golf club is nice to use.

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,640
What's the matter?

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,279
I have booked flight tickets
for you and Miss Jiang.

147
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,799
The plane leaves the day
after tomorrow in the morning.

148
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,200
As for when you get off the plane...

149
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,119
All right, you don't have to
worry about that.

150
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
I'll take care of it.

151
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
OK.

152
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,159
You will go home with your wife
and your kid for the Spring Festival.

153
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,000
When aunt knows,

154
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,479
she must be very happy.

155
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,200
Exactly.

156
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,039
I worked so hard these years,

157
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,479
just for this day to come.

158
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,479
Yes.

159
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:14,619
(Jiang Fanlv)

160
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:16,559
Fanlv.

161
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,679
Dad came back?

162
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:21,239
All right. I'll be right back.

163
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:24,679
Mom.

164
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,679
Go away.

165
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Get up.

166
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,039
Mom, do you remember?

167
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,799
When I was a little kid,

168
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,039
there was an old lady downstairs.

169
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
That was an old woman
without any relatives.

170
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,320
You and my dad sometimes

171
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,719
sent her some oil, rice or others.

172
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,039
You taught me since I was young

173
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,880
that I should be kind and helpful.

174
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,760
I'm following your advice.

175
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,440
That's why I went to look after Mr. Lei.

176
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,599
Mom.

177
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Mom.

178
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,440
To be honest,

179
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,239
Lei Yuzheng is very pathetic now.

180
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,719
He was being set up.

181
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,359
And Mr. Lei was shocked by this.

182
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,880
That's why he's like that now.

183
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
Also,

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,719
in fact, Lei Yuzheng
helped me a lot.

185
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,559
Once I was working on
a construction site,

186
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,400
suddenly I fainted.

187
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,679
It was Lei Yuzheng who
sent me to the hospital.

188
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
The house that Zhenrong and I lived in,

189
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,159
Lei Yuzheng saved it for us.

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,159
Actually, he's a good guy.

191
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,000
I apologize now. Will you accept it?

192
00:09:30,239 --> 00:09:31,760
Will you forgive me?

193
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,039
A girl's youth is more
precious than gold.

194
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
If he'd be in jail for
three or five years,

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,679
you don't care?

196
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,000
It's his own business.

197
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:44,599
There's nothing to do with me.

198
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:46,400
I am serious.

199
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,119
Look at me.

200
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,159
Tell me the truth.

201
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:52,599
Do you like him?

202
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,159
I am just worrying about you.

203
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,760
You have been hurt once,

204
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,760
and you've had a rough time.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,520
Why do you choose such a tough way?

206
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,799
My silly girl.

207
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,960
I hope you can be happy.

208
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:21,960
Then I can be settled.

209
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,400
Xiangyuan,

210
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,599
everything is OK in the company?

211
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,080
Dad,

212
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:34,119
you can rest assured.

213
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,239
Everything goes well.

214
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,960
Here.

215
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,559
It's going to be Spring Festival.

216
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,039
Do you two have any plans?

217
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,000
-Dad…
-Dad, we are staying with you.

218
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,200
Dad,

219
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,359
I want to take Fanlv to my hometown.

220
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:55,840
Go back to your hometown?

221
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,960
Lin Xiangyuan, are you kidding me?

222
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,599
Fanlv,

223
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,799
it's time for you to go back with him.

224
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,239
You got married very simply.

225
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:09,520
His mom has not even seen
her daughter-in-law.

226
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,640
It's Spring Festival.

227
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,559
If you don't go back and see her,

228
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,400
it's too rude.

229
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:17,599
My mother is dying to have you back.

230
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,679
She knows you will come back,

231
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,719
so she redecorated

232
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,520
the house in the hometown.

233
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,919
So what?

234
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,119
It doesn't matter.

235
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,159
Dad, you don't even know.

236
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,599
His hometown is a place
with poor transportation.

237
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:34,640
I'm pregnant.

238
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,440
I cannot go there in an ox cart.

239
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,440
That was years ago.

240
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,559
You can't even see an ox cart right now.

241
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,239
Last year, the train station was ready.

242
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,119
We can go to Guiyang by plane.

243
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,119
When we get off the plane,
we can take the high-speed train.

244
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,280
When we get off the high-speed train,
we are home.

245
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,440
So what?

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,280
I won't get used to it there.

247
00:11:56,479 --> 00:11:58,359
Am I going there for hardship,
or for the Spring Festival?

248
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,960
How about this?

249
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,880
We take things from Shanghai with us.

250
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,080
Whatever you want to eat, I'll buy.

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,000
You're just trying to convince me.

252
00:12:08,119 --> 00:12:10,000
You go back on your own,
and I won't stop you.

253
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,080
Or,

254
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,239
you ask your mom to come to Shanghai.

255
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,880
That's a way to deal with it.

256
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,719
Xiangyuan,

257
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,039
how about letting them come over.

258
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,400
And they can have fun in Shanghai.

259
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:29,520
Dad,

260
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:31,559
you don't know our customs.

261
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,599
A new daughter-in-law
in the first year

262
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,000
has to go back.

263
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:38,840
If Fanlv doesn't come home with me,

264
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:44,080
the neighbors will laugh at my mom.

265
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,039
Is it your mother's face that matters

266
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
or my child's safety that matters?

267
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,919
The doctor told me to be
careful and rest quietly.

268
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,799
Emotions must not fluctuate.

269
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,640
I feel not good even in Shanghai.

270
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,280
And now you want me to
take a long journey.

271
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,479
If there's anything wrong,

272
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,799
who should take the responsibility?

273
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,239
Exactly.

274
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,679
It's OK if you don't want to go with me.

275
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,119
It's fine.

276
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,640
I will just go by myself.

277
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,400
Fanlv, remember that

278
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,239
you should buy some gifts for her mom.

279
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,359
When it's New Year's Eve,

280
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:24,200
call his mother and present greetings.

281
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,159
Tell her that you are
sorry and explain it.

282
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,559
Do you hear that?

283
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,159
Got it.

284
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,159
Xiangyuan, this time

285
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,239
I brought back a lot of nourishment.

286
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,760
You can pick up some good ones later.

287
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,200
Take them back to your mother.

288
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,960
And say hello to her.

289
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
OK, dad.

290
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,320
Got it.

291
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,559
Welcome.

292
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,559
How have you been these years?

293
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,640
I let you down for what happened.

294
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,719
I shouldn't have promised to
go with you but didn't show up.

295
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,200
Can you forgive me for what I did?

296
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Forgive?

297
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,440
Impossible.

298
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,840
Du Maokai,

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,159
I wish we have never met each other.

300
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,039
I'd rather wish

301
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
we shall never meet in the future.

302
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,919
Kaixuan!

303
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:09,400
I had reasons at the time.

304
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
On my way to meet you,

305
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:14,719
I ran into a car accident.

306
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Please wait. I need to get off.

307
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,960
God, oh my god.

308
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,119
I don't know how bad it is.

309
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,599
Yes, I cannot tell.

310
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,080
What are you still wondering
about? Call the doctor.

311
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,400
-Give me a hand.
-Give him a hand.

312
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,400
The woman I sent to the hospital

313
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,200
was Ruohua, Xiaosu's mother.

314
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,719
Doctor, is she all right?

315
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,400
Temporarily out of danger.

316
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,119
You'd better pay the bill first.

317
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,840
You misunderstood. I don't know her.

318
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,719
Didn't you send her over?

319
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,119
Yes, it is me.

320
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,039
But I met her on the way
to somewhere.

321
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,919
Seriously, just let me go.

322
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,559
I have other things to do.

323
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,079
It will be too late.

324
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
I don't think so.

325
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,239
You'd better wait until the
patient wakes up.

326
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:41,839
Later on,

327
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,160
she was rescued with much effort

328
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,199
and woke up.

329
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,560
I was going to buy a ticket to
Shanghai to see you.

330
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,680
But who could predict
the sequela after bumping?

331
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
Ruohua suddenly lost her sight.

332
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,719
Later, I knew she was an orphan.

333
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:03,959
She suffered a lot,

334
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,599
and there was no one around
to take care of her.

335
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,959
I was...

336
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,800
I couldn't be assured.

337
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,479
I saved her after all,

338
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,319
so I stayed to look after her.

339
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,599
I thought I should wait
until she recovered.

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,199
And then I could decide whatever.

341
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,199
I kept taking care of her.

342
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
And when she recovered,

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,920
it was the next spring.

344
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,319
You are awake.

345
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,160
Then why didn't you tell me?

346
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,400
You thought I was unreasonable?

347
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,400
If I had known that

348
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
you did not keep your words
because of that,

349
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,800
I would not have blamed you.

350
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,520
I haven't been able to
reach you since then.

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I thought you were blaming me
and wanting to break up with me.

352
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,359
And I gave it up.

353
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,599
And afterwards,

354
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,040
I married Ruohua

355
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,520
and we had Xiaosu.

356
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,680
Kaixuan, it's been so many years.

357
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,800
Look at us.

358
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,319
We are both middle-aged.

359
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,119
We should let it go. Am I right?

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,520
Spring Festival is coming.

361
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,839
Are you going back to your hometown?

362
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:49,920
I...

363
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,680
I broke up with my girlfriend.

364
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,119
I lost my job.

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,319
How should I have the guts to go back?

366
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:05,160
I heard about that from Siqi.

367
00:19:06,439 --> 00:19:07,479
What about you, Xiaosu?

368
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,880
Will you go back?

369
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,479
My parents came to Shanghai.

370
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,400
We decided to celebrate in Shanghai.

371
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,079
Qunfei,

372
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,680
I suddenly got a good idea.

373
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,719
You have a great daughter.

374
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,079
She not only takes care of Lei's father,

375
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,199
but also moves to his house
during Spring Festival.

376
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,920
Mr. Lei, look.
(Blessing)

377
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,439
Happiness is here.

378
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,400
That's what it means.

379
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,959
Come and tell me, Mr. Lei.

380
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,000
Where should I paste it?

381
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,400
Great, higher, higher.

382
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,800
OK, here.

383
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,079
-Good-looking.
-Cheese!

384
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,599
You spoiled the child.

385
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
Increasingly absurd.

386
00:19:55,199 --> 00:19:56,160
You are blaming me?

387
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,680
Who said yes to that?

388
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,479
What else can I do?

389
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,839
Mr. Lei is old now.

390
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,560
And he is not clear in his mind.

391
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
His child is not around
even during Spring Festival.

392
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,119
I cannot bear that.

393
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,319
Yes.

394
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:12,560
Uncle Duan took nice pictures for us.

395
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,959
Look at your smiling eyes.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Xiaosu,

397
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,199
you are so clever

398
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,719
to let us stay together
for the Spring Festival.

399
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,359
We haven't had so many
people in the house

400
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,760
for a long time.

401
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,520
It would be nice if Yuzheng is here.

402
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,640
Uncle Duan, don't be like this.

403
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
It's Spring Festival.

404
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,479
If it is heard by Mr. Lei,

405
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
he would be upset.

406
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,839
OK, got it.

407
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,439
You two talk with Mr. Lei.

408
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll go to see how my parents' cooking

409
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,319
is going.

410
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,880
Must be very good.

411
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,079
Mr. Lei,

412
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,160
Miss Du's parents

413
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,920
come here today for cooking for us.

414
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,319
All delicious food.

415
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,640
Delicious food?

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,920
Hurry up, I'm hungry.

417
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,079
OK, let's eat.

418
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:52,760
It's great to be hungry.

419
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,079
Eat more later.

420
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:57,959
It smells good.

421
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,520
So much dishes already.

422
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,280
And my favorite meatballs.

423
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,280
Let me...

424
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,239
Did you wash your hands?

425
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,280
Come, come, have a bite.

426
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,479
I'm just following my dad's lead.

427
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,079
If my dad wasn't kind and righteous

428
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,839
to take you in,

429
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,359
how could you have me?

430
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:18,439
Is that right?

431
00:21:19,199 --> 00:21:20,640
My dear baby girl

432
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,199
is all your dad's credit,

433
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,079
not mine?

434
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,280
That's right.

435
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,520
Thank him for giving you
such a fine daughter.

436
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,719
Fine. Appreciated.

437
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,000
Thank you.

438
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,439
Dad, mom,

439
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,239
thank you both very much this time.

440
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:36,560
Show me that with some actions.

441
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
A kiss.

442
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
A kiss.

443
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,239
Oh, my dear girl.

444
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,640
Xiaosu,

445
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,119
don't you have friends coming?

446
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,680
Already here or not?

447
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:51,680
Not yet.

448
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:54,319
But I think she'll come.

449
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,079
What are you doing?

450
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,160
Hiding something from us?

451
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,839
Go back to your hometown?

452
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,760
Are you kidding me?

453
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,520
Xiangyuan,

454
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,959
be sure to come back this time

455
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,280
with your wife.

456
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,599
Mom wasn't there when you got married.

457
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:27,439
Everyone in the village laughed at me.

458
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,839
I can't even lift my head
in front of them.

459
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,959
It's your mother's face that matters

460
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:34,280
or the safety of my child?

461
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,599
Xiangyuan,

462
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,839
there's no reason not to have us meet.

463
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:44,920
This year, no matter what happens,

464
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,079
you have to take Fanlv back.

465
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,400
We people in the countryside

466
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,400
particularly care about

467
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,000
being together in the Spring Festival.

468
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,880
Mom's got nothing to say.

469
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,439
It's up to you.

470
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,528
(Shanghai Police Supervision)

471
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,800
Liu Sanjie who is good at singing
and dancing is waiting for you.

472
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,640
OK, it's done.

473
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,599
Mr. Lei,

474
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,640
these are all from my parents.

475
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,319
Which one you want to try first?

476
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:09,839
Mr. Lei, you have a good taste.

477
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,959
These meatballs

478
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,959
are my mother's specialty.

479
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,880
I've never stopped loving it
since my childhood.

480
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,640
Here, try one.

481
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,239
How's that?

482
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,800
Great.

483
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Let's have a toast.

484
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:29,359
Wish Mr. Lei Happy New Year.

485
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:31,359
Be happy and live long.

486
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:32,280
And

487
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:35,079
get well soon in good mood.

488
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:36,800
Here, cheers.

489
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,160
Get well soon.

490
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:39,520
Ms. Shao is here.

491
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,359
-Aunt Shao.
-Ms. Shao, come on.

492
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,280
Hello, I am late.

493
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,800
Lei, Happy New Year.

494
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,839
Xiaosu,

495
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:52,199
this is the mysterious
friend you spoke of?

496
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,079
Yes.

497
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,359
Come and have a seat.

498
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,000
Aunt Shao, please come.

499
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,400
You sit over here.

500
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,880
This is the seat
I have reserved for you.

501
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:09,839
All right, everybody's here.

502
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's begin.

503
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,079
OK.

504
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,359
Let's toast

505
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:14,479
to wish the new year

506
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,239
to be happy and prosperous.

507
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,880
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

508
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,520
Xiangyuan.

509
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,439
Mom.

510
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,040
I have something to tell you.

511
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,199
We have an emergency in our company.

512
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,160
I won't go home for the
Spring Festival this year.

513
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,800
You need to work during
the Spring Festival?

514
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,520
Yes, there's some emergency.

515
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:03,959
I have to go abroad for business stuff.

516
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,520
You are going abroad?

517
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,719
What about Fanlv?

518
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,040
Fanlv...

519
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,839
She's not in good health.

520
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,119
You are not lying to me, aren't you?

521
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
No, I am not.

522
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:16,640
It's true.

523
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,400
I don't believe it.

524
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,920
Mom, don't be upset.

525
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,000
It's true.

526
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:21,680
I can go back to home next year.

527
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,439
I don't care.

528
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:23,160
Well...

529
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,560
You have to bring Fanlv back.

530
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,199
Mom, listen to me. Don't be mad.

531
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:26,880
Mom...

532
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,640
It's hard to get everyone
together today.

533
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:49,640
I would like to take this
opportunity to say a few words.

534
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,800
Firstly, to Mr. Lei.

535
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,800
Happy New Year!

536
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,719
I hope Yuzheng will come back soon.

537
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,079
What Aunt Shao means is that

538
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,560
she hopes Yuzheng can come back soon
to accompany you.

539
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,119
Yes, back, back.

540
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,439
Yes, come back.

541
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,959
Then, to Xiaosu.

542
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
Aunt Shao.

543
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,040
Aunt Shao did something wrong to you

544
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,319
out of misunderstanding.

545
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,599
I apologize to you.

546
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,680
Will you forgive me?

547
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,599
What are you talking about, Aunt Shao?

548
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,839
You are Zhenrong's mom.

549
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,520
For me,

550
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:45,119
you are like my own mom.

551
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,359
There's no daughter

552
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,439
feeling angry to parents.

553
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:51,280
Here, bottoms up.

554
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,920
Happy New Year!

555
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:00,280
Happy New year!

556
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,599
Here.

557
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
The third one,

558
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,359
to everyone here.

559
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,880
In the past year,

560
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:15,959
a lot of things happened.

561
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:17,880
Everyone worked hard.

562
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,640
So, I hope that,

563
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,239
in the coming new year,

564
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,000
everyone is going well,

565
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,359
and everyone's dreams come true.

566
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:26,880
OK, to all of us in the new year

567
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:27,920
to be happy

568
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,520
and lucky with dreams coming true.

569
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,719
Lucky with dreams coming true.

570
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,839
Great.

571
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,839
Yes.

572
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,560
There's still a guest

573
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,599
who's drinking alone.

574
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,560
Wait for me.

575
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,359
I will convince him to go home.

576
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,760
Young man,

577
00:29:04,239 --> 00:29:05,400
it's Spring Festival.

578
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:07,239
Don't drink too much.

579
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,640
My husband

580
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,880
is urging me to go home for
festival dinner.

581
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:14,839
Could you please let me close up early?

582
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,319
Are you from Guizhou?

583
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,880
I come from Huaxi.

584
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,599
Are you from Guizhou too?

585
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,599
My hometown is not far from there.

586
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:30,920
It's already late,

587
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,439
but I don't know where to go.

588
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,160
Just for the sake of us
coming from the same place,

589
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,079
let me stay a little longer.

590
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:41,920
OK?

591
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,359
Young man,

592
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,079
why don't you go home?

593
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,040
Home?

594
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:02,400
I am different with you.

595
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,280
You have someone
waiting for you at home.

596
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,079
And me?

597
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,400
I don't want to go back to
my house in Shanghai.

598
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,760
I have no face to go back to Guizhou.

599
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,400
You have a house in Shanghai?

600
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,760
What else do you want?

601
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,079
Yes.

602
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,400
I bought my own house in Shanghai

603
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,079
and married a Shanghai lady.

604
00:30:32,199 --> 00:30:33,640
You are so lucky.

605
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,719
My husband and I

606
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,199
get up early every day,

607
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,640
keeping busy in this restaurant.

608
00:30:42,439 --> 00:30:44,959
We have been in Shanghai
for more than a decade.

609
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,560
But now,

610
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,520
we're still living in
a small rented apartment.

611
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,680
It's small even for a dog to live in.

612
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,880
My mom knows I'm married
to a Shanghai lady.

613
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,319
And she was happy to
prepare for our wedding.

614
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,760
Everything was done back in my hometown.

615
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,959
But my wife decided not
to have a ceremony.

616
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,079
It's Spring Festival now.

617
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,920
She should go home with me at least.

618
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,079
Let my mom see her in person.

619
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,199
But she doesn't want to.

620
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,160
She does not have a good temper.

621
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,839
And I don't want to let her win.

622
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,400
Did you work out after you got married?

623
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:25,760
It's hard.

624
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,959
Because my family is poor.

625
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,920
I was looked down upon all my life.

626
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,359
So, I studied hard,

627
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,040
very hard.

628
00:31:37,239 --> 00:31:38,599
I got the first place
in exams every year.

629
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
And I went to a good university finally.

630
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,160
When other students were enjoying love

631
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,760
and campus life,

632
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,319
I kept studying.

633
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,560
I remembered when I was in school,

634
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,040
all male students were living
in the same floor in the dormitory.

635
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,640
It's about something of food,

636
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,160
and I argued with another student.

637
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,560
He bought two boxes of milk,

638
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,800
and he shouted at the dormitory

639
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,520
that everyone got one

640
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,239
except Lin Xiangyuan.

641
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
I cried all the night,

642
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,880
thinking about

643
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,280
why I was so poor.

644
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:35,280
Other students were enjoying their life.

645
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,319
But me,

646
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:40,400
I had to work and earn money.

647
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,119
I had to pay the tuition.

648
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,160
After the graduation,

649
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,439
I found a job.

650
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,239
I was careful all the time,

651
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,920
hiding my tempers and feelings.

652
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,400
OK, now,

653
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,599
I got some achievements.

654
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,800
So what?

655
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:08,239
I could buy a house,

656
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,719
but not a home.

657
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,800
I worked so hard with my efforts,

658
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,400
and it turns out that I am still poor

659
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,000
with nothing left.

660
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,359
Young man,

661
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:31,280
we, as humans,

662
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,120
cannot expect all things to be perfect.

663
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,760
We all have tough times.

664
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,840
That's true for everyone.

665
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,679
You've got so many things.

666
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:45,800
You don't understand.

667
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:49,159
You are richer than me.

668
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,800
At least when it's New Year's Eve,

669
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,479
you've got someone waiting for you.

670
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:02,479
OK.

671
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,840
I shall not keep you
away from your families.

672
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,760
Thank you for listening to me.

673
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,959
I'm leaving.

674
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:33,960
(Business Hour. Reservation Number)

675
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
Come back. This is too much.

676
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,040
Money doesn't matter.

677
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,399
Happy New Year!

678
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:45,600
Happy New Year!

679
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,280
OK, got it. Please rest assured.

680
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,679
Next one.

681
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,719
Mr. Lei, look.

682
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,879
It's really nice.

683
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,919
Is it nice?

684
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,439
Your phone.

685
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:19,960
(Unknown number)

686
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,919
-Hello.
-Dad, it's me.

687
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,840
Yuzheng...

688
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Where are you?

689
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,320
I'm abroad.

690
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,520
Today is Spring Festival's Eve.

691
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:43,040
I shall say Happy New Year to you.

692
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,600
Wish you healthy and live long.

693
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,360
Dad, I miss you.

694
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,879
Me too.

695
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,479
But don't worry about me.

696
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,399
You focus on your work.

697
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:03,719
I am here

698
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,959
with many good people.

699
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,719
I will find someone to talk to you.

700
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:11,176
(Unknown number)

701
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,399
You talk to him.

702
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:20,239
It's me.

703
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,919
Happy New Year!

704
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,040
You too!

705
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,919
Yuzheng,

706
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:44,439
we are very happy this year,

707
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,439
with so many people together.

708
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,639
Well, my parents,

709
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,439
Aunt Shao and Qunfei,

710
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,399
we are here having dinner together.

711
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:56,840
It's fun.

712
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,800
Also,

713
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:02,800
they were snatching red
packets during dinner.

714
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,399
We are all doing very well.

715
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,520
So, take care of yourself.

716
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,919
Mr. Lei, I am Qunfei.

717
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,239
Yuzheng, can you hear me?

718
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,800
I am Aunt Shao.

719
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,879
I can hear everyone,

720
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:27,760
Qunfei

721
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,000
and Aunt Shao.

722
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,239
Yuzheng, Happy New Year and take care!

723
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,840
Wish you Happy New Year!

724
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,199
I miss you so much.

725
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,719
This is it.

726
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,639
I gotta go.

727
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,800
I'm wondering
where is Lin Xiangyuan now.

728
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,399
Give him a call.

729
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,159
Dad.

730
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:39,639
Xiangyuan, are you at home already?

731
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,199
Dad, I just got off the plane.

732
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:45,199
Just got off the plane?

733
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,679
When you are home,

734
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:48,959
send us a message.

735
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,919
Say hello to your mom on behalf of us.

736
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,800
OK, thanks, dad. Happy New Year!

737
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:57,560
Fanlv, talk to Xiangyuan.

738
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,040
Just a few words.

739
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,399
Where are you now?

740
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,879
Just got off the plane.

741
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,399
I'm going to catch the high-speed train.

742
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,679
Sounds quiet around you.

743
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,679
People are celebrating spring festival.

744
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
