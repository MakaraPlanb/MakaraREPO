Get married?

00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:30,839
Really?

18
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,680
Yes.

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,960
We just discussed it today.

20
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Such good news.

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,759
I didn't expect my baby girl

22
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,199
to figure it out so quickly.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
Mr. Jiang,
I have another good news for you.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,880
You will be a grandfather.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Fanlv, is that true?

26
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,279
Great!

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,759
By the way, Xiangyuan,

28
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:01,240
you should get your mother here

29
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:02,960
as soon as possible.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,639
Fanlv is pregnant.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,520
We should discuss

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,919
the wedding and arrange it soon.

33
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,240
OK. I'll inform them right away.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,320
I have determined the hotel,

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,559
the best hotel in Shanghai,
Binjiang Hotel.

36
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,520
In addition to friends,

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,080
I will invite business partners.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
Yes, invite all of them.

39
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,600
It is a great occasion for the Jiang's
to marry our girl.

40
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,199
We have to organize a large wedding.

41
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,800
Mr. Jiang,
that's what I'm thinking too.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,039
Don't worry.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,600
I will hold a grand wedding for Fanlv.

44
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:45,600
So, your father is not in good health.

45
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,880
I understand your feelings now.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,919
If your father is not present,

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,320
who will be in charge of Yutian?

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
The rival.

49
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,080
The one who set you up here, right?

50
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,119
Maybe.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,199
It seems that you want to
give up a rook to save the king.

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,320
Just like the pieces in your hand.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,399
When you hold them in your hand,

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,759
they seem useless.

55
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,880
But when you put them on the chessboard,

56
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,360
they will play their roles.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,800
No matter you
give up a rook to save the king,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,360
or the opposite,

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
there will be sacrifice.

60
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,039
Playing chess is the same as
being a human being.

61
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,479
There are losses and wins.

62
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,479
The cumulative number of losses

63
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,639
may lead to the final win.

64
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,959
Miss Jiang, these wedding rings
are selected by Mr. Lin.

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,359
Please have a look.

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,720
You can select a ring you like.

67
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,040
Miss Jiang, please take a look.

68
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
These three wedding dresses are
the most popular ones we have this year.

69
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,079
Is there any one you like?

70
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,720
Do you need a reservation?

71
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,399
Mom,

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,519
I have good news for you.

73
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to get married.

74
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,160
Of course, it's true.

75
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,959
Get ready to

76
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,359
come to Shanghai in the next few days.

77
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,239
Mr. Wei,

78
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,559
hello, this is Lin.

79
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,119
What? You already knew?

80
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,440
This is Xiangyuan,

81
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,839
and I'm going to get married.

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,279
I will definitely share his work

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,200
in the future,

84
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,239
and our business will be smoother.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,119
Miss Jiang,

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,720
this is our most popular bouquet
of the year.

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Are you satisfied with that?

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,519
Mr. Lin thought...

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,440
Enough! Get out.

90
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,880
I want to be alone for a while.

91
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:48,420
(Lin Xiangyuan)

92
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,239
Lin Xiangyuan, go to my father's office.

93
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:55,720
I want to talk to you.

94
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:05,799
Cancel the wedding?

95
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,000
It seems that
Miss Jiang is disrespectful to you.

96
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,399
Even if she is disrespectful to you,

97
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,880
she should not be disrespectful to
your mother.

98
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
She is your mother!

99
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,760
Take it slow.

100
00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:27,279
Be careful.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Mr. Lin,
you can have a nap in the car.

102
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,079
I will wake you up
when we arrive at your place.

103
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,920
Mr. Jiang,
there may be a problem with the car.

104
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,200
The car cannot be started.

105
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,440
What should I do?

106
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,160
I have to meet Mr. Xu.

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,799
How about taking Mr. Lin's car?

108
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,640
I just saw that
he went out with Miss Jiang.

109
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,839
Zhang, is your mobile phone ringing?

110
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,160
No.

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Mr. Lin,

112
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:52,839
is it convenient to talk?

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,839
Mr. Yu let me tell you that

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,799
he earned a lot this time,

115
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,359

but you achieved
unintentional positive outcomes.

has responsibility,

he was indeed wronged.

don't blame me for talking too much.

and several guests.

Mr. Jiang?

163
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Don't flatter me.

164
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,919

Lin Xiangyuan,

166

don't play the fool with me.

167
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,320
You're really good at business.

168
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,080
You killed three hawks with one arrow.

169
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,599
You ruined Lei Yuzheng,

170
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,000
built yourself up,

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,679

Mr. Jiang, calm down.

174
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,960
There must be misunderstanding.

175
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,159
Misunderstanding?

176
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,239
Tell me, who is Mr. Yu
that Xie Li was talking about?

Mr. Jiang.

178
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,679
You disappointed me too much.

179
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,239
I didn't expect that
the person I promoted

180
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,919
would do such a thing.

181
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,000
Mr. Jiang,

182
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,400
Lei Yuzheng's imprisonment really
has nothing to do with me.

183
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,039
I would never

184
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,400
dare to do that.

I saw Lei Yuzheng looked down on you

187
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:14,479
because he is the major shareholder

188
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,679
of Yutian Group.

189
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I was very angry.

190
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,159
I just don't like him,

191
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,919
but I never set him up on purpose

192
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,760
to such a serious extent.

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,440
Mr. Jiang, I swear

194
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,119
I didn't do it.

195
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,559
Shut up!

196
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,400
Lin Xiangyuan, still treating me
like a fool?

197
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,239
I've been in the business field
for decades.

198
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:43,440
I know one is always trying to
cheat the other in the business field.

199
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,280
But I have a bottom line.

200
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,320
Mr. Jiang.

201
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,119
Tell me,

202
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,719
how would I dare
to keep someone like you

203
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,760
with no moral bottom line around me?

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,159
How would I dare to let Fanlv
live with you for the rest of her life?

205
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,039
Mr. Jiang, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
I know that you don't trust me,

207
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,159
but I'm wholehearted to

208
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,359
you and Fanlv.

209
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,479
Shut up!

210
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,359
Mr. Jiang,

211
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,000
I have no complaints
no matter how you punish me,

212
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,719
but Fanlv and I are married,

213
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,719
and she is carrying my baby now.

214
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,440
If you put me in jail,

215
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,559
your grandson will be born

216
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,400
without a father.

217
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,239
Mr. Jiang,
I will make up for my mistakes.

218
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,559
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

219
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,440
I will return Yutian to him.

220
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,400
OK?

221
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:48,159
What's the use of making up for

222
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,239
what's already happened?

223
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:54,359
You know that

224
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,400
Fanlv and I
just registered our marriage.

225
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,799
Now, do you want her…

226
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,159
I swear that

227
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,039
I will love Fanlv and treat her well.

228
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,679
After Lei Yuzheng gets out of jail,

229
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:17,359
I will definitely return Yutian to him.

230
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:45,039
Fanlv, you're married today,

231
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,640
and I'm very happy for you.

232
00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:51,159
You're my baby girl,

233
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
and I always hope that

234
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,520
you can marry a good man who loves you.

235
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,280
But I also would like to warn you,

236
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,880
there is a gap
between the ideal and reality.

237
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,080
You need to learn to protect yourself.

238
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,359
Keep an eye on everything.

239
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,479
Remember?

240
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,440
Don't worry, dad.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,719
I won't leave you anyway.

242
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,400
If you have any grievance, just tell me.

243
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,679
Dad will always support you.

244
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:27,280
Mr. Jiang, a toast to you.

245
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,599
Since what is done cannot be undone,
I have nothing to say.

246
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,440
Xiangyuan, you should call me dad now.

247
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,640
Thank you, dad.

248
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,520
I have a word for you.

249
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,799
The moon waxes only to wane,
and water brims only to overflow.

250
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,039
Cherish what you've got now.

251
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:53,280
Leave some leeway for everything,

252
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,559
or you will lose more than
you've gained sooner or later.

253
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,359
Dad, I will keep that in mind.

254
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,919
Dad,

255
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,599
why are you being so weird today?

256
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,239
Nothing.

257
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,479
I just want to give some advice

258
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,760
about business to Xiangyuan.

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,119
Come on.

260
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,919
I wish you all the happiness.

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,919
May we have family harmony.

262
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,039
Here.

263
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:50,792
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

264
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,719
Lei Yuzheng.

265
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,359
Yes.

266
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,520
A woman called Shao Kaixuan
is here to see you,

267
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,840
and she is waiting in the audience room.

268
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,160
Hello, Aunt Shao.

269
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,959
Yuzheng, how are you doing there?

270
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,079
I'm fine. Don't worry.

271
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:57,959
Yuzheng, take care of yourself.

272
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,920
Zhenrong is gone,

273
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,880
and you're all that I have.

274
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,839
Remember,

275
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,199
where there is life, there is hope.

276
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,040
Be sure to take care of yourself.

277
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:11,400
Understand?

278
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,520
Aunt Shao, don't worry.

279
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,880
I've long since adapted to this place.

280
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,000
How is my father doing?

281
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,800
I forgot to tell you that

282
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,239
your father is doing well.

283
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,920
He is on vacation abroad.

284
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,479
Look,

285
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,160
your farther is getting old,

286
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,800
and he is worried about you

287
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,359
because he cannot see you.

288
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,040
But Assistant He told him that

289
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,239
you were busy
doing your own thing abroad.

290
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,359
And your father asked no more questions.

291
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Aunt Shao,
you don't have to say any more.

292
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,040
I trust you.

293
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
When I see my father in this situation,

294
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:10,800
I feel bad.

295
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,719
He is quite old now,

296
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,640
but I still have him worried.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,160
I'm not filial.

298
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:22,119
Yuzheng, I know that

299
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,400
what you've done is

300
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,520
to make Yutian

301
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,359
and the project survive.

302
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,040
Aunt Shao, don't worry.

303
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm fine.

304
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,560
You and my father

305
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:37,760
should take care of yourselves.

306
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,040
When I get out,
I will show filial piety to you.

307
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,800
I'm leaving.

308
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:54,728
(Jiangkan Detention Center)

309
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,439
Yes.

310
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,959
I understand.

311
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,920
OK, OK.

312
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,280
Mr. Jin, you can rest assured that

313
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,959
I will definitely show the simple,

314
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,640
modern, fashionable, high-end,
and magnificent style you like

315
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,000
at the lowest cost.

316
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,400
Do you think this is OK?

317
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,319
OK. Goodbye.

318
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,479
Du Xiaosu,

319
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,160
you're such a moneygrubber.

320
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,040
Only half a month left
before the Spring Festival,

321
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
and you receive so many orders.
Can you finish them in time?

322
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:29,959
Life is about making money.

323
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,680
Isn't that your motto?

324
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,520
No.

325
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:35,000
My motto is,
even if you don't earn money...

326
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,079
Who is that?

327
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,319
My mom.

328
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,199
Hello, mom.

329
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:45,119
Hello, daughter. When will you be home
for the Spring Festival break?

330
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,719
It's not easy to buy a ticket
if it's too late.

331
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
You need to book your flight
for the festival break earlier.

332
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,280
Don't be muddleheaded,

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,640
or you will be in a rush and muddle.

334
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,959
Xiaosu,

335
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:54,920
your mom started making

336
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,719
your favorite smoked fish yesterday.

337
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,920
We'll wait for you to eat that
when you return for the Spring Festival.

338
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,359
Dad and mom,

339
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,199
I was just about to
speak to you about this.

340
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,839
I may not go back home this year.

341
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,760
The studio is too busy,

342
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,959
and I cannot go back.

343
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,599
Fanlv.

344
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:28,400
Dad.

345
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,760
You're pregnant.

346
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,359
Why do you still
drive to work by yourself?

347
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,640
Where is Xiangyuan?

348
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,400
He drives you every day, doesn't he?

349
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,359
I sent him on an errand,

350
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,599
and he went out early in the morning.

351
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,560
Really?

352
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,920
He didn't bully you, right?

353
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:44,839
Him?

354
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,760
No. He treats me like a bodhisattva.

355
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,479
Don't worry.

356
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,839
Do you know who is

357
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,359
the model husband in our company?

358
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,719
Mr. Lin, right?

359
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:59,439
Of course.

360
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,479
Mr. Lin is so nice to Miss Jiang
to be nominated for "Touching China".

361
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,599
After Miss Jiang gets pregnant,

362
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,800
Mr. Lin even doesn't
dare to speak loudly.

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,160
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.
-Hello, Mr. and Miss Jiang.

364
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,079
Dad, don't listen to their nonsense.

365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,160
Xiangyuan treats you well,

366
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:18,800
and everyone sees that.

367
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:20,719
But you should have
a sense of propriety,

368
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,239
or they will think that

369
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:24,040
the Jiangs did not educate you well.

370
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,520
Mr. Jiang.

371
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,839
Mr. Lin is here.

372
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,880
Fanlv,

373
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
here are the yellow crab
and chicken porridge

374
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,359
I bought these especially for you.

375
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,119
I walked several blocks to get these.

376
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,880
Eat while they are still warm.

377
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:47,479
Xiangyuan,

378
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,119
come to my office later.

379
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,040
OK.

380
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,680
Let's go.

381
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,959
Xiangyuan,

382
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,719
I can see that
you have been treating Fanlv well

383
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,000
in the last few months,

384
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,079
and I'm delighted.

385
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:10,239
Mr. Jiang, I promised you that

386
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,560
I'd be nice to her.

387
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,520
And I will treat you as my own father.

388
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,560
That's all I should do.

389
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
As a parent,

390
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,880
my biggest wish is for my daughter

391
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:24,280
to marry a good man.

392
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:27,359
If you and Fanlv can

393
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:28,920
live a peaceful life,

394
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,199
it's the greatest filial piety to me.

395
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:34,560
About the mistake you made,

396
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,479
learn lessons from it

397
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,199
and never do that again.

398
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,640
I understand.

399
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,719
Tomorrow, I will go abroad
on a business trip,

400
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,479
and may not be back
until Spring Festival's Eve.

401
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,959
During my absence,

402
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:51,640
you take charge of the company.

403
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,359
Mr. Jiang, don't worry.

404
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:56,280
I will not disappoint you.

405
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,479
Bro,

406
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,319
what are you thinking about?

407
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,439
It seems that my father is really sick.

408
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,760
I didn't know my father might be sick,

409
00:23:23,199 --> 00:23:25,680
until the day
Aunt Shao gave me this photo.

410
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
To say the least,

411
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,479
if my father is good,

412
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,119
why doesn't he come to see me?

413
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Bro,

414
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,719
I know you are painful.

415
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:47,439
But all people living in this world

416
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,839
are painful more or less.

417
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,040
You should hide such pains
in your heart.

418
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,920
The more painful it is now,

419
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
the more you will want to live well

420
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,520
when you get out

421
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,640
in the future.

422
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,280
And in this way,
you can endure the life here.

423
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,599
Mr. Lin, you have obvious dark circles.

424
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,359
Are you OK?

425
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:25,719
Were you too tired last night?

426
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,319
Take care of yourself.

427
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,959
Lin Xiangyuan.

428
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,119
Lin Xiangyuan.

429
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,479
What are you doing
in the midnight?

430
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,800
Can you just sleep silently?

431
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,119
How can I fall asleep

432
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,479
when you keep snoring like that?

433
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,040
Don't be angry.
I will sleep on the sofa.

434
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,119
Annoying.

435
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,959
Can you just sleep silently?

436
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,319
How can I fall asleep

437
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:06,800
when you keep snoring like that?

438
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,880
Yes, it's me.

439
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:48,000
OK, I will notify Mr. Lin.

440
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:49,199
What?

441
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,560
Ning Weicheng said

442
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,760
Miss Jiang just threw up again
in the office,

443
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:54,599
so she asked for a month's leave.

444
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,439
He asked me to tell you this.

445
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,520
OK. Tell Ning Weicheng

446
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
to find someone to send her home.

447
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,079
Don't let her go alone.

448
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:05,239
OK.

449
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,280
He Qunfei was assigned
to the data and file room

450
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,319
as a clerk

451
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,239
to do odds and ends.

452
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,319
You thought about firing him before,
didn't you?

453
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,479
But Miss Jiang stopped it.

454
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,239
How do you know that?

455
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,920
I know a lot of things.

456
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,280
You don't have to fire him.

457
00:26:32,479 --> 00:26:34,040
You can transfer him to
the logistics department

458
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,800
to manage the cleaning
of the entire building, instead.

459
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,160
Make him inspect the hygiene every day.

460
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,800
You're so mean.

461
00:26:43,479 --> 00:26:44,920
Mr. Lin, you complimented me again。

462
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:47,119
Let's walk and talk.

463
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,560
Supervisor He, you mean I have to leave?

464
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,079
I'm surprised too.

465
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,400
You were here just a few days ago,

466
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
and did nothing wrong.

467
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:12,800
But look,

468
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,439
the executive office
suddenly issued an order

469
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,040
to transfer you to the logistics
department to manage the hygiene.

470
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,599
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

471
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,000
It's right for you to be loyal
to Mr. Lei,

472
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
but now it is not like the old days.

473
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:25,959
You have to accommodate
yourself to the circumstance.

474
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:32,239
Mr. Lin, Mr. Xie, what brought you here?

475
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,719
I'll get you two cups of tea.

476
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:42,359
Lin Xiangyuan, you're so mean
to get me in trouble on purpose.

477
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,160
Listen, a small-minded person like you

478
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,079
will never achieve great things.

479
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,119
Achieving great things or not

480
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,520
seems to have nothing to do with you.

481
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,119
But at least for now,

482
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:57,880
you have to do whatever

483
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,599
Mr. Lin wants you to do.

484
00:28:02,199 --> 00:28:04,100
(Employee Job Adjustment Notice)

485

(Recruitment. Interviewees wait here)

488
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,199
Who is No. 10, He Qunfei?

489
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,760
Nice to meet you.

490
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,859
(Resume of He Qunfei)

491
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,439
Mr. He, I'm curious that

492
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,760
why do you leave Yutian

493
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,119
where so many people want

494
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,800
to work.

495
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,040
Because...

496
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
As far as I know,

497
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,880
you and the current CEO of Yutian,

498
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,479
Mr. Lin Xiangyuan, have disputes.
(Applicant)

499
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,599
That's not the case.

500
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:11,959
Then,

501
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,040
why are you applying for a job here?
(Interviewer. Assistant)

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Sorry, Mr. He.

503
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,640
You'd better go to another company

504
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,439
to take a chance,

505
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,239
or change the industry.

506
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:22,920
Thank you.

507
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,199
Such a beautiful girl.

508
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,839
Me?

509
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,160
Of course, it's you.

510
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,319
What will we eat later?

511
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,760
As you want.

512
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,640
Eat…

513
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,640
Shangguan.

514
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,640
What a coincidence!

515
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,199
What a coincidence!

516
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,760
Who is this beautiful girl?

517
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,280
Hello, I'm his girlfriend.

518
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,400
She is my cousin.

519
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,439
Shopping with your cousin?

520
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:49,199
OK. See you.

521
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:50,359
-Bye.
-Bye.

522
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,760
What?

523
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,760
What do you mean?

524
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm your cousin?

525
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,199
Am I embarrassing you?

526
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,599
You misunderstood me.

527
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,239
This friend of mine

528
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:06,560
is gossipy.

529
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,560
If he knows that you're my girlfriend,

530
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,599
everyone will know that.

531
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,319
So what? Is it embarrassing

532
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,560
to have a girlfriend?

533
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,400
You just have fun with me?

534
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
What are you talking about?

535
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,959
I am true to you.

536
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,199
Even the sun and moon can see.

537
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,479
But...

538
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,880
I'm actually a very low-key person.

539
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:26,160
I really don't want to be
the subject of gossip

540
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,040
among those friends.

541
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,880
I swear,

542
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,599
if I'm not true to you,

543
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,280
I will...

544
00:30:35,439 --> 00:30:36,439
All right.

545
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,119
I trust you.

546
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,079
Show me your smile.

547
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:42,280
No.

548
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,359
Smile.

549
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,040
No.

550
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:45,439
Smile.

551
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm fine.

552
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,520
I'm a little uncomfortable.

553
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,280
Can you send me back?

554
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,920
Hello, sir.

555
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,280
Look, highly paid recruitment.

556
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,840
(High Salary Recruitment)

557
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,719
OK.

558
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,839
Here?

559
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,479
Yes, here.

560
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,479
I've checked on the phone.

561
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:35,760
Right.

562
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:39,040
You didn't even tell our daughter,

563
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,199
and you directly came to Shanghai.

564
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,640
You're not afraid of delaying her work?

565
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,359
-304.
-304.

566
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,839
301.

567
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,400
-301.
-Right, here.

568
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,400
Hello.

569
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Hello.

570
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,239
Who are you looking for?

571
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,280
Hello. We are looking for Du Xiaosu.

572
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,959
We... We're her parents.

573
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
We just came from our hometown.

574
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,199
Is she there?

575
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:02,599
Uncle and aunt,

576
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,520
please have a rest.

577
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,959
Where is Xiaosu?
She's not at work?

578
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,800
Is she sick?

579
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:08,880
No, no.

580
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,239
Xiaosu is fine.

581
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,319
But she is not here now.

582
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:18,479
She went to Lei's house
to look after an elderly person.

583
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:19,839
Lei's house?

584
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
To look after an elderly person?

585
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:24,520
Mr. Lei, look.

586
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,479
This is your favorite
red bean and glutinous rice porridge.

587
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:29,160
There are so many red beans.

588
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,599
Come on, take a sip.

589
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:35,880
Are you OK?

590
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:37,040
Let me wipe you off.

591
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:39,439
Go away.

592
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,520
I don't know you.

593
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,839
Don't you remember?

594
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,119
I'm the Marshmallow.

595
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,959
We're good friends.

596
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm not your good friend.

597
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,319
You're all bad people.

598
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,079
You imprison me here.

599
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,160
You want me to die.

600
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,079
Yuzheng, Yuzheng.

601
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,400
Get out.

602
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,239
Mr. Lei,

603
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,800
it's night time

604
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,280
over there now.

605
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,959
Your son is sleeping.

606
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,599
You'd better not to disturb him.

607
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Let's go to bed too.

608
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,839
Have a rest, OK?

609
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,359
I'm not sick. I don't take medicine.

610
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:14,959
It's OK. It's OK.

611
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,880
Let me clean here.

612
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,719
Marshmallow.

613
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,479
I'm OK. I'm fine.

614
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:33,159
Xiaosu, are you OK?

615
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:35,679
Are you injured?

616
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,239
Dad, mom,

617
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,919
why are you here?

618
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,120
If we're not here,

619
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,959
how long are you going
to hide this from us?

620
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,159
So much has happened.

621
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,760
Why didn't you tell us?

622
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:55,520
It's OK.

623
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,959
Marshmallow,

624
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:58,879
who are they?

625
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,479
Mr. Lei, don't worry or panic.

626
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,479
They're my parents, not bad people.

627
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:09,199
-Come here.
-Good people, good people.

628
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,120
You said you are busy and cannot
go back home during Spring Festival,

629
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,120
so this is what you are busy for?

630
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,719
I cannot believe you were lying to us.

631
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
If your father and I didn't see this,

632
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,560
we will never believe that

633
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,399
you're an accompanying nurse now.

634
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,840
Yes, Xiaosu,

635
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,879
how could you lie to us?

636
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,040
A girl in your company told us

637
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,159
that you are here.

638
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,879
I wanted to tell you this before,

639
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,320
but...

640
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm afraid I cannot explain it clearly.

641
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,959
Tell us,

642
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,159
what's the relationship
between you and Lei?

643
00:34:44,439 --> 00:34:45,959
If there is nothing between you,

644
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,360
why are you taking care of his father?

645
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,520
We're friends.

646
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:55,320
If the family of my friend have trouble,

647
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,919
I should help take care of them.

648
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,159
Help take care?

649
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,520
You think I don't know?

650
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:01,479
I have inquired before I came.

651
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:04,000
You make friends
with a person in the jail...

652
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,399
Mom, keep your voice down.

653
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:07,639
Mr. Lei doesn't know yet.

654
00:35:09,879 --> 00:35:10,800
Go back with me right now.

655
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,840
No, I cannot go.

656
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,600
Mr. Lei is here alone,

657
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,760
and the butler went out.

658
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,040
I have to stay here.

659
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,080
Marshmallow, I want to watch TV.

660
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
OK, I'm coming.

661
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,760
I really cannot go.

662
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,439
How about this?

663
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,919
You two go back first.

664
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,840
When the butler comes back,

665
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,280
I will go back. OK?

666
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,320
Fine.

667
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,320
Listen to Xiaosu. We go back first.

668
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
What's done is done.

669
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,560
No hurry at this moment.

670
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,320
You...
I don't know what to say about you.

671
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,159
Let's go.

672
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,639
Go.

673
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,439
The Big Head Son and Little Head Father
is going to start.

674
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,520
Hurry up.

675
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,560
Let's go.

676
00:35:48,879 --> 00:35:49,439
Go, go, go.

677
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,399
She is so...

678
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,000
Don't be angry.

679
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
Your daughter is playing the fool,

680
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,719
and you didn't stop her

681
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,040
but helped her instead.

682
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:57,919
I didn't help her.

683
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,919
No matter how serious the matter is,

684
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,479
we cannot make a noise
in other people's home.

685
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:01,120
Isn't it right?

686
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,399
She is spoiled by you.

687
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:03,719
You both...

688
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:06,439
It's weird.

689
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,520
Does Xiaosu like Mr. Lei?

690
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,199
Don't think so much.

691
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,600
Let's talk to her
after she comes back home.

692
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,159
She must give us a good explanation.

693
00:36:37,479 --> 00:36:38,679
Maokai, move.

694
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,280
I'm coming.

695
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,399
Mr. Lei,

696
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,280
let me pour you a cup of tea.

697
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,239
No, I want yogurt.

698
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:13,120
OK, yogurt.

699
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,719
But you have to take the medicine

700
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,239
after yogurt, OK?

701
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:19,879
Then I will take it away.

702
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,000
OK, OK, OK.

703
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,399
Ok. Have only one.

704
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:24,479
Drink.

705
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:30,000
Aunt Shao, you're here.

706
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,479
What's wrong with you?
You don't look very well.

707
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,239
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

708
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,800
It's him.

709
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:53,600
You often come here?

710
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,959
I came here sometimes for work.

711
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,840
Come and sit.

712
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,199
Waiter, open a bottle
of champagne.

713
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,360
Sit over here.
Don't be so far away from me.

714
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,399
Come on.

715
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:11,199
It's OK.

716
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,040
Sir, here is your champagne.

717
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,919
Thank you.

718
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:20,800
He Qunfei?

719
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,919
Why are you here?

720
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,919
He Qunfei.

721
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,040
You're Du Xiaosu's friend, right?

722
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,959
He is Du Xiaosu's friend.

723
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,199
We met before.

724
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,679
Why are you here?

725
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,040
Part-time job?

726
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,080
I'm on probation.

727
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,760
I don't know if they want me or not.

728
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,600
What a coincidence today!

729
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,479
So many acquaintances have met here.

730
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,199
Is this Assistant He?

731
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,280
Why are you here?

732
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,959
Part-time job, right?

733
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,479
That's reasonable. I'm afraid
the low salary of a cleaning supervisor

734
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,360
cannot even be enough to pay the rent.

735
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,919
Look at what you're wearing.

736
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:07,879
Is the small red bellyband

737
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:10,120
comfortable?

738
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:11,919
Mr. Lin,

739
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,239
if Lei Yuzheng sees that

740
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,239
Assistant He is serving us,
