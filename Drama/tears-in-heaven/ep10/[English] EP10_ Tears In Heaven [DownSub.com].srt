16
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,879
Miss Du is my schoolmate in college.

17
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,559
We haven't had much contact
since graduation.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,520
I didn't expect that

19
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,919
we can meet in this place.

20
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,320
Miss Du is working in Boyuan.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Xinsheng is now cooperating with Yutian.

22
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,000
Small world.

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,880
Isn't it?

24
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:27,279
So, Mr. Lin and Miss Du were schoolmates.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,600
This is called a meeting of old friends.

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,679
Mr. Lei, let's go back.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
Don't keep the guests waiting.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,880
Yuzheng,

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,160
what brought you here?

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,160
To meet someone for dinner
with Mr. Lin.

31
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:48,559
Boyuan is having a dinner party today?

32
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,199
Nope.

33
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,320
I'm dealing with some customers.

34
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,039
So I called Xiaosu over here

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,399
to come and help me.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,399
Yuzheng,

37
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm doing this for the sake of
the Group's performance.

38
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
That's why I'm working so hard.

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,880
Shouldn't you think about

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,000
how to reward me?

41
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,880
If you want to increase your salary,

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
that's easy.

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,279
But I'm afraid you despise that money.

44
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,520
That's not what I meant.

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,559
I mean...

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,720
Xiaosu, why are you still here?

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,880
Mr. Wei and others are
waiting for your toast.

48
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,240
Yuzheng, you don't even know

49
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:27,080
how cunning they are.

50
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,960
They seem to be very prudent,

51
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:32,199
and not willing to sign the contract.

52
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,720
You are not tolerant to alcohol,
so don't drink too much.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,639
If you drink too much,

54
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,000
no one can carry you back.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
I knew you would care for me.

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
Don't worry, Yuzheng.

57
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:45,679
It's our responsibility to be here.

58
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,279
Right, Xiaosu?

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,399
I'll go in first then.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,199
Mr. Lei, let's go back.

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,679
Thank you very much for
the hospitality, Miss Jiang!

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,679
Thank you for coming here, Mr. Wei.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,959
Miss Du is a good drinker.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,799
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,079
Nice to work with you.

66
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,119
See you.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
See you.

68
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,640
Miss Jiang, see you.

69
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,119
Xiaosu, how will you go back home?

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,679
Do you need a ride?

71
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,600
No, thanks, Miss Jiang.

72
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,440
I'll just take a taxi myself.

73
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,600
OK, I'll let you be.

74
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,359
Miss, shall I call you a cab?

75
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,160
No, I want to walk by myself.

76
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:03,920
OK.

is so attracting to you to wander alone?

85
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,519
Mr. Lei!

86
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,320
Are you sleepwalking?

87
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,880
You are so funny.

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,679
I just want to
walk down the street by myself.

89
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,959
Aren't you afraid of
encountering some bad guy

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
at this dark night?

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
Me?

92
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,399
It's hard to say.

93
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Maybe you'll run into a greedy one.

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,559
In the dark night like this,

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,720
anyone is OK.

96
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:31,559
And then,

97
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:33,959
he will put you into a woven bag

98
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,679
and drown you in the Huangpu River.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,239
It's scary to even think about it.

100
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Get in the car. I will give you a ride.

101
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,519
Didn't you hear me?

102
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:51,399
You are not afraid of being
put into a woven bag

103
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,760
and drowned in the Huangpu river?

104
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,720
And then,

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,239
you will disappear forever.

106
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,679
Here's the only chance.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,839
Fasten your seatbelt.

108
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
It seems that Miss Du

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,880
drank a lot today.

110
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:34,399
Not too much, just a little.

111
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,279
A little.

112
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,640
Enjoy all the pleasure in your life.

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,880
And never leave your
wine cup empty under the moonlight.

114
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It seems

115
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,320
you are upset.

116
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,040
Why are you laughing?

117
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,359
You know what?

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,279
You are really annoying.

119
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:10,440
Really?

120
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,839
I'm not surprised.

121
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,359
Don't you want to know why?

122
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,239
Tell me about it.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
Are you feeling particularly
good about yourself?

124
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,839
It makes sense.

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,839
Look at you.

126
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,679
Growing up in a wealthy family.

127
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,520
Highly educated and handsome.

128
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,719
It is natural to feel superior.

129
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:41,159
But,

130
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,440
don't you think this self-righteousness

131
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,599
and your proudness

132
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,400
are really annoying?

133
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,080
It feels like

134
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,080
you are going to tell
the truth after drinking.

135
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,080
That's the beauty of alcohol.

136
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,880
You always wrap yourself in a shell.

137
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,080
It looks good on the surface.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,960
But inside,

139
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,479
you are an extremely insecure person.

140
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Miss Du,

141
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:22,080
I advise you not to speculate
on other people's minds.

142
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,359
What makes you think that
you know me so well?

143
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
How could I?

144
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
By my intuition.

145
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,239
Do you know what it's like to
be stuck in a swamp?

146
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:40,479
Struggling only makes you fall
deeper and deeper.

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,640
Pray for someone to come to rescue you.

148
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,280
Bullshit!

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,679
No one can save you.

150
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,960
There is never anyone in this world

151
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,119
that cares about other people's
sorrow and pity.

152
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:58,119
Looks like my previous judgement
on you was right.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You are a heartless person.

154
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,919
You cannot feel any pain.

155
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,520
Your heart

156
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,559
is like a cold stone.

157
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:10,520
Fine.

158
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll take that sarcasm from you

159
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,200
as a compliment.

160
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,679
But I'm not like you,

161
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,960
drowning in your own misery every day.

162
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,200
Maybe.

163
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,559
Xiaosu!

164
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,640
Not again!

165
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:26,799
(He Qunfei)

166
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,280
He Qunfei,

167
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,119
what's wrong with your boss?

168
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,640
Since Xiaosu entered your company,

169
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,080
she has never been home
during normal time.

170
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,880
Devil indeed.

171
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Is that excessive for her?

172
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,159
She did that for work.

173
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,119
The competition in Boyuan is so fierce.

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
All she can do is to keep going.

175
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:47,000
You know all the reasoning!

176
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,719
How come I didn't see you
being more active?

177
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,119
Why don't you make some extra money?

178
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,280
How come you didn't do the hard
work and hustle of others?

179
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,719
Damn it!

180
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,280
Awake?

181
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Why didn't you wake me up?

182
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,919
Thank you for the ride.

183
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,479
I drank a little too much today.

184
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:21,919
I talked too much.

185
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,520
Just take it as a joke

186
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:25,599
and forget it.

187
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,880
It seems that you come back
from the alcohol.

188
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,200
Sometimes it's good
to listen to your true thoughts.

189
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:37,159
It is hard to hear someone
speak out the truth.

190
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,359
It's great.

191
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:42,320
Goodbye, Mr. Lei.

192
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,719
Miss Du,

193
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,960
actually, I've always had a question.

194
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,799
What exactly made you

195
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,200
break up with Zhenrong so suddenly?

196
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,200
It's because you fall in love
with someone else

197
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,679
or is it that you have secret troubles?

198
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,799
It's all about destiny.

199
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:12,679
You must have heard of it, right?

200
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:15,239
For us,

201
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:17,960
the only way to be free

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,599
is to let it go.

203
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,239
But who can really let it go?

204
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,200
Yuzheng.

205
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,000
Hello, Mr. Lei.

206
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,280
Fanlv.

207
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,320
Miss Du.

208
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:13,760
The elevator is here.

209
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,760
Mr. Lei, your special
elevator is over there.

210
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,479
Can't I get on this elevator?

211
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,760
Fanlv,

212
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,599
didn't you just get off that elevator?

213
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,520
Where are you going?

214
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,200
I left my car key in the office.

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,119
I'll go and take it.

216
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,520
Aren't you coming in?

217
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,280
I'm that scary?

218
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,080
When I come, you can't even
get on the elevator.

219
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,799
Yuzheng, look at this.

220
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,559
As soon as dinner was over yesterday,

221
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:06,640
Mr. Wei asked his secretary to

222
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,280
send me the contract.

223
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,799
How is that?

224
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,400
I put all the efforts into your matters.

225
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,599
Good job, Fanlv.

226
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,479
We all know that Mr. Wei
is a tough nut to crack.

227
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,280
You just started the company's business.

228
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:21,280
Very good. Keep going.

229
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,559
With your words, it's worth the efforts.

230
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,679
Oh,

231
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,799
why did you leave without me yesterday?

232
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,119
You didn't say anything to me,
so I was worried.

233
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,640
I dropped someone off last night.

234
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,919
I was home too late,
so I didn't contact you.

235
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
Who was so honored

236
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,320
to have that opportunity?

237
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,440
Du Xiaosu, were you OK last night?

238
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,479
Me?

239
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,559
I am fine.

240
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,320
No way.

241
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:55,280
The one you sent yesterday was Xiaosu?

242
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
I saw Du Xiaosu walking along the street
last night.

243
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,440
Just gave her a ride.

244
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:04,760
I see.

245
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
Du Xiaosu,

246
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,200
you dawdled there yesterday
for a long time.

247
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,880
You were waiting for his ride.

248
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,039
No, it's not like that.

249
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,400
Just a coincidence.

250
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,679
Coincidence?

251
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,119
Shanghai is so big, and there
are thousands of streets.

252
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,479
How did you get so lucky

253
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,840
and come across with Yuzheng?

254
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,039
Sorry, Mr. Lei.

255
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,559
Fanlv,

256
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:51,880
the elevator was angry after your talk.

257
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,359
Du Xiaosu,

258
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,239
you were

259
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,559
planning something on Yuzheng,
weren't you?

260
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
No wonder.

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,200
Yuzheng always takes care of you.

262
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,679
How could I ignore

263
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,280
there is such an outstanding girl
right by me?

264
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,760
Enough, Fanlv.

265
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,239
I got a few calls last night.

266
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,920
All from

267
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,640
the owners of some investment companies.

268
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,160
The situation is better than I thought.

269
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,280
They are all interested in the

270
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:25,959
Entertainment Center project.

271
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,239
All want to participate.

272
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,040
You think this is good?

273
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,439
Is it not?

274
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,719
Yutian has difficulties in cash flow.

275
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,719
The project always fails to start.

276
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
We're all looking forward to A round
financing.

277
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,959
It's OK now.

278
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:40,839
Our trouble

279
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,199
will be fixed easily.

280
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't think so.

281
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
Things that don't seem risky

282
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,839
are inherently the biggest risk.

283
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,959
Mr. Lei,

284
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,439
caution is good.

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
But I have to remind you

286
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,920
water from afar cannot
put out a fire nearby.

287
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,359
With my knowledge of Yutian's
financial situation,

288
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,319
I know it's not good.

289
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,000
If strategic investors are on board,

290
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:07,640
we will reduce the debt ratio of Yutian,

291
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,400
and get the Entertainment Center
project to start.

292
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,079
Isn't it beneficial for both sides?

293
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,160
Here.

294
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:14,680
Give me two days.

295
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,880
I'll think carefully about
what Mr. Lin said.

296
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
Mr. Lei, caution is necessary.

297
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,119
But there are some things that
need to be decided as soon as possible

298
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,959
to avoid some extra accidents.

299
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:28,880
Hi, Mr. Lin.

300
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,160
Enjoying some fresh air,
in the back garden.

301
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,800
Ting,

302
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,280
you've just got better

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,079
and now you start to walk around.

304
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,880
What's going on?

305
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,839
You don't want to admit you are not
a young boy?

306
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:57,680
Come.

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,560
Have a seat.

308
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,880
Ting,

309
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,160
health matters.

310
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,880
We can't compete with the young.

311
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:09,880
Well,

312
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:13,319
how is it going with the
Entertainment Center project?

313
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,359
Everything is fine.

314
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,920
Under Yuzheng's overall control,

315
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,560
it will be OK.

316
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
It's just...

317
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,239
Just?

318
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,479
Recently,

319
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,400
my assistant Lin

320
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,920
complained something to me.

321
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,760
The cooperation plan he prepared

322
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:40,640
was not approved by Yuzheng.

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,719
I wonder what he is hesitating about.

324
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
Yutian and Xinsheng

325
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,479
have entered an agreement
in cooperation.

326
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,920
Keep moving

327
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,199
is the right thing to do.

328
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,439
What do you think?

329
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,719
There's no need to worry about.

330
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:02,400
I'll handle it.

331
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,640
Thank you.

332
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,280
-Look forward to working with you!
-Look forward to working with you!

333
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,839
-Look forward to working with you!
-Look forward to working with you!

334
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,000
-Nice to work with you!
-Nice to work with you!

335
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,119
Fighting!

336
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,319
I am leaving.

337
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,280
Bye.

338
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,199
Bye.

339
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:49,839
Bye.

340
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,640
Yuzheng,

341
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,359
come and have tea with me.

342
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,160
Dad, you forgot what doctor said.

343
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,040
You cannot drink tea.

344
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,280
You dare to teach your old man?

345
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,839
Take a seat.
I have something to say to you.

346
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,520
How are you and Fanlv recently?

347
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,520
Dad!

348
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,400
You know that

349
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:34,520
I treat her like my little sister.

350
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,719
Why do you and Uncle Jiang
have to do this to me?

351
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
You are making me embarrassed.

352
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:41,160
Fanlv matches you perfectly.

353
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:43,239
Isn't she beautiful or clever?

354
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I think

355
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,839
she's the perfect woman for
your marriage.

356
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,920
I'll decide it now.

357
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,000
Dad!

358
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,599
You don't have to talk tough with me.

359
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,839
I'm not afraid of harsh words.

360
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:56,839
You...

361
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,280
Best friends,

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,959
business partners,

363
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,119
growing together since young,

364
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,640
these are not reasons.

365
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,839
Besides,

366
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:06,079
I just took over the company.

367
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,239
The Entertainment Center project
is complicated.

368
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,359
It makes me feel headache.

369
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,920
What do you mean by that?

370
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:13,880
Uncle Jiang

371
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,640
told me yesterday
that everything is fine.

372
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,880
How come it becomes

373
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,520
complicated in your words?

374
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,199
Dad, I'm telling the truth.

375
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:25,640
I've been checking the company's
financial reports for a while.

376
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,920
The revenue seems to be
growing gradually.

377
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,920
But the corporate
debt is not optimistic.

378
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,839
There is also redundancy issue.

379
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:34,640
That's a warning sign.

380
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,319
Carry these two bombs

381
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,959
to start a huge project like this.

382
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:41,359
What do you think
is the chance of winning?

383
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,560
I see what you mean.

384
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:47,959
Next you will say...

385
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,560
Dad, you're old and confused.

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,640
Dad, business is business.

387
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
With an attitude like this,

388
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:57,800
we can't talk any more.

389
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,280
I think you are being emotional.

390
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,640
I know you well.

391
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,599
You talked about so many things,

392
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,520
just to make me get
married as soon as possible.

393
00:24:06,199 --> 00:24:07,319
Ancient people said

394
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,439
no matter how much food you own,

395
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,520
you only need a small part for a meal.

396
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,560
No matter how large is your house,

397
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,160
you only need one bed for a rest.

398
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,520
That's it.

399
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:26,359
Dad had a favorable life.

400
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
It is worth it.

401
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,439
If anything happens to me,

402
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,520
I'm not regretful.

403
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,640
You have been independent
since you were a child.

404
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,280
And even a little withdrawn.

405
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,199
The reason why you don't want
to get married

406
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,040
must be about me and your mother.

407
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,959
What do you mention her for?

408
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:56,560
I already forgot her.

409
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,400
Yuzheng,

410
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,160
actually,

411
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,680
your mom...

412
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,599
You can't blame her for all the things.

413
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:10,239
It was my fault too.

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,160
Or even worse.

415
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,199
Dad!

416
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:15,880
Do you have anything else to talk about?

417
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,520
Yuzheng.

418
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,479
Enough. I don't have mom.

419
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,040
It's only you, Dad.

420
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,199
For me,

421
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,079
she's dead already.

422
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,000
Miss Du,

423
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,199
I've credited your card
with this paycheck.

424
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:36,760
Please have a check.

425
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,000
Transaction completed.
Please remove the card.

426
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,680
Yuzheng,

427
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,000
the reason why you don't want
to get married

428
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,839
must be about me and your mother.

429
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,479
I already forgot her.

430
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:12,520
Actually,

431
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,079
your mom...

432
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,839
You can't blame her for all the things.

433
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,760
It was my fault too.

434
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,359
Or even worse.

435
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,680
I can't live like this anymore.

436
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:27,640
I want a divorce.

437
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,000
Get out!

438
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,479
Mom, mom!

439
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,800
Mom, don't leave.

440
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,239
I beg you to stay.

441
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,079
Mom!

442
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,000
Uncle Duan!

443
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,880
Mom, don't leave me.

444
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,359
Yuzheng!

445
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,119
I beg you to stay.

446
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,599
Mom, don't leave me.

447
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,079
Xiaosu, whose cake is this?

448
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,280
Whose birthday is it?

449
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,560
Zhenrong's birthday is tomorrow.

450
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,599
I'm going to see him.

451
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,359
This is the first birthday you
celebrate for him, right?

452
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,719
He used to celebrate my birthday.

453
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,119
Love between you two

454
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,839
in the present society

455
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,479
is really a fairy tale love story.

456
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,439
Siqi,

457
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,599
if I were you,

458
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,119
I will cherish He Qunfei.

459
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,479
You don't know how much I envy you.

460
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:01,479
How could it be?

461
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,439
The hard life I had with him.

462
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,160
I don't know if I can take it myself.

463
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,560
I actually want to have a relaxed life

464
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,160
without any stress.

465
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,800
Oh,

466
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
how's the money thing going?

467
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,560
Plus the money from last time,

468
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,680
in total,

469
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,680
it's less than one fifth.

470
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,040
Am I right?

471
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,280
That is

472
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,040
a mission impossible.

473
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,199
Lei Yuzheng is torturing you with it.

474
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,800
You're the only one who believes in it.

475
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,119
Fine. No one is blaming you.

476
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,000
The most important thing is
that we are happy.

477
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,000
Listening.

478
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,760
Mr. Lei, all your schedules today

479
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,119
are cancelled as planned.

480
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,040
But the other side just informed me

481
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:08,040
their CEO temporarily changed his plan.

482
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,719
The flight has arrived Shanghai.

483
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,479
Do you think...

484
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,400
Send them my apologies.

485
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,040
Tell them I'm not available today.

486
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,400
I will talk to their CEO
privately later.

487
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,800
That's it.

488
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,019
(Beloved son Shao Zhenrong
By Shao Kaixuan 1989-2016)

489
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:54,079
Zhenrong,

490
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,599
today is your birthday.

491
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,959
I came to see you.

492
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,640
Do you still remember this pudding?

493
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,040
It was my birthday.

494
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,520
I forgot it myself.

495
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,880
How are you doing over there?

496
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,599
I remember

497
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,479
the day you left me

498
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,839
was a rainy night.

499
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,400
I never expected

500
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:31,359
that was the last time
we both saw each other in our lives.

501
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:34,280
I didn't even have the time

502
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,280
to say goodbye to you.

503
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,520
And you left me forever.

504
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:44,119
If time could be turned backwards,

505
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,959
or if the gods
would give me another chance,

506
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,560
I would have never

507
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,280
agreed to Aunt Shao's request.

508
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,839
That's the grudge between them.

509
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,599
It should not be repaid by us.

510
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,359
I feel regretful.

511
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:06,040
I regret deeply.

512
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,839
Why didn't I insist?

513
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:13,719
Why gave up on you so easily?

514
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,239
But don't worry.

515
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,479
I'm having a good time.

516
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,079
Just a little busy.

517
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,520
Once I stop,

518
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,160
I will be thinking about you
all the time.

519
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:40,479
It seems that you never left me.

520
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:42,400
You just went to a place

521
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,800
that I cannot see, waiting for me.

522
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,319
Zhenrong, I'm too tired.

523
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,839
I don't think I can hold out any more.

524
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,800
Do you remember our apartment?

525
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
You said you wanted to design it well.

526
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,640
Put up white curtains.

527
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,520
Grow lots of flowers on the balcony.

528
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,599
We would get a puppy.

529
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,319
But now,

530
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:41,760
I may actually have to give up.

531
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,199
Will you forgive me?

532
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,319
Take care of yourself.

533
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,920
Me too.

534
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,839
Live well.

535
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:16,280
If you miss me,

536
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,079
meet me in my dream.

537
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,239
Goodbye.

538
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,199
Zhenrong.

539
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,879
Letting go is a very difficult decision.

540
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,320
During this time,
for the purpose of this engagement,

541
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,239
I give it all I've got,

542
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,840
but still in vain.

543
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,639
I love Zhenrong, and I can live
without the apartment,

544
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:40,679
because Zhenrong

545
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,840
never left me alone.

546
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
Come in.

547
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,479
Mr. Lei.

548
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,399
Have a seat.

549
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,199
Mr. Lei,

550
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,320
about the thirty-day bet,

551
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,040
I admit defeat.

552
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,760
Why?

553
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,959
I admit it.

554
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,639
This is my resignation letter.

555
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,959
Miss Du, you are a woman of your word,

556
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,360
very cool.

557
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,639
It's not due yet.

558
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:30,439
I remember you said

559
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,320
you will never give up.

560
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,320
I overestimated myself.

561
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,919
So, you mean

562
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,719
you give up the apartment?

563
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,800
Yes.

564
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,719
Miss Du, you can think like that,

565
00:35:44,919 --> 00:35:46,679
you must have cleared your mind.

566
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,280
I'm going to leave here,

567
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,439
to start over.

568
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,320
I'm not surprised at

569
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,840
your decision,

570
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,280
because that is your style.

571
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,040
Since you have made up your mind,

572
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,479
I wish you good luck in the future.

573
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,840
By the way,

574
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,879
where are you going?

575
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:16,040
I used to love this city very much.

576
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,959
Because in this city,

577
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,120
I have my beloved one.

578
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,479
But now for me,

579
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,719
every place is the same.

580
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,159
Mr. Lei.

581
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,120
Farewell!

582
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,199
Miss Du,

583
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,679
hold on a second.

584
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,239
As usual，

585
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:44,000
your resignation should
go to Director Ning,

586
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,719
not me.

587
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
But it's OK.

588
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,199
I'll take a look at it for him first.

589
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,000
Siqi and Qunfei,

590
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,199
I have presented my resignation today.

591
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,040
Du Xiaosu, what's wrong with you?

592
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,120
What happened?

593
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,239
Today,

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,159
I admitted defeat.

595
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,040
What do you mean?

596
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:22,679
The bet she made with your boss,

597
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,120
saying that the apartment will be
paid off within thirty days.

598
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,879
Or she will leave.

599
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,399
Forget it. I am really tired.

600
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,199
No matter how hard I tried,

601
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,520
I could not make it.

602
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:39,159
Xiaosu, I think

603
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,159
we need to think more about this.

604
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:43,679
I know about Mr. Lei.

605
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,639
He's not a bad person.

606
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,679
Maybe he just wants
to make you feel frustrated.

607
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,479
You can apologize to him.

608
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,159
And that's it.

609
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,679
Look,

610
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,280
you can stay quiet.

611
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,760
Tomorrow, let me probe for you.

612
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,479
Who is it?

613
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,239
Hello, your delivery.

614
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
OK. Please sign here.

615
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,879
Thank you.

616
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,199
What is it?

617
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,719
Du Xiaosu, your package.

618
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,919
Wait.

619
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,159
Is this the apartment of Yiping?

620
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,080
So, it was sent by Lei Yuzheng?

621
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:45,360
He returned it to you.

622
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,040
No way.

623
00:38:53,376 --> 00:38:55,840
(Resignation)

624
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,159
How could it not be?

625
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,320
See? Is this your resignation letter?

626
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,040
It seems that Lei Yuzheng
not only returns the apartment to you,

627
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,959
but also wants you to go back to Boyuan.

628
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Told you! Mr. Lei is a kind-hearted man.

629
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,439
He won't care too much about
a little guy like you.

630
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,360
Now that we got the key,

631
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,239
let's check out the apartment.

632
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,159
Slow down!

633
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,719
