16
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,199
Come on.

17
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,240
Let's go.

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,600
-Where is it?
-This way.

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,479
How do you like it?

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,279
The view is pretty nice.

21
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,720
He Qunfei.

22
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,800
It is pretty expensive here, isn't it?

23
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,080
Of course.

24
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,360
How come a stingy person like you
spend so much money?

25
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,839
Who is stingy?

26
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,119
I'm not.

27
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,279
You're not stingy to Siqi,

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
but you're stingy to me.

29
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,399
Well...

30
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,720
Let's choose another place, shall we?

31
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,639
Why? Just stay here!

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,479
Siqi.

33
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:11,000
Du Xiaosu. Come on. Listen to me.

34
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
Let's go.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Mr. Lei. Have a date?

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,360
Mr. Lei.

37
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:29,639
I take the day off.

38
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,800
I take Xiaosu and Siqi out for dinner.

39
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:33,960
Take your time.

40
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,399
We’ll choose another place.

41
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:38,839
Just stay here.

42
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
Siqi.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,039
Mr. Lei.
Why don't we have dinner together?

44
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:45,679
It's been so difficult to meet you.

45
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:46,919
You don't mind it, right?

46
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,679
Since you're here,
let's have dinner together.

47
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,320
Come on.

48
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,160
Waiter.

49
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:53,839
More settings please.

50
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:56,279
Sit still.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,360
Miss Xu.

52
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,479
Nice to meet you.

53
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,479
I am Zou Siqi,
a journalist of White Goose Website,

54
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,399
namely the journalist
of entertainment news.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,119
Miss Zou turns out to be
a journalist of entertainment news.

56
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,679
No wonder you're so sharp.

57
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,160
It seems Miss Xu has a bias against us.

58
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:25,479
How is it possible?

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,479
We're closely related,

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,880
and mutually dependent.

61
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:32,600
Right.

62
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,360
Miss Zou.

63
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,440
The date like today

64
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,839
is very different

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
to you, isn't it?

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,799
It depends on what kind of date it is.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,279
The date with friends

68
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,160
can't make the headline for sure.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
How about the date between lovers?

70
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,959
It is said your relationship abroad

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
is not going well.

72
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,320
Are you coming back this time
for comfort?

73
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,720
Mr. Lei. Miss Xu.

74
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,559
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,160
Sorry.

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,200
Well...

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,559
Mr. Lei. We'll leave.

78
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,320
Mr. Lei.

79
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,239
There is something
I would like to say.

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,239
Go ahead.

81
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,119
Miss Xu is your friend.

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
Xiaosu is also your friend.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,640
I don't know
what Miss Xu has in her mind.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,040
But I know what Xiaosu has in her mind.

85
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,320
And you know it.

86
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,799
I believe you know

87
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,239
what to do exactly.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,399
Goodbye.

89
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:47,880
Siqi.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,679
Look at yourself.

91
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,399
What do you want me to say about you?

92
00:04:52,119 --> 00:04:53,239
Du Xiaosu.

93
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,720
Do you have a conscience?

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,839
I was just taking it out for you!

95
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,399
You're blaming me now...

96
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,440
You're mistaking a good person
for a bad one!

97
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,279
I know you did it for me.

98
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,839
But you were talking with Xu You
like that.

99
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,279
It really made all of us
very embarrassed.

100
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,279
Let's stop fighting!

101
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:11,959
I know there is a

102
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,959
very good Korean barbecue
restaurant just ahead.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Let's go there.

104
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,640
I'll leave you two.

105
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,880
I'll go back home.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,040
Du Xiaosu.

107
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Siqi.

108
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,519
Stop calling me.

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,119
There are so many good restaurants.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
You just choose this one.

111
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,040
It's disappointing.

112
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,760
Why is it my fault?

113
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,359
She's already far away.
Stop looking.

114
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,799
I finally understand

115
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,760
why you treat me to dinner
and send me flowers.

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Are you using me as a shield?

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,200
What?

118
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,839
Listen.

119
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,480
There is something different between
you and Du Xiaosu.

120
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,119
Are you having a fight?

121
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,799
You made her jealous on purpose.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,119
You want me to make this show with you,
right?

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,679
I ask you out today

124
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,640
not to make a show with me.

125
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,760
There's something to do next.

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,040
It could be dangerous.

127
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,920
I don't know
whether you wanna get involved.

128
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,119
Fine.

129
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,720
You still have the conscience.

130
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,600
But I'm really curious

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
what kind of danger

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,119
you are concerned about.

133
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,200
I've decided to stay

134
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,320
out of curiosity.

135
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,720
I wanna witness this
life-and-death play.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,640
Xiaosu. Xiaosu. Xiaosu.

137
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,519
Don't be mad.

138
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,000
It's all He Qunfei's fault.

139
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,279
What an awful place for dinner!

140
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,279
Fine.

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,440
I was speaking without thinking.

142
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:59,320
I was talking nonsense.

143
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,399
Don't be mad at me, please.

144
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,760
I'm a little bit tired.

145
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll take a shower.

146
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,920
Xiaosu.

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,279
The date like today

148
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,640
is very different

149
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,040
to you, isn't it?

150
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,239
How about the date between lovers?

151
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,359
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

152
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:34,040
Sorry.

153
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,840
Lin Xiangyuan.

154
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,479
Even if you go to the ends of the earth,

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,320
I won't let go of you.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Lin Xiangyuan.

157
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,320
You are shameless.

158
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
I finally see you through.

159
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,799
I will kill you!

160
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,719
Lin Xiangyuan.

161
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,280
Behave yourself and cooperate with me.

162
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,679
Or else I'll ruin you

163
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,919
and make you lose everything.

164
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Fanlv.

165
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,000
Fanlv.

166
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,479
Why do you stay up so late?
What're you doing?

167
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:15,520
Come on. Let's go back to sleep.

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,000
If people are gone,

169
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,000
they will have no worries, right?

170
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,159
Fanlv.

171
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,880
It's already middle of the night.
What are you thinking about?

172
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,880
Are you feeling sick?

173
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,960
I am sick.

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,280
If I had not been ill, I would not
have been unable to sleep.

175
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,799
What's the point of living

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,799
if people can't fall asleep?

177
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,760
Jiang Fanlv.

178
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,640
Stop being like this.

179
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm begging you.
Leave me alone, will you?

180
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,799
You're finally speaking your mind!

181
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:00,239
In your mind,

182
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,479
I am a troublemaker.

183
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,359
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,840
I didn't mean it.

185
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,440
Yes, you did!

186
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:16,559
Fanlv.

187
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,679
Let's not fight.

188
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,039
Let's live a good life, shall we?

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,880
Fanlv.

190
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,559
It was all my fault before.

191
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,960
Let's forget the past

192
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:31,400
and start all over again.

193
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll be nice to you!

194
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,559
It's too late.

195
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,280
No, it's not late at all.

196
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,919
Let's go abroad.

197
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,280
Bali, Chiang Mai, Dubai.

198
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,799
Let's find a place where nobody knows us

199
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
and start all over again.

200
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,359
Fanlv.

201
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,919
What're you doing?

202
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,280
Take your time.

203
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:36,919
Fanlv.

204
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,159
Fanlv.

205
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:44,200
Wait a minute.

206
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,119
What's wrong with her recently?

207
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,479
I have no idea.

208
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,919
She's been like this lately.

209
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,280
She's always like
she can't have enough to eat.

210
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,239
Except for overeating,

211
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:56,119
she's been often alone
in the small living room,

212
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,559
talking to herself, or staring blankly
without talking.

213
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Sometimes she spoke to herself
in the mirror.

214
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,760
It's creepy.

215
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:06,440
Mr. Lin.

216
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,559
According to what you've described,

217
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:09,960
we have reason to suspect

218
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,200
your wife is suffering from depression.

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,359
Is there any way out?

220
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:19,479
Depression is

221
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:22,119
a kind of mental illness that mainly
causes a persistent feeling of sadness.

222
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:26,000
Patients are usually depressed, sad,
and inferior.

223
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,200
She might suffer a loss
or even be deprived of

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,719
her interests in life.

225
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,679
Serious patients will become

226
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,080
pessimistic and desperate.

227
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,880
So in normal times families have to keep
her company as much as possible.

228
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,640
In the daily life,
you have to keep an eye on her.

229
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,359
Or...

230
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,280
Or what?

231
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,679
Of course.

232
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,559
I'm referring to the patients with
severe depression.

233
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,799
They might commit suicide.

234
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,679
Fanlv. It's a nice day today.

235
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,799
Let's go out for a walk.

236
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,719
No.

237
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,880
Fine. Call if off then.

238
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,880
I'm just sitting here.
Let's have a talk.

239
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,960
Go ahead by yourself.

240
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Where are you going?

241
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:45,200
Do I need your permission

242
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,200
to go back to my own room?

243
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,880
I didn't mean it.

244
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,239
Miss Jiang. Let me accompany you back.

245
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,119
By the way.

246
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,359
Let me introduce you

247
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,119
the new nanny.

248
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,159
Mrs. Wang.

249
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,760
Aren't there already two nannies
at home?

250
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,760
You don't like that nanny, right?

251
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,760
I fired her.

252
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:07,599
Mrs. Wang

253
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,440
is specially for you to talk with.

254
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:11,200
She's keeping an eye on me, isn't she?

255
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:12,679
Don't say that.

256
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:15,039
You're always alone at home every day.

257
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,000
There has to be someone to
talk with you.

258
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,119
Let her go. I don't need it.

259
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,840
Come on. Please?

260
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,520
I'm usually busy working in the company.

261
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,599
I'm worried about you being alone here
all the time.

262
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,479
Miss Jiang. I won't bother you.

263
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,640
I'll show up only when you need me.

264
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,200
Mrs. Wang.

265
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:33,880
My wife is not feeling very well
recently.

266
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,280
Please take good care of her.

267
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,000
Ok. Sir.

268
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,919
Shangguan has been looking for
Wang Mian for many days,

269
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,799
but still has no clue.

270
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:54,719
There is one person.

271
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:56,200
You can give it a try.

272
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,679
Who is it?

273
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,799
Xie Li.

274
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,000
Xie Li?

275
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,239
Lin Xiangyuan is the cause
of this event.

276
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:05,000
But according to the current situation,

277
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,400
his initial purpose

278
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,000
may be to make some money.

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,080
Probably he himself hasn't expected that

280
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,119
things are going like this.

281
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,119
So

282
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,280
when he was doing the whole thing,

283
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:16,960
there must be flaws.

284
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,719
And Xie Li

285
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,960
is one of them.

286
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,000
He had been following Lin Xiangyuan
every day.

287
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
Whatever Lin Xiangyuan has done,

288
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,840
there's no way he has no idea.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,479
If anything,
Lin Xiangyuan is scared of me.

290
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,239
Xie Li hates me.

291
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,840
Why?

292
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,679
He used to work for Yutian.

293
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:33,960
He's greedy.

294
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,880
He had some financial problems with
the movie

295
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:36,799
invested by Yutian.

296
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:37,919
So he had to leave.

297
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,559
After that he has been following
Lin Xiangyuan.

298
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,400
Perhaps he has always held a grudge
against it.

299
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,080
On the other hand,

300
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,919
as he was greedy,

301
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,799
he would buy the shares of Yutian

302
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,200
behind Lin Xiangyuan's back.

303
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,320
If Lin Xiangyuan didn't know about it,

304
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,719
others behind the scenes
won't know about it either.

305
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,000
I believe

306
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,799
they didn't fix this flaw in time.

307
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,679
The premise is whether he knew about

308
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,400
the cooperation between Yutian and S.G
before signing the agreement.

309
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:05,559
If Lin Xiangyuan was aware of it,

310
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,119
then he must know it.

311
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,719
I assume he was the one to go for Li Lu.

312
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,400
If so,

313
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,280
leave it to me.

314
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:14,799
I'll get to the bottom of them.

315
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,799
No.

316
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,320
To deal with a shameless man
like Xie Li,

317
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,520
there must be a person more shameless
than him.

318
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:24,400
Leave it to Shangguan.

319
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,679
That day I asked Xu You to dinner

320
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,280
Du Xiaosu saw it.

321
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,680
Du Xiaosu?

322
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:33,520
What's going on?

323
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,599
I'm worried I might've really hurt her.

324
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:39,839
But that's fine.

325
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,000
For her safety.

326
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,920
You have to cut the tie with her
for now.

327
00:16:45,119 --> 00:16:46,719
If there is no better way,

328
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,839
I can only let her misunderstand me
for now.

329
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,079
Chairman. Something's wrong!

330
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,040
What's going on?

331
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,000
What happened?
Why are you in such a panic?

332
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,479
Watch the news.

333
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,920
Mr. Lin. Have you watched the news?

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,680
What news?

335
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,719
Someone is going to take over Yutian.

336
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,400
What's great about that?

337
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,920
I...I have heard
it's the overseas fund company.

338
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,119
Do you want me to ask someone?

339
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Not necessary.

340
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,239
Mind your own business.

341
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:35,680
Mr. Lin. You seem to have known this.

342
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,880
It is news,

343
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,359
so people with phones will know it.

344
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,880
Why make the fuss about it?

345
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,040
Now that Yutian is going to be
taken over,

346
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,680
it's useless for Lei Yuzheng to
come back.

347
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,280
Then we can...

348
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,880
If Yutian is taken over,

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
you'll lose your job.

350
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:59,319
Don't be cheerful all day long.

351
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,359
If Yutian is taken over,

352
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,000
no one will come to a good end.

353
00:18:06,408 --> 00:18:08,456
(Jiang Jin)

354
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,199
Go out, please.

355
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,719
Mr. Lin. There's one more thing.

356
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,640
Go out. We'll talk about it later.

357
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Do you know that

358
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,280
Hengshan Fund overseas

359
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,239
is going to take over our Yutian?

360
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,479
Really?

361
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,560
Ok. I'll be there.

362
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,760
(It is said that Hengshan Fund had)

363
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,400
(already acquired 5% of the shares
of Yutian.)

364
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,959
(As for Yutian,)

365
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,560
(there was no response yet.)

366
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,239
(Our reporters will continue to follow.)

367
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,479
Come to the next. We'll...

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
I didn't expect they made the move
so soon.

369
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,359
It is obvious that

370
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,599
they've already known that
we've started our investigation.

371
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,439
They're afraid out results will
mess things up.

372
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,359
More importantly,

373
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:05,119
they're going to cover
their criminal acts.

374
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,479
So they made the move in advance.

375
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,880
I know. I'm trying to figure it out.

376
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
That'll be all for now.

377
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,959
If there is anything,
I'll let you know at once.

378
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,319
Mr. Jiang. So much has happened.

379
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,839
Why don't you call me?

380
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,119
Mr. Fang.

381
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,880
I was just aware of it.

382
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,839
You're the chairman of Yutian.
You have to make the decision.

383
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,400
We all depend on you.

384
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,199
I know. Take it easy.

385
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:40,920
How can I take it easy?

386
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,800
I've heard that Hengshan Fund is
quite powerful,

387
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,520
and aggressive.

388
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
I'm afraid our Yutian might be acquired.

389
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,520
And if worse comes to worst,

390
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,319
get Lei Yuzheng back.

391
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,160
That guy is capable.

392
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Ok. I get it.

393
00:19:59,040 --> 00:19:59,959
Yuzheng.

394
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,640
This time Yutian is really in trouble.

395
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:04,880
I've already known it, Uncle Jiang.

396
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,079
I'm here to discuss this with you.

397
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,880
Do you have any idea?

398
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,199
I think first of all

399
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,760
we have to hold a press conference

400
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,280
to keep the media in control.

401
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,760
Second,

402
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,599
we have to restore the confidence of
the market in Yutian.

403
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,599
We have to tell them that
Yutian is in order.

404
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:22,760
Great. Great.

405
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,640
Why hasn't he come yet?

406
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,680
May I ask how Yutian is gonna

407
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:33,760
respond to the takeover?

408
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,959
Are you going to accept it
or fight against it?

409
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,160
Well...

410
00:20:37,439 --> 00:20:39,800
Everyone. First of all.
Thank you very much

411
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,560
for your attention to Yutian.

412
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:44,000
We've just received the invitation
of the acquisition.

413
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,719
As to how to deal with it,

414
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,239
we have to wait for the decision made by

415
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,280
the Board of Directors and
interim general meeting of stockholders.

416
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I'll keep you up to date

417
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,920
the first time with any news.

418
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,280
Hengshan Fund is the top private equity fund.

419
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,839
Being confronted with
such a powerful opponent,

420
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,359
doesn't Yutian have any solutions?

421
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,400
Takeover or anti-takeover

422
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,959
are both common commercial behaviors
in the capitalist market.

423
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,199
I don't think we need make a fuss

424
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,520
because of the takeover.

425
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,119
As to the solutions,

426
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:10,439
I believe any listed company

427
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,439
has corresponding solutions to
this kind of situation.

428
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,359
Mr. Jiang.

429
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:14,959
As the chairman of
a listed company,

430
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,160
what is your attitude?

431
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,959
Individually,

432
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,040
are you in favor of the takeover
or against it?

433
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,719
Mr. Jiang.

434
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Excuse me. Please be quiet.

435
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,199
Mr. Jiang can't

436
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:25,719
answer your question just now.

437
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,640
I think you probably have no idea that

438
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:29,479
for an important solution like this,

439
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:31,400
the final decision will be made

440
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,560
by the general meeting of shareholders,

441
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:33,920
instead of Board of Directors.

442
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:36,680
So I hope everyone can look forward to

443
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,359
our next decision.

444
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,599
All right. Mr. Jiang.

445
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,400
That's the end of
our today's press conference.

446
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,719
Thank you all for coming.

447
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,079
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

448
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,280
Mr. Jiang. Mr. Jiang.

449
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,479
One more question. Mr. Jiang.

450
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,319
Have a cup of coffee.

451
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,719
Have been busy for so many days.

452
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,560
Finally the market is closed.

453
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,119
I can take a break.

454
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,479
You have done a great job recently.

455
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,920
It's far from that.

456
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,079
I worked in finance industry and

457
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
have already been used to
this kind of life.

458
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,319
I didn't expect you

459
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,920
to be so calm

460
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,920
when being confronted
with a formidable enemy,

461
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,599
and spend the day sunbathing with me.

462
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,119
What do I have to be afraid of?

463
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,640
I have you

464
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,239
by my side to help me.

465
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,199
Don't flatter me.

466
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,680
Hengshan Fund is tough.

467
00:22:41,199 --> 00:22:42,920
I may not be their opponent.

468
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,400
In order to cover the truth,

469
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,040
on the one hand they stop us
from the investigation,

470
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,920
on the other hand,
they make use of the acquisition

471
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,160
to divert people's attention.

472
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,359
The purpose is still to
stop our investigation.

473
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,760
I just want them to know.

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
No matter whether they take over or not,

475
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,760
I won't stop the investigation.

476
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,199
But I have no idea

477
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,880
where to start.

478
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,719
What?

479
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,719
We've got Li Lu.

480
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,119
Wang Mian. Don't worry.

481
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,839
I've come here alone.

482
00:23:47,199 --> 00:23:48,479
Nobody is following me.

483
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,280
Thank you for saving me last time.

484
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm afraid you ask me out this time

485
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,400
not to thank me.

486
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,599
I know where Li Lu is.

487
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:57,280
Where is he?

488
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,280
In his hometown.

489
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,479
Guizhou?

490
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,680
Yes.

491
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,520
Are you still in contact now?

492
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,520
After he went back to his hometown,

493
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:10,160
in the first few months,
I could still reach him.

494
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,680
But a few months later,

495
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,800
I can't reach him either.

496
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,640
Besides, the call was answered by
someone else.

497
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,239
I think he has already
changed his number.

498
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,760
He changed his number?

499
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,959
Yes.

500
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:23,959
So

501
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,880
Li Lu went back to his hometown.

502
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,599
It looks like this.

503
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,319
But not for certain.

504
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,119
Maybe he went somewhere else.

505
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:48,319
What do you mean?

506
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,680
Siyang.

507
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,040
Tomorrow you go to the shopping mall

508
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:55,199
and buy two clothes
which are exactly the same,

509
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:57,280
and one international flight ticket.

510
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,359
Xiao Zhang.

511
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,839
Book me an international flight
ticket tomorrow.

512
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,160
Tell me after it's done.

513
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,359
And tell the driver to pick me up
from my home.

514
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
What did you say?

515
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,760
Lei Yuzheng is going abroad?

516
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,760
You wanna pretend to go abroad?

517
00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,199
What else can I do?
Someone is watching us.

518
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,439
I have to play a trick.

519
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:23,160
It is true.

520
00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:25,000
I heard that
he asked Xiao Zhang in the office

521
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,560
to book him the ticket.

522
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:31,119
Why does he go abroad at this moment?

523
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,560
Is he going to visit famous S.G?

524
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,479
He might be.

525
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,920
Lin Dun from S.G is his classmate
in Stanford.

526
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,920
Then what should we do?

527
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,880
Let me figure it out.

528
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,880
Follow the car.

529
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,439
Wish you a nice trip, Mr. Lei.

530
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:47,880
Thank you.

531
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,640
You're welcome.

532
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,599
Hello.

533
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,479
Can I change the ticket

534
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,719
of Flight 987 here?

535
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,719
Yes. Would you like to change it?

536
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,599
No. I'll wait.

537
00:26:58,959 --> 00:26:59,959
Thank you.

538
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,960
(Shanghai Specialty)

539
00:27:46,056 --> 00:27:47,688
(Lei is in international departure)

540
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,952
(Don't leave and keep an eye on it)

541
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,319
Mr. Lei. Is everything going well?

542
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,400
Yes, it is.

543
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,439
How about Siyang?

544
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,568
(Liu Siyang: Everything's OK.
Boarding now)

545
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:33,400
Siyang said everything is going well.
He is boarding.

546
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,760
Let's go.

547
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,079
Mr. Lei. Where are we going?

548
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,000
Guizhou.

549
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,920
Ok.

550
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,000
Let's go.

551
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:52,000
Du Xiaosu.

552
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,000
Why are you here?

553
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,400
You were not back home all night.
Am I not worried?

554
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,319
You worked too hard.

555
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,040
I've just realized now

556
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:04,599
how good working is.

557
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,800
Money sometimes is really
more important than love.

558
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:11,079
If you put efforts into making money,
you'll have it.

559
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,359
But love...

560
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:14,439
Giving doesn't always get paid back.

561
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,880
Pay back?

562
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:22,599
What?

563
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,520
Du Xiaosu.

564
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,560
What am I to you?

565
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:25,319
My bestie.

566
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm your good listener.

567
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,359
So there can't be anything

568
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:31,599
in your mind, right?

569
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,920
Tell me everything you're upset about.

570
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,400
I am all ears.

571
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,760
What are you talking about?

572
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm quite busy now.

573
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,160
I don't have time to
spill out the troubles.

574
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,640
If you don't have anything else,

575
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,880
just go back.

576
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,560
Thank you for dropping in.

577
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,239
Let's go.

578
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,640
Look at your black eyes.

579
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,479
I am busy.

580
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,280
Is this for work?

581
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,000
Isn't it for him?

582
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,656
(Entertainment Express. Lei Yuzheng)

583
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,319
It's been revised.

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,239
Fine. Even if it is.

585
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,920
How about Yutian's PR?

586
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:05,959
How about Xu You's agent?

587
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,719
Why don't they come out to
make the clarification?

588
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,319
Now people all over the world are
responding the same.

589
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,079
They are all acquiescing in it.

590
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,719
A clean hand wants no washing.

591
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,719
If every time there is a gossip,

592
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,400
it has to be clarified,

593
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,000
these companies can't do anything else.

594
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,479
Go ahead. You continue to be stubborn.

595
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,079
I'm asking you one question now.

596
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:25,079
Did he, Lei Yuzheng, ever contact you?

597
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:25,880
Did he make a call?

598
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,599
Did he send a message?

599
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,760
If it's difficult for you to ask,
I will ask him.

600
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:33,239
What are you doing?

601
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,680
Can't I ask him?

602
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,079
What are you doing?

603
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,359
I have to make it clear.

604
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,760
What? How?

605
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:42,560
Who am I to Lei Yuzheng?

606
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,719
He has the freedom to contact

607
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,079
with others without my permission.

608
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,439
Don't you know that?

609
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,719
What happened to you on the island

610
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,560
demonstrated that you fell in love.

611
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,359
I don't understand.

612
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,359
Why can't you intervene?

613
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,640
Besides,

614
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:00,719
it's not interfering,
it's protecting your right.

615
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:04,760
Are you really silly?

616
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,199
She's threatening you now.
Are you aware of that?

617
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,680
You're just sitting here
and doing nothing.

618
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,119
Zou Siqi.

619
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,520
Lei Yuzheng and I are grown-ups.

620
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,719
We'll

621
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:17,400
work it out.

622
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,239
We've been through so much.

623
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:20,920
And we know each other.

624
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,079
If there is understanding between us,

625
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,000
why do we have to say it?

626
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,439
Fine.

627
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
I admit.

628
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,079
Lei Yuzheng is probably really
in love with you.

629
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:38,439
Is he able to cope with the passion
of Xu You?

630
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,560
I don't want to speculate on others.

631
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,079
When you found that
Lei Yuzheng and Xu You were together,

632
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:46,719
your expression had already

633
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
told me everything.

634
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:48,800
My lady.

635
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,359
I really don't want to
talk about it today.

636
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,560
I still have a lot of work to do.

637
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
I'm really busy.

638
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,719
I'm also tired.

639
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,160
If there isn't anything else,

640
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,719
you can go home first.

641
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,119
-Hurry up. Du Xiaosu.
-Bye.

642
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,920
I can wish you happy every day.

643
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,400
But the premise is

644
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,359
you have to be really happy.

645
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,072
(Nanny)

646
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,119
Mr. Lin.

647
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,439
Something was wrong!

648
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,920
Please come back!

649
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,959
Nurse! Nurse!

650
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,079
Honey. Everything's fine.

651
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:46,839
Hold on!

652
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,079
Nurse!

653
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,040
Everything is gonna be fine.

654
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,239
Nurse!

655
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,680
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

656
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,839
Watch out! Watch out!

657
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,400
Come on. Slow down.

658
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,119
The patient's family members
are waiting outside.

659
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,640
Dad.

660
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,920
Dad.

661
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,920
Fanlv is in trouble.

662
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,760
Settle her down quickly.

663
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,399
Why did you save me?

664
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,639
Just let me die.

665
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,639
We've worked so hard to
save you.

666
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,919
You still wanna die?

667
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:58,959
Do you know

668
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,600
how many patients in the world die

669
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,479
without treatment every day?

670
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,959
Look at those patients
who are seriously ill.

671
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,600
They are so painful,

672
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,439
but they are still pulling
themselves together.

673
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,840
You're so young,

674
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,120
but you don't cherish your life,

675
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:14,159
and the efforts of medical staff.

676
00:34:14,439 --> 00:34:15,080
So many opportunities for patients

677
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,639
waiting for rescue are wasted.

678
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,840
The wound has been treated.

679
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,919
Think about it.

680
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,239
Who are you?

681
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:32,959
I'm the patient's husband.

682
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:34,239
Doctor.

683
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,159
How is my wife now?

684
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:37,639
She's fine for now.

685
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,199
But,

686
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,199
is there something wrong with your wife?

687
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,879
Or something made her unhappy?

688
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,560
She had depression before.

689
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,239
But I didn't expect
it to be so serious.

690
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,479
This time she's lucky.

691
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,120
But it doesn't mean that
she can still be lucky next time.

692
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
You have to be prepared.

693
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,520
Please go ahead.

694
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,600
Your wife

695
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,959
has developed
a serious suicidal tendency.

696
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,399
It belongs to severe depression.

697
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:02,959
I recommend early treatment.

698
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,080
Doctor, I will cooperate with
any treatment required.

699
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,800
Money is not the problem,

700
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,080
as long as she can be cured.

701
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,120
First of all, drug therapy can be
taken into consideration.

702
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
Drug therapy?

703
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,399
Of course, the patient like her

704
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
needs long-term medication.

705
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,959
She might be drug dependent.

706
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,719
There'll be trigeminal neuralgia,

707
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:19,600
memory loss,

708
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,199
and damages to visceral organs, etc.

709
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,719
Is there any other way?

710
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,360
If you don't adopt drug therapy,

711
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,159
then try psychological treatment.

712
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,000
The best psychotherapy is
to keep her company.

713
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,520
Your family members have to
accompany her as much as possible.

714
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,199
Help her relieve the pressure,

715
00:35:33,439 --> 00:35:34,439
and ensure her safety.

716
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,000
Besides, the patient is quite agitated.

717
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,959
It's better not to let her know
about her illness,

718
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,600
so as not to bother her.

719
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,959
Ok. Thank you, doctor.

720
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,239
All right. You're welcome.

721
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,919
Fanlv.

722
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,399
If anything really happens to you,

723
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
how can I live the rest of my life?

724
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:14,120
If I'm dead, everyone will be easy.

725
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,760
Isn't it?

726
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,479
Why are you saying like that?

727
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,199
Fanlv.

728
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,399
Do I behave disgracefully in your heart?

729
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,760
People say
couple for one day, love forever.

730
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,959
Moreover,
we've been married for so long.

731
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,239
The doctor told me to be nice to you.

732
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,280
Don't lie to me.

733
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:47,159
I know what's wrong with me.

734
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,439
Why did you save me?

735
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,719
It'll be good that I'm dead.

736
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,280
What's the point of living?

737
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,879
It'll be easy instead to be dead.

738
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Fanlv.

739
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,719
Don't say that.

740
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Each person will be
in a bad mood sometimes .

741
00:37:08,439 --> 00:37:09,520
The doctor said

742
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,919
you would get better very soon.

743
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,199
Dad.

744
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,320
Get up.

745
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,520
My dear. What's wrong with you?

746
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:33,159
Are you silly?

747
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,679
If anything happens to you,

748
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,520
how can I

749
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,479
live with it?

750
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,919
Dad.

751
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,399
My dear. Why are you so upset?

752
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,600
Tell me if you are in trouble.

753
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,840
Dad will help you out.

754
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,280
Come with me.

755
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,639
Tell me. What's going on?

756
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,000
Dad. I didn't take good care of Fanlv.

757
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,679
Sure, you didn't.

758
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,560
Let me ask you.

759
00:38:32,439 --> 00:38:33,600
What did the doctor say?

760
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:34,919
The doctor said

761
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:37,280
Fanlv had depression.

762
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,879
When did she have it?

763
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,639
Why don't you tell me earlier?

764
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,199
Actually Fanlv has been
in depression for a while.

765
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:48,080
I didn't tell you because I'm
afraid you might be worried.

766
00:38:49,959 --> 00:38:52,040
Fanlv is my daughter.

767
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:54,520
When she was sick, you didn't tell me.

768
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,719
You were worrying about me?

769
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,719
If you really worried about me,

770
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,879
you would not fight with her recklessly.

771
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
You made her lose her baby.

772
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:08,280
Lin Xiangyuan.
I'm telling you.

773
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
You should consider yourself lucky
that nothing happened to Fanlv.

774
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,800
If anything happens to her,

775
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,439
I won't forgive you.

776
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:19,280
Dad. It's my fault.

777
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,320
I didn't make Fanlv happy.

778
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,280
So far,

779
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,760
I assume that it's time to end.
