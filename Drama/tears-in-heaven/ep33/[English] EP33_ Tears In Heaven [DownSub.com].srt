00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,199
Come on.

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's go.

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,600
-Where is it?
-This way.

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,479
How do you like it?

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,279
The view is pretty nice.

21
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:16,720
He Qunfei.

22
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,800
It is pretty expensive here, isn't it?

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,080
Of course.

24
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:22,360
How come a stingy person like you
spend so much money?

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,839
Who is stingy?

26
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,119
I'm not.

27
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,279
You're not stingy to Siqi,

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
but you're stingy to me.

29
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,399
Well...

30
00:02:37,399 --> 00:02:38,720
Let's choose another place, shall we?

31
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,639
Why? Just stay here!

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,479
Siqi.

33
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,000
Du Xiaosu. Come on. Listen to me.

34
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Let's go.

35
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Mr. Lei. Have a date?

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Mr. Lei.

37
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,639
I take the day off.

38
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,800
I take Xiaosu and Siqi out for dinner.

39
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,960
Take your time.

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,399
We’ll choose another place.

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,839
Just stay here.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,720
Siqi.

43
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,039
Mr. Lei.
Why don't we have dinner together?

44
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:20,679
It's been so difficult to meet you.

45
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,919
You don't mind it, right?

46
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,679
Since you're here,
let's have dinner together.

47
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,320
Come on.

48
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,160
Waiter.

49
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:28,839
More settings please.

50
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,279
Sit still.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,360
Miss Xu.

52
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,479
Nice to meet you.

53
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,479
I am Zou Siqi,
a journalist of White Goose Website,

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,399
namely the journalist
of entertainment news.

55
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,119
Miss Zou turns out to be
a journalist of entertainment news.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,679
No wonder you're so sharp.

57
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,160
It seems Miss Xu has a bias against us.

58
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:00,479
How is it possible?

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,479
We're closely related,

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
and mutually dependent.

61
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,600
Right.

62
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,360
Miss Zou.

63
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,440
The date like today

64
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,839
is very different

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
to you, isn't it?

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,799
It depends on what kind of date it is.

67
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,279
The date with friends

68
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,160
can't make the headline for sure.

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
How about the date between lovers?

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,959
It is said your relationship abroad

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
is not going well.

72
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:31,320
Are you coming back this time
for comfort?

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,720
Mr. Lei. Miss Xu.

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,559
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,160
Sorry.

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,200
Well...

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,559
Mr. Lei. We'll leave.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,320
Mr. Lei.

79
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,239
There is something
I would like to say.

80
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,239
Go ahead.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,119
Miss Xu is your friend.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
Xiaosu is also your friend.

83
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,640
I don't know
what Miss Xu has in her mind.

84
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,040
But I know what Xiaosu has in her mind.

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
And you know it.

86
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,799
I believe you know

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,239
what to do exactly.

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,399
Goodbye.

89
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:22,880
Siqi.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,679
Look at yourself.

91
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,399
What do you want me to say about you?

92
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,239
Du Xiaosu.

93
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:29,720
Do you have a conscience?

94
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,839
I was just taking it out for you!

95
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,399
You're blaming me now...

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,440
You're mistaking a good person
for a bad one!

97
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,279
I know you did it for me.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,839
But you were talking with Xu You
like that.

99
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,279
It really made all of us
very embarrassed.

100
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:45,279
Let's stop fighting!

101
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:46,959
I know there is a

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,959
very good Korean barbecue
restaurant just ahead.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
Let's go there.

104
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,640
I'll leave you two.

105
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,880
I'll go back home.

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,040
Du Xiaosu.

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Siqi.

108
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,519
Stop calling me.

109
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,119
There are so many good restaurants.

110
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
You just choose this one.

111
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,040
It's disappointing.

112
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,760
Why is it my fault?

113
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,359
She's already far away.
Stop looking.

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,799
I finally understand

115
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,760
why you treat me to dinner
and send me flowers.

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Are you using me as a shield?

117
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,200
What?

118
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Listen.

119
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,480
There is something different between
you and Du Xiaosu.

120
00:06:40,679 --> 00:06:42,119
Are you having a fight?

121
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,799
You made her jealous on purpose.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,119
You want me to make this show with you,
right?

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,679
I ask you out today

124
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,640
not to make a show with me.

125
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,760
There's something to do next.

126
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
It could be dangerous.

127
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,920
I don't know
whether you wanna get involved.

128
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,119
Fine.

129
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
You still have the conscience.

130
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,600
But I'm really curious

131
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,760
what kind of danger

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,119
you are concerned about.

133
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
I've decided to stay

134
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,320
out of curiosity.

135
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,720
I wanna witness this
life-and-death play.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,640
Xiaosu. Xiaosu. Xiaosu.

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,519
Don't be mad.

138
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
It's all He Qunfei's fault.

139
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,279
What an awful place for dinner!

140
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,279
Fine.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,440
I was speaking without thinking.

142
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,320
I was talking nonsense.

143
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,399
Don't be mad at me, please.

144
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm a little bit tired.

145
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,480
I'll take a shower.

146
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,920
Xiaosu.

147
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,279
The date like today

148
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,640
is very different

149
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,040
to you, isn't it?

150
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,239
How about the date between lovers?

151
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,359
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

152
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,040
Sorry.

153
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,840
Lin Xiangyuan.

154
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,479
Even if you go to the ends of the earth,

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
I won't let go of you.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,840
Lin Xiangyuan.

157
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,320
You are shameless.

158
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
I finally see you through.

159
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,799
I will kill you!

160
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,719
Lin Xiangyuan.

161
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,280
Behave yourself and cooperate with me.

162
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:11,679
Or else I'll ruin you

163
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,919
and make you lose everything.

164
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Fanlv.

165
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,000
Fanlv.

166
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,479
Why do you stay up so late?
What're you doing?

167
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,520
Come on. Let's go back to sleep.

168
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,000
If people are gone,

169
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,000
they will have no worries, right?

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,159
Fanlv.

171
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,880
It's already middle of the night.
What are you thinking about?

172
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:08,880
Are you feeling sick?

173
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,960
I am sick.

174
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,280
If I had not been ill, I would not
have been unable to sleep.

175
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:17,799
What's the point of living

176
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,799
if people can't fall asleep?

177
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:26,760
Jiang Fanlv.

178
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,640
Stop being like this.

179
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm begging you.
Leave me alone, will you?

180
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,799
You're finally speaking your mind!

181
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:35,239
In your mind,

182
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,479
I am a troublemaker.

183
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:45,359
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,840
I didn't mean it.

185
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,440
Yes, you did!

186
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:51,559
Fanlv.

187
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:53,679
Let's not fight.

188
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,039
Let's live a good life, shall we?

189
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,880
Fanlv.

190
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,559
It was all my fault before.

191
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,960
Let's forget the past

192
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,400
and start all over again.

193
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
I'll be nice to you!

194
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,559
It's too late.

195
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,280
No, it's not late at all.

196
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:18,919
Let's go abroad.

197
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:20,280
Bali, Chiang Mai, Dubai.

198
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,799
Let's find a place where nobody knows us

199
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,000
and start all over again.

200
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,359
Fanlv.

201
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,919
What're you doing?

202
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,280
Take your time.

203
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:11,919
Fanlv.

204
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,159
Fanlv.

205
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,200
Wait a minute.

206
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,119
What's wrong with her recently?

207
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,479
I have no idea.

208
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:25,919
She's been like this lately.

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,280
She's always like
she can't have enough to eat.

210
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,239
Except for overeating,

211
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,119
she's been often alone
in the small living room,

212
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,559
talking to herself, or staring blankly
without talking.

213
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Sometimes she spoke to herself
in the mirror.

214
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:38,760
It's creepy.

215
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:41,440
Mr. Lin.

216
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,559
According to what you've described,

217
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,960
we have reason to suspect

218
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,200
your wife is suffering from depression.

219
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,359
Is there any way out?

220
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,479
Depression is

221
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,119
a kind of mental illness that mainly
causes a persistent feeling of sadness.

222
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,000
Patients are usually depressed, sad,
and inferior.

223
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,200
She might suffer a loss
or even be deprived of

224
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,719
her interests in life.

225
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,679
Serious patients will become

226
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,080
pessimistic and desperate.

227
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,880
So in normal times families have to keep
her company as much as possible.

228
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,640
In the daily life,
you have to keep an eye on her.

229
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,359
Or...

230
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,280
Or what?

231
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,679
Of course.

232
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,559
I'm referring to the patients with
severe depression.

233
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,799
They might commit suicide.

234
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,679
Fanlv. It's a nice day today.

235
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,799
Let's go out for a walk.

236
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,719
No.

237
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,880
Fine. Call if off then.

238
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm just sitting here.
Let's have a talk.

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,960
Go ahead by yourself.

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Where are you going?

241
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,200
Do I need your permission

242
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,200
to go back to my own room?

243
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,880
I didn't mean it.

244
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,239
Miss Jiang. Let me accompany you back.

245
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,119
By the way.

246
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,359
Let me introduce you

247
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,119
the new nanny.

248
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,159
Mrs. Wang.

249
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,760
Aren't there already two nannies
at home?

250
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,760
You don't like that nanny, right?

251
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,760
I fired her.

252
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:42,599
Mrs. Wang

253
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
is specially for you to talk with.

254
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,200
She's keeping an eye on me, isn't she?

255
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:47,679
Don't say that.

256
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,039
You're always alone at home every day.

257
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,000
There has to be someone to
talk with you.

258
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,119
Let her go. I don't need it.

259
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,840
Come on. Please?

260
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm usually busy working in the company.

261
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,599
I'm worried about you being alone here
all the time.

262
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,479
Miss Jiang. I won't bother you.

263
00:15:03,599 --> 00:15:05,640
I'll show up only when you need me.

264
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
Mrs. Wang.

265
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,880
My wife is not feeling very well
recently.

266
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,280
Please take good care of her.

267
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,000
Ok. Sir.

268
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,919
Shangguan has been looking for
Wang Mian for many days,

269
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,799
but still has no clue.

270
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,719
There is one person.

271
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,200
You can give it a try.

272
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,679
Who is it?

273
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,799
Xie Li.

274
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,000
Xie Li?

275
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,239
Lin Xiangyuan is the cause
of this event.

276
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,000
But according to the current situation,

277
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,400
his initial purpose

278
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,000
may be to make some money.

279
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Probably he himself hasn't expected that

280
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,119
things are going like this.

281
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,119
So

282
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:50,280
when he was doing the whole thing,

283
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,960
there must be flaws.

284
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,719
And Xie Li

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,960
is one of them.

286
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
He had been following Lin Xiangyuan
every day.

287
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,400
Whatever Lin Xiangyuan has done,

288
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
there's no way he has no idea.

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,479
If anything,
Lin Xiangyuan is scared of me.

290
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,239
Xie Li hates me.

291
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,840
Why?

292
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:07,679
He used to work for Yutian.

293
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:08,960
He's greedy.

294
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:10,880
He had some financial problems with
the movie

295
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,799
invested by Yutian.

296
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:12,919
So he had to leave.

297
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,559
After that he has been following
Lin Xiangyuan.

298
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,400
Perhaps he has always held a grudge
against it.

299
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,080
On the other hand,

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,919
as he was greedy,

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,799
he would buy the shares of Yutian

302
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,200
behind Lin Xiangyuan's back.

303
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:27,320
If Lin Xiangyuan didn't know about it,

304
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,719
others behind the scenes
won't know about it either.

305
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,000
I believe

306
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,799
they didn't fix this flaw in time.

307
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,679
The premise is whether he knew about

308
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,400
the cooperation between Yutian and S.G
before signing the agreement.

309
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:40,559
If Lin Xiangyuan was aware of it,

310
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,119
then he must know it.

311
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,719
I assume he was the one to go for Li Lu.

312
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,400
If so,

313
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,280
leave it to me.

314
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:49,799
I'll get to the bottom of them.

315
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,799
No.

316
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:53,320
To deal with a shameless man
like Xie Li,

317
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,520
there must be a person more shameless
than him.

318
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:59,400
Leave it to Shangguan.

319
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,679
That day I asked Xu You to dinner

320
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,280
Du Xiaosu saw it.

321
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,680
Du Xiaosu?

322
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,520
What's going on?

323
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,599
I'm worried I might've really hurt her.

324
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,839
But that's fine.

325
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,000
For her safety.

326
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,920
You have to cut the tie with her
for now.

327
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,719
If there is no better way,

328
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,839
I can only let her misunderstand me
for now.

329
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,079
Chairman. Something's wrong!

330
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:31,040
What's going on?

331
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,000
What happened?
Why are you in such a panic?

332
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,479
Watch the news.

333
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,920
Mr. Lin. Have you watched the news?

334
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,680
What news?

335
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,719
Someone is going to take over Yutian.

336
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,400
What's great about that?

337
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,920
I...I have heard
it's the overseas fund company.

338
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,119
Do you want me to ask someone?

339
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,319
Not necessary.

340
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,239
Mind your own business.

341
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,680
Mr. Lin. You seem to have known this.

342
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,880
It is news,

343
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,359
so people with phones will know it.

344
00:18:17,479 --> 00:18:18,880
Why make the fuss about it?

345
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,040
Now that Yutian is going to be
taken over,

346
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,680
it's useless for Lei Yuzheng to
come back.

347
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,280
Then we can...

348
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,880
If Yutian is taken over,

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,800
you'll lose your job.

350
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,319
Don't be cheerful all day long.

351
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:35,359
If Yutian is taken over,

352
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,000
no one will come to a good end.

353
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:43,456
(Jiang Jin)

354
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,199
Go out, please.

355
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,719
Mr. Lin. There's one more thing.

356
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,640
Go out. We'll talk about it later.

357
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Do you know that

358
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,280
Hengshan Fund overseas

359
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,239
is going to take over our Yutian?

360
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,479
Really?

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,560
Ok. I'll be there.

362
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,760
(It is said that Hengshan Fund had)

363
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,400
(already acquired 5% of the shares
of Yutian.)

364
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,959
(As for Yutian,)

365
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,560
(there was no response yet.)

366
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,239
(Our reporters will continue to follow.)

367
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,479
Come to the next. We'll...

368
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,520
I didn't expect they made the move
so soon.

369
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,359
It is obvious that

370
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,599
they've already known that
we've started our investigation.

371
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,439
They're afraid out results will
mess things up.

372
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,359
More importantly,

373
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:40,119
they're going to cover
their criminal acts.

374
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,479
So they made the move in advance.

375
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,880
I know. I'm trying to figure it out.

376
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
That'll be all for now.

377
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,959
If there is anything,
I'll let you know at once.

378
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,319
Mr. Jiang. So much has happened.

379
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,839
Why don't you call me?

380
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,119
Mr. Fang.

381
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,880
I was just aware of it.

382
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,839
You're the chairman of Yutian.
You have to make the decision.

383
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,400
We all depend on you.

384
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,199
I know. Take it easy.

385
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,920
How can I take it easy?

386
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,800
I've heard that Hengshan Fund is
quite powerful,

387
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,520
and aggressive.

388
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,560
I'm afraid our Yutian might be acquired.

389
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,520
And if worse comes to worst,

390
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,319
get Lei Yuzheng back.

391
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,160
That guy is capable.

392
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Ok. I get it.

393
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,959
Yuzheng.

394
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,640
This time Yutian is really in trouble.

395
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,880
I've already known it, Uncle Jiang.

396
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,079
I'm here to discuss this with you.

397
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,880
Do you have any idea?

398
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,199
I think first of all

399
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,760
we have to hold a press conference

400
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,280
to keep the media in control.

401
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Second,

402
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,599
we have to restore the confidence of
the market in Yutian.

403
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,599
We have to tell them that
Yutian is in order.

404
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,760
Great. Great.

405
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,640
Why hasn't he come yet?

406
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,680
May I ask how Yutian is gonna

407
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,760
respond to the takeover?

408
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,959
Are you going to accept it
or fight against it?

409
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,160
Well...

410
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,800
Everyone. First of all.
Thank you very much

411
00:21:14,959 --> 00:21:16,560
for your attention to Yutian.

412
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:19,000
We've just received the invitation
of the acquisition.

413
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,719
As to how to deal with it,

414
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,239
we have to wait for the decision made by

415
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:25,280
the Board of Directors and
interim general meeting of stockholders.

416
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
I'll keep you up to date

417
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,920
the first time with any news.

418
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,280
Hengshan Fund is the top private equity fund.

419
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,839
Being confronted with
such a powerful opponent,

420
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,359
doesn't Yutian have any solutions?

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Takeover or anti-takeover

422
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,959
are both common commercial behaviors
in the capitalist market.

423
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,199
I don't think we need make a fuss

424
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,520
because of the takeover.

425
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,119
As to the solutions,

426
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,439
I believe any listed company

427
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,439
has corresponding solutions to
this kind of situation.

428
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,359
Mr. Jiang.

429
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,959
As the chairman of
a listed company,

430
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,160
what is your attitude?

431
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,959
Individually,

432
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,040
are you in favor of the takeover
or against it?

433
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,719
Mr. Jiang.

434
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Excuse me. Please be quiet.

435
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,199
Mr. Jiang can't

436
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,719
answer your question just now.

437
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:02,640
I think you probably have no idea that

438
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,479
for an important solution like this,

439
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,400
the final decision will be made

440
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,560
by the general meeting of shareholders,

441
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,920
instead of Board of Directors.

442
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,680
So I hope everyone can look forward to

443
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,359
our next decision.

444
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,599
All right. Mr. Jiang.

445
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,400
That's the end of
our today's press conference.

446
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,719
Thank you all for coming.

447
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,079
Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you.

448
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,280
Mr. Jiang. Mr. Jiang.

449
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,479
One more question. Mr. Jiang.

450
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,319
Have a cup of coffee.

451
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,719
Have been busy for so many days.

452
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Finally the market is closed.

453
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,119
I can take a break.

454
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,479
You have done a great job recently.

455
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,920
It's far from that.

456
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,079
I worked in finance industry and

457
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,880
have already been used to
this kind of life.

458
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,319
I didn't expect you

459
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,920
to be so calm

460
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,920
when being confronted
with a formidable enemy,

461
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,599
and spend the day sunbathing with me.

462
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,119
What do I have to be afraid of?

463
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,640
I have you

464
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,239
by my side to help me.

465
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,199
Don't flatter me.

466
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,680
Hengshan Fund is tough.

467
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,920
I may not be their opponent.

468
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
In order to cover the truth,

469
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,040
on the one hand they stop us
from the investigation,

470
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,920
on the other hand,
they make use of the acquisition

471
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,160
to divert people's attention.

472
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,359
The purpose is still to
stop our investigation.

473
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,760
I just want them to know.

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,520
No matter whether they take over or not,

475
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,760
I won't stop the investigation.

476
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,199
But I have no idea

477
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:37,880
where to start.

478
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:45,719
What?

479
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,719
We've got Li Lu.

480
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,119
Wang Mian. Don't worry.

481
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:21,839
I've come here alone.

482
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,479
Nobody is following me.

483
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
Thank you for saving me last time.

484
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,560
I'm afraid you ask me out this time

485
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,400
not to thank me.

486
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:31,599
I know where Li Lu is.

487
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,280
Where is he?

488
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,280
In his hometown.

489
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,479
Guizhou?

490
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,680
Yes.

491
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,520
Are you still in contact now?

492
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,520
After he went back to his hometown,

493
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:45,160
in the first few months,
I could still reach him.

494
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,680
But a few months later,

495
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
I can't reach him either.

496
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,640
Besides, the call was answered by
someone else.

497
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,239
I think he has already
changed his number.

498
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
He changed his number?

499
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,959
Yes.

500
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:58,959
So

501
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:00,880
Li Lu went back to his hometown.

502
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,599
It looks like this.

503
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,319
But not for certain.

504
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,119
Maybe he went somewhere else.

505
00:25:22,199 --> 00:25:23,319
What do you mean?

506
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:24,680
Siyang.

507
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,040
Tomorrow you go to the shopping mall

508
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:30,199
and buy two clothes
which are exactly the same,

509
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,280
and one international flight ticket.

510
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,359
Xiao Zhang.

511
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,839
Book me an international flight
ticket tomorrow.

512
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,160
Tell me after it's done.

513
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,359
And tell the driver to pick me up
from my home.

514
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
What did you say?

515
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,760
Lei Yuzheng is going abroad?

516
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,760
You wanna pretend to go abroad?

517
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:53,199
What else can I do?
Someone is watching us.

518
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,439
I have to play a trick.

519
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,160
It is true.

520
00:25:58,479 --> 00:26:00,000
I heard that
he asked Xiao Zhang in the office

521
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,560
to book him the ticket.

522
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,119
Why does he go abroad at this moment?

523
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,560
Is he going to visit famous S.G?

524
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,479
He might be.

525
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,920
Lin Dun from S.G is his classmate
in Stanford.

526
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,920
Then what should we do?

527
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,880
Let me figure it out.

528
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,880
Follow the car.

529
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,439
Wish you a nice trip, Mr. Lei.

530
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:22,880
Thank you.

531
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,640
You're welcome.

532
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,599
Hello.

533
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,479
Can I change the ticket

534
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,719
of Flight 987 here?

535
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,719
Yes. Would you like to change it?

536
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,599
No. I'll wait.

537
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:34,959
Thank you.

538
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:52,960
(Shanghai Specialty)

539
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,688
(Lei is in international departure)

540
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,952
(Don't leave and keep an eye on it)

541
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,319
Mr. Lei. Is everything going well?

542
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,400
Yes, it is.

543
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,439
How about Siyang?

544
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:05,568
(Liu Siyang: Everything's OK.
Boarding now)

545
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,400
Siyang said everything is going well.
He is boarding.

546
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,760
Let's go.

547
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,079
Mr. Lei. Where are we going?

548
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,000
Guizhou.

549
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:12,920
Ok.

550
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,000
Let's go.

551
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:27,000
Du Xiaosu.

552
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:29,000
Why are you here?

553
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:31,400
You were not back home all night.
Am I not worried?

554
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,319
You worked too hard.

555
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,040
I've just realized now

556
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,599
how good working is.

557
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,800
Money sometimes is really
more important than love.

558
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,079
If you put efforts into making money,
you'll have it.

559
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,359
But love...

560
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,439
Giving doesn't always get paid back.

561
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
Pay back?

562
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:57,599
What?

563
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,520
Du Xiaosu.

564
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,560
What am I to you?

565
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:00,319
My bestie.

566
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:03,040
I'm your good listener.

567
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,359
So there can't be anything

568
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:06,599
in your mind, right?

569
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,920
Tell me everything you're upset about.

570
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,400
I am all ears.

571
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,760
What are you talking about?

572
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm quite busy now.

573
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:18,160
I don't have time to
spill out the troubles.

574
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,640
If you don't have anything else,

575
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,880
just go back.

576
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:23,560
Thank you for dropping in.

577
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:24,239
Let's go.

578
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,640
Look at your black eyes.

579
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,479
I am busy.

580
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,280
Is this for work?

581
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,000
Isn't it for him?

582
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,656
(Entertainment Express. Lei Yuzheng)

583
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,319
It's been revised.

584
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,239
Fine. Even if it is.

585
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
How about Yutian's PR?

586
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,959
How about Xu You's agent?

587
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,719
Why don't they come out to
make the clarification?

588
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,319
Now people all over the world are
responding the same.

589
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,079
They are all acquiescing in it.

590
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,719
A clean hand wants no washing.

591
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,719
If every time there is a gossip,

592
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,400
it has to be clarified,

593
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:55,000
these companies can't do anything else.

594
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,479
Go ahead. You continue to be stubborn.

595
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,079
I'm asking you one question now.

596
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,079
Did he, Lei Yuzheng, ever contact you?

597
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:00,880
Did he make a call?

598
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,599
Did he send a message?

599
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,760
If it's difficult for you to ask,
I will ask him.

600
00:31:07,239 --> 00:31:08,239
What are you doing?

601
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,680
Can't I ask him?

602
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,079
What are you doing?

603
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,359
I have to make it clear.

604
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,760
What? How?

605
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,560
Who am I to Lei Yuzheng?

606
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,719
He has the freedom to contact

607
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,079
with others without my permission.

608
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,439
Don't you know that?

609
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,719
What happened to you on the island

610
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,560
demonstrated that you fell in love.

611
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,359
I don't understand.

612
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,359
Why can't you intervene?

613
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
Besides,

614
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,719
it's not interfering,
it's protecting your right.

615
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,760
Are you really silly?

616
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,199
She's threatening you now.
Are you aware of that?

617
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,680
You're just sitting here
and doing nothing.

618
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,119
Zou Siqi.

619
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:49,520
Lei Yuzheng and I are grown-ups.

620
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,719
We'll

621
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,400
work it out.

622
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,239
We've been through so much.

623
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,920
And we know each other.

624
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,079
If there is understanding between us,

625
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,000
why do we have to say it?

626
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,439
Fine.

627
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,160
I admit.

628
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,079
Lei Yuzheng is probably really
in love with you.

629
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:13,439
Is he able to cope with the passion
of Xu You?

630
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,560
I don't want to speculate on others.

631
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,079
When you found that
Lei Yuzheng and Xu You were together,

632
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,719
your expression had already

633
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,160
told me everything.

634
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:23,800
My lady.

635
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,359
I really don't want to
talk about it today.

636
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,560
I still have a lot of work to do.

637
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,760
I'm really busy.

638
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,719
I'm also tired.

639
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,160
If there isn't anything else,

640
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,719
you can go home first.

641
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,119
-Hurry up. Du Xiaosu.
-Bye.

642
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,920
I can wish you happy every day.

643
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,400
But the premise is

644
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,359
you have to be really happy.

645
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,072
(Nanny)

646
00:33:07,479 --> 00:33:08,119
Mr. Lin.

647
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,439
Something was wrong!

648
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,920
Please come back!

649
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,959
Nurse! Nurse!

650
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,079
Honey. Everything's fine.

651
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:21,839
Hold on!

652
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,079
Nurse!

653
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,040
Everything is gonna be fine.

654
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:26,239
Nurse!

655
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,680
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

656
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,839
Watch out! Watch out!

657
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,400
Come on. Slow down.

658
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,119
The patient's family members
are waiting outside.

659
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,640
Dad.

660
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,920
Dad.

661
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,920
Fanlv is in trouble.

662
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,760
Settle her down quickly.

663
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,399
Why did you save me?

664
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,639
Just let me die.

665
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,639
We've worked so hard to
save you.

666
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,919
You still wanna die?

667
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:33,959
Do you know

668
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,600
how many patients in the world die

669
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,479
without treatment every day?

670
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,959
Look at those patients
who are seriously ill.

671
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
They are so painful,

672
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,439
but they are still pulling
themselves together.

673
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,840
You're so young,

674
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,120
but you don't cherish your life,

675
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:49,159
and the efforts of medical staff.

676
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,080
So many opportunities for patients

677
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,639
waiting for rescue are wasted.

678
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,840
The wound has been treated.

679
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,919
Think about it.

680
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,239
Who are you?

681
00:35:06,879 --> 00:35:07,959
I'm the patient's husband.

682
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:09,239
Doctor.

683
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,159
How is my wife now?

684
00:35:11,479 --> 00:35:12,639
She's fine for now.

685
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,199
But,

686
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,199
is there something wrong with your wife?

687
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,879
Or something made her unhappy?

688
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:20,560
She had depression before.

689
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,239
But I didn't expect
it to be so serious.

690
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,479
This time she's lucky.

691
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,120
But it doesn't mean that
she can still be lucky next time.

692
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,040
You have to be prepared.

693
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,520
Please go ahead.

694
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,600
Your wife

695
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,959
has developed
a serious suicidal tendency.

696
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,399
It belongs to severe depression.

697
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:37,959
I recommend early treatment.

698
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,080
Doctor, I will cooperate with
any treatment required.

699
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,800
Money is not the problem,

700
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:42,080
as long as she can be cured.

701
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,120
First of all, drug therapy can be
taken into consideration.

702
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,360
Drug therapy?

703
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,399
Of course, the patient like her

704
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
needs long-term medication.

705
00:35:49,919 --> 00:35:51,959
She might be drug dependent.

706
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,719
There'll be trigeminal neuralgia,

707
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:54,600
memory loss,

708
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,199
and damages to visceral organs, etc.

709
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,719
Is there any other way?

710
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,360
If you don't adopt drug therapy,

711
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,159
then try psychological treatment.

712
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,000
The best psychotherapy is
to keep her company.

713
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,520
Your family members have to
accompany her as much as possible.

714
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,199
Help her relieve the pressure,

715
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,439
and ensure her safety.

716
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,000
Besides, the patient is quite agitated.

717
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,959
It's better not to let her know
about her illness,

718
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,600
so as not to bother her.

719
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,959
Ok. Thank you, doctor.

720
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,239
All right. You're welcome.

721
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,919
Fanlv.

722
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,399
If anything really happens to you,

723
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,040
how can I live the rest of my life?

724
00:36:45,439 --> 00:36:49,120
If I'm dead, everyone will be easy.

725
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,760
Isn't it?

726
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,479
Why are you saying like that?

727
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,199
Fanlv.

728
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,399
Do I behave disgracefully in your heart?

729
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,760
People say
couple for one day, love forever.

730
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,959
Moreover,
we've been married for so long.

731
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,239
The doctor told me to be nice to you.

732
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
Don't lie to me.

733
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,159
I know what's wrong with me.

734
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,439
Why did you save me?

735
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,719
It'll be good that I'm dead.

736
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,280
What's the point of living?

737
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,879
It'll be easy instead to be dead.

738
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Fanlv.

739
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,719
Don't say that.

740
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Each person will be
in a bad mood sometimes .

741
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,520
The doctor said

742
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,919
you would get better very soon.

743
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,199
Dad.

744
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,320
Get up.

745
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:04,520
My dear. What's wrong with you?

746
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:08,159
Are you silly?

747
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,679
If anything happens to you,

748
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,520
how can I

749
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,479
live with it?

750
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,919
Dad.

751
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,399
My dear. Why are you so upset?

752
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,600
Tell me if you are in trouble.

753
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,840
Dad will help you out.

754
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,280
Come with me.

755
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,639
Tell me. What's going on?

756
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,000
Dad. I didn't take good care of Fanlv.

757
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:04,679
Sure, you didn't.

758
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,560
Let me ask you.

759
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,600
What did the doctor say?

760
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,919
The doctor said

761
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:12,280
Fanlv had depression.

762
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,879
When did she have it?

763
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,639
Why don't you tell me earlier?

764
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,199
Actually Fanlv has been
in depression for a while.

765
00:39:20,439 --> 00:39:23,080
I didn't tell you because I'm
afraid you might be worried.

766
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:27,040
Fanlv is my daughter.

767
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:29,520
When she was sick, you didn't tell me.

768
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,719
You were worrying about me?

769
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,719
If you really worried about me,

770
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,879
you would not fight with her recklessly.

771
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,320
You made her lose her baby.

772
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,280
Lin Xiangyuan.
I'm telling you.

773
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
You should consider yourself lucky
that nothing happened to Fanlv.

774
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
If anything happens to her,

775
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,439
I won't forgive you.

776
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:54,280
Dad. It's my fault.

777
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,320
I didn't make Fanlv happy.

778
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,280
So far,

779
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,760
I assume that it's time to end.
