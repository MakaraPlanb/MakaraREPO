Xiangyuan.

17
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,440
Come on in. It's cold outside.

18
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,440
Thank you for

19
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,279
being the witness for me and Fanlv,

20
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,880
and for visiting my mom in my hometown.

21
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,000
When you're available,

22
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,639
bring your mom here for meals.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,199
Can I light a joss stick for your dad?

24
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,440
Mr. Lei,

25
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,960
I, Lin Xiangyuan, am very sorry.

26
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,119
I'm here to apologize to you.

27
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,200
Even if the whole world can forgive me,

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,640
I can't forgive myself.

29
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,880
I have caused so much trouble

30
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
for you and Lei Yuzheng.

31
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
I feel guilty.

32
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,119
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,519
Mr. Lei,

34
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,239
I decide to leave Yutian, because I

35
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,880
want to take the responsibility
for my mistakes.

36
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,559
Mr. Jiang and Fanlv
have spoken well of me,

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,559
but

38
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,079
I don't deserve their caring.

39
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,519
Mr. Lei, I will stop bothering you.

40
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,320
Lin Xiangyuan,

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,000
do you actually think that
you can gain my forgiveness

42
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,880
just by leaving for good?

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,559
I don't care if you did it
on purpose or not,

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,320
but it is true that you
have put me and Yutian

45
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,519
in a very dangerous situation.

46
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,640
Do you think that I can get over it?

47
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,760
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:47,559
You're sorry.

49
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,519
Do you know

50
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,679
what it means

51
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,160
for a man to say sorry?

52
00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:00,480
It means that he needs to work harder

53
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,760
to make up for the mistakes he made.

54
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,880
The only way for you
to make up for that right now

55
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,600
is to stay at Yutian.

56
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:11,119
Here's the evidence from
the investigation on you.

57
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,720
It belongs to you now.

58
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,279
Xiangyuan,

59
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,760
you are here today

60
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,480
to confront me.

61
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,359
It means that you're a man who takes
responsibility for his own actions.

62
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
I don't want to stick to the past.

63
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,200
So you should also look forward.

64
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,079
Mr. Lei.

65
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:10,160
Mr. Lin, it's emergency.

66
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,239
We're all in the meeting room.

67
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,279
You should come too.

68
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,160
You're here.

69
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
Please come in and have a seat.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Since everyone's here,

71
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,279
we can start now.

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,320
All the shareholders of Yutian Group

73
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,679
since foundation till now
are here today.

74
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,920
Ever since the acquisition issue,

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,799
we have seen that Mr. Lei has

76
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,720
the same mindpower and persistency

77
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,480
as Mr. Lei Senior.

78
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,799
Therefore, we have strong faith

79
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,040
in Yutian's future.

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,920
We hope that Mr. Lei can come back to

81
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,040
where you belong as soon as possible.

82
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,559
Mr. Lei, please just come back.

83
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,399
Every shareholder, thank you all.

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,359
But regarding whether
I will come back or not,

85
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,519
I've already had the answer.

86
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:12,200
I remember that my dad
used to tell me that

87
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,880
doing business

88
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,679
is not for interests.
Instead, it's for people's heart.

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,440
Xiangyuan,

90
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,119
I remember that you also told me that

91
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,279
people's heart can only be won

92
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,200
and not be given.

93
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,480
No matter how long I'm in this position,

94
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:34,000
there's no way that I can replace you.

95
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,160
Because people's heart can only be won

96
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,600
and not be given.

97
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,359
I'm sure that everyone has witnessed

98
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,399
the achievement of Mr. Lin
over the years,

99
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,559
which has helped him
win many people's heart.

100
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,880
Today I would like to
announce one thing.

101
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,720
I will leave Yutian temporarily

102
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,399
and quit the position
of Chairman assistant.

103
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,960
From now on, Mr. Lin will lead everyone

104
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,239
and Yutian to move forward.

105
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:02,479
Yuzheng,

106
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,559
am I hearing correctly?

107
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,359
You are quitting?

108
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:13,359
Yutian does not only
belong to Lei's family.

109
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,559
It belongs to everyone.

110
00:08:17,679 --> 00:08:19,080
I hope that you can all understand.

111
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,320
Goodbye.

112
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:37,896
(Assistant)

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,840
How was it?

114
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,640
Was Mr. Wang satisfied with

115
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,520
the plans that we modified?

116
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,679
Yes, he was.

117
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,239
He's especially satisfied
with your suggestion

118
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,719
to use glass and steel
for the renovation. He wants to start

119
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,200
the construction as soon as
the drawings are ready.

120
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:56,280
That's such a relief!

121
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,159
Oh, Xiaosu.

122
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,719
There's something I need to tell you.

123
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,760
I'm afraid that while I'm gone,

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
you can't handle everything by yourself.

125
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,280
So I've found a free assistant for you.

126
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,479
Free assistant?

127
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,280
Yes.

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,599
He should have already
arrived at your door.

129
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,479
I feel that this person is quite great.

130
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,919
You will be satisfied for sure.

131
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,119
It seems like he's here.

132
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,039
Gotta go. Bye.

133
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:17,880
OK.

134
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,479
Hello, Boss Du.

135
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Nice to meet you.

136
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:32,559
How come it is you?

137
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,159
I heard that you need an assistant,

138
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,599
and I'm here for my job interview.

139
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,359
I'm sorry, but

140
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:38,520
I think you found the wrong place.

141
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
I don't need an assistant.

142
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,200
So this is the place
where Miss Du works.

143
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,840
You moved the office back home.

144
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,840
So dedicated!

145
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,080
Boss Du,

146
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,559
I can start working right away.

147
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Lei Yuzheng,

148
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,320
it is assistant that I'm hiring,

149
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,919
not a boss.

150
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,159
Stand up.

151
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:05,479
I...

152
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,679
My studio is going to go broke,

153
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,320
and I don't have money to hire people.

154
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I have no demand for salary.

155
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
OK. I see.

156
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,960
You are pitying me.

157
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,039
Boss Du,

158
00:10:25,479 --> 00:10:27,280
you are taking it wrong.

159
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,599
I'm here to learn from you.

160
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,640
Learn?

161
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,919
This place is too ordinary
for the mighty you.

162
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,520
Please just go back.

163
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:35,520
Thank you.

164
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
Don't make a mess for me.

165
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm begging you.

166
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,159
Boss Du, Boss Du.

167
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,919
Mr. Lei, thank you.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
Goodbye.

169
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,359
Boss Du,

170
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,400
how about just for a trial period?

171
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,840
Three months.

172
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,239
Only three months.

173
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,599
One month.

174
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,559
Ten days.

175
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,359
In ten days, if

176
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,919
I still can't change myself

177
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,200
to satisfy boss' needs,

178
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,799
I will quit myself.

179
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,080
Are you sure?

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,559
A man would keep his promises.

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
Qunfei,

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,719
actually I had no idea that

183
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,239
Mr. Lei would make the announcement

184
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,599
and let me stay in the company.

185
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640
Mr. Lin,

186
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,239
we both have done

187
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:27,840
things that we are sorry for Mr. Lei.

188
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,400
Actually, I'm staying here at Yutian

189
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,919
not because I want to get promoted
or become rich.

190
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,719
I just want to do my best

191
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,599
and make up for my mistakes.

192
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Qunfei,

193
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,919
you must be still hating me.

194
00:11:47,719 --> 00:11:48,880
About what happened before,

195
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,640
I was doing it not only to earn money,

196
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,239
but also to win people's respect.

197
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,719
Mr. Lin,

198
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
I'm the same as you.

199
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:01,840
I also come from a small town.

200
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,039
Maybe I don't have as much
knowledge as you do,

201
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:08,080
and I might not be
as ambitious as you are,

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,520
but I could tell for sure that

203
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,599
Mr. Lei is a trustful boss to me.

204
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,080
That's why I want to follow him,

205
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,200
and do whatever

206
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,960
he asks me to do.

207
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,719
The things that he
doesn't allow me to do

208
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
must be wrong.

209
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,520
You can say that
I don't have enough ability

210
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,640
and I'm shortsighted.

211
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,679
But look,

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,359
I've been working hard

213
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,039
and I've become a manager now

214
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,599
with my own achievements.

215
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,000
Qunfei,

216
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,239
I'm sorry for

217
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,799
what I've done to you.

218
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,000
There's no end to revenge.

219
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:48,840
Mr. Lin,

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
I want to ask you whether

221
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,080
you still think of me as a friend?

222
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:57,200
If you do,

223
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,080
I'm your friend.

224
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,799
If you think of me as a friend,

225
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,840
let's get over

226
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
what happened in the past.

227
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,359
Alright.

228
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,640
Take these and make 10 copies.

229
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,559
What are you doing over there?

230
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,479
Boss Du, excuse me.

231
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,280
Where can I make copies of these?

232
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,239
Got it, boss. Don't worry.
I will be back soon.

Mom, allow me.

250
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:44,919
OK.

251
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,880
Mom, you should rest a bit.
Don't worry about those.

252
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,799
OK.

253
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,239
Let's start.

254
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,880
Otherwise, the dishes will get cold.

255
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,359
My daughter-in-law, help yourself.

256
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,159
Try and see if you like it.

257
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,799
Mom, your cooking is awesome.

258
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,840
I used to like what

259
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,760
Xiangyuan cooked for me.

260
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,119
But compared with you,

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,760
his cooking skills
still need practicing.

262
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm glad you like it.

263
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
Mom will cook for you more often.

264
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,800
We haven't been like this
for quite a while.

265
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,280
Today is the first time that

266
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,439
we gather to have meals.

267
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Xiangyuan's mom,

268
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,160
it's hard for you to
raise Xiangyuan by yourself.

269
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,319
Here, a toast to you.

270
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,599
Fanlv's dad, Xiangyuan
might have brought you troubles.

271
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,800
It's his luck to marry
such a wonderful woman.

272
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,760
I should be the one who says thank you.

273
00:16:52,239 --> 00:16:53,119
Come on.

274
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,959
Dad,

275
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,560
I will make the toast.

276
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,959
The first glass is to

277
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,599
thank you for bringing
me into the business.

278
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
The second glass is to

279
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,599
thank you for

280
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,079
allowing me to marry your daughter.

281
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,280
As for the third glass,

282
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,040
I hope that I can still
be your son-in-law

283
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,599
in the future,

284
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,839
I can still call you dad

285
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:57,280
like now,

286
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,280
and we have meals together.

287
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:04,719
Xiangyuan,

288
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,560
don't talk like that.

289
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,239
Mom,

290
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,640
I will toast to you with this glass.

291
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,880
You will be leaving soon.

292
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,199
This glass is

293
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,119
to wish you a safe trip.

294
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,640
You used to teach me that

295
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:29,560
a person should never
let three matters down.

296
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,479
First, never let the
moral standard down.

297
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,280
Second, never let parents down.

298
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:34,920
Third, never let oneself down.

299
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,239
But now,

300
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,560
I didn't achieve any of them.

301
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,959
I feel sorry to you.

302
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,199
Xiangyuan,

303
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,280
did anything happen to you?

304
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:56,839
Mom.

305
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,280
Mom, it's nothing.

306
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,719
Xiangyuan is just too excited

307
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,520
to know what to say.

308
00:19:01,719 --> 00:19:02,839
Don't worry.

309
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,880
Xiangyuan's mom,

310
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,319
Xiangyuan is now the

311
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,800
president of Yutian.

312
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,359
His future is very bright.

313
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,640
Xiangyuan,

314
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,319
you have such bright future,

315
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,359
all thanks to Fanlv, her dad

316
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:24,199
and those friends.

317
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,640
You need to work hard

318
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,839
to pay back to them.

319
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,280
Mom, I know.

320
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,199
Fanlv,

321
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,280
I will toast to you with this glass.

322
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,959
I used to...

323
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Sorry,

324
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,439
I feel a little sick.

325
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:56,959
You should eat first.

326
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,520
Xiangyuan, sit down and eat.

327
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,800
We need to take your mom
to the airport soon.

328
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,280
Don't be late.

329
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,959
Xiangyuan, help yourself.

330
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,680
OK.

331
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,000
Have some more.

332
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,199
Mom, you should also have some more.

333
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,479
Fanlv's dad, you help yourself too.

334
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,680
I really didn't see
that side of you before.

335
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
You have such skills?

336
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,920
There must be a lot of girls
who like your cooking.

337
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,239
How would I know?

338
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,680
I've never cooked for anyone.

339
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,959
Wait,

340
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
are we missing anything?

341
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,800
Missing what?

342
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Where's the wine?

343
00:21:29,576 --> 00:21:31,400
(Bank Transfer Receipt)

344
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:46,319
Xiangyuan,

345
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,079
how about letting mom stay?

346
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,319
Mom is alone at home by herself

347
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,719
and we all worry about her.

348
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,280
It's OK.

349
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm used to living by myself.

350
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,239
Then you should come visit us often,

351
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,479
even if just for Fanlv.

352
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,400
I will visit often for sure.

353
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,680
Dad, Fanlv.

354
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,400
It's cold outside.
You should go back inside.

355
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:08,199
Exactly, Fanlv's dad,
my daughter-in-law.

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,319
You don't need to see me off.
You can go back in.

357
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
Mom, have a safe trip.

358
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Go back.

359
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,680
Bye.

360
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
Mom, have a safe trip. Bye!

361
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,319
My son, there's one thing that
I always wanted to ask you.

362
00:22:45,439 --> 00:22:47,800
Did you do anything
that you're sorry for anyone?

363
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
No.

364
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,040
Your son is doing well.

365
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:54,560
You are my son.

366
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
Of course I can tell.

367
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,839
Last time Mr. Lei came to our home

368
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
and told me that he was passing by

369
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,800
and that he didn't know you.

370
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,359
He's your boss.

371
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,400
How come he doesn't know you?

372
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,199
Also,

373
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:10,959
what was he doing back then?

374
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,400
Tell me.

375
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,640
It should be Lei Yuzheng
and his assistant.

376
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,479
I was out of my mind

377
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,640
and did something bad to Lei Yuzheng.

378
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,199
That Mr. Lei has been so good to you,

379
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,760
and he even gave his position to you.

380
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,479
How could you do bad things to him?

381
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,760
Mom,

382
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,040
I know that I was wrong.

383
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,439
Then you should make corrections.

384
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,599
Go find Mr. Lei and apologize

385
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,079
to gain his forgiveness.

386
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,520
Did you hear me?

387
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,439
My son, it's hard to live a life.

388
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,520
Sometimes, it's inevitable
to run into difficulties.

389
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,400
No matter how hard it is,
you should keep a strong will.

390
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:02,359
Remember that

391
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,239
there's no difficulty
that you can't overcome.

392
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,479
Even if something more difficult occurs,

393
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,199
mom will be by your side.

394
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,599
Come back home if
you want to cry to someone.

395
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:14,239
Cry to me.

396
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,479
Mom,

397
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,920
don't worry.

398
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,640
I remember every single thing you said.

399
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,920
Please take care of yourself.

400
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,079
As soon as I get everything done here,

401
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,400
I will go back and stay with you.

402
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:44,959
Here it is.

403
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Big meal.

404
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
It looks pretty good.

405
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,959
Of course it does,

406
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,560
since it is made by me.

407
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,560
Here you come again.

408
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:01,599
Have some wine, Boss Du.

409
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,800
Thank you.

410
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,479
You have a high tolerance.

411
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,760
Thank you.

412
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,000
Here you go.

413
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,439
Wish you have good
appetite all the time.

414
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:18,400
Thank you for the
delicious dinner you prepared.

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,160
I will have a taste.

416
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:33,719
Are you so happy now

417
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:35,280
that you already forget the instant noodle?

418
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:41,160
We can save it for the next time.

419
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:44,119
Boss Du,

420
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,040
your stomach is like your second brain.

421
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,959
You can only create good designs
when you're full.

422
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
For your designs and your future,

423
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,400
I suggest you to stay away from it.

424
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,239
But if you are not here,

425
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,800
I can't make such good dishes.

426
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,160
Du Xiaosu,

427
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,160
as long as you want,

428
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,680
I can handle every

429
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:22,000
single meal for you in the future.

430
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,920
Oh, wait a moment.

431
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,760
This is the dessert for you.

432
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:49,239
How is it?

433
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Do you like it?

434
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:52,479
Not bad.

435
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,920
That's good.

436
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,199
Since you like it,

437
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
can you

438
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,839
give me a surprise too?

439
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,479
What surprise do you want?

440
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Boss Du,

441
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,359
today is the last day

442
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,959
of my trial period.

443
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,760
I would like to know

444
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,959
if I can stay by your side

445
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,040
and cook for you every day.

446
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,439
Tomorrow,

447
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,599
you can stop showing up.

448
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:40,280
Why?

449
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,839
Am I not up to the job?

450
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,079
No, it's the opposite.

451
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,800
You were doing too good

452
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,040
for me to take it.

453
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,040
Is it wrong to do well?

454
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,959
Do you think that

455
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:00,599
you are still yourself now?

456
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,880
Why am I not myself?

457
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,239
I don't want you to

458
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,239
change because of me.

459
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,560
It's impossible to move you,

460
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:11,239
no matter what I do now. Am I right?

461
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,439
Lei Yuzheng,

462
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,839
after all these things,

463
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,719
do you still believe in love?

464
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,079
I didn't believe in love.

465
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,400
But someone told me that

466
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,599
it's because you haven't
met the right person and

467
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,839
you don't get it.

468
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,680
I was suspicious about the words

469
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,640
until I met you, Du Xiaosu.

470
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,719
Then I understood the
meaning of those words.

471
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,119
I used to believe that

472
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,359
love means no matter
what the other person does,

473
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,160
you would still unconditionally
choose this person,

474
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,400
wait for him, and forgive him.

475
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,640
I don't know what's wrong with me,

476
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,319
but I feel that

477
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:01,079
I can't do that anymore.

478
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,479
So I'm sorry.

479
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,599
It's OK.

480
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:10,520
It's getting late.

481
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,640

Fanlv,

492
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,479
don't take too much stuff.

493
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,439
I wouldn't need them.

494
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,359
Leave this sweater out of it too.

don't be like this.

498
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,640
I would be worried to see you like this.

499
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,319
Then don't go.

500
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,959
Yuzheng has said that

501
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,439
the best way for you to
make up for your mistakes

502
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,719
is to stay at Yutian

503
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,599
and serve Yutian.

504
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,640
The reason Lei Yuzheng could forgive me

505
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,119
is that he has good temper.

506
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,160
Fanlv, think about it.

507
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,239
Lei Yuzheng left Yutian,

508
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
because he follows the rules.

509
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,880
If he doesn't correct his mistakes,

510
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,719
he would never come back to Yutian

511
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,199
or take the position of president.

512
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,479
Yutian belongs to Lei's family.

513
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,000
But he gave it up because of me.

514
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:15,839
What a huge sacrifice he made!

515
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm a man

516
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,199
and I need to take responsibility
of what I've done.

517
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,160
I should sort things out

518
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,599
and take the responsibility
for my crime.

519
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,239
In such way, he can be
proved to be innocent

520
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,160
and come back to Yutian.

521
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,640
I know all that.

522
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,680

you know that I don't want this.

It's hard for me to
make this decision too.

535

559
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:28,479
It's my responsibility.

560
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,120
Listen to me.

561
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,360
You can't keep this baby.

562
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,239
That's impossible.

563
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,399
I was wrong once.

564
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
I won't make it happen again.

565
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:45,959
I've already decided.

566
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,080
No matter what happens

567
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,919
and no matter how long
you are staying there,

568
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,719
I will wait for you.

569
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,199
No.

570
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:07,560
I will wait for you with the baby.

571
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,489
(Jiang Fanlv, pregnant）

572
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,320
I told you to think clearly.

573
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,040
Yuzheng,

574
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:53,280
are you serious?

575
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,719
Of course I'm serious.

576
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,520
I want both his money

577
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,919
and yours,

578
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,159
as well as the money of all our friends.

579
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,520
You all need to offer your help.

580
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:02,840
Why?

581
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:05,479
Are you starting another business?

582
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:08,199
I just want to have a charity donation.

583
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,639
Charity donation?

584
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,159
After quitting the job,
I've been thinking about one thing.

585
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,479
If I had the chance to become

586
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,439
a totally different person than before,

587
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,479
what shall I do?

588
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,399
Now I got the answer.

589
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:25,320
This.

590
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,760
Let me tell you the story.

591
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,919
Some time ago, I went to this island.

592
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:34,080
There are many kids
who need help on that island.

593
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
They are very optimistic and strong

594
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,320
with strong wills to never give up.

595
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,239
They had a huge influence on me.

596
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,639
Therefore,

597
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,199
I've been thinking about
doing something for them.

598
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,399
The thing is,
I didn't know where I shall start.

599
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:47,719
Then here it is.

600
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,239
Regarding this charity donation,

601
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,719
I hope that not only me but also

602
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
my friends around me

603
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,040
can all offer help to these kids.

604
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:59,000
Yuzheng,

605
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,639
you've hidden so many things.

606
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,080
Let me ask you.

607
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:06,320
Who did you go to the island with?

608
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,840
And who gave you the idea

609
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:10,800
of doing the charity donation?

610
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,679
My son,

611
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:33,679
it's hard to live a life.

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,280
Sometimes, it's inevitable
to run into difficulties.

613
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:39,560
No matter how hard it is,
you should keep a strong will.

614
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,479
Remember that

615
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:42,579
(Police)

616
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,639
there's no difficulty
that you can't overcome.

617
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,560
I've already decided.

618
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,879
No matter what happens

619
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,959
and no matter how long
you are staying there,

620
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
I will wait for you.

621
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
No.

622
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,879
I will wait for you with the baby.
