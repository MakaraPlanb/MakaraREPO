Xiangyuan.

17
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,440
Come on in. It's cold outside.

18
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,440
Thank you for

19
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,279
being the witness for me and Fanlv,

20
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,880
and for visiting my mom in my hometown.

21
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
When you're available,

22
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:48,639
bring your mom here for meals.

23
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,199
Can I light a joss stick for your dad?

24
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,440
Mr. Lei,

25
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,960
I, Lin Xiangyuan, am very sorry.

26
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,119
I'm here to apologize to you.

27
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:21,200
Even if the whole world can forgive me,

28
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,640
I can't forgive myself.

29
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,880
I have caused so much trouble

30
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,720
for you and Lei Yuzheng.

31
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,920
I feel guilty.

32
00:04:30,119 --> 00:04:31,119
I'm sorry.

33
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,519
Mr. Lei,

34
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,239
I decide to leave Yutian, because I

35
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,880
want to take the responsibility
for my mistakes.

36
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,559
Mr. Jiang and Fanlv
have spoken well of me,

37
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,559
but

38
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,079
I don't deserve their caring.

39
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,519
Mr. Lei, I will stop bothering you.

40
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,320
Lin Xiangyuan,

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,000
do you actually think that
you can gain my forgiveness

42
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,880
just by leaving for good?

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,559
I don't care if you did it
on purpose or not,

44
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,320
but it is true that you
have put me and Yutian

45
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,519
in a very dangerous situation.

46
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,640
Do you think that I can get over it?

47
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,559
You're sorry.

49
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,519
Do you know

50
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,679
what it means

51
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,160
for a man to say sorry?

52
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,480
It means that he needs to work harder

53
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,760
to make up for the mistakes he made.

54
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,880
The only way for you
to make up for that right now

55
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,600
is to stay at Yutian.

56
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,119
Here's the evidence from
the investigation on you.

57
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,720
It belongs to you now.

58
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,279
Xiangyuan,

59
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,760
you are here today

60
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,480
to confront me.

61
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,359
It means that you're a man who takes
responsibility for his own actions.

62
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,040
I don't want to stick to the past.

63
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,200
So you should also look forward.

64
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,079
Mr. Lei.

65
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,160
Mr. Lin, it's emergency.

66
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,239
We're all in the meeting room.

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,279
You should come too.

68
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,160
You're here.

69
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,040
Please come in and have a seat.

70
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Since everyone's here,

71
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:10,279
we can start now.

72
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,320
All the shareholders of Yutian Group

73
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,679
since foundation till now
are here today.

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,920
Ever since the acquisition issue,

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,799
we have seen that Mr. Lei has

76
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
the same mindpower and persistency

77
00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:25,480
as Mr. Lei Senior.

78
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,799
Therefore, we have strong faith

79
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,040
in Yutian's future.

80
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,920
We hope that Mr. Lei can come back to

81
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,040
where you belong as soon as possible.

82
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,559
Mr. Lei, please just come back.

83
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,399
Every shareholder, thank you all.

84
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,359
But regarding whether
I will come back or not,

85
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,519
I've already had the answer.

86
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,200
I remember that my dad
used to tell me that

87
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:48,880
doing business

88
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,679
is not for interests.
Instead, it's for people's heart.

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,440
Xiangyuan,

90
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,119
I remember that you also told me that

91
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,279
people's heart can only be won

92
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,200
and not be given.

93
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,480
No matter how long I'm in this position,

94
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:09,000
there's no way that I can replace you.

95
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,160
Because people's heart can only be won

96
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,600
and not be given.

97
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,359
I'm sure that everyone has witnessed

98
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,399
the achievement of Mr. Lin
over the years,

99
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,559
which has helped him
win many people's heart.

100
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,880
Today I would like to
announce one thing.

101
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,720
I will leave Yutian temporarily

102
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,399
and quit the position
of Chairman assistant.

103
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,960
From now on, Mr. Lin will lead everyone

104
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,239
and Yutian to move forward.

105
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,479
Yuzheng,

106
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,559
am I hearing correctly?

107
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,359
You are quitting?

108
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,359
Yutian does not only
belong to Lei's family.

109
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,559
It belongs to everyone.

110
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,080
I hope that you can all understand.

111
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,320
Goodbye.

112
00:09:11,904 --> 00:09:12,896
(Assistant)

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,840
How was it?

114
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,640
Was Mr. Wang satisfied with

115
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,520
the plans that we modified?

116
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,679
Yes, he was.

117
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,239
He's especially satisfied
with your suggestion

118
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,719
to use glass and steel
for the renovation. He wants to start

119
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,200
the construction as soon as
the drawings are ready.

120
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,280
That's such a relief!

121
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,159
Oh, Xiaosu.

122
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,719
There's something I need to tell you.

123
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,760
I'm afraid that while I'm gone,

124
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,000
you can't handle everything by yourself.

125
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,280
So I've found a free assistant for you.

126
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,479
Free assistant?

127
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,280
Yes.

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,599
He should have already
arrived at your door.

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,479
I feel that this person is quite great.

130
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,919
You will be satisfied for sure.

131
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:51,119
It seems like he's here.

132
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,039
Gotta go. Bye.

133
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:52,880
OK.

134
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,479
Hello, Boss Du.

135
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Nice to meet you.

136
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,559
How come it is you?

137
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,159
I heard that you need an assistant,

138
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,599
and I'm here for my job interview.

139
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,359
I'm sorry, but

140
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:13,520
I think you found the wrong place.

141
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,760
I don't need an assistant.

142
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,200
So this is the place
where Miss Du works.

143
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,840
You moved the office back home.

144
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,840
So dedicated!

145
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Boss Du,

146
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:30,559
I can start working right away.

147
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Lei Yuzheng,

148
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
it is assistant that I'm hiring,

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,919
not a boss.

150
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,159
Stand up.

151
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,479
I...

152
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,679
My studio is going to go broke,

153
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,320
and I don't have money to hire people.

154
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
I have no demand for salary.

155
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,840
OK. I see.

156
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,960
You are pitying me.

157
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:00,039
Boss Du,

158
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,280
you are taking it wrong.

159
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,599
I'm here to learn from you.

160
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,640
Learn?

161
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,919
This place is too ordinary
for the mighty you.

162
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,520
Please just go back.

163
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,520
Thank you.

164
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,440
Don't make a mess for me.

165
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm begging you.

166
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,159
Boss Du, Boss Du.

167
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,919
Mr. Lei, thank you.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,880
Goodbye.

169
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,359
Boss Du,

170
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,400
how about just for a trial period?

171
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,840
Three months.

172
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,239
Only three months.

173
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,599
One month.

174
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,559
Ten days.

175
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,359
In ten days, if

176
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,919
I still can't change myself

177
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:32,200
to satisfy boss' needs,

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,799
I will quit myself.

179
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,080
Are you sure?

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,559
A man would keep his promises.

181
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Qunfei,

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,719
actually I had no idea that

183
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,239
Mr. Lei would make the announcement

184
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:56,599
and let me stay in the company.

185
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,640
Mr. Lin,

186
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,239
we both have done

187
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,840
things that we are sorry for Mr. Lei.

188
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,400
Actually, I'm staying here at Yutian

189
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,919
not because I want to get promoted
or become rich.

190
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,719
I just want to do my best

191
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,599
and make up for my mistakes.

192
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Qunfei,

193
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,919
you must be still hating me.

194
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:23,880
About what happened before,

195
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,640
I was doing it not only to earn money,

196
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:29,239
but also to win people's respect.

197
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,719
Mr. Lin,

198
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm the same as you.

199
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:36,840
I also come from a small town.

200
00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:39,039
Maybe I don't have as much
knowledge as you do,

201
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,080
and I might not be
as ambitious as you are,

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
but I could tell for sure that

203
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,599
Mr. Lei is a trustful boss to me.

204
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
That's why I want to follow him,

205
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,200
and do whatever

206
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,960
he asks me to do.

207
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,719
The things that he
doesn't allow me to do

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
must be wrong.

209
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,520
You can say that
I don't have enough ability

210
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:01,640
and I'm shortsighted.

211
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,679
But look,

212
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,359
I've been working hard

213
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:08,039
and I've become a manager now

214
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,599
with my own achievements.

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Qunfei,

216
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,239
I'm sorry for

217
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,799
what I've done to you.

218
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:21,000
There's no end to revenge.

219
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,840
Mr. Lin,

220
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,200
I want to ask you whether

221
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,080
you still think of me as a friend?

222
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:32,200
If you do,

223
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm your friend.

224
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,799
If you think of me as a friend,

225
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,840
let's get over

226
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,960
what happened in the past.

227
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:43,359
Alright.

228
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:45,640
Take these and make 10 copies.

229
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,559
What are you doing over there?

230
00:13:52,359 --> 00:13:53,479
Boss Du, excuse me.

231
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,280
Where can I make copies of these?

232
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,239
Got it, boss. Don't worry.
I will be back soon.

Mom, allow me.

250
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:19,919
OK.

251
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,880
Mom, you should rest a bit.
Don't worry about those.

252
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,799
OK.

253
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,239
Let's start.

254
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
Otherwise, the dishes will get cold.

255
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:31,359
My daughter-in-law, help yourself.

256
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,159
Try and see if you like it.

257
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,799
Mom, your cooking is awesome.

258
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
I used to like what

259
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,760
Xiangyuan cooked for me.

260
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,119
But compared with you,

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,760
his cooking skills
still need practicing.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm glad you like it.

263
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,000
Mom will cook for you more often.

264
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,800
We haven't been like this
for quite a while.

265
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,280
Today is the first time that

266
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,439
we gather to have meals.

267
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,760
Xiangyuan's mom,

268
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,160
it's hard for you to
raise Xiangyuan by yourself.

269
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,319
Here, a toast to you.

270
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:22,599
Fanlv's dad, Xiangyuan
might have brought you troubles.

271
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,800
It's his luck to marry
such a wonderful woman.

272
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,760
I should be the one who says thank you.

273
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,119
Come on.

274
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,959
Dad,

275
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,560
I will make the toast.

276
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,959
The first glass is to

277
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,599
thank you for bringing
me into the business.

278
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
The second glass is to

279
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,599
thank you for

280
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,079
allowing me to marry your daughter.

281
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,280
As for the third glass,

282
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,040
I hope that I can still
be your son-in-law

283
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,599
in the future,

284
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,839
I can still call you dad

285
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,280
like now,

286
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,280
and we have meals together.

287
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:39,719
Xiangyuan,

288
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,560
don't talk like that.

289
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,239
Mom,

290
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,640
I will toast to you with this glass.

291
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,880
You will be leaving soon.

292
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,199
This glass is

293
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,119
to wish you a safe trip.

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
You used to teach me that

295
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:04,560
a person should never
let three matters down.

296
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:06,479
First, never let the
moral standard down.

297
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,280
Second, never let parents down.

298
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,920
Third, never let oneself down.

299
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,239
But now,

300
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,560
I didn't achieve any of them.

301
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:18,959
I feel sorry to you.

302
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,199
Xiangyuan,

303
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,280
did anything happen to you?

304
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,839
Mom.

305
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Mom, it's nothing.

306
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,719
Xiangyuan is just too excited

307
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,520
to know what to say.

308
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:37,839
Don't worry.

309
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,880
Xiangyuan's mom,

310
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,319
Xiangyuan is now the

311
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,800
president of Yutian.

312
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:52,359
His future is very bright.

313
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,640
Xiangyuan,

314
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,319
you have such bright future,

315
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,359
all thanks to Fanlv, her dad

316
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:59,199
and those friends.

317
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,640
You need to work hard

318
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,839
to pay back to them.

319
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,280
Mom, I know.

320
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,199
Fanlv,

321
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,280
I will toast to you with this glass.

322
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,959
I used to...

323
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,000
Sorry,

324
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,439
I feel a little sick.

325
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,959
You should eat first.

326
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,520
Xiangyuan, sit down and eat.

327
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,800
We need to take your mom
to the airport soon.

328
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,280
Don't be late.

329
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,959
Xiangyuan, help yourself.

330
00:20:58,119 --> 00:20:58,680
OK.

331
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
Have some more.

332
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,199
Mom, you should also have some more.

333
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,479
Fanlv's dad, you help yourself too.

334
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
I really didn't see
that side of you before.

335
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,400
You have such skills?

336
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,920
There must be a lot of girls
who like your cooking.

337
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,239
How would I know?

338
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,680
I've never cooked for anyone.

339
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,959
Wait,

340
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,800
are we missing anything?

341
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,800
Missing what?

342
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Where's the wine?

343
00:22:04,576 --> 00:22:06,400
(Bank Transfer Receipt)

344
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,319
Xiangyuan,

345
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,079
how about letting mom stay?

346
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,319
Mom is alone at home by herself

347
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:26,719
and we all worry about her.

348
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,280
It's OK.

349
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm used to living by myself.

350
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:32,239
Then you should come visit us often,

351
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,479
even if just for Fanlv.

352
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,400
I will visit often for sure.

353
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,680
Dad, Fanlv.

354
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,400
It's cold outside.
You should go back inside.

355
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:43,199
Exactly, Fanlv's dad,
my daughter-in-law.

356
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,319
You don't need to see me off.
You can go back in.

357
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
Mom, have a safe trip.

358
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
Go back.

359
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:56,680
Bye.

360
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Mom, have a safe trip. Bye!

361
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,319
My son, there's one thing that
I always wanted to ask you.

362
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,800
Did you do anything
that you're sorry for anyone?

363
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
No.

364
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,040
Your son is doing well.

365
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,560
You are my son.

366
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,560
Of course I can tell.

367
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:34,839
Last time Mr. Lei came to our home

368
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,400
and told me that he was passing by

369
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,800
and that he didn't know you.

370
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,359
He's your boss.

371
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,400
How come he doesn't know you?

372
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,199
Also,

373
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,959
what was he doing back then?

374
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,400
Tell me.

375
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:51,640
It should be Lei Yuzheng
and his assistant.

376
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,479
I was out of my mind

377
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
and did something bad to Lei Yuzheng.

378
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,199
That Mr. Lei has been so good to you,

379
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,760
and he even gave his position to you.

380
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,479
How could you do bad things to him?

381
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
Mom,

382
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,040
I know that I was wrong.

383
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,439
Then you should make corrections.

384
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,599
Go find Mr. Lei and apologize

385
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,079
to gain his forgiveness.

386
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:21,520
Did you hear me?

387
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,439
My son, it's hard to live a life.

388
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,520
Sometimes, it's inevitable
to run into difficulties.

389
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,400
No matter how hard it is,
you should keep a strong will.

390
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,359
Remember that

391
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,239
there's no difficulty
that you can't overcome.

392
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,479
Even if something more difficult occurs,

393
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,199
mom will be by your side.

394
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,599
Come back home if
you want to cry to someone.

395
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:49,239
Cry to me.

396
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,479
Mom,

397
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,920
don't worry.

398
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,640
I remember every single thing you said.

399
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,920
Please take care of yourself.

400
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:02,079
As soon as I get everything done here,

401
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,400
I will go back and stay with you.

402
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:19,959
Here it is.

403
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Big meal.

404
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,920
It looks pretty good.

405
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,959
Of course it does,

406
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,560
since it is made by me.

407
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:31,560
Here you come again.

408
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:36,599
Have some wine, Boss Du.

409
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,800
Thank you.

410
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:43,479
You have a high tolerance.

411
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,760
Thank you.

412
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,000
Here you go.

413
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,439
Wish you have good
appetite all the time.

414
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,400
Thank you for the
delicious dinner you prepared.

415
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,160
I will have a taste.

416
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:08,719
Are you so happy now

417
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,280
that you already forget the instant noodle?

418
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,160
We can save it for the next time.

419
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:19,119
Boss Du,

420
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,040
your stomach is like your second brain.

421
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,959
You can only create good designs
when you're full.

422
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
For your designs and your future,

423
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,400
I suggest you to stay away from it.

424
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,239
But if you are not here,

425
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,800
I can't make such good dishes.

426
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,160
Du Xiaosu,

427
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,160
as long as you want,

428
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,680
I can handle every

429
00:26:55,719 --> 00:26:57,000
single meal for you in the future.

430
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,920
Oh, wait a moment.

431
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,760
This is the dessert for you.

432
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,239
How is it?

433
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Do you like it?

434
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:27,479
Not bad.

435
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,920
That's good.

436
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:32,199
Since you like it,

437
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,280
can you

438
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:37,839
give me a surprise too?

439
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,479
What surprise do you want?

440
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Boss Du,

441
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,359
today is the last day

442
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,959
of my trial period.

443
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,760
I would like to know

444
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,959
if I can stay by your side

445
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,040
and cook for you every day.

446
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,439
Tomorrow,

447
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,599
you can stop showing up.

448
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:15,280
Why?

449
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,839
Am I not up to the job?

450
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,079
No, it's the opposite.

451
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:21,800
You were doing too good

452
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:25,040
for me to take it.

453
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,040
Is it wrong to do well?

454
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,959
Do you think that

455
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,599
you are still yourself now?

456
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:37,880
Why am I not myself?

457
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,239
I don't want you to

458
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,239
change because of me.

459
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,560
It's impossible to move you,

460
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:46,239
no matter what I do now. Am I right?

461
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:47,439
Lei Yuzheng,

462
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,839
after all these things,

463
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,719
do you still believe in love?

464
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,079
I didn't believe in love.

465
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,400
But someone told me that

466
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,599
it's because you haven't
met the right person and

467
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,839
you don't get it.

468
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,680
I was suspicious about the words

469
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,640
until I met you, Du Xiaosu.

470
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,719
Then I understood the
meaning of those words.

471
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,119
I used to believe that

472
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:22,359
love means no matter
what the other person does,

473
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,160
you would still unconditionally
choose this person,

474
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,400
wait for him, and forgive him.

475
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,640
I don't know what's wrong with me,

476
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,319
but I feel that

477
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,079
I can't do that anymore.

478
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,479
So I'm sorry.

479
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,599
It's OK.

480
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,520
It's getting late.

481
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,640

Fanlv,

492
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,479
don't take too much stuff.

493
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:33,439
I wouldn't need them.

494

Leave this sweater out of it too.

don't be like this.

498
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,640
I would be worried to see you like this.

499
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,319
Then don't go.

500
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,959
Yuzheng has said that

501
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,439
the best way for you to
make up for your mistakes

502
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,719
is to stay at Yutian

503
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,599
and serve Yutian.

504
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,640
The reason Lei Yuzheng could forgive me

505
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,119
is that he has good temper.

506
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,160
Fanlv, think about it.

507
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,239
Lei Yuzheng left Yutian,

508
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,760
because he follows the rules.

509
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,880
If he doesn't correct his mistakes,

510
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,719
he would never come back to Yutian

511
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,199
or take the position of president.

512
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,479
Yutian belongs to Lei's family.

513
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,000
But he gave it up because of me.

514
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,839
What a huge sacrifice he made!

515
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm a man

516
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,199
and I need to take responsibility
of what I've done.

517
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,160
I should sort things out

518
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,599
and take the responsibility
for my crime.

519
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,239
In such way, he can be
proved to be innocent

520
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,160
and come back to Yutian.

521
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,640
I know all that.

522
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,680

you know that I don't want this.

It's hard for me to
make this decision too.

535
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,320
But I shouldn't be so selfish.

559
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,479
It's my responsibility.

560
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,120
Listen to me.

561
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,360
You can't keep this baby.

562
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,239
That's impossible.

563
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,399
I was wrong once.

564
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
I won't make it happen again.

565
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,959
I've already decided.

566
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,080
No matter what happens

567
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,919
and no matter how long
you are staying there,

568
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,719
I will wait for you.

569
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,199
No.

570
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,560
I will wait for you with the baby.

571
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,489
(Jiang Fanlv, pregnant）

572
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,320
I told you to think clearly.

573
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,040
Yuzheng,

574
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:28,280
are you serious?

575
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,719
Of course I'm serious.

576
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,520
I want both his money

577
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,919
and yours,

578
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,159
as well as the money of all our friends.

579
00:37:35,399 --> 00:37:36,520
You all need to offer your help.

580
00:37:36,919 --> 00:37:37,840
Why?

581
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,479
Are you starting another business?

582
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:43,199
I just want to have a charity donation.

583
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:47,639
Charity donation?

584
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,159
After quitting the job,
I've been thinking about one thing.

585
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,479
If I had the chance to become

586
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,439
a totally different person than before,

587
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,479
what shall I do?

588
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,399
Now I got the answer.

589
00:37:59,439 --> 00:38:00,320
This.

590
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,760
Let me tell you the story.

591
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,919
Some time ago, I went to this island.

592
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:09,080
There are many kids
who need help on that island.

593
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,280
They are very optimistic and strong

594
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,320
with strong wills to never give up.

595
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,239
They had a huge influence on me.

596
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,639
Therefore,

597
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:19,199
I've been thinking about
doing something for them.

598
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,399
The thing is,
I didn't know where I shall start.

599
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:22,719
Then here it is.

600
00:38:23,919 --> 00:38:25,239
Regarding this charity donation,

601
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,719
I hope that not only me but also

602
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,840
my friends around me

603
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,040
can all offer help to these kids.

604
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,000
Yuzheng,

605
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,639
you've hidden so many things.

606
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Let me ask you.

607
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,320
Who did you go to the island with?

608
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
And who gave you the idea

609
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,800
of doing the charity donation?

610
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,679
My son,

611
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:08,679
it's hard to live a life.

612
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,280
Sometimes, it's inevitable
to run into difficulties.

613
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,560
No matter how hard it is,
you should keep a strong will.

614
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,479
Remember that

615
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:17,579
(Police)

616
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,639
there's no difficulty
that you can't overcome.

617
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,560
I've already decided.

618
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,879
No matter what happens

619
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,959
and no matter how long
you are staying there,

620
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,560
I will wait for you.

621
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
No.

622
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,879
I will wait for you with the baby.
