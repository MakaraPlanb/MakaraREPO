Xu You?

18
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,579
(Lei Yuzheng, Founder of Leiyu Group)

19
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:20,080
Who on earth is this guy next to her?

20
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,800
Breaking news!

21
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,440
Do you know who I saw

22
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,279
when I went to the washroom?

23
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,360
Who is it?

24
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,320
Xu You,

25
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,800
that big star.

26
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,199
Is she your acquaintance?

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
Well, that's impossible!

28
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,320
And what more surprising is

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,160
she was with a man!

30
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,880
And they looked intimate.

31
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,320
That must be her secret boyfriend.

32
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,240
I took their photos as well.

33
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,800
Check it out.

34
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,160
That's him.

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,839
Well, it's him...

36
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:06,960
Do you know him?

37
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:09,919
He is a celebrity.

38
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,240
He is Junior President Lei of Yutian.

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,399
They're probably not
in a relationship

40
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,679
as I can tell from this photo.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,079
Not in a relationship?

42
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,079
But how come they look so close?

43
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
No wonder Yan Jingjing
is replaced by her.

44
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,839
He's going too far.

45
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,760
Has he ever pissed you off?

46
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,959
No.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,839
I've made a decision just now,

48
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,880
that I will do something big.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,079
Don't mess things up.

50
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,679
I'm not messing things up!

51
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,959
I'm trying to help the weak

52
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,440
and doing justice.

53
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,880
Things in the entertainment industry
are too complex

54
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:48,920
for you to understand.

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,079
Fine, I don't understand.

56
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,160
Here.

57
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,119
No, thanks.

58
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,559
I am allergic to alcohol.
I can't drink.

59
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:03,040
What about lemon water
as an alternative?

60
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:06,920
Sure.

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Are you cold?

62
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,839
A little bit.

63
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,959
What, what are you doing?

64
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,239
Don't get fresh with me

65
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,559
without my permission.

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,119
I was just holding your hand.

67
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,880
Don't you...

68
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,440
I have a crush on you.

69
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,399
You don't have to see me off.

70
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,000
I can walk back on my own.

71
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,720
Your hand is still cold.

72
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,640
Let me warm it up for a little longer.

73
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,880
Why do you give me this pig?

74
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:41,679
Because you are Xiaozhu (piggy) Du.

75
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,839
I am not a piggy!

76
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
I am not!

77
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,239
Well, take it easy.

78
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,119
Even if you really turn into a pig,

79
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll still love you.

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,160
You are the pig!

81
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,519
You are!

82
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,720
Doesn't it look like you?

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I think it does.

84
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,760
Kiss the piggy to show your respect.

85
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,320
You don't have to go in.

86
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,359
Just wait for me here.

87
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
I never thought about

88
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,679
seeing you in a hospital.

89
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:27,239
When I was a kid, you told me
stories of Chinese mythology.

90
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,679
You said there was a man called Kuafu,

91
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,880
who always ran after the sun.

92
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,440
I always had the feeling that

93
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,919
you are like Kuafu,

94
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,799
you always keep going,

95
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
and never lose.

96
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,840
You never feel tired,

97
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
or break down.

98
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
I never thought that

99
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,799
there would be one day
when you fall down.

100
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,320
Dad?

101
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:58,559
You're awake?

102
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,640
Here, have some water.

103
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,119
Are you looking for
your special assistant？

104
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,520
She's too tired,

105
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,919
and I asked her to take a rest.

106
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,280
I'm here.

107
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,760
Just let me know if you need anything.

108
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,919
Go away.

109
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,880
Just like

110
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:23,919
how you left Yutian.

111
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Go away!

112
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,640
Go!

113
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,320
I do want to go,

114
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,400
but you have to extract your blood
from mine first.

115
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Then I'll go right away.

116
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,400
Dad,

117
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,919
don't you know
what kind of situation we are in?

118
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
You're sick,

119
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,679
and Yutian is in deep trouble.

120
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,520
Can you just stop
setting yourself against me?

121
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,640
What happened to Yutian?

122
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:54,239
Nothing,

123
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,239
small issues.

124
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,919
Rest assured, I'm here.

125
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,960
Want to return to Yutian now?

126
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:07,520
Get stumbled over

127
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,080
and rebuffed, right?

128
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:13,200
Now you realize
the value of your family business?

129
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,840
Sorry to let you down,

130
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,159
but I'm good doing my own stuff.

131
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,880
I came back to Yutian unwillingly.

132
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,239
When you recover and return to Yutian,

133
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,880
I'll definitely return the business
to you intact.

134
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,679
Won't you regret?

135
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,359
Uncle Lei,

136
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,640
how are you today?

137
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,119
Better, much better.

138
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,599
Yuzheng has finally come back
to work for Yutian.

139
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,719
Really?

140
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,000
That's great.

141
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:49,200
Now your wish is fulfilled.

142
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:51,679
Bro,

143
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
rest assured.
I'm here to take care of Uncle Lei.

144
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,239
You should both go back now.

145
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:59,719
I know my conditions well.

146
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,479
Don't worry about me.

147
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,919
Go.

148
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,640
Bro,

149
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,119
while you are now back to Yutian
to help Uncle Lei,

150
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,479
but you are doing that unwillingly,
right?

151
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,599
He's old.

152
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,760
I used to stick only to what I want,

153
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:21,640
but it's till now

154
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,000
that I start to realize

155
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,960
I need to do something for my family.

156
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,159
Sometimes it's a matter of
giving and taking.

157
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,159
Well,

158
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,559
see you then.

159
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,520
OK.

160
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:56,559
Du Xiaosu!

161
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,559
Where is the press release?

162
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
Xiaosu, what's wrong with you?

163
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'm in a hurry, I have to go now.

164
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,359
When will you hand in your draft?

165
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,479
What on earth are you doing?

166
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,320
Are you trying to pick up a fight?

167
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,159
Do you think you are so great

168
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,359
just because
you interviewed Yan Jingjing?

169
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,840
Let me tell you,

170
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,919
you get pay from me,

171
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,520
so you have to work for me!

172

(Yan Jingjing. Demon Hunter.

173
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,880
Miss Yan,

174
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,039
I'll try to bring justice back to you.

175
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,159
Really?

176
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:49,520
Xiaosu, thank you so much.

177
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,520
Wait for my good news!

(Special Appearance. Xu You.

179
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,400
Where is Lei Yuzheng?

180
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,919
Do you have an appointment?

181
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,679
It's an emergency. I must see him.

182
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,479
Tell me where he is.

183
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,200
Mr. Lei is attending a luncheon

184
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,520
at Riverside Hotel.

185
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,080
Manager Xiao, sorry for the trouble.

186
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,719
Then I will count on you

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,440
to help us with the business.

188
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:47,799
Sure, my pleasure.

189
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,599
See you.

190
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Lei Yuzheng!

191
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,479
Do you dare or not get off the car
and accept my interview?

192
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:12,080
Mr. Lei...

193
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,919
Who the hell is that?
Drive.

194
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,200
Du Xiaosu, are you crazy?

195
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,280
Who the hell you think you are?

196
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,400
Lei Yuzheng,

197
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,599
I'm Du Xiaosu, entertainment reporter
of Whitegoose.com.

198
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,799
Let me interview you.

199
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,479
Let go of me!

200
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,359
Xiaosu!

201
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:00,679
Interview me?

202
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,039
I have no reason to do
what you ask me to do.

203
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,719
You dare not accept my interview

204
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,320
because you did the wrong thing, right?

205
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,520
Don't gather here.

206
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,239
If you make an apology to me now,

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,919
maybe,

208
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:25,400
I will just let you go
like nothing happened.

209
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,479
You are the one who should apologize.

210
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:29,880
Yan Jingjing is still lying on the bed,

211
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,599
you shouldn't exacerbate
her situation.

212
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,520
Exacerbate her situation?

213
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:36,919
Miss Du,

214
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,239
may I ask who is the person
that drove to chase her?

215
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,440
Who is the person that has been
making all efforts to disguise herself

216
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,200
and try to get the chance for interview?

217
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,479
Even if Yan Jingjing were the victim,

218
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,599
would you dare to say

219
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,359
that there wasn't any contribution

220
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:50,119
from you in the whole matter?

221
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,719
I was wondering

222
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,000
if you really come to see me

223
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,320
for the sake of Yan Jingjing.

224
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,159
Miss Du,

225
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,880
don't be a hypocrite.

226
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,680
I admit

227
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
I did something wrong,

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,520
but...

229
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,479
But what?

230
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,079
Since you also admit you are wrong,

231
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,359
why don't you

232
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:22,959
say sorry to Yan Jingjing,

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,119
so that you can feel better off?

234
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,359
Is it fun

235
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,119
to excuse yourself
and pretend to be innocent

236
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,439
in front of me?

237
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:31,199
Listen,

238
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,119
in this world,

239
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:35,920
those who show weakness
are not necessarily weak.

240
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,479
Those who appear to be unsullied

241
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,319
and accuse others of demoralization

242
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,520
are not necessarily ethical.

243
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,319
Let's go.

244
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,479
Go.

245
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:56,160
Go.

246
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,199
Shao,

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
why work on holiday?

248
00:18:28,199 --> 00:18:29,560
Are you preparing to support a family?

249
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,000
Have a girlfriend now?

250
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:34,760
Good on you.

251
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,640
Keep working on it.

252
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,359
Sure, no problem.

253
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll leave first.

254
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,079
Watch your steps.

255
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,059
(Du Xiaosu)

256
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,800
You are the one who should apologize.

257
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,680
Yan Jingjing is still
lying in the hospital.

258
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,199
You shouldn't exacerbate
her situation.

259
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,479
Exacerbate her situation?

260
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,280
Miss Du,

261
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,800
may I ask who is the person
that drove to chase her?

262
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
Who is the person that has been
making all efforts to disguise herself

263
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:19,760
and try to get the chance for interview?

264
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,920
In this world,

265
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
those who show weakness
are not necessarily weak.

266
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,319
Those who appear to be unsullied

267
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,160
and accuse others of demoralization

268
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,599
are not necessarily ethical.

269
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Miss Du,

270
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,479
don't be a hypocrite.

271
00:19:43,852 --> 00:19:44,344
(Zou Siqi)

272
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,719
Xiaosu.

273
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,319
You're famous now, do you know?

274
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:52,319
Mr. Mo has just

275
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,800
posted your picture
of Xu You and Lei Yuzheng

276
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,479
on the web.

277
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,319
Do you know what happens then?

278
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,199
It's got so many views!

279
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,400
I think

280
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,280
the website will crash
because of this!

281
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,219
(Mr. Lei Junior secret meeting
with Xu You)

282
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,280
Do you know who wrote this?

283
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,400
No.

284
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,079
I'll contact the media
that posted this photo immediately,

285
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,520
and ask them to make a public apology.

286
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
I know who wrote this.

287
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,000
Contact lawyer,

288
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,079
and sue Du Xiaosu.

289
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,439
Who?

290
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:29,760
The reporter

291
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,439
who stopped my car today,

292
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,920
Du Xiaosu.

293
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:35,800
Why are you still standing here?

294
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
But Mr. Lei,

295
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,680
maybe it's not wise to sue her.

296
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:42,719
It will make the thing
unnecessarily more viral.

297
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,920
It's not your turn

298
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,680
to flurry.

299
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
Tell the reporter that

300
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:53,880
I refuse to settle out of court.

301
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,839
I'll see her in court.

302
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,239
Du Xiaosu!

303
00:21:15,479 --> 00:21:17,199
Haven't I told you
not to piss Mr. Lei off?

304
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,040
What? He asked you to come for me?

305
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,680
Seeking revenge?

306
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,719
Yes.

307
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,199
He has asked Yutian's lawyer
to prepare lawyer's letter.

308
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,319
He will sue you for defamation.

309
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,239
What?!

310
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,280
Sue her? For what?

311
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
Defamation?

312
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,239
Is he crazy?!

313
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:34,319
Isn't the guy in the photo Lei Yuzheng?

314
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,359
Or someone else?

315
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,599
He was having lunch with Xu You,

316
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,520
and they were acting intimately.

317
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,479
It was him!

318
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,839
Qunfei, go and tell Lei Yuzheng

319
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,760
that he is not the ruler

320
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,040
of the world.

321
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,319
Maybe others are frightened of him,
but I am not.

322
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,800
He did the wrong thing first,

323
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,319
and he wronged Yan Jingjing first.

324
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,599
He was the one who took away her role.

325
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
That's why I'm asking for justice.

326
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,760
Am I wrong?

327
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Did I say anything wrong?

328
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
No, wait.

329
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,000
You are doing all these things
for Yan Jingjing?

330
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,839
No wonder Mr. Lei was angry.

331
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,040
Well, Xiaosu,

332
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:06,160
even if you want to
fight against injustice,

333
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,040
shouldn't you first be clear

334
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,520
about who is the good guy
and who is the bad guy?

335
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,280
Yan Jingjing gangs up with
the senior management of our company,

336
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,680
trying to make a fortune
by manipulating the contract.

337
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,160
That's why Mr. Lei took away her role.

338
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,400
Don't you think what you are doing
is unjustified?

339
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,719
Jingjing,

340
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:28,680
our risky move

341
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,959
has failed again.

342
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,599
I know Lei Yuzheng
much better than you do.

343
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,319
He was the person
who gave me the hard time.

344
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,959
I won't let him go easy.

345
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:40,719
Du Xiaosu released the news

346
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,760
and pisses him off, and

347
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,800
then my ruse of self-injury has worked.

348
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,280
So, you are indeed lying to me!

349
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,959
Why?

350
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:57,560
Why?

351
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,359
There is nothing to ask.

352
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,719
When you chased after my car,

353
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,000
have you asked why?

354
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,239
Let's go.

355
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,839
I wouldn't believe them
when they told me you are here.

356
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,079
Come over here, baby.

357
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:28,640
What's wrong? Let me see.

358
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,319
What happened?

359
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:33,760
What's wrong?

360
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,800
You look bad.

361
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,520
Are you feeling well?

362
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,599
Zhenrong, I was wrong.

363
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,599
I was wrong, indeed.

364
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,920
That's all right.

365
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,239
Come here.

366
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,520
No worries.

367
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,800
Why did they fool me?

368
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Zhenrong,

369
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,239
I want to resign.

370
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Have you thought about
what to do after that?

371
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,199
When I was in college,

372
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
my major was architectural design.

373
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,400
I became an entertainment reporter
by accident,

374
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,680
because I couldn't find a job
after graduation.

375
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,359
Tell me,

376
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:41,280
do you think I've got the chance
to start over again?

377
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,319
To be a real designer?

378
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
Of course.

379
00:24:51,719 --> 00:24:53,000
You are such a good girl.

380
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,800
You've got the chance.

381
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Really?

382
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
I heard Boyuan is a good company.

383
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,280
Do you want to have a shot?

384
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,199
Boyuan?

385
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,359
But Boyuan is a big design company.

386
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,280
They won't be interested
in an unimportant figure like me.

387
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,880
Send your resume to me,

388
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,640
just in case I can help.

389
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,959
Do you know people from Boyuan?

390
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,000
No,

391
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:26,359
but chances are higher

392
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:27,359
if there is one more person
to submit your resume.

393
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,319
We need to take every possibility

394
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:31,640
to get recruited by Boyuan or the like.

395
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,040
What if I can't find a job?

396
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,000
Then I'll support you.

397
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,280
Really? You support me?

398
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,359
Yes, you have my words.

399
00:25:58,059 --> 00:25:59,540
(Resignation)

400
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,800
Mr. Mo.

401
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,079
Xiaosu,

402
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,520
you did very well this time.

403
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,640
Good on you.

404
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,280
So hurry to get your bonus, huh?

405
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,680
Letter of resignation?

406
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,800
For low pay?

407
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,040
For not giving you leaves?

408
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,079
Then what's wrong with you?

409
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,439
I want to become
an architecture designer.

410
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,400
That's not suitable for you.

411
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:39,839
See? You cannot just carelessly...

412
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,800
Mr. Mo.

413
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,599
Thank you for taking care of me.

414
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:44,119
Thank you.

415
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,439
No, but...

416
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,880
No more news-seeking!

417
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Tell me,

418
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
do you think I've got the chance
to start over again?

419
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,400
To be a real designer?

420
00:27:22,119 --> 00:27:22,839
Mr. Lei.

421
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
It seems Mr. Lei's got a visitor.

422
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:24,719
Mr. Lei,

423
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,199
this girl has been waiting for you.

424
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,839
OK, Mr. Lei, we'll see you around.

425
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,800
See you, Mr. Lei.

426
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Mr. Lei, I'll go in first.

427
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,959
Mr. Lei,

428
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,400
I want to talk to you.

429
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,359
Didn't I say that
I do not want to see you?

430
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,199
Why are you still here?

431
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,239
I'm sorry for what I did last time.

432
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:47,439
It was me who misunderstood you

433
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,959
without knowing the truth.

434
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,439
Sorry.

435
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,839
Miss Du, last time
when you stopped my car

436
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,119
and spoke for Yan Jingjing,

437
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,880
I thought you were

438
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,439
a person who adheres to principles.

439
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,199
Now realizing you are going to be sued,

440
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,479
you immediately change your stance.

441
00:28:01,439 --> 00:28:02,760
You seem quite adaptable
to circumstances.

442
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:05,560
Do you think I am apologizing

443
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,359
because I'm worrying about
the lawsuit?

444
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,719
Isn't that the case?

445
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:11,400
You've been waiting here

446
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,000
for hours at night.

447
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,199
Don't tell me

448
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:16,000
that there is no underlying reason.

449
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:18,560
That will be funny.

450
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,239
Mr. Lei,

451
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
I come to aologize,

452
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,439
because I know I did the wrong thing.

453
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,719
I just knew you replaced Yan Jingjing

454
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,839
for your own reason.

455
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,199
I was too naive and
taken advantage by her.

456
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,319
Do you think I will accept your apology?

457
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,119
Miss Du,

458
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,800
you seem to be over-confident.

459
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,959
According to your logic,

460
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,079
a murderer

461
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,839
can be released
just because he says sorry.

462
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,040
Don't go too far!

463
00:28:50,239 --> 00:28:51,760
What on earth do you want?

464
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
The rich are so unreasonable!

465
00:28:59,079 --> 00:28:59,920
I'll wait for you outside.

466
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,040
Bro.

467
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,000
Bro.

468
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,920
See?

469
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,040
This is the resume of my friend.

470
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,560
She majored in architecture,

471
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,239
and she is looking for a job.

472
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,520
I know Yutian's subsidiary, Boyuan,

473
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,599
is hiring people.

474
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,520
Can you give her a chance to try?

475
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,739
(Du Xiaosu, Job intention: Architect.
Haidong University of Architecture)

476
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,680
This person must be special to you;

477
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,079
otherwise you won't
ask for a favor for her.

478
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,359
It's that girl, right?

479
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:37,760
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

480
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:40,280
It's just we haven't been together
for very long.

481
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,479
Not long?

482
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,319
But you are already
trying to find her a job?

483
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,839
Seems you are really into her.

484
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,319
Don't talk about Xiaosu like that.

485
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,599
She is a nice girl,

486
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,719
and she's simple.

487
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,839
Simple?

488
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,760
Maybe that's only what she looks like.

489
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,359
Her targets are
silly boys like you.

490
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,040
Maybe there will be one day

491
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,079
when you're cheated by her.

492
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:09,959
Bro,

493
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,119
you have a bias towards women.

494
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,079
You shouldn't think

495
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,719
all women are alike,

496
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,520
just because you're surrounded by
extravagant women.

497
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,680
Would you help me or not?

498
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,119
Leave me the resume.

499
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,760
I'll notify Boyuan.

500
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,680
Thanks, bro.

501
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,079
I'm leaving for the night shift.

502
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:43,019
(Resume, Du Xiaosu.
Job intention: Architect.)

503
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:43,880
Mr. Ning?

504
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,839
Are you also coming
to see Mr. Lei?

505
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:47,640
He asked to see me.

506
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,079
Otherwise, I wouldn't have the chance

507
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,199
to visit his office.

508
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,099
(curriculum vitae. Du Xiaosu)

509
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:57,760
What's up, Mr. Lin?

510
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,239
Do you have to inform Mr. Lei

511
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,760
on recruitment issues?

512
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,959
This one is not hired by me.

513
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,760
She is assigned here by the higher-up.

514
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,359
You know for things like this,

515
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,800
all we need to do
is to just follow the order.

516
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,560
It's none of our business.

517
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,499

518
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,800
Assigned by the higher-up...

519
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,239
Hello,

520
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,040
is it Mr. Wang?

521
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,680
Hello,

522
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,079
I'm your student, Lin Xiangyuan.

523
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,000
Do you still remember me?

524
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,560
Hello, Mr. Wang, how are you?

525
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,680
Well,

526
00:31:37,719 --> 00:31:39,000
there's something I need help from you.

527
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,599
Do you remember my classmate, Du Xiaosu?

528
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,479
Stop, stop, stop!

529
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:52,959
Wait!

530
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Smile!

531
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:57,079
Done!

532
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,640
Let me see what you got.

533
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,400
See?

534
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,560
I look fat and ugly!
Delete it!

535
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,119
No way!

536
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,239
I will print these photos out

537
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,520
and stick them onto the wall.

538
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,719
Just imagine!

539
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,040
How meaningful and loving that would be!

540
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:16,839
Shao's private kitchen,

541
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,959
giving you the experience
of Michelin-starred restaurant.

542
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,640
It's tasty!

543
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,920
Shao Zhenrong!

544
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,800
I need to take the initiative
to get the first mover advantage,

545
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,439
or I'll be so regretful

546
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,640
if you're with someone else.

547
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,640
How about this?

548
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:46,959
May I marry you?

549
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,719
Great.

550
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,160
You agreed, right?

551
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,479
You said you are going to marry me.

552
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,040
From now on,
Shao Zhenrong belongs to Du Xiaosu.

553
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,760
All right.

554
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,359
Shao Zhenrong, what can I do now?

555
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:20,000
You are the one who treats me best
in this world,

556
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,560
almost better than my parents.

557
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:26,079
I'm worried that people will be
jealous of me.

558
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,400
Then don't leave me, all right?

559
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,280
Wait.

560
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:35,560
Hello?

561
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,599
Really?

562
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,680
Really?!

563
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,560
All right, all right, thank you.

564
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:42,560
See you tomorrow!

565
00:33:43,239 --> 00:33:44,119
What's up?

566
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,839
I'm hired by Boyuan!

567
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:48,959
Really?

568
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,280
I'm hired!

569
00:33:54,719 --> 00:33:55,640
Awesome!

570
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,680
Here, as a reward!

571
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,000
And a hug.

572
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:08,040
If it were not for this headline,

573
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
I wouldn't be clear about

574
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,840
what I really wanted to do,

575
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:12,879
and the kind of life that
I really wanted to live.

576
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,800
I want to become
an architecture designer.

577
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,080
Du Xiaosu, fight!

578
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:36,719
Come here.

579
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,719
Open the door for me.

580
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,560
Hello, have you registered
your information as a visitor?

581
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,679
You're new here, right?

582
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:45,639
Well...

583
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,520
No wonder.

584
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,280
I'm here to see Mr. Lei.

585
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,679
My surname is Jiang.

586
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,360
Sorry, Miss Jiang,

587
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,679
it is our company rule

588
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
that all visitors
must register their information.

589
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:55,800
Register?

590
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,159
Call the Office
of the Secretary to the Board,

591
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,840
and ask whether I, Jiang Fanlv,

592
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:02,919
need to register my information
at Yutian.

593
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,840
But it's our company rule

594
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,239
that visitors must
register their information first

595
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,679
before they can see Mr. Lei,
no matter who they are.

596
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,399
I've seen your works.

597
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:12,679
They are nice,

598
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,600
close to Boyuan's design concept.

599
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,199
Thank you.

600
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,399
I understand the reason
you changed your job,

601
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,239
but that doesn't mean

602
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,679
you can really

603
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,239
perform well in architectural design.

604
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,120
No one can assure you that.

605
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,679
At present,

606
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,159
we can only offer you an internship.

607
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,719
Whether you can become
a formal employee

608
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:40,159
depends on your efforts.

609
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,239
I see.

610
00:35:43,399 --> 00:35:45,959
It's good enough for me.

611
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:47,679
I will do my best.

612
00:35:48,959 --> 00:35:49,840
All right.

613
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,600
Come and start work next Monday.

614
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

615
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,239
But,

616
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,360
there is one question that
I want to ask you.

617
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,000
Go ahead.

618
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,800
You enrolled me just upon my resume

619
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,600
and didn't interview me.

620
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,959
Why?

621
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:15,479
I believe

622
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,959
there must be candidates
better than me.

623
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Miss Du,

624
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
our talk just now

625
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,679
also counts as interview.

626
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,040
Boyuan

627
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:28,199
is a company that is
open and inclusive.

628
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,040
We won't reject people who are aspiring

629
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,120
on grounds of experience or education.

630
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,399
Therefore,

631
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,399
please do you best.

632
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,719
Yes,

633
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
I will.

634
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,320
Thank you.

635
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,280
See you.

636
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,959
Miss Jiang, I'm so sorry.

637
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,760
This is Mr. Jiang's daughter,

638
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,919
a friend of Yuzheng.

639
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,800
It's all misunderstanding.

640
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,479
Open the door.

641
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:11,760
Yes!

642
00:37:23,919 --> 00:37:25,800
Lin Xiangyuan,
I don't want to blame you,

643
00:37:25,879 --> 00:37:28,159
but your reaction is too slow

644
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,919
to see me standing there arguing with
the reception girl.

645
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,800
Lin Xiangyuan, what are you waiting for?

646
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,280
Come in!

647
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,879
I'll shut the door if you stay there.

648
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:19,719
Mr. Lei,

649
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,040
you son visits you every day.

650
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,080
He really cares about you.

651
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,600
You must be happy and satisfied, right?

652
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,320
Yes, I am.

653
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,320
Now when I think about it,

654
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:33,879
I do feel I have to accept the state
of being old.

655
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,040
Speak of the devil and he appears.

656
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,479
Help yourselves.

657
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,280
See you later.

658
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,199
Thank you.

659
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,199
Why do you come again?

660
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,080
I've told you I'm good.

661
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
You don't have to come to see me
every single day.

662
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,320
Well, OK then.

663
00:38:55,879 --> 00:38:57,719
There are so many things to be solved
at Yutian.

664
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,760
If you are well now,
go back to your company.

665
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,520
And I can hand over my work.

666
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,000
Son,

667
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,080
you're looking to contradict me?

668
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,479
Listen,

669
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,439
as long as I am in the hospital,

670
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,879
you need to stay and work for Yutian.

671
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,320
Your uncle Jiang is waiting for you
at the golf court.

672
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,479
Dad,

673
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,600
he doesn't want to play golf with me,

674
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
but to talk about your business.

675
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I've heard that the project

676
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,120
was given to us by no reason

677
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,520
from Uncle Jiang.

678
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,199
It's weird.

679
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:37,959
Are you implying

680
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,439
that I'm too old

681
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,280
to tell good and bad things apart?

682
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,360
Dad,

683
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,320
that's not what I meant.

684
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,679
Then that's it.

685
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,199
I've signed the contract
with your Uncle Jiang.

686
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,120
You just need to implement it.

687
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,719
Nice shot, Mr. Jiang!

688
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,560
I have a strong feeling

689
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,919
that our project

690
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,360
will be undertaken by Yutian.

691
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,040
The Senior Lei has agreed,

692
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,080
and the Junior Lei
can do nothing about it.

693
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:14,000
He is smart and competent,

694
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,360
but he will not dare to

695
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,479
disobey his father.

696
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Generally speaking,

697
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,760
Lei Ting shouldn't have agreed on it.

698
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,520
Why he did so this time?

699
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,159
Lei Ting

700
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
is old.

701
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,360
Lei Yuzheng is coming,

702
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,639
Yuzheng, you are late.

703
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:51,919
Uncle Jiang.

704
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:55,600
Let me introduce.

705
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,120
This is Lin Xiangyuan,

706
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,439
my assistant.

707
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,600
He is a hard-working young man.

708
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,199
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lei.
