16
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,960
Brother.

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,639
Why do you get up so early every day?

18
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,679
Have you ever seen the Bund at 4 am
when the sun starts to rise?

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,479
No, never.

20
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I have.

21
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,119
Every single day.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
I work hard not for money,

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,000
but to prove who I am.

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,528
(Aunt Mo)

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,160
Mr. Mo.

26
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Mr. Mo.

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,279
Good morning.

28
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:49,919
Let Du Xiaosu answer the phone.

29
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,080
Well, Xiaosu...

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,360
She is around. What's up?

31
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll get her. Hold on.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Still sleeping?

33
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,800
Wake up!

34
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,160
Du Xiaosu!

35
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,520
Wake up now!

36
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,639
Du Xiaosu!

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,559
Mr. Mo is on the phone.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,919
Stop sleeping. Hurry up!

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Mr. Mo is waiting!

40
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,839
Mr. Mo.

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Well, good for you, Du Xiaosu.

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,839
Could you please check up the time?

43
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,960
What time is it?

44
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,960
Could you please also think about

45
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,119
if there is still any
unfinished task today?

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,399
Interview...

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,520
Of Yan Jingjing!

48
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,559
Well, it seems you still remember it.

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Zou Siqi has been bragging about you,

50
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:40,320
but you've been on standby
in our company for one year,

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
and produced not even one piece of news!

52
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,800
Let me tell you, Du Xiaosu.

53
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,000
Yan Jingjing's flight
will arrive in 20 minutes.

54
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:50,639
If you fail to reach the airport

55
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,679
before 9:45,

56
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:52,520
then you should just never come back.

57
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,720
I will prepare your resignation letter.

58
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,360
What do you think about that?

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,240
All right, Mr. Mo.

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,279
I'm leaving for the airport right now.

61
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,320
Just wait for the good news!

62
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,679
Hurry up! Get dressed!

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,839
Drive me to the airport!

64
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:08,279
Let's stop here.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't you remember how I
used to teach you?

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,240
Attack like fire,

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,720
and be steady as mountains.

68
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:15,839
Your attack was too hasty,

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and the defence was careless.

70
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,640
No wonder you lose.

71
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,760
Aunt Shao has been forcing you
to attend blind dates again, right?

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,279
I went to see the girl.

73
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,720
She was so straightforward,

74
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:25,679
and the first thing she said to me was:

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,959
When shall we apply for
the marriage certificate?

76
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,880
When do we get married?

77
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,399
I was frightened to death.

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,480
Are girls all like this?

79
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,359
Well, that's because
you're an attractive man.

80
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,559
What a pity!

81
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,239
Your standard is too high.

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,079
I wonder with whom you will fall in love.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,600
Brother, stop teasing me.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,559
I always put quality before quantity.

85
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,640
But you?

86
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:47,440
Quantity before quality.

87
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,640
Here, take this.

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,839
Well, another T-shirt from you?

89
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,559
I haven't got the chance
to put on the last one you gave me.

90
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,799
I have to wear uniform every day.

91
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
I don't have the chance to put them on.

92
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,839
Well, you are looking for
a romantic relationship, right?

93
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,600
You'd better have a few fine outfits.

94
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,359
Can't you just tell Mr. Mo

95
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,480
that you have already arrived?

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,720
Why insist on telling the truth?

97
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,399
It's such bad luck

98
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,640
to be your roommate.

99
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,119
I have to get up early on the weekend

100
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,279
and be your driver.

101
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,720
Stop complaining.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
If I lose this job,

103
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,600
you will be my breadwinner.

104
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,440
So pick one from

105
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,239
being my breadwinner

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
or my driver.

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,959
Look at you.

108
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Nothing close to a lady at all.

109
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:32,959
Be your breadwinner?

110
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,000
Definitely no.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
I will never marry someone.

112
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:37,239
I'll serve you wholeheartedly
for my entire life.

113
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,440
No. Thanks.

114
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,320
I will marry someone,
and I will find a boyfriend.

115
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:43,679
Stop checking your make-up.

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,279
It's not the time for yogurt!

117
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:46,160
Hurry up!

118
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,119
That's my breakfast!

119
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:47,799
I know!

120
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,959
Drive now. Please.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,839
All right.

122
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,440
Let's get some music.

123
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,959
Go!

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
9:33.

125
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,359
We will arrive in time.

126
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:02,079
Brother.

127
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,440
Where are you going later?

128
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,239
Beijing.
(Lei Yuzheng. End call)

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,200
Cool. Safe trip.

130
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,279
See you.

131
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
All my best to Aunt Shao.

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
Have you arrived?

133
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,079
Yes, just now.

134
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,279
Ok.

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,679
The car is ready.

136
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,160
You can take a rest at the hotel first.

137
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,640
We can rest assured

138
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,959
once the press conference is held.

139
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,720
Ok, got it.

140
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,000
Well,

141
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,519
I heard Lei Yuzheng
is also at the airport.

142
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:37,959
Really?

143
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,320
Lei Yuzheng is going to Beijing.

144
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,640
He will be arriving soon.

145
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Do we need to meet him?

146
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,079
Lei Yuzheng has declined to see me

147
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,600
with all kinds of excuses,

148
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,000
now I finally have the chance
to catch him up.

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,279
Is that Lei Yuzheng's assistant?

150
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,559
Take this

151
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,799
to Asisstant He.

152
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,720
Say nothing else.

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
If you let anyone else

154
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,440
know it,

155
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,160
you should know

156
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
what the consequence could be.

157
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:20,600
Yes, Mr. Lei,

158
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,559
I got it.

159
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,679
Don't hurry! Take it slow!

160
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,720
Bye!

161
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,000
Excuse me!

162
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,959
Please, let me pass through!

163
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,079
Excuse me!

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,200
Here!

165
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Come over here!

166
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Good on you, Mr. Bi!

167
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,839
Always taking up the best spot, huh?

168
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:57,000
May I stand by you?

169
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,079
Sure.

170
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,320
But I have to say,

171
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,720
a reporter like you

172
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
who is always unhurried

173
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,000
will ultimately cry hard

174
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,160
for missing the headlines.

175
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I overslept.

176
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:06,880
You'd be dead,

177
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,839
if Mr. Mo knew it.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,359
That's correct.

179
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,079
I was scolded to consciousness by him.

180
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,959
Your phone rings.

181
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,279
Get ready. See that?

182
00:08:17,359 --> 00:08:18,760
When they come, shoot in that direction.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Right, over there.

184
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,519
Du Xiaosu,

185
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,959
are you with Mr. Bi now?

186
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:29,239
Yes.

187
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,239
Ok. Now, do not let him see you.

188
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,119
Hide yourself now.

189
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,719
Very soon. They ae coming.

190
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,080
Take your pictures.

191
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:37,479
Be ready, they are coming.

192
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,359
Mr. Mo, what's the issue?

193
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
According to the latest
insider information,

194
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,520
Yan Jingjing

195
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,440
is leaving the airport
through staff entrance.

196
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,320
You don't need me to teach you
what to do next, right?

197
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:59,640
Never say that I give you
no special treatment,

198
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:00,520
ok?

199
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:01,239
Anyway,

200
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,599
I've written the resignation letter
for you.

201
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,159
Please, don't do that.

202
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,760
I know you've been taking care of me,
Mr. Mo.

203
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,640
I also know that

204
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,200
your words are harsh
but your heart is soft.

205
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Please rest assured.

206
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,640
I'll definitely get to interview her.

207
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,320
Fine, fine.

208
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,679
You must do it well.

209
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,760
Little girl.

210
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,119
Excuse me, excuse me.

211
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,039
Sorry.

212
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
I didn't do it on purpose.

213
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
Are you ok?

214
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Are you ok?

215
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,559
Yes, I'm fine.

216
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:09,520
Thank you.

217
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,320
Yan Jing...

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,799
Zou Siqi!

219
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,440
Well done, Siqi!

220
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,559
You're right in time!

221
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,359
What happened? Why so hurry?

222
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:56,840
Quick!

223
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,400
Yan Jingjing is in the car ahead!

224
00:10:58,479 --> 00:10:59,280
Come one!

225
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,039
Mr. Bi?

226
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:04,640
Why do you come here?

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,919
Xiaosu, that's your fault.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,840
You keep the information to yourself.

229
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,640
You should at least disclose
a bit of it to me.

230
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,320
How did you know?

231
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,799
No, Mr. Bi,

232
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,799
get out of the car.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,039
We are rivals,

234
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:16,359
I can't take you with us.

235
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,599
If you don't go now,
you'll never catch up.

236
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:18,760
She's gone.

237
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:32,799
Miss Yan,

238
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,400
there seems to be a car following us.

239
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,400
Drive faster and get rid of them.

240
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,320
These reporters are well-informed.

241
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,799
What are they doing?

242
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,239
They're driving so fast!
Are they crazy?

243
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,159
It, it's too dangerous!

244
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,640
Mr. Lei.

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,520
I just received a call.

246
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,880
The chairman is in danger.

247
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,960
I want to be Lei Yuzheng,

248
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,479
not Lei Ting's son.

249
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,919
I've made up my mind.

250
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
I don't want to work for Yutian.

251
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I want to start up my own business.

252
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,119
Well,

253
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,359
good.

254
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,039
You can go now.

255
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,359
It's not like Yutian will not run
without you.

256
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,479
Uncle Lei almost died,

257
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,200
but he was saved.

258
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,440
When will he restore consciousness?

259
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,159
This kind of disease happens quickly
but is difficult to treat.

260
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,719
He's too old.

261
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,799
It's hard to say

262
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,119
when he will recover.

263
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:21,400
But rest assured.

264
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,880
I'm here to help you.

265
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:25,080
Mr. Lei.

266
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,960
Mr. Lei.

267
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,880
Yan Jingjing had a car accident
on the way to the airport.

268
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,280
What?

269
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,239
Dr. Shao,
the director is calling you.

270
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,440
Excuse me, excuse me.

271
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,960
Let me pass through.

272
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,559
Everyone please move back.

273
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:54,960
Excuse me.

274
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Stop shooting!

275
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,640
Excuse me.

276
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:00,799
Excuse me.

277
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,719
Stop shooting!

278
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,840
Let me pass through.

279
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,599
Stop shooting, ok?

280
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,599
Excuse me.

281
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,799
Mr. Lei,

282
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,679
there are so many incidents
happening in one day.

283
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,479
I guess the Board is in a mess now.

284
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Drive to Yutian.

285
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,640
To Yutian?

286
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,119
Inform the Group's Finance Deparatment

287
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,280
to prepare the financial statements
for the past year for me.

288
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,359
Also,

289
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,479
bring me the review report
for Demon Hunter.

290
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,679
All right, I'll inform
the Finance Department immediately.

291
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:28,479
Also, Mr. Lei,

292
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:29,760
I heard that

293
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,880
this time the pay for Yan Jingjing
was quite high.

294
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,719
She got the female leading role

295
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,799
beacuse Xie Li supported her.

296
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,159
Do you think something's going on
between them...

297
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,080
Patient blood pressure: 70/30 mmHg.

298
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:50,919
Heart rate: 130 bpm.

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,479
The patient is under hemorrhagic shock.

300
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,559
We need to perform surgery right now.

301
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,799
Give me another one.

302
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:08,880
Report the vital signs of the patient.

303
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,080
The vitals are stable.

304
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,280
Sew up the wound.

305
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,119
Ok.

306
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,520
Where is the other patient?

307
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:15,719
In the Emergency Room.

308
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:30,880
Du Xiaosu,

309
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,359
you're such a rare-seen freak!

310
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,119
Let me ask you,

311
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,320
why you failed to interview her?

312
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:37,520
Why?

313
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,840
What's the matter?
How did you run into the car accident?

314
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,840
I don't know why...

315
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,719
My dear Xiaosu,

316
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,000
what's wrong with you?

317
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,400
I've been repeatedly telling you

318
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:09,479
that it's a great opportunity.

319
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,799
And now you make yourself the background
of someone else's news.

320
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,640
I don't know how this happened...

321
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,640
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

322
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,479
Listen, Du Xiaosu,

323
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,320
stay in the hospital

324
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,599
and get well,

325
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,119
but if you fail to interview
Yan Jingjing again,

326
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,599
then you don't need to come back.

327
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:18,199
Where's the patient?

328
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,040
She was here just now.

329
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,319
Where did she go?

330
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,239
Famous actress Yan Jingjing

331
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,400
had a car accident.

332
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Will the Demon Hunter, invested
by Yutian Group

333
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,599
and starred by Yan Jingjing

334
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,640
be on action as planned?
The answer is still unclear.

335
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:40,880
Mr. Xie,

336
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,040
please tell us the truth.

337
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Can this movie

338
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,520
be continued?

339
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:52,640
Yan Jingjing had a car accident,

340
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,160
we have to wait till she recovers.

341
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,800
Wait for her?

342
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,800
We've spent a good fortune.

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
No one wants it to happen,

344
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,160
including Lei Ting.

345
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,839
But he was still in the hospital.

346
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,719
We need someone to
make the decision, right?

347
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,319
Mr. Lei,

348
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:29,920
may I inform everyone first?

349
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,880
No.

350
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,439
In my opinion,

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,319
let's vote to decide

352
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,239
whether to give up this movie.

353
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,479
There is no one taking charge.

354
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,439
I don't think we should
make the decision on our own.

355
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,920
That's right...

356
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,000
Yuzheng?

357
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,199
You are...

358
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,920
From now on,

359
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,920
I will take charge of

360
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,239
Yutian's business.

361
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,640
I've heard

362
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,400
your quarrel,

363
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,760
you are simply worrying about the
cancellation of the Demon Hunter.

364
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,479
As long as I'm here,

365
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,520
the production of this movie

366
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,000
will be continued.

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,000
I never make bad bargains,

368
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,239
neither will Yutian bear the costs.

369
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
The actress must be changed.

370
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,839
That's impossible.

371
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,760
Yan Jingjing

372
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,000
has signed the contract with us.

373
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:34,760
Listen, everyone.

374
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,760
If we replace her with someone else,

375
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,199
she will definitely sue us.

376
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,239
If we don't change the actress,

377
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:46,359
then you will be the one to be sued.

378
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:51,040
Mr. Xie,

379
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,160
read this.

380
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,199
Now you understand?

381
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,439
Yes.

382
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,920
You don't need me to teach you

383
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,079
what to do next, right?

384
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:32,839
Mr. Lei,

385
00:20:33,439 --> 00:20:34,319
sorry.

386
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,680
I want...

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,959
I want to resign.

388
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,560
Fine.

389
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,040
I accept your resignation.

390
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,640
Yuzheng,

391
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,239
what's going on here?

392
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,839
Xie Li was just losing his mind
for the moment.

393
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,599
He made a small mistake,

394
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,959
but that's no big deal.

395
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm not the kind of person

396
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,439
who cannot tolerate mistakes.

397
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,680
But this time he

398
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,199
crossed the line too much,

399
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:10,040
and that's why Yutian won't keep him.

400
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,479
But please don't worry,

401
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,000
I ensure you all that

402
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,920
I will find a better actress
for the Demon Hunter.

403
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,599
Dad,

404
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:30,680
you once said that

405
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,439
Yutian belongs to you and me,

406
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
and we need to protect it,

407
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,520
to let it be the tallest building.

408
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:40,719
The ground we stand on is our enterprise,

409
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,680
our destiny, and our Yutian.

410
00:22:01,504 --> 00:22:02,856
(Midnight Canteen)

411
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,680
Your noodles,

412
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,319
help yourself.

413
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,680
Hi, can I have noodles
with shredded eel?

414
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:25,560
Sure.

415
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,479
One bowl of noodles with shredded eel.

416
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
Here, have some hot water first.

417
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,280
Well,

418
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:47,760
that guy...

419
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,680
Your customer over there,

420
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,040
what kind of noodles is he eating?

421
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,400
It looks so delicious.

422
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:53,280
And it smells great.

423
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,400
It's noodles
with free-range chicken meat.

424
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:56,800
Free-range chicken raised by me.

425
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,199
The soup can warm up your body.

426
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,640
I'll have the same noodles, too.

427
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,959
But you just ordered noodles
with shredded eel,

428
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,839
do you still need it?

429
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,719
Yes, both.

430
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,000
Two bowls? For a young girl like you?

431
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:08,920
Wouldn't that be too much?

432
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm so hungry,

433
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
I haven't eaten anything
for a whole day.

434
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:13,880
I can even eat up a cow right now.

435
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,479
Fine,

436
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,839
I'll get the noodles for you.

437
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Another bowl of noodles
with free-range chicken meat.

438
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,160
Here you are.

439
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,319
Two bowls of noodles.

440
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,359
Help yourself.

441
00:23:35,736 --> 00:23:36,936
Thank you.

442
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:00,936
(Mr. Mo)

443
00:24:07,736 --> 00:24:08,000
Hello.

444
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
Hello. How's the thing going?

445
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,439
She is still in the ward.

446
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,479
What about her agent?

447
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,479
What did Zhao Shi say?

448
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,599
It was all messed up,

449
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,319
so I know nothing about it.

450
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,040
You are on the site.
Can't you just seek some information?

451
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,719
But she's hospitalized.

452
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,040
I should at least
show some care for her.

453
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,599
Du Xiaosu,

454
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,640
listen,

455
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,640
news is all about timeliness.

456
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,079
See what you can do.

457
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,920
Where is my phone?

458
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,520
Excuse me...

459
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,319
Here is your phone.

460
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,680
The car speed is fast,

461
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,400
be careful.

462
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,800
Thank you.

463
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,000
Excuse me. Hello?

464
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,839
See you then.

465
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:17,479
Wake up!

466
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:18,680
Quick!

467
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,079
The inspector is coming.

468
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:26,560
I've been looking for you.

469
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,439
I have an important thing to tell you.

470
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,599
It doesn't seem like a good thing.

471
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,680
How could you say that?

472
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,439
I owe you, right?

473
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,719
So I'm returning your favor
with a big gift.

474
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,520
That's the baseline
for working in this industry, right?

475
00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:41,040
Well, your moral quality
isn't that good anyway.

476
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:43,079
It will be nice of you
if you don't set me up.

477
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,479
Well, that's not true.

478
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,640
This is not setting you up.

479
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,119
Believe it or not.

480
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,479
I'm telling you right now,

481
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,560
Yan Jingjing is no longer in ICU.

482
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:54,119
Then where is she?

483
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,640
You want to know?

484
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:02,680
In-patient department, on the 3rd floor.

485
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,479
How did you know that?

486
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,400
Experienced reporters like me

487
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,439
can get information from friends.

488
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:09,920
Then why don't you go by yourself?

489
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:11,280
Why tell me?

490
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,359
I'm returning your favor.

491
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,760
Xiaosu,

492
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,719
well, I...

493
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:20,319
It's a bit inconvenient for me,

494
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,599
see?

495
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,119
Inconvenient?

496
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:36,199
The ECG is stable.

497
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,239
The blood pressure is also normal.

498
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,119
Drowsiness is also alleviated.

499
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,119
She should be fine now.

500
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,920
Then why her agent

501
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,880
acted so nervously?

502
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,560
There is a guard outside the door.

503
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,560
Well, they call it special care.

504
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,640
Because she is a big star.

505
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,439
Let's go.

506
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
Don't be nervous.

507
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,959
Take it easy. Calm down.

508
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,560
Dr. Shao.

509
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,000
Dr. Shao.

510
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
I'am here to open the window
to get some fresh air.

511
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,359
Who are you?

512
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,560
I've never seen you before.

513
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm a nurse. I'm new.

514
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,359
New?

515
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:01,719
Have you measured her blood pressure?

516
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,880
Blood pressure?

517
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:05,000
(Shao Zhenrong. Chief physician in
Department of Neurosurgery)

518
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:06,560
Dr. Shao,

519
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,760
I forget the blood pressure kit,

520
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,000
I'll fetch it.

521
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,160
Blood pressure kit?

522
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,719
Which department are you in?

523
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,719
Have you seen this person before?

524
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,560
No...

525
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,239
Wait.

526
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,359
Sorry.

527
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,239
Are you ok?

528
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,119
I'm good.

529
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:35,280
Sorry.

530
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,040
What's going on?

531
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:36,680
Sorry.

532
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,599
Be more careful.

533
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,920
Dr. Shao,

534
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,439
why are you in a hurry?

535
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,079
Ghost hunting?

536
00:31:50,239 --> 00:31:51,199
Well, maybe.

537
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,040
Mr. Lei,

538
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,239
we got in touch with Xu You.

539
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,599
Her schedule is ok.

540
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,119
However,

541
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:07,359
she insists on meeting you in person.

542
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,880
Lei Yuzheng,

543
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,239
you know what I want.

544
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,199
I cannot give you

545
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,640
what you want.

546
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,560
Can't we just have a peaceful breakup?

547
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,439
Lei Yuzheng,

548
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:26,880
there will be one day

549
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,680
when you have to

550
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,040
pay all these back to someone.

551
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:38,839
Tell Xu You,

552
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,359
I'll meet her.

553
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,000
Time is up to her.

554
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,520
Mr. Lei,

555
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,199
maybe you need to think twice

556
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,479
about changing the role.

557
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,839
Xie Li will definitely
tell Yan Jingjing about it.

558
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,839
I'm afraid she will then make trouble.

559
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,319
Fine,

560
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,199
let she do it.

561
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
I wonder what else she can do

562
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:58,719
after her collusion with Xie Li.

563
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,119
-All right.
-All right.

564
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,839
Mr. Jiang,

565
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,640
come in.

566
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,880
Mr. Jiang,

567
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,439
there are rumors that

568
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,199
Yutian's Demon Hunter production
will be canceled.

569
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,319
And Lei Yuzheng wants to
change the female leading role.

570
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,319
Have you heard about it?

571
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,119
Of course.

572
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,479
Their crisis is our chance.

573
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,119
What's more, they have invested

574
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:46,040
several millions in the movie.

575
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,959
Maybe we can...

576
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,760
Maybe we can also give him

577
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,319
the project that we are not good at?

578
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,280
That project was quite good

579
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,599
in the beginning.

580
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,920
But for some reason

581
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,800
it's causing a lot of troubles recently.

582
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:00,800
A simple demolition

583
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,479
has set us on fire,

584
00:34:03,479 --> 00:34:04,959
not to mention the development
of this project.

585
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,680
There is also something wrong
with our funds.

586
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,399
If that's the case,

587
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,239
then we'd better let them do it.

588
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
If we want to make the deal
with the Lei Family,

589
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:20,239
it seems I will be needing help
from another person.

590
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,800
I'll go for it!

591
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,040
The window is not closed.

592
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Great!

593
00:35:12,399 --> 00:35:13,639
Thanks God!

594
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:19,879
Dr. Shao.

595
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,239
I'll go and check.

596
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,000
He looks even more handsome than before.

597
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,439
What are you doing?

598
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,639
Are you ok?

599
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,280
It's you!

600
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,080
I don't know what you are talking about!

601
00:36:27,479 --> 00:36:28,879
When will you get off from my body?

602
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,879
It's cold on the floor.

603
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,320
I swear.

604
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,159
I didn't mean to flirt with you.

605
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,280
Dr. Shao...

606
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,199
You...

607
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,159
You guys...

608
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,840
Well, you are popular.

609
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:14,199
Which department are you in?

610
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,600
I, I, I...

611
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,320
Answer my question.

612
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,239
Actually I sneaked into the hospital
in disguise

613
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,000
to thank you

614
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,520
for picking up my phone.

615
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,719
I'm so hungry.

616
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
I haven't eaten anything
for a whole day.

617
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,199
I can even eat up

618
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,159
a cow right now.

619
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,239
The car speed is fast.

620
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,520
See?

621
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,840
You've got so many fans in the hospital.

622
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,679
If I just walk in directly,

623
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
I'll be beaten up

624
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,320
by your nurse fans.

625
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,679
Well, it seems you risk your life
to express your gratitude.

626
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
Who on earth are you?

627
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,840
Frankly,

628
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,159
I'm a reporter.

629
00:38:28,879 --> 00:38:30,520
You come to see Yan Jingjing.

630
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
But you shouldn't

631
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,719
climb up the window.

632
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,280
If you fell off just now,

633
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,800
it would be good luck

634
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,639
to end up with soft tissue contusion,

635
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,639
or broken spine and internal organs

636
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,439
for worse.

637
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,320
Life time paralysis.

638
00:38:53,439 --> 00:38:53,879
I...

639
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,479
That's it.

640
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,919
Never do this again.

641
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,159
Get out.

642
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:06,320
Dr. Shao.

643
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,399
Well,

644
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,760
I almost died just now,

645
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,040
so please don't send me back
with empty hands.

646
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,560
Could you

647
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,239
make an exception for me?

648
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,639
Please?

649
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,520
Just one photo.

650
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,840
Just one.

651
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,120
Do you think this is a bargain?

652
00:39:25,959 --> 00:39:28,080
Dr. Shao, do you know that

653
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,479
if I fail to interview her,

654
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,639
I'll be fired?

655
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:33,439
And then I'll have no money

656
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,679
to pay for my rent,

657
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,600
and then I'll be homeless,

658
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:37,800
sleeping on the street.

659
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,800
I'm such a miserable person.

660
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,479
Please,

661
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,639
just help me.

662
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,560
Please.

663
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,600
Well, body guard!

664
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,159
Wait!

665
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,760
May I just ask you two questions?

666
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,879
How's the injury of Yan Jingjing?

667
00:39:54,479 --> 00:39:55,840
How's the injury of Yan Jingjing?

668
00:39:55,919 --> 00:39:56,800
Will there be post-trauma symptoms?

669
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,679
Is her face disfigured?

670
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:58,479
Will there be scar?

671
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,879
I am a doctor.

672
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,159
Have you ever seen a doctor

673
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,520
who gives away
private information of patients?

674
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,639
Isn't it true that
all doctors are sympathetic?

675
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,919
How can you just see me dying
without doing anything?

676
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,600
I'm so helpless.

677
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,919
Listen.

678
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,399
Listen.

679
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,239
If you don't allow me to
take a picture of her,

680
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,879
I'll make things irreparable.
