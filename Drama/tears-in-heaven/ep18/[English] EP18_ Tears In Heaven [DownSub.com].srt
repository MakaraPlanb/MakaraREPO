16
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,399
Lin Xiangyuan?

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,600
What are you doing here?

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,639
Fanlv,

19
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:35,559
this is for you.

20
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,520
What's this for?

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,639
I haven't seen you for a long time.

22
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,440
You've been avoiding me in the company.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,479
You see me now.

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,559
You can leave.

25
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,279
Fanlv.

26
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,759
Let me do it.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,759
OK.

28
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,919
I really like you.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,919
Please believe me.

30
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,839
I'll be good to you.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,360
Give me a chance, Ok?

32
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,559
I'll prove it to you.

33
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:06,720
Ok,

34
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,240
then give it to me.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,199
Fanlv.

36
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:28,960
Dad, what's the matter?

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
What is Lin Xiangyuan here for?

38
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,160
For nothing, dad.

39
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,839
Stop lying to me.

40
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,199
I saw everything upstairs just now.

41
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:41,240
Dad,

42
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,160
there is nothing going on between us.

43
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,279
So, you won't tell me, right?

44
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,360
I'll ask him.

45
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Please don't.

46
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,360
It's Lin Xiangyuan.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
He always pesters me.

48
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
I'm out, Mr. Lei.

49
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,119
I am not good at fencing.

50
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,119
How can I compete with you?

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm not Shao Zhenrong.

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,119
Right.

53
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,679
You're not Zhenrong.

54
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,399
No one can be him.

55
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:24,559
I'm sorry, Mr. Lei.

56
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,440
Never mind.

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,720
By the way,

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,679
I heard Du Xiaosu's not doing well

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,799
with her studio.

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,519
I'm wondering how

61
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,760
she dares to

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,279
start up a studio

63
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,440
without connections or background.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,480
Not that surprising

65
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,079
since she even dares to stop my car
to argue with me.

66
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,040
By the way,

67
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,200
you can go back to the company first.

68
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:44,760
Ok.

69
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,640
I have other plans.

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,000
Need a ride?

71
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,079
What did I tell you?

72
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,200
Being drunk is not a big deal,

73
00:04:57,559 --> 00:05:00,359
but doing stupid things like that is.

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Dad,

75
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
Yuzheng turned me down that day.

76
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,279
I was upset and drank a lot.

77
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:11,760
That's why Lin Xiangyuan and I...

78
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,119
I'm not blaming you.

79
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,440
I care about you.

80
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,200
But no matter how upset you were,

81
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,559
you should not have been with
Lin Xiangyuan.

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,880
The less you love yourself,

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,760
the farther away
Lei Yuzheng will be from you.

84
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,640
Man would never

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,399
love a woman more

86
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,760
because she abandoned herself.

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,239
It is such a simple truth.

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,519
Why can't you get it?

89
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,160
Dad.

90
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:58,839
Client's coming, client's coming...

91
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,440
Client's coming...

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,559
Flower means client.

93
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:16,440
Flower!

94
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,920
But no client.

95
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,040
It doesn't count this time.
One more time.

96
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,279
Client's coming, client's coming...

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,760
Client!

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Welcome to Du Xiaosu...

99
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,760
Lei Yuzheng, why are you here?

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,040
I just stop by.

101
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,200
Why? Am I not expected?

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,359
It is not like that.

103
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,440
Your studio is quiet.

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,160
No people here.

105
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,239
Is it going out of business?

106
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,720
Lei Yuzheng,
what are you talking about?

107
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,600
Are you expecting my studio
to close down every day?

108
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,079
What a capitalist you are!

109
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,600
You have no sympathy at all.

110
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,200
I'll talk to Ning Weicheng.

111
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,799
You can come back to Boyuan.

112
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,079
Back to Boyuan?

113
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,600
Are you losing your mind?

114
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Do you think I open this studio

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,519
just for fun?

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm just concerned that
you can't make it,

117
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,279
and might be starving to death.

118
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
It's not that far yet.

119
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
How do you know that?

120
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,119
I'll hang in there.

121
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Mr. Lin,

122
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,920
to be honest,

123
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
I feel unsettled

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,600
as I owe money to you.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,959
So, I wanna pay the money

126
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,720
back to you.

127
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:56,040
Qunfei,

128
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,200
no rush.

129
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,720
You can return that money
anytime you want.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,239
I didn't push you.

131
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,040
I know,

132
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,839
you don't want to owe me.

133
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,359
But in this society,

134
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:07,959
anyone might

135
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,519
suffer from a very difficult time.

136
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,239
We are friends.

137
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,559
Take me as your sponsor.

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,600
I'll give it back to you
as long as I have the money.

139
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,839
Thank you, Mr. Lin.

140
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,559
You are welcome.

141
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,000
See you later.

142
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,799
You're so late!

143
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,520
Three drinks to start, Ok?

144
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,599
All right.

145
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,520
A piece of cake.

146
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,000
One toast

147
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,080
to you.

148
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,239
You're so easy today.

149
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,799
I don't know what to say.

150
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,320
One toast to each of you.

151
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,440
Stop it.

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I dare not to take it.

153
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,159
You gave him a toast last year.

154
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,919
The final price was lowered
by two percent.

155
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,919
He couldn't do anything about it.

156
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,679
Don't listen to him.

157
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,799
I heard you recently acquired a company,

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,159
and want renovation.

159
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,239
Do you need a designer?
A friend of mine is a designer.

160
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,520
Come on, what do you mean?

161
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
You don't wanna make
such a little money, do you?

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,679
This is not you.

163
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,599
What do you have in your mind?

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,919
Ye Shenkuan,

165
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,840
you take your little money back

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,960
as soon as possible.

167
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,080
I wanna introduce you

168
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
a designer friend.

169
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,880
A man or a woman?

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
A woman.

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,000
It's a woman for sure.

172
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,359
I knew it!

173
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,239
It is a woman. So what?

174
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Yuzheng,

175
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,719
we've known each other
for so many years.

176
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:50,359
You are on your own.

177
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,719
You never ask for favors.

178
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,239
Why did you do that this time?

179
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,280
Are you in love?

180
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,960
Anyway, this is the deal.

181
00:09:58,119 --> 00:09:59,520
I'll give you her number.

182
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,719
Call her.

183
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
But remember

184
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,679
not to tell her that you know me.

185
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,960
Miss Jiang, are you expecting Mr. Lei?

186
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,679
Mr. Lei told me that...

187
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,159
Fanlv.

188
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,760
What are you doing here?

189
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,840
Why? Am I not allowed to be here?

190
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,080
You are.

191
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,799
But next time before you come in,

192
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,919
please knock at the door.

193
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
Ok, I'm sorry.

194
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,239
Yuzheng.

195
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,280
I have something to tell you.

196
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,000
Hold on one second.

197
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,080
I have to approve

198
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,320
this contract right now.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm getting engaged.

200
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:49,559
Getting engaged?

201
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:51,719
Don't you congratulate me?

202
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,200
Are you surprised or

203
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,559
reluctant to let me marry somebody else?

204
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,520
Fanlv.

205
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,559
Congratulations!

206
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,960
You mean it?

207
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,919
We grew up together.

208
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,440
You have your beloved one now,

209
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:10,840
and are getting engaged.

210
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,760
Of course I'm happy for you.

211
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,719
Don't forget
to give me the invitation.

212
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,679
I'll definitely give you
a big red packet.

213
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,559
Great.

214
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,119
This is it.

215
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,039
Lei Yuzheng,

216
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,239
I've got the best seat for you.

217
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,559
Please be there on time.

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,184
(Wedding Invitation to Lei Yuzheng,
from Lin Xiangyuan and Jiang Fanlv)

219
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,080
Wait.

220
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
Are you getting engaged
with Lin Xiangyuan?

221
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,719
Why?

222
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,440
Can't I?

223
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:50,640
Fanlv.

224
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,599
Ok, fine.

225
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,599
He is your fiance now.

226
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,359
It might not be proper for me
to tell you this.

227
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,640
But Lin Xiangyuan

228
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,559
may not be as simple as you think.

229
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,520
Even I can't see him through.

230
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,200
Think about it again.

231
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,599
Lin Xiangyuan
is really not the one for you.

232
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,799
Love is the foundation of marriage.

233
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
We grew up together,

234
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,559
so I know you.

235
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,080
You won't be so naive to

236
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,359
take your marriage lightly.

237
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,239
Think about it.

238
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,679
I just want you to be happy.

239
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,200
Happy?

240
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,919
I think I'll be happy.

241
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't worry.

242
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm not going to
take my marriage lightly.

243
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,159
The clothes are too expensive here.

244
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,599
Let's go somewhere else.

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,280
Du Xiaosu.

246
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,359
Can you learn from me?

247
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,880
Look at yourself! Not fashionable!

248
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,799
Look!

249
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,880
Not fashionable?

250
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,159
Does this one look nice?

251
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,479
Is it nice?

252
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:04,619
(Price: 5280 yuan)

253
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,840
More than 5,000 yuan for this?

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,679
Are you nuts?

255
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,359
Who would buy such an expensive coat?

256
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,719
It is expensive. So what?

257
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,719
No input, no output.

258
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,359
Xiaosu,

259
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,440
I think

260
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,440
this coat looks good on you, too.

261
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,039
I don't have the money for
such an expensive coat.

262
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,799
No business yet

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
since the opening of the studio.

264
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,679
If it goes on like this,

265
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,400
I have to shut it down.

266
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,880
That's why I called you silly.

267
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,719
Give up the work in Boyuan.

268
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,400
Have to live on your own.

269
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,880
You are meant to be poor.

270
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,640
Why did you talk like this?

271
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,320
Hello.

272
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,239
Yes, it is my studio.

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,719
I'll take it.

274
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,159
I'll take it for sure!

275
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,719
When are we going to sign the contract?

276
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,679
Great! Brilliant! Thank you!

277
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,840
Ok. Bye.

278
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,359
Siqi!

279
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,280
What happened?

280
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,599
Somebody just called me

281
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,479
and asked me to
decorate an office building

282
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:15,919
at this price.

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,799
It can't be timelier!

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,280
I finally don't have to be starving!

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,359
I finally can keep the studio!

286
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:23,799
Renovation of an office building?

287
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,559
At this price?

288
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,320
Xiaosu.

289
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,960
Calm down.

290
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,080
How did he know you?

291
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,159
I didn't ask about this.

292
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,400
Whatever.

293
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:43,280
Now, we have eggs,

294
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,320
what's the point to know
where they come from?

295
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:46,599
I'll treat you to dinner!

296
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,799
Not today.

297
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Why?

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,840
Shangguan is going on a business trip
to Guangzhou tomorrow.

299
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,799
I have to be with him.

300
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,119
Siqi.

301
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,679
Where are you, you and Shangguan?

302
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,679
Where are we?

303
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,559
We just proceed without a plan.

304
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:10,000
I support He Qunfei.

305
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,479
Forever.

306
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,280
Xiaosu,

307
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,119
let me tell you the truth.

308
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,719
I'm not like you.

309
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,799
You can be on your own,

310
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,440
begging every day

311
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,239
for a big contract out of nowhere,

312
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,799
and living an unsettled life.

313
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,559
But I can't. Really.

314
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,119
Do you think

315
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,479
I'm so sick and realistic?

316
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:43,960
Fine.

317
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,359
Then take care of yourself.

318
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,760
Sushi!

319
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,959
So much delicious food!

320
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,839
Zou Siqi,
you care dates much more than mates.

321
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,000
This wine is all for me.

322
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,359
Come on!

323
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,199
Fill the glass!

324
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,520
I, Du Xiaosu,

325
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,319
finally settled in Shanghai!

326
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:32,719
I have my own studio.

327
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,520
And I just signed a big contract!

328
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:37,560
Dad! Mom!

329
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:40,400
You should be happy for me.

330
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,520
I'll try my best.

331
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:50,079
I'll work hard.

332
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,079
Besides,

333
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll become

334
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,839
a real architect.

335
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,920
Cheers!

336
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,959
I'm so happy!

337
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,160
Come on!

338
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,239
Cheers!

339
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,800
Great. Thank you, Shenkuan.

340
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,464
I'll treat you to dinner.

341
00:18:21,472 --> 00:18:22,016
(Du Xiaosu)

342
00:18:33,568 --> 00:18:34,304
(Calling Du Xiaosu)

343
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:42,008
(Lei Yuzheng)

344
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,400
Lei Yuzheng?

345
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,280
Hello,

346
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,079
this is Du Xiaosu's studio.

347
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,439
What can I do for you?

348
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,319
Du Xiaosu, where are you?

349
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm in the botanical garden.

350
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,959
Ok, wait for me.

351
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,439
Another contract!

352
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:15,079
Du Xiaosu,

353
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,000
your luck in fortune is coming!

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,839
You can't even stop it!

355
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,400
Cheers.

356
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,479
I screwed up.

357
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,880
Miss Du.

358
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,199
You look so happy.

359
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,400
What made you so happy?

360
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,640
You didn't even
share it with me.

361
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:47,280
Are you also offering me a big contract?

362
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,680
I just arrived.

363
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,680
Good for you. Du Xiaosu.

364
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,880
I heard you've got a big contract.

365
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,280
You don't even think about
treating me to dinner,

366
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,319
but come here to enjoy foods alone?

367
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,160
Who told you I was eating alone?

368
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,560
Didn't you see that

369
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,280
Zou Siqi just left?

370
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,400
Du Xiaosu,

371
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
you have signed a big contract

372
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,839
as soon as the company is open.

373
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,199
So lucky for you.

374
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,239
Of course. Don't you know who I am?

375
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
I, Du Xiaosu,

376
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,800
graduated from a famous
university after all.

377
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,000
When working in Boyuan,

378
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,119
you know my talent was just wasted.

379
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,479
What's so funny?

380
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,560
Fine.

381
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,160
Seems that I didn't value you.

382
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,319
When I go back,

383
00:20:39,479 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll have a serious talk with
Ning Weicheng.

384
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,520
Ok!

385
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,199
To retain the talent like you,

386
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,239
we must offer well-paid job.

387
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,319
How can we have such a talent
drained away to the society?

388
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
Isn't this

389
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,119
developing competitors for Boyuan?

390
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,359
You regret it?

391
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,239
But it's not too late yet.

392
00:20:57,439 --> 00:21:00,319
We can join force together.

393
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,880
Well, Miss Du,

394
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:06,000
how are you going to make it?

395
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well,

396
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,599
I have to think about it.

397
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,920
Ok.

398
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,439
Miss Du, take your time.

399
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,599
Contact us whenever you're ready.

400
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,880
Yutian

401
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,400
is always waiting for you.

402
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,239
By the way,

403
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,719
when are you going to start to implement

404
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,839
the contract you just signed?

405
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,319
Tomorrow.

406
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,119
To be honest,

407
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,319
I didn't expect that

408
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,319
I'm so valuable.

409
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,319
I'm wondering why the guy is so silly

410
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:40,920
that he spent that much money

411
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,880
on a designer like me…

412
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,160
What?

413
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:50,280
Nothing.

414
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,239
I'm happy for you.

415
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,560
Xiaosu, you shouldn't have said that.

416
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,479
He offers you work,

417
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,239
but you're speaking ill of him.

418
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,479
Don't you have a conscience?

419
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,479
I'm not speaking ill of him.

420
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,599
I'm telling you. Don't worry.

421
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,280
This contract,

422
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll take it seriously.

423
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,239
I know exactly

424
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,599
what I'm capable of.

425
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,959
Absolutely no problem for this contract.

426
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,079
All right.

427
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,079
Wish you all the best

428
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,760
for your first contract!

429
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,040
Cheers!

430
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Xiangyuan.

431
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,719
Mr. Jiang.

432
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,479
Mr. Jiang, have tea.

433
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,000
You and Fanlv

434
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,160
are getting engaged.

435
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,760
Do you have anything to say to me?

436
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,800
Mr. Jiang, please trust me.

437
00:23:02,959 --> 00:23:04,439
I'll be good to Fanlv.

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,599
If she asks me to go east,
I'll never go west.

439
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,199
I promise that

440
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:12,599
I'll favor her and love her

441
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,719
for my whole life.

442
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
From now on,
you can regard me as your son.

443
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,319
I'll be willing to risk any danger

444
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,560
to do whatever you want me to do.

445
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,760
Xiangyuan,

446
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,359
we're gonna be a family soon.

447
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,719
I want to be honest with you.

448
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,880
Frankly speaking,

449
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,439
you're not the son-in-law
I was expecting.

450
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,319
And

451
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,680
you knew it yourself.

452
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,479
Fanlv is the apple of my eye.

453
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,800
As long as you're good to her,

454
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,920
I'll be good to you.

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,880
Got it.

456
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

457
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,239
From now on,

458
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,479
whatever you ask me to do, I'll do it.

459
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
Wait.

460
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,160
I've already given the invitation
to Lei Yuzheng.

461
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,359
Now there is a person

462
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,040
for you to invite.

463
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
No problem.

464
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,656
(Wedding Invitation to Du Xiaosu,
from Lin Xiangyuan and Jiang Fanlv)

465
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:25,719
Miss Du, take a look.

466
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:26,479
Here it is.

467
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:30,199
Mr. Ye,

468
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,599
you have a very good location here.

469
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,280
Enough for an office.

470
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:35,680
By the way,

471
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,920
are you satisfied

472
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,160
with the last design?

473
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,319
Miss Du,

474
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,040
I'm very satisfied with the design.

475
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:44,160
How about this?
Since we've signed the contract,

476
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,079
you can start anytime.

477
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:47,719
I'll check as soon as
the renovation completes.

478
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,599
Ok, Mr. Ye.

479
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,199
I’ll do my best!

480
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,199
So, he likes this type.

481
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,839
What?

482
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,680
Nothing. I was kidding.

483
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,760
You're in charge now.

484
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,959
I shall go now.

485
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,719
Ok.

486
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,640
Bye-bye.

487
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,239
See you.

488
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,800
Hello, who is that?

489
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:37,696
(Wedding Invitation to Du Xiaosu,
from Lin Xiangyuan and Jiang Fanlv)

490
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
Are you getting engaged?

491
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:42,640
Yes.

492
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,880
Congratulations!

493
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,920
Miss Jiang has always been

494
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,640
the one you've been dreaming of.

495
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:51,079
You should cherish her.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,880
And I wish you all the best.

497
00:25:57,079 --> 00:25:58,280
You have Jiang Fanlv,

498
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,000
and I have someone I loved.

499
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,479
Shao Zhenrong?

500
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,280
But he's...

501
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,199
As long as he is in my heart,

502
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,839
he's always been around me.

503
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,800
Don't worry.

504
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,400
I will be there on time.

505
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:26,680
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

506
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,719
Thank you very much.

507
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,560
I appreciate it.

508
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:29,920
Upstairs, please.

509
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,199
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

510
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:31,920
Thank you very much.

Upstairs, please.

512
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,280
Mr. Huang is here.

513
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,319
Congratulations!

514
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:39,280
Hello, Mr. Huang.

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,880
Come over here.

516
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,319
Let me introduce you.

517
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,640
This is Mr. Huang from Ruiyuan Group,

518
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,719
and also one of our shareholders.

519
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,319
This is my son-in-law, Lin Xiangyuan.

520
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,000
He's working in Yutian.

521
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,880
Your support is highly expected.

522
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,920
It's my pleasure.

523
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,319
Kindly give me more advice, Mr. Huang.

524
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,800
Mr. Jiang's son-in-law

525
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,640
must be outstanding.

526
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,760
I‘ll do my best.

527
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,359
-It's very kind of you.
-Upstairs, please.

528
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,400
Why does Fanlv

529
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,959
get engaged so soon?

530
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,520
It was really a shock to me.

531
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,319
As a spectator, I can see that

532
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,199
Fanlv has been having a big crush on

533
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,560
our Yuzheng for years.

534
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,880
Why did she get engaged
to Lin Xiangyuan all of a sudden?

535
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,239
What's the point?

536
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:45,839
Fanlv did have a big crush on him,

537
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,079
but he

538
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,079
just ignored that.

539
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,920
She is a girl after all,

540
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,239
and she has the dignity.

541
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,599
So,
Yuzheng let Fanlv down, right?

542
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,239
Aunt Shao,

543
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,040
it's Fanlv's freedom to marry
anyone she wants.

544
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,400
It's none of my business.

545
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,959
How dare you?

546
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:08,319
A good marriage is screwed up.

547
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,520
Jiang even sent me the invitation.

548
00:28:12,199 --> 00:28:13,959
I have to pretend smiling

549
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,000
to attend the ceremony.

550
00:28:17,199 --> 00:28:19,280
You've made me so embarrassed.

551
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,479
Dad, the problem is...

552
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,520
Come on.

553
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:24,520
You two, just stop.

554
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,239
But Yuzheng,

555
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:29,640
you're not young anymore.

556
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,800
You should settle down with a girl.

557
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,319
If you don't like Fanlv, that's ok.

558
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
But you need to be careful.

559
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160
Don't be like our Zhenrong.

560
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,560
Such an awful relationship he was in.

561
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,040
Aunt Shao, I'm not in hurry.

562
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:47,199
I'll take care of you when you're older.

563
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,239
Mr. Jiang. Congratulations!

564
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:24,719
Kaixuan,

565
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,040
it's more than enough
while you are here.

566
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,719
Don't be so kind.

567
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:29,000
Uncle Jiang,

568
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:29,880
congratulations.

569
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,079
This is a little regard
from my dad and me.

570
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,359
Jiang,

571
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,199
congratulations.

572
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,800
Let me see

573
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,719
who's so lucky

574
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,239
to win the heart of our Fanlv.

575
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,880
Kaixuan,

576
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,719
you're flattering Fanlv.

577
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,040
Actually, everyone has
their own preference.

578
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:52,000
Our Fanlv is worthless

579
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,000
in someone's eyes.

580
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:54,839
Uncle Jiang,

581
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,640
don't you accept the red packet?

582
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,079
My God, I just saw it.

583
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:00,280
Thank you.

584
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:01,439
Yuzheng,

585
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,359
Fanlv used to annoy you a lot.

586
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,599
I apologize for her.

587
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,000
Don't worry. From now on,

588
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,479
I promise she won't annoy you anymore.

589
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,239
It's so kind of you, Uncle Jiang.

590
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,079
Today is the big day for Fanlv.

591
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,920
Why let the past ruin today?

592
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,640
Dad and Aunt Shao,

593
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,719
I will come inside.

594
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,760
Ok. Upstairs please.

595
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,160
Ok. We will go upstairs first.

596
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,119
Please. Thank you.

597
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:56,599
Du Xiaosu,

598
00:30:58,839 --> 00:30:59,760
why are you here?

599
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,400
Mr. Lei?

600
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,880
Fanlv invited you?

601
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,079
Today I'm the guest of groom.

602
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:11,880
Why?

603
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,479
Are you coming here to kidnap the bride?

604
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,160
Why?

605
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,040
Fanlv is not my type.

606
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,040
Then what's your type?

607
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,160
I can help you.

608
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,280
Let me guess.

609
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:25,959
First,

610
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:27,160
she has to be a good-looking,

611
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,479
like the Hollywood actress at least.

612
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,199
Second,

613
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,119
she must come from a well-bred family.

614
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,560
Third, she has to have a good character.

615
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,439
Only the one who is gentle and obedient

616
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
can stand your bad temper.

617
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,920
Du Xiaosu,

618
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,199
are you insane?

619
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,599
You make fun of me!

620
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,040
I guess the ceremony will begin soon.

621
00:31:49,439 --> 00:31:51,119
I should go for it now.

622
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,640
From now on, the Leis and the Jiangs

623
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,880
have contradiction with each other.

624
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,959
Pathetic parents' heart.

625
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:16,199
Jiang is just worrying about Fanlv.

626
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,040
It's normal to make some complaints.

627
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,239
He'll be fine in few days.

628
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,560
What's wrong?

629
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,119
Nothing.

630
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,920
So beautiful.

631
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,119
Aunt Shao.

632
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,839
Dad.

633
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,280
Look,

634
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,839
you won't marry Fanlv,

635
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,520
and Jiang's getting mad at your dad.

636
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,040
And now, your dad is getting mad at you.

637
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,520
Are you gonna eat it?

638
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:36,800
Today…

639
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,719
Forgive me.

640
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,160
I'm a little excited.

641
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,680
Thank you very much

642
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,760
for coming to my daughter‘s

643
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,599
engagement ceremony.

644
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,800
My daughter Fanlv and Lin Xiangyuan

645
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,119
are in love with each other,

646
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,880
and pledge to marry each other.

647
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,319
I've been thankful for this.

648
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,439
Here,

649
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,280
I kindly hope that everyone here

650
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,040
can help my son-in-law Xiangyuan.

651
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,840
I thank you all here.

652
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,639
It seems Jiang Jin is

653
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,120
pretty satisfied with this son-in-law.

654
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,959
Sure.

655
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,040
Let's raise our glass.

656
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,000
Lin Xiangyuan is not like you.

657
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,760
You are so proud.

658
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:35,000
Lin Xiangyuan has been
determined to marry Jiang.

659
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,679
He just gets what he wants.

660
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,600
You…

661
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,199
Let's

662
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,439
cheers.

663
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,120
Let's

664
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,239
cheers.

665
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:48,040
I've heard that this groom

666
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,479
is working for Jiang Jin.

667
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,360
He is not in the high position.

668
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,479
He is just a vice president.

669
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,800
He's already bonded with Mr. Jiang.

670
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,879
Promotion is for sure.

671
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,320
Thank you again

672
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:02,399
for coming to my daughter's
engagement ceremony.

673
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:03,639
Thank you.

674
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,399
Du Xiaosu, I don't get you.

675
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:22,280
It's not your engagement ceremony.
Why were you so excited?

676
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:27,600
I'm sorry.

677
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,280
I don't know why.

678
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,600
I kind of lost my cool today.

679
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:36,719
Don't tell me you were touched.

680
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:39,679
Also,

681
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,000
are you always so sentimental?

682
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:46,399
I know you don't believe in fate.

683
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,439
But I believe fate is meant to be.

684
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,959
I believe,

685
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,159
everyone has his own love.

686
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:02,560
It's said that the fate is marvelous.

687
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,120
If two people in the world

688
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
can get together in the end,

689
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,280
that would be the best thing
in this world.

690
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,439
What are you thinking?

691
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,239
You have such a special way of thinking.

692
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:17,639
Du Xiaosu,

693
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,239
you are so naive.

694
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:21,600
Can you live on fate and love?

695
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:24,320
Don't you think
there is only love in life?

696
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,280
You have to love deeply

697
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,120
while being laughed by others?

698
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,320
That's what you want?

699
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,800
What do you mean?

700
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,199
Don't you understand?

701
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,600
Understand what?

702
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,520
I do feel like that anyway.

703
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,399
You are so stubborn.

704
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,280
Forget it, and just be naive.

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,320
You are really weird.

706
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,560
Why do you have to eat cakes

707
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,719
in the engagement ceremony of others?

708
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,040
Did you see it?

709
00:36:57,679 --> 00:36:59,919
How come I didn't see it
since you were eating like that.

710
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,360
I was so starving.

711
00:37:05,879 --> 00:37:07,360
I saw that cake was pretty good.

712
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,360
I just took several.

713
00:37:08,399 --> 00:37:10,520
It turned out to be really tasty.

714
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,159
I'm telling you,

715
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,399
in that ceremony,

716
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,360
the cake

717
00:37:13,479 --> 00:37:15,560
is the only highlight.

718
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:25,399
What is that?

719
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,360
Fireworks!

720
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,719
So many of them!

721
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,679
Look over there!

722
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,479
It's so beautiful with all colors.

723
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,800
It's really beautiful!

724
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,800
What a pity.

725
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Just one moment.

726
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,520
Like the happiness.

727
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,000
The more dazzling,
the less possible to keep it.

728
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,560
So what?

729
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,560
At least it was dazzling.

730
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:55,719
But I'm telling you that

731
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
the details are particularly important.

732
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,080
