17
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,039
Mr. Lei,

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,479
on behalf of Yutian's staff,

19
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:34,839
I welcome you back.

20
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,720
Qunfei,

21
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,880
where is Xiangyuan?

22
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,679
Xiang...

23
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,199
Mr. Lin...

24
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,080
Uncle Jiang,

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,119
when did Xiangyuan turn himself in?

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,000
In fact,

27
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:58,279
Xiangyuan never intended to stay.

28
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,119
He knows

29
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,679
that the Entertainment Center Project
is the work of you and Mr. Lei Senior.

30
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
During this time,

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,919
he has been trying his best

32
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,399
to arrange the restart of the project

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,880
properly.

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,119
Uncle Jiang,

35
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,279
you should keep him.

36
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,399
He left like this.

37
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,679
Does Fanlv know?

38
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,520
She knows.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,960
Yuzheng,

40
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:28,720
don't hesitate to come back.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,399
Yutian needs you.

42
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,199
The Entertainment Center
Project needs you.

43
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,600
We all need you.

44
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
I will keep this room

45
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,679
for Xiangyuan.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,639
I want to thank you for Xiangyuan.

47
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,080
The shareholders are all
in the meeting room.

48
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,639
Let's go.

49
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,919
Come.

50
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,679
Xiaosu,

51
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:10,639
thank you for the design
you made for my friend.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,479
You don't need to thank me.

53
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,800
It's my pleasure.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,639
Thank you.

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,320
Mr. Liu,

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,799
I'm very sorry for
what happened last time.

57
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Sorry.

58
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,839
Do you mean

59
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,320
last time when we had meals?

60
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I've forgot about it.

61
00:04:26,559 --> 00:04:27,239
How are you two doing now?

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
Is everything OK?

63
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,799
Let's skip this topic.

64
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,760
Xiaosu, I'm older than you.

65
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:39,000
There's something I want to tell you.

66
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,359
Actually, there's an imagined enemy

67
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,519
in every man's heart.

68
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,559
But if this imagined enemy

69
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,959
can keep your love
long-lasting and lively,

70
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,480
the meal I bought you
was not for nothing.

71
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:49,600
Xiaosu,

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,480
actually, I'm calling today

73
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
to tell you something else.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you know the Young Architect Competition?

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,079
Of course I know about it.

76
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,239
I've always wanted to participate.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,440
Has it already started for this year?

78
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,679
I've been so busy these days

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,920
and I almost forgot about it.

80
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,959
Yes. I have a friend who is

81
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:10,279
the judge.

82
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,119
When he mentioned it to me,

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,239
you were the first
that came into my mind.

84
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,320
I want you to participate.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,320
I heard that the winner can go to Paris

86
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,440
to study for one year.

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,760
I think it might be
a great opportunity for you.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,079
But I've been so busy these days

89
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,640
and I'm afraid that I won't have time.

90
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,640
Xiaosu,

91
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,920
I know that it's difficult for you.

92
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,279
But do you know
who leads the team this year?

93
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
It's your idol, Professor Ohm.

94
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Professor Ohm? Seriously?

95
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,320
Don't worry.

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,480
There's still time before the deadline.

97
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,920
You can still think about it.

98
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
OK.

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
I will think about it.

100
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:53,920
Bye.

101
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:21,880
Come on in.

102
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,799
Xiaosu, have a seat.

103
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,839
Mr. Ning, why did you call me?

104
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,399
Here.

105
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,480
Check out this contract first.

106
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,799
If you are willing to
collaborate with us,

107
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,359
please sign here

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,399
and the contract will
become effective immediately.

(Party A: Yutian Group)

111
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,920
The pricing is all written there.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,239
I'm sure that you will be satisfied
with the pricing this time.

113
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,679
Thank you for your trust,

114
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,480
but I'm afraid that

115
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:02,040
I can't accept it.

116
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,279
Why?

117
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:05,880
Do you think the project
is not good enough?

118
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,880
Or you are not satisfied with the price?

119
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,480
It's a great project

120
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,359
with good pricing.

121
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:12,559
But

122
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,839
I can't accept it.

123
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,480
Why?

124
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,399
It's because of me.

125
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't want to

126
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,040
collaborate with Yutian.

127
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,000
I see what you mean.

128
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,839
It's not Yutian that
you don't want to collaborate with.

129
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,000
It's Mr. Lei

130
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,440
that you don't want to come across.

131
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,279
But you need to think it through.

132
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,880
Relationship is relationship,

133
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,600
while work is work.

134
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Mr. Ning,

135
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,200
I really appreciate you told me these.

136
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:50,760
But

137
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,679
I hope that I can achieve my goals

138
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,200
through my own efforts,

139
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,519
one step at a time.

140
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,880
Hope you can understand.

141
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
Goodbye.

142
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,920
Do you have time tonight?

143
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Let's meet up.

144
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,559
Miss, would you like to order anything?

145
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:01,880
Excuse me, give me a moment.

146
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:03,080
OK.

147
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:14,784

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,280
Fanlv, what is it?

150
00:09:25,479 --> 00:09:27,880
(The number you have dialed
is currently busy.)

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,239
(Please dial it again later.)

(Du Xiaosu)

153
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:35,960
What happened to Uncle Jiang?

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,719
Maybe what happened to Xiangyuan

155
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,640
caused his heart attack.

156
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,840
Can you come here now?

157
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,440
He wants to tell you something.

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,119
OK, I will be right there.

159
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,688
(Du Xiaosu)

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,960
Yuzheng is here.

161
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
Uncle Jiang,

162
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,479
do you feel better now?

163
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:21,119
I'm getting older and weaker.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,599
The doctor just stopped by

165
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
and my dad is doing okay now.

166
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,559
Uncle Jiang,

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,080
what did you want to tell me?

168
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,799
You can say it now.

169
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Yuzheng,

170
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:38,000
here is the thing. I got sick,

171
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,320
and Xiangyuan...

172
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,479
I don't know

173
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
what would happen to him.

174
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:48,280
If one day

175
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,840
I can't hold it anymore...

176
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,440
Uncle Jiang,

177
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,520
don't say that.

178
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,719
You will be fine.

179
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,039
If I suddenly pass away one day,

180
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,760
please help me take care of Fanlv.

181
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,440
You two grew up together after all.

182
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,200
Uncle Jiang,

183
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:37,119
no matter when,

184
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,400
I will take care of her

185
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,239
like my own sister.

186
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,559
Please don't worry.

187
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,679
As for Xiangyuan,

188
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,880
I have already
arranged a lawyer for him.

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,440
That's a relief.

190
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,080
Yuzheng,

191
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,960
you are really

192
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,000
like your dad.

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,880
You can get over with
what happened before

194
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:06,559
and still treat him so well.

195
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,119
I really appreciate it.

196
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,479
Uncle Jiang,

197
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,159
the past belongs to the past.

198
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,559
Let's not talk about it anymore.

199
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,599
Please rest well.

200
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,359
You still have me.

201
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,599
OK.

202
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,440
When people are sick,

203
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,719
they get very weak.

204
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,719
My dad is getting better after you came.

205
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,479
Yuzheng, thank you.

206
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,840
We are like families

207
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,559
and you don't need to thank me.

208
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,640
Also for Xiangyuan,

209
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I appreciate it.

210
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,479
Don't worry.

211
00:12:50,599 --> 00:12:52,599
I've found the best lawyer for him.

212
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
Take good care of yourself.

213
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,080
That's the best comfort

214
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,799
for your dad and Lin Xiangyuan.

215
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,799
After going through so many things,

216
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:02,039
I feel that I've grown up.

217
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,479
I will take care of myself.

218
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,799
It's just you.

219
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,520
How are you and Du Xiaosu

220
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,039
doing?

221
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,479
I almost forgot.

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,039
I asked her out for dinner tonight.

223
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,039
Then you should leave now.

224
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,719
Sorry for interrupting your date.

225
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,239
OK.

226
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,559
I'll leave now.

227
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,000
Drive safely.

228
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,760
Xiaosu,

229
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
I had some emergency last night

231
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,599
and I couldn't make it.

232
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,039
Come on in.

233
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,679
What's wrong?

234
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,479
Are you mad at me?

235
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,640
Mad?

236
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:49,960
Am I that calculating?

237
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,919
Do you know who

238
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:55,760
asked me out yesterday?

239
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,719
Who?

240
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,239
Ning Weicheng.

241
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,640
Why did he ask you out?

242
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,599
He offered me a huge project.

243
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,159
That's great.

244
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,760
How did the thing go?

245
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,400
It went pretty well.

246
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,159
Mr. Ning also seemed very sincere.

247
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,880
But I turned it down.

248
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,080
You turned it down?

249
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,880
Why?

250
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,200
What he plans to do is
an environment-friendly

251
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,960
building based on
sustainability concepts.

252
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:23,239
Isn't that what you've been looking for?

253
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,239
I haven't spoken of the details yet.

254
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,599
How did you know what it's about?

255
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,719
When will you stop lying to me about it?

256
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
Alright.

257
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,599
I admit that

258
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:40,640
I did want to help.

259
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,840
Lei Yuzheng,

260
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,359
why can't you understand?

261
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,400
I could even drink until throwing up

262
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,239
just for some cheap tips at that time.

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,200
Now, it's the same.

264
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,359
For my studio,

265
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,239
I can work hard

266
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,239
and try my best to earn money.

267
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:52,520
Xiaosu,

268
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,479
is your persistency that important?

269
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,760
Yes.

270
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,400
It's such a great project.

271
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,200
Any designer would not

272
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,719
turn it down.

273
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,599
You said "any designer".

274
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,919
But I'm not "any designer".

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm just me.

276
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,159
I'm Du Xiaosu.

277
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
I'm tired.

278
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,080
You should leave now.

311
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:14,359
Thanks.

Oh, there's another important thing.

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,599
What is it?

314
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Here you go.

315
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,839
I've got you an amulet

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,640
which can protect

317
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760

Siqi,

320
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
I've been thinking that

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,719
I have very different background,

322
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,800
thoughts, and experience

323
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,199
from him.

324
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Xiaosu, you are just thinking too much.

325
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,119
There's no right or wrong.

326
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,280
If everything is the same for you two,

327
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,880
it would be boring.

328
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,199
Look at me and He Qunfei.

329
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,680
We are also different,

330
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,959
but we have no problem being together.

331
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,439
Mr. Liu.

332
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,719
Congratulations, Xiaosu.

333
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,640
Congratulations?

334
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,079
For what?

335
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
I couldn't keep it from you.

336
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,079
Although tomorrow morning,

337
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,680
you would receive the notification
from the committee,

338
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,959
I still can't wait

339
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,079
to tell you that

340
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:18,040
your work was selected.

341
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,439
You can go to Paris!

342
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,119
Thank you!

343
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,079
What?

344
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,280
Mr. Liu called me to tell that

345
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,760
my work was selected

346
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,560
and I would go to Paris
for the competition.

347
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,199
Competition?

348
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:36,880
What competition?

349
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,000
How come I didn't know?

350
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,719
Young Architect Competition,

351
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,199
the one I've always
wanted to participate.

352
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,959
That's awesome, Du Xiaosu!

353
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,239
You would become a big designer soon!

354
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,319
But now, I'm still a little hesitating.

355
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,079
You don't want to
be apart from him, right?

356
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,160
Having such kind of feeling means that

357
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:02,000
you still care a lot about Lei Yuzheng.

358
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,439
He doesn't know that
you are going to Paris, right?

359
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,640
It's my own thing.

360
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,040
It has nothing to do with him.

361
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,040
Let me ask you.

362
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
If

363
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,920
you don't go to this competition,

364
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
are you going to regret it?

365
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:17,040
If I don't go to this competition,

366
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,719
I might regret for my whole life.

367
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,680
But if you leave without

368
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:23,040
telling Lei Yuzheng,

369
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,239
he would be sad for his whole life.

370
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,560
If being apart can kill this love,

371
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,040
this relationship

372
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,319
is not strong enough.

373
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,920
But timing is also important for love.

374
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,959
Once you miss it,
it will be gone forever.

375
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,719
If you decide to leave Shanghai,

376
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:43,439
before you go,

377
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,000
don't you want to
explain everything to him?

378
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,040
Listen to me.

379
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,719
You can only sort it out
after having conversation.

380
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,160
Otherwise, even if you get to Paris,

381
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,400
you still can't let go of
what happened here.

382
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,359
Mr. Lei.

383
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,560
Mr. Lei.

384
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
Manager He,

385
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:09,839
you are already at management position.

386
00:22:10,239 --> 00:22:11,680
How come you are still
acting so hastily all the time?

387
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,359
It's so worth celebrating

388
00:22:13,479 --> 00:22:14,880
that I have to tell you right away.

389
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,040
What is it?

390
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Du Xiaosu is going to Paris.

391
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,640
I know that she's going to Paris

392
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,400
on a business trip.

393
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:27,599
No.

394
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,319
She participated in

395
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:31,839
Young Architect Competition.

396
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,959
The result came out and

397
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:35,280
her work was selected.

398
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,199
Mr. Lei,

399
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:38,839
it's surprising to see

400
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:41,760
that she's actually very capable.

401
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,199
Mr. Lei.

402
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,319
Mr... Mr. Lei.

403
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:48,719
Mr... Mr. Lei.

404
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
Have you decided to leave?

405
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,359
Yes.

406
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,319
If today

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,520
I didn't come to see you,

408
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,160
are you planning to leave
without saying goodbye?

409
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,119
Actually, a long time ago,

410
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,800
there were many things
I wanted to tell you.

411
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,119
Although we have fought
and argued with each other

412
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,439
while we were together,

413
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,599
I really cherish the time with you.

414
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,800
Is this some kind of goodbye speech?

415
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,959
If I have a second chance...

416
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,680
If you have a second chance,

417
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,640
what would you do?

418
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,199
I would let go.

419
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:05,959
What if I'm not letting go?

420
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,880
The studio has had many
difficulties recently.

421
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,719
Maybe changing the environment

422
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,719
by going to Paris

423
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,760
can give me what I want.

424
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Xiaosu, have you thought about it?

425
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,439
If you want to be

426
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,000
a great architect,

427
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,599
there are many friends
around me who are experts.

428
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,520
You can tell me

429
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,880
and I will ask them to help you.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,079
Lei Yuzheng,

431
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,239
our life tracks

432
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,520
are very different
from the very beginning.

433
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,760
We are like two parallel lines

434
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,479
that can never meet.

435
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,880
If you don't want to see me sad,

436
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,439
and if you don't want me
to feel overwhelmed,

437
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,079
please let me go.

438
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:11,744
♪Your love weeps for a withered soul♪

439
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,008
♪That teardrop of sadness
brings extreme beauty♪

440
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:25,920
♪Indulging in the black
whirlpool of your eyes♪

441
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,960
♪Dreams have never been this quiet♪

442
00:26:02,464 --> 00:26:03,904
(The new founder, Lei Yuzheng)

443
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Have you made up your mind?

444
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,359
Yes.

445
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:56,479
If I keep thinking,
I won't be able to leave.

446
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,280
But are you really willing
be apart from Lei Yuzheng?

447
00:27:00,239 --> 00:27:01,560
Why not?

448
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,239
His life is full of possibilities,

449
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,800
but I

450
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,680
only got this one.

451
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,800
But love is unique.

452
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,719
Xiaosu,

453
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
do you really love Lei Yuzheng or not?

454
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,719
Yuzheng.

455
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,239
Uncle Duan.

456
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,839
When people get old, they sleep less.

457
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,079
I'm here to drink with you.

458
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,119
How come I haven't
seen Miss Du for a while?

459
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:55,119
She said that

460
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,199
she is going to Paris.

461
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,040
That's alright.

462
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,239
It's good that she's not going to Mars.

463
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,160
It's just France.

464
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,160
Uncle Duan,

465
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,920
when you were young,

466
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,719
have you been in love?

467
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,520
Did you have arguments with her?

468
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
Uncle Duan,

469
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,119
managing a relationship is a lot more

470
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,839
difficult than I imagined.

471
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,079
I used to think that I'm strong,

472
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:36,959
but now I begin to feel that

473
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,839
I'm just a coward

474
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,199
when it comes to relationship.

475
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,079
I can do many things
for her without telling her,

476
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,560
but I don't have the courage to

477
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:49,880
tell her that I love her
in front of her.

478
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,680
Kid,

479
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,800
the gap between people

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,479
is like the ice in this glass of wine.

481
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,479
It can't melt right away.

482
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,040
You need to hold it

483
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,680
and warm it up slowly.

484
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,599
Then it would melt in the end.

485
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,280
After that, you can taste it

486
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:18,839
and you can taste the layers

487
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,079
that make it a good wine.

488
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:22,959
Uncle Duan,

489
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,800
I know what you are saying.

490
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Actually,

491
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,959
I don't mind

492
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,079
any gap with her.

493
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,040
I just hope that

494
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,680
she can pursue the life she likes.

495
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:36,959
Yuzheng,

496
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:40,760
there's something that you may not know.

497
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,839
Wanhua passed away so early.

498
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,640
But look at your dad.

499
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,400
The feeling he had for her

500
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,839
has never disappeared.

501
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,560
In this world,

502
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,359
what makes people regret the most

503
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,520
is nothing

504
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,400
but

505
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,760
missed destiny and people.

506
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:06,760
Yuzheng,

507
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,239
come on.

508
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,520
Let's have a drink.

509
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
Cheers!

510
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,959
Cheers.

511
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,728
(Teacher Sun)

512
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,880
Teacher Sun,

513
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,319
are you doing good with the kids?

514
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,880
Yes, Xiaosu.

515
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:51,520
Shanwa, Doudou and Mei

516
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,119
all miss you and Yuzheng.

517
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,160
They kept asking me

518
00:30:54,239 --> 00:30:55,199
when you and Yuzheng

519
00:30:55,239 --> 00:30:56,439
will visit us again.

520
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,280
I will be gone for a while,

521
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,680
and before I leave,

522
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,119
I want to visit you and the kids.

523
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,520
Are you going on a business trip?

524
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,599
Sounds good. When do you plan to come?

525
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,199
How about the day after tomorrow?

526
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,119
OK. That's fantastic!

527
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,760
Is Yuzheng coming with you?

528
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,479
He...

529
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,280
He is quite busy these days.
He just returned to the

530
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,719
company and he's busy
dealing with many things.

531
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,959
So I will be visiting you by myself.

532
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,239
By yourself?

533
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,520
OK.

534
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,520
But I hope that

535
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,400
you two can come together
some other time.

536
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
We will for sure.

537
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,199
OK, see you soon.

538
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,839
OK, see you the day after tomorrow! Bye.

539
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,199
Xiaosu,

540
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,599
Yuzheng sent all these

541
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,079
and these,

542
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,439
and the projector

543
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,119
and many other stuff.

544
00:32:33,219 --> 00:32:34,956
(Wish you all the best in your studies.
Lei Yuzheng)

545
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:45,940
(Wish you all the best in your studies.
Lei Yuzheng)

546
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,079
Xiaosu,

547
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,439
you and Yuzheng

548
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,479
have done so much

549
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,280
for kids and the school.

550
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,520
Now you are even preparing for
the Xiaosu Foundation.

551
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,680
I really don't know

552
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,119
how to thank you.

553
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,199
Foundation?

554
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:01,079
Yes.

555
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,920
I heard from people at the Foundation

556
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,160
they will hire more volunteers

557
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,199
and collect more donation

558
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,719
to help the kids on the island.

559
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
Next year,

560
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:14,119
when you come back from abroad,

561
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,119
the new building will be completed.

562
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
There will be more teachers,

563
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,199
and more kids can go to school then.

564
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,319
All the people on the island
are saying that

565
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,239
it's all thanks to you and Yuzheng.

566
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,319
What did you say

567
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,280
the name of the foundation

568
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,280
was?

569
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,400
It was named after you.

570
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,880
It's called Xiaosu Foundation.

571
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:36,839
How come you didn't know it?

572
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,079
Maybe Yuzheng is hiding from you

573
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,199
and not telling you.

574
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:05,560
Du Xiaosu,

575
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:08,040
happy birthday.

576
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Are you starving?

577
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:49,560
What are you doing there?

578
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,280
Come here.

579
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:33,080
Star Island at this moment

580
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,239
is so pretty.

581
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:43,320
Xiaosu,

582
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,159
you are not here to see the ocean.

583
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,239
You miss me, right?

584
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:57,120
Stop being a narcissist.
No one misses you.

585
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,760
I'm here for a walk.

586
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,399
Is it?

587
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,399
You should be happy to have a walk.

588
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,959
Why are you frowning?

589
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,760
Who's frowning?

590
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,879
Even if I look unhappy,

591
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,040
it's because

592
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,760
I don't want to be apart from the kids.

593
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,840
Is it really because of the kids?

594
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,879
What else?

595
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,239
Who else would I miss?

596
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:37,639
What about you?

597
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,159
What are you waiting for here?

598
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:43,239
Are you waiting for the sunset?

599
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Yes.

600
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,959
I'm waiting for the sunset.

601
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,040
I want to watch the sunset

602
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,159
together with the person I like.

603
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,879
Du Xiaosu,

604
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,679
ever since I met you,

605
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,360
I figured out that

606
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,239
love is so simple,

607
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,560
and even ordinary.

608
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,600
All I want is to

609
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,919
simply spend

610
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,199
my whole life with you like right now.

611
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,000
With no worries,

612
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,120
I hold your hands

613
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,840
and we watch the sunrise
and sunset at Star Island.

614
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,600
You don't have to make
any sacrifice for me anymore.

615
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,399
You don't have to betray
your inner thoughts.

616
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Because I will make changes for you.

617
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,360
If you want to stay in Shanghai,

618
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,840
I will stay in Shanghai with you.

619
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,639
If you want to go to Paris,

620
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:05,560
I will wait for you here.

621
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,399
From now on, no matter where you go,

622
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,120
I will follow you

623
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:17,679
to the world

624
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:19,760
from where I am.

625
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,399
Xiaosu,

626
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,040
take my hand.

627
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,439
Give me the chance to take care of you

628
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,959
for the whole life,

629
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,199
OK?

630
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:49,040
Are you going to be so harsh
on yourself for your whole life?

631
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,239
Yes, I do.
