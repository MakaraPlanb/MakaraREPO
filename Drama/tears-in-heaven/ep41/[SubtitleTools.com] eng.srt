17
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,039
Mr. Lei,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,479
on behalf of Yutian's staff,

19
00:01:58,639 --> 00:01:59,839
I welcome you back.

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:03,720
Qunfei,

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,880
where is Xiangyuan?

22
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:07,679
Xiang...

23
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,199
Mr. Lin...

24
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,080
Uncle Jiang,

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,119
when did Xiangyuan turn himself in?

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
In fact,

27
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,279
Xiangyuan never intended to stay.

28
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,119
He knows

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,679
that the Entertainment Center Project
is the work of you and Mr. Lei Senior.

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,000
During this time,

31
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,919
he has been trying his best

32
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,399
to arrange the restart of the project

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
properly.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,119
Uncle Jiang,

35
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,279
you should keep him.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,399
He left like this.

37
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,679
Does Fanlv know?

38
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,520
She knows.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,960
Yuzheng,

40
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:53,720
don't hesitate to come back.

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,399
Yutian needs you.

42
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,199
The Entertainment Center
Project needs you.

43
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,600
We all need you.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
I will keep this room

45
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,679
for Xiangyuan.

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,639
I want to thank you for Xiangyuan.

47
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,080
The shareholders are all
in the meeting room.

48
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,639
Let's go.

49
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:25,919
Come.

50
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,679
Xiaosu,

51
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,639
thank you for the design
you made for my friend.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,479
You don't need to thank me.

53
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,800
It's my pleasure.

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,639
Thank you.

55
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,320
Mr. Liu,

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,799
I'm very sorry for
what happened last time.

57
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,760
Sorry.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,839
Do you mean

59
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,320
last time when we had meals?

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I've forgot about it.

61
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,239
How are you two doing now?

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,600
Is everything OK?

63
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,799
Let's skip this topic.

64
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,760
Xiaosu, I'm older than you.

65
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,000
There's something I want to tell you.

66
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,359
Actually, there's an imagined enemy

67
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:06,519
in every man's heart.

68
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,559
But if this imagined enemy

69
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
can keep your love
long-lasting and lively,

70
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,480
the meal I bought you
was not for nothing.

71
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,600
Xiaosu,

72
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
actually, I'm calling today

73
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
to tell you something else.

74
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,920
Do you know the Young Architect Competition?

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,079
Of course I know about it.

76
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,239
I've always wanted to participate.

77
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,440
Has it already started for this year?

78
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,679
I've been so busy these days

79
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
and I almost forgot about it.

80
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,959
Yes. I have a friend who is

81
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:35,279
the judge.

82
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,119
When he mentioned it to me,

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,239
you were the first
that came into my mind.

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,320
I want you to participate.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,320
I heard that the winner can go to Paris

86
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,440
to study for one year.

87
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,760
I think it might be
a great opportunity for you.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,079
But I've been so busy these days

89
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,640
and I'm afraid that I won't have time.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,640
Xiaosu,

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,920
I know that it's difficult for you.

92
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,279
But do you know
who leads the team this year?

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,640
It's your idol, Professor Ohm.

94
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,920
Professor Ohm? Seriously?

95
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,320
Don't worry.

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,480
There's still time before the deadline.

97
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:11,920
You can still think about it.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
OK.

99
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,480
I will think about it.

100
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:18,920
Bye.

101
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:46,880
Come on in.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,799
Xiaosu, have a seat.

103
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,839
Mr. Ning, why did you call me?

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,399
Here.

105
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,480
Check out this contract first.

106
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,799
If you are willing to
collaborate with us,

107
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,359
please sign here

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,399
and the contract will
become effective immediately.

(Party A: Yutian Group)

111
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,920
The pricing is all written there.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,239
I'm sure that you will be satisfied
with the pricing this time.

113
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,679
Thank you for your trust,

114
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,480
but I'm afraid that

115
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,040
I can't accept it.

116
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,279
Why?

117
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,880
Do you think the project
is not good enough?

118
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,880
Or you are not satisfied with the price?

119
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
It's a great project

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,359
with good pricing.

121
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,559
But

122
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,839
I can't accept it.

123
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,480
Why?

124
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,399
It's because of me.

125
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,920
I don't want to

126
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,040
collaborate with Yutian.

127
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,000
I see what you mean.

128
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,839
It's not Yutian that
you don't want to collaborate with.

129
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,000
It's Mr. Lei

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
that you don't want to come across.

131
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,279
But you need to think it through.

132
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,880
Relationship is relationship,

133
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,600
while work is work.

134
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,640
Mr. Ning,

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,200
I really appreciate you told me these.

136
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:15,760
But

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,679
I hope that I can achieve my goals

138
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,200
through my own efforts,

139
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,519
one step at a time.

140
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,880
Hope you can understand.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,440
Goodbye.

142
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,920
Do you have time tonight?

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Let's meet up.

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,559
Miss, would you like to order anything?

145
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,880
Excuse me, give me a moment.

146
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,080
OK.

147
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:39,784

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Fanlv, what is it?

150
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,880
(The number you have dialed
is currently busy.)

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,239
(Please dial it again later.)

(Du Xiaosu)

153
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,960
What happened to Uncle Jiang?

154
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,719
Maybe what happened to Xiangyuan

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,640
caused his heart attack.

156
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,840
Can you come here now?

157
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,440
He wants to tell you something.

158
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,119
OK, I will be right there.

159
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,688
(Du Xiaosu)

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
Yuzheng is here.

161
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Uncle Jiang,

162
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,479
do you feel better now?

163
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:46,119
I'm getting older and weaker.

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,599
The doctor just stopped by

165
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,640
and my dad is doing okay now.

166
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,559
Uncle Jiang,

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
what did you want to tell me?

168
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,799
You can say it now.

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Yuzheng,

170
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:03,000
here is the thing. I got sick,

171
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
and Xiangyuan...

172
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,479
I don't know

173
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
what would happen to him.

174
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,280
If one day

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,840
I can't hold it anymore...

176
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:17,440
Uncle Jiang,

177
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,520
don't say that.

178
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,719
You will be fine.

179
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,039
If I suddenly pass away one day,

180
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,760
please help me take care of Fanlv.

181
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:57,440
You two grew up together after all.

182
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,200
Uncle Jiang,

183
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:02,119
no matter when,

184
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,400
I will take care of her

185
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,239
like my own sister.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,559
Please don't worry.

187
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,679
As for Xiangyuan,

188
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,880
I have already
arranged a lawyer for him.

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,440
That's a relief.

190
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,080
Yuzheng,

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,960
you are really

192
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,000
like your dad.

193
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,880
You can get over with
what happened before

194
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,559
and still treat him so well.

195
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,119
I really appreciate it.

196
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:37,479
Uncle Jiang,

197
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,159
the past belongs to the past.

198
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,559
Let's not talk about it anymore.

199
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,599
Please rest well.

200
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,359
You still have me.

201
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:48,599
OK.

202
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
When people are sick,

203
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,719
they get very weak.

204
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,719
My dad is getting better after you came.

205
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,479
Yuzheng, thank you.

206
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,840
We are like families

207
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,559
and you don't need to thank me.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,640
Also for Xiangyuan,

209
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
I appreciate it.

210
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,479
Don't worry.

211
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:17,599
I've found the best lawyer for him.

212
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,320
Take good care of yourself.

213
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:21,080
That's the best comfort

214
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,799
for your dad and Lin Xiangyuan.

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,799
After going through so many things,

216
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,039
I feel that I've grown up.

217
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,479
I will take care of myself.

218
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,799
It's just you.

219
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:32,520
How are you and Du Xiaosu

220
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,039
doing?

221
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,479
I almost forgot.

222
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,039
I asked her out for dinner tonight.

223
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,039
Then you should leave now.

224
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,719
Sorry for interrupting your date.

225
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,239
OK.

226
00:12:44,599 --> 00:12:45,559
I'll leave now.

227
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,000
Drive safely.

228
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Xiaosu,

229
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,400
I had some emergency last night

231
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,599
and I couldn't make it.

232
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,039
Come on in.

233
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:08,679
What's wrong?

234
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,479
Are you mad at me?

235
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,640
Mad?

236
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,960
Am I that calculating?

237
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,919
Do you know who

238
00:14:19,239 --> 00:14:20,760
asked me out yesterday?

239
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,719
Who?

240
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:24,239
Ning Weicheng.

241
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,640
Why did he ask you out?

242
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,599
He offered me a huge project.

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,159
That's great.

244
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,760
How did the thing go?

245
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
It went pretty well.

246
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,159
Mr. Ning also seemed very sincere.

247
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:39,880
But I turned it down.

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
You turned it down?

249
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,880
Why?

250
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:44,200
What he plans to do is
an environment-friendly

251
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,960
building based on
sustainability concepts.

252
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:48,239
Isn't that what you've been looking for?

253
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,239
I haven't spoken of the details yet.

254
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,599
How did you know what it's about?

255
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,719
When will you stop lying to me about it?

256
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,280
Alright.

257
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,599
I admit that

258
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,640
I did want to help.

259
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,840
Lei Yuzheng,

260
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,359
why can't you understand?

261
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,400
I could even drink until throwing up

262
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,239
just for some cheap tips at that time.

263
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,200
Now, it's the same.

264
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,359
For my studio,

265
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,239
I can work hard

266
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,239
and try my best to earn money.

267
00:15:16,359 --> 00:15:17,520
Xiaosu,

268
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,479
is your persistency that important?

269
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:20,760
Yes.

270
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,400
It's such a great project.

271
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,200
Any designer would not

272
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,719
turn it down.

273
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,599
You said "any designer".

274
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,919
But I'm not "any designer".

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm just me.

276
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,159
I'm Du Xiaosu.

277
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm tired.

278
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
You should leave now.

311
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,359
Thanks.

Oh, there's another important thing.

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,599
What is it?

314
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Here you go.

315
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,839
I've got you an amulet

which can protect

00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,760

Siqi,

320
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,160
I've been thinking that

321
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,719
I have very different background,

322
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,800
thoughts, and experience

323
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,199
from him.

324
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,280
Xiaosu, you are just thinking too much.

325
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,119
There's no right or wrong.

326
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:12,280
If everything is the same for you two,

327
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,880
it would be boring.

328
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,199
Look at me and He Qunfei.

329
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,680
We are also different,

330
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:19,959
but we have no problem being together.

331
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,439
Mr. Liu.

332
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,719
Congratulations, Xiaosu.

333
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,640
Congratulations?

334
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,079
For what?

335
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
I couldn't keep it from you.

336
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,079
Although tomorrow morning,

337
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,680
you would receive the notification
from the committee,

338
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,959
I still can't wait

339
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,079
to tell you that

340
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,040
your work was selected.

341
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,439
You can go to Paris!

342
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,119
Thank you!

343
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:54,079
What?

344
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,280
Mr. Liu called me to tell that

345
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
my work was selected

346
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,560
and I would go to Paris
for the competition.

347
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,199
Competition?

348
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:01,880
What competition?

349
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,000
How come I didn't know?

350
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,719
Young Architect Competition,

351
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:09,199
the one I've always
wanted to participate.

352
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,959
That's awesome, Du Xiaosu!

353
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,239
You would become a big designer soon!

354
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,319
But now, I'm still a little hesitating.

355
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,079
You don't want to
be apart from him, right?

356
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:24,160
Having such kind of feeling means that

357
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:27,000
you still care a lot about Lei Yuzheng.

358
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,439
He doesn't know that
you are going to Paris, right?

359
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,640
It's my own thing.

360
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,040
It has nothing to do with him.

361
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,040
Let me ask you.

362
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
If

363
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,920
you don't go to this competition,

364
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
are you going to regret it?

365
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,040
If I don't go to this competition,

366
00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:44,719
I might regret for my whole life.

367
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,680
But if you leave without

368
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,040
telling Lei Yuzheng,

369
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,239
he would be sad for his whole life.

370
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:54,560
If being apart can kill this love,

371
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,040
this relationship

372
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,319
is not strong enough.

373
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,920
But timing is also important for love.

374
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,959
Once you miss it,
it will be gone forever.

375
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,719
If you decide to leave Shanghai,

376
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,439
before you go,

377
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,000
don't you want to
explain everything to him?

378
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,040
Listen to me.

379
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,719
You can only sort it out
after having conversation.

380
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,160
Otherwise, even if you get to Paris,

381
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,400
you still can't let go of
what happened here.

382
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,359
Mr. Lei.

383
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,560
Mr. Lei.

384
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,000
Manager He,

385
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,839
you are already at management position.

386
00:21:35,239 --> 00:21:36,680
How come you are still
acting so hastily all the time?

387
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,359
It's so worth celebrating

388
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:39,880
that I have to tell you right away.

389
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,040
What is it?

390
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Du Xiaosu is going to Paris.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,640
I know that she's going to Paris

392
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:51,400
on a business trip.

393
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,599
No.

394
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,319
She participated in

395
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,839
Young Architect Competition.

396
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,959
The result came out and

397
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,280
her work was selected.

398
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,199
Mr. Lei,

399
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,839
it's surprising to see

400
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,760
that she's actually very capable.

401
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,199
Mr. Lei.

402
00:22:12,719 --> 00:22:13,319
Mr... Mr. Lei.

403
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:13,719
Mr... Mr. Lei.

404
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,520
Have you decided to leave?

405
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,359
Yes.

406
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,319
If today

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
I didn't come to see you,

408
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,160
are you planning to leave
without saying goodbye?

409
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,119
Actually, a long time ago,

410
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,800
there were many things
I wanted to tell you.

411
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,119
Although we have fought
and argued with each other

412
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:00,439
while we were together,

413
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:03,599
I really cherish the time with you.

414
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,800
Is this some kind of goodbye speech?

415
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,959
If I have a second chance...

416
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,680
If you have a second chance,

417
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,640
what would you do?

418
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,199
I would let go.

419
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:30,959
What if I'm not letting go?

420
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,880
The studio has had many
difficulties recently.

421
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,719
Maybe changing the environment

422
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,719
by going to Paris

423
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,760
can give me what I want.

424
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,280
Xiaosu, have you thought about it?

425
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,439
If you want to be

426
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,000
a great architect,

427
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,599
there are many friends
around me who are experts.

428
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,520
You can tell me

429
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,880
and I will ask them to help you.

430
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,079
Lei Yuzheng,

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,239
our life tracks

432
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,520
are very different
from the very beginning.

433
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,760
We are like two parallel lines

434
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,479
that can never meet.

435
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,880
If you don't want to see me sad,

436
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,439
and if you don't want me
to feel overwhelmed,

437
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,079
please let me go.

438
00:24:30,024 --> 00:24:36,744
♪Your love weeps for a withered soul♪

439
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:44,008
♪That teardrop of sadness
brings extreme beauty♪

440
00:24:44,104 --> 00:24:50,920
♪Indulging in the black
whirlpool of your eyes♪

441
00:24:51,016 --> 00:24:57,960
♪Dreams have never been this quiet♪

442
00:25:27,464 --> 00:25:28,904
(The new founder, Lei Yuzheng)

443
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,760
Have you made up your mind?

444
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:17,359
Yes.

445
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,479
If I keep thinking,
I won't be able to leave.

446
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,280
But are you really willing
be apart from Lei Yuzheng?

447
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:26,560
Why not?

448
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,239
His life is full of possibilities,

449
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
but I

450
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,680
only got this one.

451
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,800
But love is unique.

452
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,719
Xiaosu,

453
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,160
do you really love Lei Yuzheng or not?

454
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,719
Yuzheng.

455
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,239
Uncle Duan.

456
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,839
When people get old, they sleep less.

457
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,079
I'm here to drink with you.

458
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,119
How come I haven't
seen Miss Du for a while?

459
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,119
She said that

460
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,199
she is going to Paris.

461
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,040
That's alright.

462
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,239
It's good that she's not going to Mars.

463
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,160
It's just France.

464
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,160
Uncle Duan,

465
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,920
when you were young,

466
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,719
have you been in love?

467
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,520
Did you have arguments with her?

468
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Uncle Duan,

469
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,119
managing a relationship is a lot more

470
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:56,839
difficult than I imagined.

471
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,079
I used to think that I'm strong,

472
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,959
but now I begin to feel that

473
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,839
I'm just a coward

474
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,199
when it comes to relationship.

475
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,079
I can do many things
for her without telling her,

476
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,560
but I don't have the courage to

477
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,880
tell her that I love her
in front of her.

478
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Kid,

479
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,800
the gap between people

480
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,479
is like the ice in this glass of wine.

481
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,479
It can't melt right away.

482
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
You need to hold it

483
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,680
and warm it up slowly.

484
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,599
Then it would melt in the end.

485
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,280
After that, you can taste it

486
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,839
and you can taste the layers

487
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,079
that make it a good wine.

488
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:47,959
Uncle Duan,

489
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,800
I know what you are saying.

490
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,040
Actually,

491
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,959
I don't mind

492
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,079
any gap with her.

493
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,040
I just hope that

494
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,680
she can pursue the life she likes.

495
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:01,959
Yuzheng,

496
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,760
there's something that you may not know.

497
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:07,839
Wanhua passed away so early.

498
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,640
But look at your dad.

499
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,400
The feeling he had for her

500
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,839
has never disappeared.

501
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,560
In this world,

502
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,359
what makes people regret the most

503
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,520
is nothing

504
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:24,400
but

505
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,760
missed destiny and people.

506
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,760
Yuzheng,

507
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,239
come on.

508
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:36,520
Let's have a drink.

509
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Cheers!

510
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,959
Cheers.

511
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:06,728
(Teacher Sun)

512
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,880
Teacher Sun,

513
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,319
are you doing good with the kids?

514
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,880
Yes, Xiaosu.

515
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,520
Shanwa, Doudou and Mei

516
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,119
all miss you and Yuzheng.

517
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,160
They kept asking me

518
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,199
when you and Yuzheng

519
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,439
will visit us again.

520
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,280
I will be gone for a while,

521
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,680
and before I leave,

522
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,119
I want to visit you and the kids.

523
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,520
Are you going on a business trip?

524
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:33,599
Sounds good. When do you plan to come?

525
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,199
How about the day after tomorrow?

526
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,119
OK. That's fantastic!

527
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,760
Is Yuzheng coming with you?

528
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,479
He...

529
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,280
He is quite busy these days.
He just returned to the

530
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,719
company and he's busy
dealing with many things.

531
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:49,959
So I will be visiting you by myself.

532
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,239
By yourself?

533
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,520
OK.

534
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,520
But I hope that

535
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,400
you two can come together
some other time.

536
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
We will for sure.

537
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,199
OK, see you soon.

538
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,839
OK, see you the day after tomorrow! Bye.

539
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,199
Xiaosu,

540
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,599
Yuzheng sent all these

541
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,079
and these,

542
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,439
and the projector

543
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,119
and many other stuff.

544
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,956
(Wish you all the best in your studies.
Lei Yuzheng)

545
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:10,940
(Wish you all the best in your studies.
Lei Yuzheng)

546
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,079
Xiaosu,

547
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,439
you and Yuzheng

548
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,479
have done so much

549
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,280
for kids and the school.

550
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,520
Now you are even preparing for
the Xiaosu Foundation.

551
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,680
I really don't know

552
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:22,119
how to thank you.

553
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,199
Foundation?

554
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,079
Yes.

555
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,920
I heard from people at the Foundation

556
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,160
they will hire more volunteers

557
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,199
and collect more donation

558
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,719
to help the kids on the island.

559
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,520
Next year,

560
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,119
when you come back from abroad,

561
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,119
the new building will be completed.

562
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,640
There will be more teachers,

563
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,199
and more kids can go to school then.

564
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,319
All the people on the island
are saying that

565
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,239
it's all thanks to you and Yuzheng.

566
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,319
What did you say

567
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
the name of the foundation

568
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:55,280
was?

569
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,400
It was named after you.

570
00:32:57,959 --> 00:32:59,880
It's called Xiaosu Foundation.

571
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,839
How come you didn't know it?

572
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,079
Maybe Yuzheng is hiding from you

573
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,199
and not telling you.

574
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,560
Du Xiaosu,

575
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,040
happy birthday.

576
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Are you starving?

577
00:34:13,439 --> 00:34:14,560
What are you doing there?

578
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,280
Come here.

579
00:34:56,439 --> 00:34:58,080
Star Island at this moment

580
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,239
is so pretty.

581
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:08,320
Xiaosu,

582
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,159
you are not here to see the ocean.

583
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:16,239
You miss me, right?

584
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:22,120
Stop being a narcissist.
No one misses you.

585
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,760
I'm here for a walk.

586
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:27,399
Is it?

587
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,399
You should be happy to have a walk.

588
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,959
Why are you frowning?

589
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
Who's frowning?

590
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,879
Even if I look unhappy,

591
00:35:38,919 --> 00:35:40,040
it's because

592
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,760
I don't want to be apart from the kids.

593
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,840
Is it really because of the kids?

594
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,879
What else?

595
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,239
Who else would I miss?

596
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:02,639
What about you?

597
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,159
What are you waiting for here?

598
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,239
Are you waiting for the sunset?

599
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Yes.

600
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,959
I'm waiting for the sunset.

601
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:22,040
I want to watch the sunset

602
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:24,159
together with the person I like.

603
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,879
Du Xiaosu,

604
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,679
ever since I met you,

605
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,360
I figured out that

606
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,239
love is so simple,

607
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,560
and even ordinary.

608
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,600
All I want is to

609
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:57,919
simply spend

610
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,199
my whole life with you like right now.

611
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,000
With no worries,

612
00:37:01,959 --> 00:37:03,120
I hold your hands

613
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,840
and we watch the sunrise
and sunset at Star Island.

614
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,600
You don't have to make
any sacrifice for me anymore.

615
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,399
You don't have to betray
your inner thoughts.

616
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Because I will make changes for you.

617
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,360
If you want to stay in Shanghai,

618
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,840
I will stay in Shanghai with you.

619
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,639
If you want to go to Paris,

620
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,560
I will wait for you here.

621
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,399
From now on, no matter where you go,

622
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,120
I will follow you

623
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:42,679
to the world

624
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:44,760
from where I am.

625
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,399
Xiaosu,

626
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,040
take my hand.

627
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,439
Give me the chance to take care of you

628
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,959
for the whole life,

629
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,199
OK?

630
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:14,040
Are you going to be so harsh
on yourself for your whole life?

631
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,239
Yes, I do.
