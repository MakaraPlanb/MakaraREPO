=Episode 16=

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,839
Excuse me, how much is this?

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,039
Two thousand yuan.

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,279
Two thousand yuan?

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,080
So expensive!

20
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,720
Aren't there many stores that

21
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,039
sell pearls on this island?

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,600
Why are your pearls so expensive?

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Many pearls are available
on this island.

24
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,520
But you never see such a big one.

25
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,759
It is so round

26
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,279
and natural.

27
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,600
These pearls were obtained

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,399
from the deep sea by my uncle.

29
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,880
I cannot bargain at will.

30
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:45,679
It's still too expensive.
Can you give me a discount?

31
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,320
The price is not high on this island.

32
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
If you buy this from a store
in a big city,

33
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:52,399
it will definitely cost you
more than twenty thousand yuan.

34
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,639
No. It's still too expensive.
I will not take it.

35
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,399
Take it or leave it.

36
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,759
Leave it if you have no money.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,399
Siqi, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
I shouldn't have lied to you.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,479
I have made it clear with my parents,

40
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,160
and they understand it.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,039
Just forget it.

42
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,759
We pretend that it did not happen, OK?

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,399
Shangguan.

44
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:32,880
Let's go.

45
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:34,800
Be careful.

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,880
Thank you.

47
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:37,520
Shangguan Boyao.

48
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,880
Just stop drinking.

49
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,199
It's not a big deal.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,119
I'm always obedient to her.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,359
I admit I'm not very well off.

52
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:19,399
But she should not cheat on me.

53
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:24,920
In fact, Siqi is not quite realistic.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,519
She just wants a place to settle down.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,640
I've really strived for the apartment.

56
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,920
I asked Mr. Lei for the discount

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,000
of the apartment before,

58
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,640
but he refused.

59
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
If I have an apartment now,

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,720
Siqi might have married me long ago?

61
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,880
Mr. Lei turned you down?

62
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,440
Isn't it a discount?

63
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,040
It is easy for him.

64
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,679
You've been his assistant
for so many years,

65
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,079
and he won't even lift a finger.

66
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,160
Mr. Lei is a man of principle,

67
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,359
and he is so heartless.

68
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,119
I'm not successful,

69
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:11,880
not to blame Mr. Lei.

70
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,359
Run slowly.

71
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,079
Get down.

72
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,359
Alright.

73
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,640
Let's say goodbye.

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,359
Mei,

75
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,320
listen to Teacher Sun from now on.

76
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,279
OK?

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,720
Doudou,
don't be picky about your food.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,359
Eat less fatty meat and more vegetables.

79
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,799
Shanwa.

80
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,839
Listen to your father,

81
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,480
and take care of him.

82
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,119
Understand?

83
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,279
Yes!

84
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,920
Miss Du is coming.

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,559
A pleasant journey to you.

86
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,200
It's a farewell hug.

87
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,119
Goodbye.

88
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,559
I have to go.

89
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,519
Shanwa.

90
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,239
Bye-bye.

91
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,959
See you.

92
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,760
A pleasant journey to you.

93
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Wait a minute.

94
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,880
A pleasant journey to you.

95
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,399
Don't tell anyone that

96
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm on this island.

97
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,760
Why?

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,880
I don't want...

99
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,000
OK, I understand.

100
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,119
When do you plan to come back?

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,600
I may stay on this island
for the rest of my life.

102
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,720
Well,

103
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:06,959
it is a good vacation place for me.

104
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,799
I'm not going on vacation with you.

105
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,959
I came all the way here
to see you this time.

106
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,359
Well, no matter where you are,

107
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,200
I hope that you are happy.

108
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,559
I wish you a safe trip.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,160
Kids, let's go back.

110
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,600
Bye-bye, let's go...

111
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,720
Bye-bye, let's go...

112
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:52,480
Is it a necklace?

113
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,480
Goodbye.

114
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:58,600
Happy birthday!

115
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,959
Goodbye.

116
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,119
Bye-bye...

117
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,239
A pleasant journey to you. Bye-bye.

118
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,479
Doctor.

119
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,760
I've been feeling unwell lately.

120
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,400
Then I went to the hospital,

121
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,840
but the doctor said
there was nothing wrong with my body.

122
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,359
He asked me to come here.

123
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,080
Do you feel anything else?

124
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,880
Every night when I go to bed

125
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
and watch the ceiling,

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,200
I always feel like

127
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,280
something is spinning above.

128
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,119
Tell me,

129
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,280
have you been stimulated lately?

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,919
Shangguan.

131
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,400
Be careful.

132
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,359
Thank you.

133
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:12,679
Take care of yourself.

134
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,479
You may have
psychological disorder syndrome.

135
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,760
Although this is the
mildest mental illness,

136
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
if you ignore it,

137
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,719
it is highly likely to develop into

138
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,960
depression, phobia,

139
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,559
or OCD. Understand?

140
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm sorry, doctor.

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
I'm not sick,
I'm not sick at all.

142
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,719
Let go of me.

143
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,320
I'll walk by myself.

144
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,359
Come.

145
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,080
Siqi.

146
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,400
Are you satisfied now?

147
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,679
What kind of tricks
do you want to play?

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,119
Isn't that your favorite?

149
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,960
Luxury suite in a five-star hotel.

150
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,679
Look at these roses,

151
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,880
are they enough?

152
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:26,520
Champagne and red wine.

153
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,280
He Qunfei, are you crazy?

154
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,880
What do you want to do?

155
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,520
What do I want to do?

156
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
I want to propose to you.

157
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,679
Didn't you think
my last proposal was not grand?

158
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,679
And this time,

159
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,080
are you satisfied this time?

160
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
Is it grand enough?

161
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,520
Siqi.

162
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,359
Please marry me.

163
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,359
He Qunfei, are you sick?

164
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,719
Do you think I'm quite vulgar?

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Do you think I turned you down
because of the arrangement?

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,520
It's because of the apartment.

167
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,679
Apartment?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
Apartment again.

169
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:32,559
You don't like me
because I'm poor

170
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,200
and cannot give you a good life.

171
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
Why do you say this?

172
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,960
I just want an apartment.
Is it my fault?

173
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:41,799
Tell me,

174
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
who doesn't want a secure home now?

175
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
Why do you complain?

176
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,559
Have I ever resented you?

177
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,960
You can't afford to buy an apartment.

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,719
I said I would wait for you.

179
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,479
But I've been waiting so long.

180
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,159
I was desperate and anxious to wait.

181
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,719
How many years
have we been in a relationship?

182
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:05,919
More than three years, right?

183
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:10,919
What exactly did you do?

184
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,159
Have you made any efforts
for the apartment I want?

185
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,239
Yes, I have.

186
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,520
Really.

187
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:18,559
OK.

188
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:22,559
Tell me, how long do I have to wait?

189
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,719
Look at all these in the room.

190
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
What do you mean?

191
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,599
Are you sarcastic about
my vanity and realism?

192
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
Is it meaningful? He Qunfei.

193
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,919
Enjoy yourself.

194
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,400
I have no time to waste with you.

195
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
If I have a big apartment now,

196
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,119
will you marry me?

197
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
We'll see.

198
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,039
Mr. Lei,

199
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,159
you're coming back?

200
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,400
Hello, I want to check out.

201
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,640
OK. Please wait a minute.

202
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,159
The total cost of your flowers, package,

203
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:11,159
drinks and room

204
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,320
is thirty-two thousand
eight hundred yuan.

205
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,919
How much?

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,799
Thirty-two thousand eight hundred yuan.

207
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:19,880
So...so expensive.

208
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,599
Sorry, I don't have enough cash,
can I use my credit card?

209
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:29,640
OK. Please wait a minute.

210
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:35,280
Sorry, you have overspent on this card.

211
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,679
Please get another card.

212
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Does your hotel offer credit?

213
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,719
Come here to pick me up in half an hour.

214
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,440
We will go to the construction site
of the Entertainment Center.

215
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,719
OK.

216
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,599
Mr. Lei, you're back.

217
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,799
I thought you would come back tomorrow.

218
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:23,599
Did you hear back from the overseas

219
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,039
in these two days when I was away?

220
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,960
I have put the S.G files on your desk.

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,880
Did you drink?

222
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,479
I'm sorry, Mr. Lei.

223
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,799
I drank a lot
at the class reunion yesterday.

224
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,559
Page 4 is missing?

225
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:51,919
Uh...

226
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,200
There might be a problem
with the printer

227
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:56,080
when I was printing.

228
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:57,919
I'm sorry, Mr. Lei.

229
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,840
I'll print another copy right away.

230
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:01,520
Qunfei,

231
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,679
look at yourself.

232
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:05,919
You are disheveled,

233
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
hasty, and drunk.

234
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,679
Did something happen to you

235
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,599
while I was away?

236
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,559
No.

237
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,479
You can tell me.

238
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,799
Maybe I can help you.

239
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,159
Nothing happened.

240
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,840
Let's make the premise clear first.

241
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,719
From now on,

242
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,119
never let me see you like this

243
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,599
in the office again.

244
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,880
These files are so important,

245
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,200
and one wrong word is not allowed,

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,640
while you are missing a whole page.

247
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,200
I am usually very strict with

248
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,200
other employees in the company.

249
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,919
And you, as my assistant,

250
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,840
should set an example.

251
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,919
You must be rigorous,

252
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,919
otherwise how can I convince
all the employees.

253
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,599
Mr. Lei, I understand.

254
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,080
I will never be like this.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,080
Qunfei,

256
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
you have worked with me
for such a long time,

257
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,840
and you know my character,

258
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,520
I always focus on the behavior,
instead of the person.

259
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,479
I want to remind you,

260
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,439
drink less alcohol.

261
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,160
Drink a little for delight,

262
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,560
and drinking too much will hurt you.

263
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,239
Not only does it harm your health,

264
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,520
but most importantly,
it affects your work.

265
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:17,400
Understand?

266
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,439
I understand, Mr. Lei.

267
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,560
OK, go.

268
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,959
Take the files.

269
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,359
Mr. Lin.

270
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,199
You don't look well.

271
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:54,280
Were you criticized?

272
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,880
I deserved it.

273
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,400
I have a question,

274
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,319
why were you in a hurry
to borrow money from me?

275
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,520
I wanted to spend a sum of money

276
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:08,920
to restore my relationship with Siqi.

277
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,800
I didn't expect the opposite.

278
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,479
Money was spent while Siqi was leaving.

279
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,800
Did you break up?

280
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:22,560
Not yet, but soon I guess.

281
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,239
I've experienced
this kind of relationship.

282
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,800
The more you talk about breaking up,
the more you can't break up.

283
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,319
You can't forget her and move on now.

284
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,239
Hero becomes a prisoner of love.

285
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
A penny baffles a hero.

286
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,280
What you need is far more than a penny.

287
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,319
Mr. Lin.

288
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:47,560
For the money I owe you,

289
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:51,359
I will pay you back in installments
when I get paid.

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,359
Brother, take your time.

291
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:00,040
This money is nothing to me.

292
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,079
You really need to
think about your future.

293
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,160
I have no future.

294
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,560
You remind me of the person I once was.

295
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,359
I had no money,
so I paid by credit card.

296
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:31,000
One month after one month,

297
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,839
I robbed Peter to pay Paul.

298
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,680
You did love this girl,

299
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,560
but various real-life problems

300
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,439
kept her away from you.

301
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,520
I understand that and want to help you.

302
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,839
Mr. Lin.
I cannot accept your money any more.

303
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,199
You've helped me a lot.

304
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,000
Your understanding
is the biggest help for me.

305
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,199
In this world,

306
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,640
it's not hard to
have friends and opportunities,

307
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,439
but it's hard to have someone
understand you.

308
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,319
Lei Yuzheng trusts you a lot,

309
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:06,880
but he will never understand you.

310
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,199
Because he did not experience
a life like ours.

311
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:11,400
We have to move upward step by step.

312
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,800
This money is nothing to me.

313
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,800
But for you,

314
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,239
it's a life-saving straw.

315
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Mr. Lin,
I can't accept your money any more.

316
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,079
Take this money to get more.
No more than two months,

317
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:27,280
your worries will vanish.

318
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
Thank you.

319
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,800
Excuse me, how much is this?

320
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,680
Isn't the fact that Uncle Lei

321
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,400
is the best gift, right?

322
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,719
Let's go.
Let me take you somewhere.

323
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,560
Du Xiaosu,

324
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,319
happy birthday!

325
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,040
Hope you can be happy forever.

326
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,400
It's raining.

327
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,719
Go.

328
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:07,560
-It's really raining. Run fast.
-Run.

329
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:21,920
Please taste it.

330
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,959
This steak looks so delicious.

331
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Of course.

332
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,079
The grade of steaks

333
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,760
relies on the quality.

334
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,520
The difference between

335
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,560
prime beef and lowest rated beef
is very big.

336
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,680
There is a lot to learn about this.

337
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,520
Shangguan, you have not lived in vain.

338
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,119
You are so good at enjoying yourself.

339
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,199
What do you think people earn money for?

340
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,000
Just for enjoying, right?

341
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,760
But they shall have money first.

342
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,680
By the way, how is that fund doing?

343
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,119
You don't trust me?

344
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,479
Why do you have to ask
every time we meet?

345
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,760
No, No...

346
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
Fine. I don't know what to do with you.

347
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,959
Let me check.

348
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,760
So far, there should be

349
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,280
a ten percent of profit.

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,560
Ten percent?

351
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,160
So I've got a profit of
five thousand yuan

352
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,800
for my fifty thousand yuan.

353
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,479
Too little for you?

354
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
No, No, No...I don't mean that.

355
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,640
It just takes more than ten days,

356
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,439
and I'm very satisfied with this result.

357
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,880
Do you think it will double this year?

358
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,839
Zou Siqi.

359
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,319
Do you have dinner with me,

360
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,000
or check my performance today?

361
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,439
Even my multi-billion-yuan clients
don't ask questions

362
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,439
all day long like you do.

363
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

364
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,239
I might be too excited.

365
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,199
Since you have earned the money,

366
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:50,839
how about your treat today?

367
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,439
OK, my treat.

368
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,040
Fine, I'm just kidding.

369
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:57,920
I, Shanguang Boyao,

370
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,599
never let a woman treat me.

371
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:00,599
Hello, Sir.

372
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,680
Do you need to order anything?

373
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,239
No.

374
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,199
Sorry, sorry.

375
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,239
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

376
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:04,880
Sorry, sorry.

377
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll call someone to clean it up.

378
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,839
Isn't that Assistant He?

379
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:11,760
Assistant He.

380
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,520
What a coincidence!
You are here too.

381
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,599
Hello, Mr. Shangguan.

382
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,839
Hello.

383
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
It's rare to meet you, Assistant He.

384
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,359
I just want to ask you

385
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,680
about Yutian.

386
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,959
Siqi, do you mind if we sit together?

387
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,640
It's fine, Mr. Shangguan.

388
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,959
I have business and I'm leaving soon.

389
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,880
It's my fault.

390
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:43,959
He Qunfei, the assistant
to the Chairman of Yutian Group.

391
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,160
Zou Siqi,

392
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,199
this is my...my

393
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,079
good friend.

394
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,560
Have you met before？

395
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:03,359
Yes, I'm quite familiar with people

396
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,160
of Yutian Group.

397
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,359
Really?

398
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,560
It's destiny that ties people together!

399
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,719
We must toast to

400
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,160
our meeting today.

401
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,079
Waiter,

402
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:15,640
get a chair and cup over here.

403
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,599
Qunfei,

404
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,880
taste this bottle of wine I open today.

405
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,520
No, thanks, Mr. Shangguan.

406
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,760
I... I'm leaving.

407
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,560
Are you disrespectful to me?

408
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,959
Be careful, I will complain about you

409
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,160
to Lei Yuzheng next time.

410
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,199
I'm so sorry, Mr. Shangguan.

411
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,199
I have to go now.

412
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:53,479
Goodbye.

413
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,640
Shangguan, I want to go to the washroom.

414
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,839
Wait me for a minute.

415
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,680
OK.

416
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:11,000
He Qunfei,

417
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,160
you are so mean, you follow me.

418
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,160
It's not you to blame me,

419
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,800
but the opposite.

420
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:20,560
What is the relationship between you?

421
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:21,920
What relationship?

422
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,119
He is a new friend of mine,

423
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,560
and we were talking about business.
What's wrong with that?

424
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,239
You're shiftless.
Can't I pursue a better life?

425
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,760
Do you believe what you just said?

426
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,239
Why not?

427
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,479
I respect the God

428
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
and myself.

429
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,160
He talked to me about making money,

430
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:35,599
and treated me with dinner.
What's wrong with this?

431
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,880
I don't care if you believe me or not.

432
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:39,239
Can you promise
you don't have other thought for him?

433
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,280
He is a boss, and he won't
love the one like me?

434
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,800
You'd better know that.

435
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,359
Zou Siqi, listen to me.

436
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,760
Shangguan is a notorious playboy.

437
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:48,680
He has so many girlfriends,

438
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,239
and you'll be hurt sooner or later.

439
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:52,800
I get hurt? Hurt by what?

440
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:56,760
By what? Think about it.

441
00:26:56,959 --> 00:26:58,199
Why should he invest for you?

442
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,839
Why should he help you make money?

443
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,920
It's all because
you are young and pretty,

444
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,119
and he wants to take advantage of you.

445
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,560
He Qunfei, keep your mouth clean.

446
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,479
In the restaurant,

447
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,160
Shangguan was nice to you.

448
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,439
Now the things you've said about him.

449
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:10,839
Do you think it's appropriate?

450
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
I think you're jealous of his money.

451
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,199
He can do whatever he wants
just because he's rich?

452
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:18,439
So he can take my girlfriend away?

453
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,959
He doesn't even know
I'm your girlfriend.

454
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,959
Why didn't you tell him
in the restaurant?

455
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,079
Do you know how hard it was for me

456
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,959
to watch you two having fun

457
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,920
in the restaurant?

458
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,959
Do you know how much
I wanted to rush over

459
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,439
to grab him and tell him

460
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,119
you're my girlfriend?

461
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,199
But I didn't.

462
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,640
Why?

463
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,040
Because I'm afraid of losing you.

464
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,520
Siqi,

465
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,599
is this how we ended up?

466
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,280
It's your call,

467
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,560
no matter what you think.

468
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,880
Uncle Jiang, just small gifts
to show my respect to you.

469
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm glad

470
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,520
you can come to see me.

471
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,880
Come and sit down.

472
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,239
Uncle Jiang.
My father is not very well this year,

473
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,719
so I come alone. Please don't mind.

474
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,119
By the way, how's your father?

475
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,199
He's fine, but frail as always.

476
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,560
Your father was high-spirited
and vigorous

477
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:09,839
when he was young.

478
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:13,079
And he is old now.

479
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:15,760
I also feel that

480
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,920
I'm getting old and loosing strength.

481
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:20,880
It's the time for young ones
to look after the business.

482
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:24,479
Yuzheng, I'm definitely betting on you.

483
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,439
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

484
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,760
But it's not all true.

485
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,239
We're young, and full of the motivation
and active mind.

486
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:33,239
But we still need guidance and help

487
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,560
from you and other predecessors

488
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,119
in the company

489
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,479
at the beginning.

490
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,719
Uncle Jiang, if you wanna retire,

491
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,680
I'll be the first person to say no
before my father.

492
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,079
Yuzheng, you are a smart talker now.

493
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:49,680
If Fanlv's half as excellent as you are,

494
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,040
I won't worry about her that much.

495
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,760
What? Fanlv is not at home?

496
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,880
She's not at home all day,

497
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,719
and always comes back drunk.

498
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,959
I'm really worried.

499
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,160
Come on, have tea.

500
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,000
Fanlv.

501
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,479
Come, come here.

502
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,199
Yuzheng is here,

503
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,719
why don't you say hello?

504
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,000
You're getting rude.

505
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,880
Mr. Lei hardly comes here,
it's our pleasure.

506
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,680
Are you here to see my dad? Mr. Lei.

507
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,280
You two have a nice talk, excuse me.

508
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,280
Another date?

509
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,439
Can you not go?

510
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,880
It's not easy for Yuzheng to be here.

511
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,239
Let's have dinner together.

512
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,119
Why do I have to accompany him?

513
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,880
It's like no one wants your daughter.

514
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,239
How come you said this?

515
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,640
Your daughter is popular as always.

516
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:53,119
Many handsome and young men

517
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,079
are lining up to have dinner with me.

518
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,199
How can you say that
in front of Yuzheng?

519
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
So what?

520
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,319
Dad, I'm leaving.

521
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,439
Look at you,

522
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,280
Fanlv.

523
00:31:10,199 --> 00:31:11,239
Look at her...

524
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,839
Uncle Jiang,
it's good for Fanlv to date someone.

525
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,599
Often meeting with friends

526
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,239
will make her feel good.

527
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,839
You know her friends,

528
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,880
who only know
how to eat and drink every day.

529
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,280
I thought that
her volunteering to Yutian

530
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,839
would help her change her laziness.

531
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:30,959
But I didn't expect

532
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,239
her to not even
show up in the company now.

533
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:35,839
She is still young,
and hasn't had enough fun.

534
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:38,520
Yuzheng,

535
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,520
you and Fanlv grew up together,

536
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,439
and you were so close to

537
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,800
each other when you were children.

538
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:49,280
Why do you have trouble with each other
when you grow up?

539
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,680
We are not on the same track.

540
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,199
I am not able to control her.

541
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,119
Yuzheng, help me.

542
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,319
Find a chance to
have a good talk with her.

543
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,800
She still listens to you.

544
00:32:06,959 --> 00:32:07,680
OK.

545
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,000
The points recorded in today's meeting

546
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:36,000
must be implemented. Understand?

547
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,000
Lei Yu...

548
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,119
Hello, Mr. Lei.

549
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,520
Are you planning to come back?

550
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,280
I...

551
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,880
I come back to Yutian to
handle the resignation procedure.

552
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,520
It seems that

553
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,880
Yutian is still not attractive enough,

554
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,800
so you don't want to stay.

555
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:01,280
In the future,

556
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,800
I have to reflect on myself.

557
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,119
If you need anything in the future,

558
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,239
just come to Yutian,
and we will help you.

559
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:10,000
Thank you, Mr. Lei.

560
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:12,479
Well... I'm leaving.

561
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,760
Xiaosu is here.

562
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,439
Xiaosu, you come back.

563
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,319
Xiaosu, you really want to leave?

564
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,439
Yes, we are all sad to see you leave.

565
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,800
Yes, please stay.

566
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,439
During this period,

567
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:45,160
I was glad to meet you.

568
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,439
Thank you all for taking care of me.

569
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,520
We will definitely have the chance
to see each other again in the future.

570
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,520
Mr. Ning.

571
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,359
Won't you think about staying?

572
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
Mr. Ning,

573
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
my greatest gain in Boyuan

574
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,159
is that I got to know you.

575
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,719
You turned me from a rookie

576
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
to a professional.

577
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,959
Although I can't guarantee now

578
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,320
that I will become

579
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,800
a great designer in the future,

580
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,959
I won't

581
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,760
bring shame on you

582
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,520
as your prentice.

583
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
You little girl,

584
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,000
don't be obsequious to me.

585
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,520
Well,

586
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,080
after resignation,

587
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,639
have you found a job?

588
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,639
Not yet.

589
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,479
Naked resignation is not easy.

590
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,600
The living cost is so high now.

591
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,040
Don't worry.

592
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,360
I will work hard.

593
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,320
OK.

594
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,199
Remember,

595
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,399
Boyuan is your home.

596
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
If you have any difficulty,
come back anytime.

597
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:56,639
Sure.

598
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,320
Would it be rude
not to say goodbye personally?

599
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,439
But what shall I say if I go to see him?

600
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,840
I...

601
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:26,439
I come back to Yutian to
handle the resignation procedure.

602
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:32,879
Xiaosu, are you going to
take the elevator?

603
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,639
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,239
You go first.

605
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,080
Mr. Lei,

606
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
this is the contract.

607
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,399
Is there someone outside looking for me?

608
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:46,199
No.

609
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,040
Front side, go.

610
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,560
Back side, not go.

611
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,000
Leave it to God.

612
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,000
This is the only way.

613
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,360
-Qunfei.
-Xiaosu.

614
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:02,679
Is Mr. Lei inside?

615
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
No, he is not inside.

616
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,479
Such a heavy rain!

617
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:19,159
My new shoes will get wet again.

618
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,199
Let's leave tomorrow.

619
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,479
No.

620
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,719
My father wouldn't let me
stay out overnight.

621
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,159
He has urged me
to go home several times.

622
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,959
You have to go back home
to be a "good girl" again.

623
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,919
Miss Jiang.

624
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,679
I just asked you to go,
didn't I?

625
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:39,439
I can't go,
because the rain is so heavy.

626
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm leaving.

627
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,760
OK.

628
00:37:42,919 --> 00:37:43,560
Bye.

629
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,320
Go.

630
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:47,280
Take it slow.

631
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,280
I'm so jealous.

632
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:09,239
Wipe with napkins.

633
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:10,679
Thank you.

634
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,159
Are you OK?

635
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,239
I'm fine.

636
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,479
I just drank a lot.

637
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,360
This is for you,

638
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,919
fresh tomato and pomegranate juice.

639
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,959
Drink some.

640
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,000
It's good for your health.

641
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:29,639
Well,

642
00:38:30,919 --> 00:38:33,520
is it too cold?
I also have hot drink here.

643
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,120
You are not good at drinking,

644
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,639
and should not have drunk so much.

645
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,360
Look at yourself.

646
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,159
Uncomfortable, right?

647
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,159
Go back now.

648
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,159
Fanlv.

649
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,600
What are you doing?

650
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
Fanlv, I'm sorry.

651
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,520
I...

652
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,320
I just want to see you

653
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,199
and talk to you.

654
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Lin Xiangyuan,

655
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:09,639
we have nothing to talk about.

656
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,320
Fanlv,

657
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
I am sincere with you.

658
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:15,360
That day...

659
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,159
Don't mention about that day any more.

660
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:20,919
Fanlv,

661
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,239
I want to tell you that

662
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,399
I'm very sad.

663
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:26,479
Being together with you

664
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,439
is a blessing from God.

665
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,040
I know there is a big gap between us.

666
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
Please give me a chance.

667
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,399
Let me stay by your side.

668
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,679
I will treat you well.

669
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,600
OK?

670
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,959
This is eight-treasure porridge.

671
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,479
And these...

672
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,120
Steamed buns?

673
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,879
Nanxiang steamed buns with crab meat.

674
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,639
I remember you like them.

675
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,639
You don't have to do this.

676
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,040
