Listen.

Listen.

18
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,039
If you don't allow me to
take a picture of her,

19
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,679
I'll make things irreparable.

20
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:17,960
You will make things what?

00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,360

...r-a-b-l-e.

23
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:24,880
I'll tell every doctor and nurse
in this hospital

24
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,479
that you are my boyfriend,

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
and you've been physically abusing me.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,320
You will lose all your fans.

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,600
Excellent.

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,199
I'd rather you do that
so I can get some rest.

29
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,119
Go ahead.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,839
You are so stubborn!

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,039
This is called professional ethics.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,240
Come on, get out of here now.

33
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,199
No.

34
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,000
Dr. Shao.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,679
Go right away!

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
No, please.

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,240
One photo, just let me take one photo!

38
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,839
I promise to finish in 5 minutes.

39
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,440
No one knows who will win in the end.

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,440
Shao Zhenrong.

41
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,399
Here.

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,399
Remember,

43
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,239
modesty is no good to a competition.

44
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,160
If you want to win,

45
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:49,720
just rely on yourself.

46
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,600
By the way,

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,160
as for Yan Jingjing's injury,

48
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,760
give her the best treatment.

49
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,040
I'll cover the cost.

50
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,200
It takes at least a few months
for her to recover.

51
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,399
It will temporarily impossible

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
for her to work.

53
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,000
I know that.

54
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,160
But movie shooting has already started,

55
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,600
and the whole team is waiting.

56
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:11,760
Also,

57
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,359
those shareholders have put their eyes
on the progress.

58
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:14,760
If you don't want to lose,

59
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,440
you have to change the actress.

60
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,880
You've made up your mind?

61
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,720
There's no such thing called
one solution to all.

62
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,320
No pay, no gain.

63
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:25,559
If you want to have everything,

64
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
you'll get nothing in the end.

65
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,359
Yan Jingjing just

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,839
doesn't understand this simple logic.

67
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,040
But...

68
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,839
But what?

69
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,200
Well, even I don't know about
the entertainment industry,

70
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
but I know it's risky.

71
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,559
You're worried that
someone will play tricks on me,

72
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,320
or say that I'm ruthless.

73
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,279
Zhenrong,

74
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,600
life is like a drama,

75
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,720
in which all the stories and characters
are made up.

76
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,679
It's not up to us to decide

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,640
who is the good guy and who is the bad.

78
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,559
As for me,

79
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,640
as long as I know
what I should and should not do,

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,679
that'll be enough.

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,480
Rumors

82
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,839
won't hurt me.

83
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,399
Anyway, no matter what will you do,

84
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,679
I'll be on your side.

85
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
Pain is inevitable,

86
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
suffering is optional.

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,640
Pain is inevitable,

88
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,559
suffering is optional.

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
You know me the best.

90
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,320
It's all written down.

91
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,359
Dr. Shao,

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,359
good morning.

93
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,480
Here, your coffee.

94
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,480
Who is this?

95
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,320
She's cute.

96
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,880
Why are you here again?

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,079
I want to thank you for saving my life.

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,559
Here,

99
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:58,920
your latte.

100
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,119
I don't drink latte.

101
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,399
You don't drink latte?

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
I only drink mocha.

103
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,119
I've got mocha here.

104
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,399
I also have Americano, Cappuccino,

105
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,079
and Caramel Macchiato.

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,799
You can pick any one.

107
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,839
Why such good things never happen to me?

108
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
What's up, Dr. Shao?

109
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,200
I know why you are here,

110
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,600
but I have told you

111
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,839
that you can't interview Yan Jingjing.

112
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:30,760
You got me wrong, Dr. Shao.

113
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
It's not like what you think.

114
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,359
I come here today

115
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,000
just to bring you the coffee.

116
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,399
Here, take it.

117
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:41,880
Shao, good for you

118
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,839
to have someone bring you coffee
early in the morning.

119
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,880
Your girl friend is cute.

120
00:07:48,559 --> 00:07:49,279
No...

121
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:49,959
You're lucky.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,880
That's not true...

123
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Well...

124
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,200
We all knew it.

125
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,799
No...

126
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,799
Zhenrong,

127
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,160
look at you. So thin!

128
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,559
Don't be thinner!

129
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,600
That will break my heart.

130
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:07,040
Thank you all for
taking care of Zhenrong.

131
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,640
No worries.

132
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,559
Here, doctor.

133
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,239
The coffee is for you.

134
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:11,480
For every one of us?

135
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Sure.

136
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,519
Thank you.

137
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Then I'll leave the time to you.

138
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,440
Take your time.

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm leaving now.

140
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,119
Well done.

141
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,480
All right.

142
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,200
See you! Bye!

143
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,119
See you!

144
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Yuzheng.

145
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,799
Fan Lv?

146
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,799
Aren't you in France?

147
00:09:01,599 --> 00:09:02,440
Fan Lv,

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,039
when did you come back?

149
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,599
Why didn't you tell me?

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,880
Qunfei,

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,239
it's your oversight.

152
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Why didn't you inform me

153
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,640
that Miss Jiang had come?

154
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,479
You shouldn't just let her
walk in alone.

155
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,919
Sorry, Mr. Lei,

156
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I don't know Miss Jiang is coming,

157
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,559
nor that she comes

158
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,760
without invitation.

159
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:33,880
Fan Lv,

160
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,520
you see,

161
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
I should accompany you

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,119
since you are back.

163
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:41,039
But,

164
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,919
I am too busy today,

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,479
and really don't have the time.

166
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,719
That's OK.

167
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,840
I can wait for you.

168
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,320
OK.

169
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,919
Please wait for a while.

170
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,400
Yuzheng,

171
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,599
how long do I still have to wait?

172
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm so negligent.

173
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,799
I almost forget you are still here.

174
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,960
I have to go through all these docs.

175
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,200
It will probably take some time.

176
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,400
Anyway,

177
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,640
overtime work

178
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,200
has become a habit of me.

179
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Well then,

180
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,159
take your time

181
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,119
and don't go home too late.

182
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,320
All right.

183
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,719
Then see you around.

184
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:42,880
Qunfei,

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,960
see Miss Jiang off.

186
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,320
Yes, Mr. Lei.

187
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:51,919
Miss Jiang,

188
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,520
this way please.

189
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,080
Then, I shall leave for now.

190
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,919
See you next time.

191
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:14,184
(Calling Shao Zhenrong)

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,679
Brother.

193
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,320
Zhenrong,

194
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,280
I'm almost there.

195
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,599
OK, wait for me.

196
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,520
I'll go downstairs right now.

197
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
By the way, brother,

198
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
I met a girl.

199
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,080
Who?

200
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,799
That girl

201
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,320
is really funny,

202
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,840
and smiles a lot.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,119
She works very hard,

204
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,200
and comes up with all kinds of tricks
to get her work done.

205
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
But at the same time she's very kind,

206
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,840
and very thoughtful.

207
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:55,520
It seems you

208
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,479
have fallen in love.

209
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,359
You like her, right?

210
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,080
That's not the case.

211
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,640
We only met for several times.

212
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:08,400
Look at you, how nervous!

213
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:09,559
I just feel...

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,000
I just feel that I'm lucky.

215
00:12:11,119 --> 00:12:11,919
What do you think?

216
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,039
Well, you're lucky?

217
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,119
It's the girl who is lucky.

218
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,559
Listen,

219
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:18,679
she has to be a good girl.

220
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,200
Otherwise,

221
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:21,320
I won't allow you guys
to date each other.

222
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,919
At that time,

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,840
I was in the crew.

224
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,239
I remember the mosquitos

225
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,359
were like this big.

226
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,000
This big, you know?

227
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,880
And it was in the wilderness.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,719
There were no people.

229
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,799
It's scary even just to think about it.

230
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,599
Why did you make movies
in places like that?

231
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:41,760
Because it was a costume drama.

232
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,039
You cannot shoot things like highways,

233
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,719
or buildings, and poles.

234
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,000
If the camera moves like this,

235
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,280
then it will be all messed up.

236
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,760
That's why costume dramas

237
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,359
have to be shot in desolate areas.

238
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,919
Speaking of this,

239
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,840
do you know Xu You?

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,919
Is she the one...

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,479
-Yes!
-Yes!

242
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,479
She was even more unfortunate back then.

243
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:02,320
She almost

244
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,559
drank up the whole bottle of
mosquito repellent.

245
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,039
She was about to wear a gas mask!

246
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,719
Dr. Shao!

247
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,760
What a coincidence!

248
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,880
We are destined to meet each other!

249
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,479
Dr. Shao looks shy.

250
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,080
Dr. Shao!

251
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:49,039
Dr. Shao, don't leave!

252
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,400
My greatest hobby

253
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:55,559
is to watch handsome young men.

254
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:02,376
(Mr. Mo)

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,599
Excuse me, I have to answer my phone.

256
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,799
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

257
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,880
Mr. Mo.

258
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,599
Yutian is about to change Yan Jingjing.

259
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,919
Are you sure?

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,039
Yes. The news has been all around.

261
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,159
I think it's probably true.

262
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,640
Whether it's true or not,

263
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,039
you need to bear
the heavy responsibility, XIaosu.

264
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,280
Think about it.
You're now the closest to Yan Jingjing.

265
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,799
As long as

266
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,559
you get to interview her
and learn about the truth,

267
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,640
it will immediately become a headline.

268
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,239
Let me tell you, Xiaosu.

269
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
If you want to get promoted,

270
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,640
you have my words.

271
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:44,840
You know what I mean.

272
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,320
But if she's really been replaced,

273
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
it would be very difficult for her.

274
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
Du Xiaosu,

275
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:53,080
can you stop being emotional?

276
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,520
Think about who you are as a reporter.

277
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,719
Now all I want is the truth.

278
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,760
Go and see what you can do.

279
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,960
There must be something wrong
with Du Xiaosu's head.

280
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,159
What?

281
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,719
Hurry up! Hurry up!

282
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,599
What happened? What's going on?

283
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,640
A bus ran into a school bus.

284
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,719
Many kids are injured.

285
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
We need to carry out emergency rescue.
See you later.

286
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:20,919
How are you feeling now?

287
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,679
This kid's condition

288
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:24,479
is bad.

289
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:26,919
What shall we do, Dr. Shao?

290
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
This kid is suffering from hemorrhea,

291
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,559
but there is no Rh-negative
AB blood type in our blood bank.

292
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:33,799
It's available
in the city's blood center.

293
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,640
But it takes at least 1 hour
to transfer the blood.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,960
1 hour?

295
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
It'll be too late.

296
00:15:42,119 --> 00:15:43,119
Take my blood,

297
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,239
Dr. Shao.

298
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Take mine.

299
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,119
You have Rh-negative
AB blood type?

300
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,080
Absolutely.

301
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:52,760
Take my blood.

302
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,640
Don't worry about me.

303
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,479
I'll be ok.

304
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,200
I'm strong enough,
and I've got sufficient blood.

305
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,880
I'm fine. Just go ahead.

306
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,919
Are you ok?

307
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,599
I'm fine.

308
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,119
It's just I forgot to eat breakfast.

309
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,799
Could you please

310
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,599
get some meat buns for me?

311
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,640
And a cup of milk tea.

312
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,159
With extra pearl

313
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,400
and jelly.

314
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,880
Xiaosu! Xiaosu!

315
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,760
Dr. Shao?

316
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,760
You are awake.

317
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,679
What happened?

318
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,040
You passed out after blood drawing.

319
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,839
Was I boy-crazy

320
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,760
before passing out

321
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
and flirting you again?

322
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,920
You told me before losing consciousness

323
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,079
that,

324
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Shao Zhenrong,

325
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,160
why your head

326
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
looks twice as big as watermelon?

327
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,199
Tell me,

328
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
why you skipped breakfast?

329
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,719
Because I was too busy.

330
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,839
You had the time

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,479
to gossip with the nurses,

332
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,800
but no time for proper meals?

333
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,640
I was trying to
build ties with the mass.

334
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,839
The smell of pan fried pork bun?

335
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,640
Here.

336
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,439
It's pan fried pork bun indeed!

337
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,160
What a great smell!

338
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,760
I'm so hungry.

339
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:18,839
It's yummy!

340
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,920
Food.

341
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,880
Here, the drink.

342
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Dr. Shao,

343
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,239
there is one thing

344
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,000
that I want to ask you.

345
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,400
Go ahead.

346
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,640
But

347
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,560
nothing about Yan Jingjing.

348
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,319
In fact,

349
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,319
I was chasing behind her that day.

350
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Well,

351
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:09,000
if I didn't chase her closely,

352
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,560
she probably wouldn't drive that fast.

353
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,199
Perhaps,

354
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,160
then there would be no accident.

355
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,199
As far as I know,

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,920
what caused the injury

357
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,359
was that she didn't
fasten her seat belt.

358
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,800
You don't have to comfort me.

359
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,400
The news is all around

360
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,280
that the actress for the Demon Slayer
will be changed.

361
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,199
If Yan Jingjing is replaced
by someone else,

362
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,319
she will hate me to death.

363
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,319
Therefore,

364
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,199
I think...

365
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,400
You feel guilty.

366
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:50,400
Dr. Shao,

367
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,959
the kid's CT report is ready.

368
00:19:53,479 --> 00:19:54,560
I see.

369
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:00,000
Take a good rest,

370
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:02,400
and stop making blind conjectures.

371
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,040
How's everything going?

372
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,640
Has the news been circulated?

373
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,800
Which media are informed?

374
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,560
Most of them have arrived, right?

375
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
Ok.

376
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,599
I'll make sure my audience

377
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:43,760
enjoy this reality show

378
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:45,439
as much as possible.

379
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,359
Dr. Shao, you scared me!

380
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,319
What are you doing?

381
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:06,359
Why do you come?

382
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,199
I...

383
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,800
I was...

384
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:10,160
Where is Yan Jingjing?

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,560
I was going to ask you.

386
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,760
Where did she go?

387
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,040
Has she been discharged?

388
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,119
No.

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,040
Where is she?

390
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,079
Dr. Shao.

391
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,000
Reporter Du.

392
00:22:22,199 --> 00:22:22,760
Bad news.

393
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:23,880
Yan Jingjing is going to
jump from the building.

394
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,719
What?

395
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,839
Call the police!

396
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,839
Don't take things too hard!

397
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
Do not jump!

398
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,719
Please don't jump!

399
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:35,839
It's not worth giving up your life.

400
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,079
Excuse me.

401
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,560
Hurry up!

402
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,040
Which floor can we get to
the podium building?

403
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:44,000
6th floor.

404
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:44,719
6th floor.

405
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,520
It's too late.

406
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:48,920
Let's go.

407
00:22:54,479 --> 00:22:55,119
Stand back.

408
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,119
Quick!

409
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,239
Quick!

410
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,520
Let us in.

411
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,719
Stop being foolish!

412
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,640
Yan Jingjing!

413
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,800
Yan Jingjing!

414
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,199
Stay there. Don't come over!

415
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,359
I don't want you to get involved.

416
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,000
If you step closer, I'll jump off.

417
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,079
Yan Jingjing.

418
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,839
Don't be stupid.

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
Let us take some pictures.

420
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,400
Let us in.

421
00:23:22,839 --> 00:23:23,560
Don't come over!

422
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
Stop!

423
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:27,280
Listen to me, Yan Jingjing.

424
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,719
Your injury is light,

425
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,000
and you'll recover soon.

426
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:30,920
You're young.

427
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:31,839
We've all got only one life,

428
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,280
so don't make the decision that
you will regret.

429
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,920
But look at me now.

430
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm better off dead.

431
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,079
Hurry up!

432
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:46,280
Yan Jingjing.

433
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:47,479
Listen to me.

434
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,680
Things are not as bad as you think.

435
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,000
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

436
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,800
Mr. Lei,

437
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,800
I heard that Yan Jingjing and Xie Li

438
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,479
are spreading the news

439
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,359
that Yutian is changing her role,

440
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,839
pressing on us directly and indirectly.

441
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,040
That's good.

442
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,040
Then it will be their fault first,

443
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:12,959
and I'm paying them back.

444
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,199
Yan Jingjing.

445
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Yan Jingjing.

446
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,079
I'm your doctor,

447
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,199
and you are my patient.

448
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,560
I will keep you safe.

449
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,239
Trust me.

450
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:22,359
Dr. Shao, don't come over here.

451
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,920
It doesn't matter what you say.

452
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,880
Nothing can change my mind now.

453
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,040
Stay there!

454
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,959
Hurry up!

455
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,239
Trust me.

456
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,560
You'll be safe.

457
00:24:36,439 --> 00:24:37,319
Look out!

458
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,800
Xiaosu, look out!

459
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,000
Be careful!

460
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:54,760
Mr. Lei,

461
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,280
Yan Jingjing wants to
jump from the building.

462
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:57,239
Watch this.

463
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,900
(The actressYan Jingjing committed
suicide after casting scandal)

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,079
Can you get in touch with Du Xiaosu?

465
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,119
You have to get in touch with her.

466
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
She's the only reporter in the podium.

467
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,959
Be careful!

468
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,599
Do not act on impulse!

469
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,119
Dr. Shao, you can leave now.

470
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:12,040
I won't listen.

471
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,680
We won't give you up.

472
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,000
Yan Jingjing,

473
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,880
please believe us.

474
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,000
You tell her that

475
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,719
she must be careful.

476
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,079
Be careful!

477
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,880
Xiaosu, Xiaosu, hold on!

478
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:45,199
Famous actress, Yan Jingjing,

479
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,400
lost her role due to a car accident.

480
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,400
Desperate as she was, she
attempted to commit suicide

481
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,520
by jumping off the building,
but was saved by her attending doctor

482
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,079
who risked his own life.

483
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:51,839
Zhenrong!

484
00:25:52,239 --> 00:25:53,079
…and a reporter...

485
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,000
Let go!

486
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:58,839
No!

487
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,280
No!

488
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,800
I'd rather die with you.

489
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:13,920
Hold on! Hold on!

490
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:02,000
Xiaosu!

491
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,680
Du Xiaosu!

492
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,640
Du Xiaosu!

493
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,560
Wake up!

494
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,719
Du Xiaosu!

495
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,079
Du Xiaosu!

496
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,959
Wake up!

497
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:15,119
We are still alive?

498
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,400
Yes, we're still alive.

499
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,800
Am I dreaming?

500
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,719
No, you aren't.

501
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,479
It's great, Dr. Shao!

502
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,280
We're still alive!

503
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,719
Yes.

504
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,319
Jinging!

505
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,119
Gosh! I'm too tired!

506
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,560
You know what?

507
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,599
This time we made things too big.

508
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,359
Lei Yuzheng was anxious.

509
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Call Zhao Shi.

510
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:48,640
(Zhao Shi)

511
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,560
Tell Yan Jingjing,

512
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,880
I know clearly

513
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,400
her tricks.

514
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
You'd better pray

515
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,280
that no one gets hurt.

516
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:00,880
Otherwise,

517
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:02,280
I'll see her in the court.

518
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,160
Do you have anything to say, Dr. Shao?

519
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:07,680
No, nothing.

520
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,359
Excuse me!

521
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:09,839
Excuse me!

522
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:10,199
No.

523
00:28:10,239 --> 00:28:10,880
Dr. Shao!

524
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:13,839
Dr. Shao!

525
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,800
Please tell us!

526
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,719
Everyone stands back!

527
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,520
Please tell us!

528
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,400
Please!

529
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,160
-Dr. Shao!
-Dr. Shao!

530
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,599
Everyone stands back!

531
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:22,359
Yes, please!

532
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,439
-Dr. Shao!
-Dr. Shao!

533
00:28:44,719 --> 00:28:45,839
-Are you Ok?
-Are you Ok?

534
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,079
Du Xiaosu,

535
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:54,599
you did impress me.

536
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,880
Really, thank you.

537
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,560
Give me your phone number.

538
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,920
I'll call you

539
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,040
if I want to hear
your monologue comic talk.

540
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,079
No problem.

541
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,800
Excuse me,

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,880
have you seen Zhenrong,..Dr. Shao?

543
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,239
No, I haven't.

544
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,760
Thank you.

545
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,599
Brother,

546
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
are you looking for me?

547
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
What's up?

548
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,000
Are you crazy?

549
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,359
I...

550
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:15,920
Did you get hurt?

551
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm fine.

552
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,400
Not even a bruise.

553
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,680
Follow me.

554
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,319
To where?

555
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,680
I need to work...Where are we going?

556
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,640
You can go back first.

557
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,959
Bro, where are you taking me to?

558
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,079
Do you remember this place?

559
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:11,359
When we were kids,

560
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,640
once you almost fell off from here.

561
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,680
You were scared and cried so hard.

562
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:19,000
I do.

563
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,920
It was me,
who grabbed you and took you back.

564
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
Yes,

565
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,839
I was only 12 years old.

566
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:26,680
Since then,

567
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,319
you become afraid of
places of high height.

568
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,520
You know just now,

569
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,599
Aunt Shao called me

570
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
and how anxious was she?

571
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:40,959
Have you ever thought about her?

572
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,319
How she's gonna live

573
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:43,479
if anything bad happens to you?

574
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,239
I know it, brother.

575
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,000
All I was thinking about at that time
was to save her.

576
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,000
You thought about saving her?

577
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,079
You thought you are a big hero?

578
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
But have you ever thought about us?

579
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,920
But see? Nothing happens to me.

580
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,920
Yan Jingjing was invited by me.

581
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,479
If you get hurt today

582
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,920
because of saving her,

583
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,199
how can I face Aunt Shao?

584
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,079
Yan Jingjing is your actress,

585
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,880
but she is also my patient.

586
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:10,359
It's my duty as a doctor
to save patients.

587
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,959
Are you asking me to see her dying?

588
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,400
Just watching her
jump off the building in front of me?

589
00:32:13,479 --> 00:32:14,760
Do you think she really
has the guts to jump?

590
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
She doesn't.

591
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,319
What do you mean by that, bro?

592
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:21,800
Who will take his own life as a joke?

593
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,079
Zhenrong,

594
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,760
what you see may not be true.

595
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,000
There are times

596
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:28,959
when things are

597
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,800
much more complex
than you can imagine.

598
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,760
You, you mean...

599
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,199
Zhenrong,

600
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,000
we grow up together.

601
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:38,520
You

602
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,239
and Aunt Shao

603
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:42,719
have given me
all the warmth and happiness.

604
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,319
Aunt Shao has been saying this to me

605
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,319
since I was a kid,

606
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,400
"Yuzheng,

607
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,719
you are the older brother.

608
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,160
Please support Zhenrong,

609
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,439
and protect him."

610
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:54,439
I thought I had the power,

611
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,479
but what happened today

612
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,719
makes me realize that

613
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,359
you no longer need my protection.

614
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,199
Bro,

615
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,239
you're always my big brother.

616
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,800
(Calling)

617
00:33:50,552 --> 00:33:51,200
(Shao Zhenrong)

618
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,880
Hello!

619
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,679
The number you dailed

620
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,399
is not in service, please redial later.

621
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,840
It seems the user I'm trying to contact
is taking a rest.

622
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,239
Then I will call tomorrow.

623
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,320
Don't hang up!

624
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,840
You call me at this time...

625
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,639
so you are off work now?

626
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,520
Or still treating your patient?

627
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,120
What about you? Are you going to sleep?

628
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,159
Or still working hard?

629
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,879
Well, I'm living an unfortunate life.

630
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,760
There is no one in the office

631
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,399
except me typing letters.

632
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,719
You work so hard.

633
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,800
Yes.

634
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,320
Now I'm lonely by myself,

635
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,679
and nobody cares about me.

636
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,919
No way.

637
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,199
I think a person like you

638
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,120
should be loved by many.

639
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,000
Well, that's true.

640
00:34:59,239 --> 00:35:02,320
But I didn't give them the chance.

641
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,199
Why not?

642
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,040
Still waiting for my fate.

643
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,879
The fortune-teller told me that

644
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,879
I can expect romantic encounters
this year.

645
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,239
Also,

646
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,239
the guy is in the southwest,

647
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,800
holding scalpel.

648
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,239
Wait, no,

649
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,719
not scalpel,

650
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,840
but a butcher's knife.

651
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,280
Given what you say,

652
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:26,199
the dining hall of our hospital
is located in the southwest.

653
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,120
OK, I'll do you a favor,

654
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,959
and ask the cook of our hospital
if he wants to date you.

655
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,439
I'm tired and unhappy.

656
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,840
I'm going to hang up.

657
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,879
Wait, wait, stop!

658
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,439
You are my life saver and
I want to thank you.

659
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,560
How about this,

660
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,919
let's meet at the South's Cafe.

661
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,520
I want to invite you for lunch.

662
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,919
Let me think about it.

663
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,040
Well, since you are so handsome,

664
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,600
I accept your invitation.

665
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,840
See you tomorrow at 11 am.

666
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,399
Ok, see you then.

667
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,199
Bye!

668
00:35:57,399 --> 00:35:58,439
Bye!

669
00:36:21,919 --> 00:36:22,919
Thanks god I'm still in time.

670
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,959
This restaurant

671
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,520
is quite special.

672
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,199
It's not expensive

673
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
but the dishes are nice.

674
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,679
The environment is also nice.

675
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:39,159
Thank you.

676
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,840
It's nice here.

677
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,959
Dr. Shao,

678
00:36:45,399 --> 00:36:46,439
do you often take your girlfriend

679
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,399
to dine here?

680
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,040
Who told you that I have a girlfriend?

681
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:54,919
Dr. Shao,

682
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,399
can you tell me

683
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,360
why a good man like you

684
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,199
doesn't have a girlfriend?

685
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,520
Well, it's probably not the right time.

686
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
I've read a book,

687
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,959
and there was a sentence that I like.

688
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,479
Come cross

689
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,760
someone you're destined to meet,

690
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,560
not too early nor too late,

691
00:37:14,919 --> 00:37:16,280
but at the very moment

692
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,320
when you realize the person
you've been waiting for

693
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,280
is also there waiting for you.

694
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,840
Destiny is hard to tell.

695
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
When two people meet
and fall in love with each other,

696
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,080
we call it destiny.

697
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,760
When they don't,
we say there is no such thing.

698
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:38,040
But what if they meet each other,

699
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:39,760
fall in love,

700
00:37:39,879 --> 00:37:41,239
but do not go together in the end?

701
00:37:41,399 --> 00:37:42,360
Is that destiny

702
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:43,520
or not?

703
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,159
No matter whether there is
such a thing called destiny,

704
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,120
they need to spend time together first.

705
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,840
Well, a handsome man like you
won't understand it.

706
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,679
You can just sit here and do nothing,

707
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,080
and there will be girls coming for you.

708
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,719
Thank you for the compliments.

709
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,760
Happy birthday!

710
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,479
When you filled in
the blood donation card,

711
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,639
I saw your ID number.

712
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:34,719
Make a wish.

713
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,399
I'm done.

714
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,719
It's a pig!

715
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,000
You guys look alike.

716
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,840
Thank you.

717
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,560
Xiaosu,

718
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,120
if,

719
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:44,760
there is only one girl
that I would fall in love with,

720
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,399
what would you do?

721
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,199
I...

722
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,439
I...

723
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,719
I need to use the washroom.

724
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,600
He didn't say he likes you,

725
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:28,320
why are you so nervous?

726
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,159
