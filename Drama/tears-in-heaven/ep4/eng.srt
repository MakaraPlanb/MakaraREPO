Here you are.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Have this sorted out.

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,880
Hello, this is for you.

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,639
Here you are.

21
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,080
Thank you.

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,960
Here, this is for you.

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,479
Uncle Jiang,

24
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:44,639
this project is so great.

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,600
You can do it yourself without question.

26
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,759
Why do you give it to Yutian?

27
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,039
Xiao Lin,

28
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,360
go get my scarf from the car.

29
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:54,360
Sure. I'll leave you alone.

30
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,720
Yuzheng,

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,440
you and I are on the same side.

32
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:10,039
Xiao Lin is capable,

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,520
he is also in charge of this project,

34
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,119
but he is

35
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,839
an outsider after all.

36
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,080
Uncle Jiang,

37
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,320
why are you guarding against
your own people?

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,479
These days, the most difficult thing

39
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:27,880
to understand is moral nature.

40
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,279
I have a good faith in you
since you were kid.

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,520
I know you are capable,

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,160
and this project

43
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:37,279
fits your taste.

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,919
Also, we should always
look after each other.

45
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,759
Let's do it together.

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
The initial investment of Xinsheng

47
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,559
is converted into Yutian's shares.

48
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,360
Uncle Jiang,

49
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,320
you are trying to stand behind,

50
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,279
and let Yutian be vanguard.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,800
Yuzheng,

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,520
you are a good joker.

53
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,240
This project

54
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,880
is fully approved by your father.

55
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,399
We could consider it as

56
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,039
your father's retirement masterpiece.

57
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Yuan!

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,720
Yuan!

59
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:19,279
It is me! Qiang zi!

60
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Lin Qiang!

61
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:22,760
We are from the same village.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
Excuse me.

63
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,880
You have the wrong guy.

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,440
In the repair shop two years ago,

65
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,640
we were working together.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,839
Remember?

67
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:35,839
I really don't know you.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,040
Wearing fake mask, pretending something.

69
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,359
Mr. Jiang,

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,839
where is Lei Yuzheng?

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,200
He went to the bathroom.

72
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,760
In the repair shop two years ago,

73
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,959
we were working together.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,279
I really don't know you.

75
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,679
Why?

76
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Nothing.

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,359
Mr. Jiang,

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,760
did Lei Yuzheng agree to work with us?

79
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,959
He will, of course.

80
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,559
The senior Lei is still alive,

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,559
and he can't decide all by himself.

82
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,320
My sweetheart, how's your first day?

83
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,000
Well done!

84
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Well done!

85
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,959
First day at work,

86
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,079
I just served the drinks and take-out.

87
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,079
Poor girl.

88
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,519
Even no much

89
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:06,600
real work to do,

90
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:08,160
but I still learnt a lot.

91
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,679
If so, today I must

92
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,799
treat you with a nice dinner.

93
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
What to eat?

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,559
Whatever you want.

95
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,880
But,

96
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,640
there is another mission that

97
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,959
you have to meet a special guest.

98
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,799
Special guest?

99
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,399
Is he handsome?

100
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:25,959
He is as handsome as I am.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,040
What do you think?

102
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,559
Not bad.

103
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,399
Let's go then!

104
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,440
Go!

105
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,279
Are you not jealous?

106
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,640
No, I am not.

107
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:34,440
So generous you are!

108
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,040
Having a dinner with your brother,

109
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,440
why don't you tell me in advance?

110
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm not even prepared.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,320
Isn't your brother

112
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,399
a very serious

113
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:59,920
and old-fashioned guy?

114
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,600
What you said just reminds me that

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,880
he is really a very cold man.

116
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,200
I am kidding.

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,320
Yuzheng is a very nice guy.

118
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,440
We grew up together.

119
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,200
Let me show you the picture.

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,440
You won't be nervous seeing the picture.

121
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,519
Here, this is Yuzheng.

122
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,040
I was weak and sick when I was a kid.

123
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,640
Taking the medication all the time.

124
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,239
I was a sickly child.

125
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,320
But brother Yuzheng was
the king of children.

126
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,119
Look.

127
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,239
There was one time,

128
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,399
he stood on that pile of bricks,

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
and was shouting to all children.

130
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,320
From now on, if you dare
to bully Zhenrong,

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,480
you have to go through me first!

132
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,440
Although we grew up together,

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,359
he is two years older than me.

134
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,839
He has been defending me in every way.

135
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,079
Long time ago,

136
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,000
I wanted to go to medical school.

137
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:53,440
But my mom disagreed.

138
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,200
My mom said it was too hard.

139
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,119
Back then, I was difficult with my mom.

140
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,440
We didn't talk for days.

141
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,600
At last it was Yuzheng,

142
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,079
he convinced my mom.

143
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:03,359
Finally, I was allowed to go to
the medical school.

144
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,399
Look at the picture.

145
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,640
Here.

146
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,720
This is a picture of us
at the school gate.

147
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,440
This is him.

148
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,320
This is your bro.

149
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,839
Is he handsome?

150
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,160
What did you say about me?

151
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,440
Yuzheng is here!

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,799
Come on.

153
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,799
Let me introduce,

154
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,119
this is my girlfriend,

155
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:36,200
Du Xiaosu.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Miss Du,

157
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:39,919
nice to meet you.

158
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,000
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lei.

159
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,119
I've heard so much about you
from Zhenrong.

160
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,440
My ears are getting cocooned.

161
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,359
Today,

162
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,239
we need to please Yuzheng.

163
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,159
He is your boss now.

164
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,320
Didn't Zhenrong tell you?

165
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,239
Boyuan is subsidiary of Yutian.

166
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:09,760
No.

167
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,880
I really don't know.

168
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:15,919
Let me explain.

169
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:16,919
I

170
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,840
just got you an interview opportunity.

171
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,599
But your success

172
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,000
is totally on your own capabilities.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,479
My brother

174
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:24,880
is the kind of person

175
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,599
who thinks business always comes first.

176
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,440
He won't hire the one
he doesn't like,

177
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,159
isn't it?

178
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,320
Of course.

179
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,200
Today, it should be me to say thank you.

180
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,320
Thanks to Zhenrong
for his recommendation

181
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,440
on such an excellent staff for Boyuan.

182
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,919
Let's eat.

183
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
Waiter, bring the food.

184
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,559
Mr. Lei,

185
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,479
about that report,

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,359
I am really sorry.

187
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,039
You two knew each other?

188
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,159
No.

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,239
This is the first time we meet.

190
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,599
Miss Du wrote a story about me

191
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,119
when she was a journalist.

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,599
It was a good one,

193
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,119
very talented.

194
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,799
In this way,

195
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,679
I could say we have been kind of
soul mate for a long time.

196
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,400
I told you she's great!

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,200
You will definitely like her.

198
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:25,679
You act first without asking.

199
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,239
Dare I say I don't like her?

200
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,119
Though he is a well-known doctor now,

201
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:34,880
he grew up by following me everywhere.

202
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,760
He has nothing to hide from me.

203
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,200
Except for falling in love with Miss Du.

204
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,200
Tell you the truth, Miss Du,

205
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,719
I was kind of worried at the beginning.

206
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,479
My brother

207
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,599
is a dedicated person.

208
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,320
He's never been
in a serious relationship.

209
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:52,479
For love,

210
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm afraid he could be an idiot.

211
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:57,960
You can understand, right?

212
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,080
Sure.

213
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,719
Now I feel I can relax a bit.

214
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,679
Miss Du is capable and talented.

215
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,520
I think Zhenrong

216
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,359
has found her better for him.

217
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,239
Did you put ideas in his head?

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,159
He went totally different side.

219
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,200
No, I didn't.

220
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,520
Miss Du, relax.

221
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,320
He is kidding.

222
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,640
Excuse me,

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,440
I don't drink.

224
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,559
Right.

225
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,840
She is allergic to alcohol.

226
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,359
Let her drink plain water.

227
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:45,919
Is she?

228
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,119
What a pity! I thought

229
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,000
nowadays all girls could drink.

230
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,359
Well,

231
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,359
I wish you all the best.

232
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,679
May all your wishes come true.

233
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,919
How weird your toast sounds.

234
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,520
But thanks to Yuzheng

235
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:15,039
for his great support all the time.

236
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,400
The second toast,

237
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:22,320
Miss Du,

238
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,599
I wanna propose to you.

239
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,280
Water is fine.

240
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:38,000
Miss Du doesn't have to stand.

241
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,080
Let's sit and talk.

242
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,679
There are two things I want to ask you.

243
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,239
First,

244
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:51,320
you look younger than Zhenrong,

245
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,799
but

246
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,840
I feel you are more mature.

247
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,119
About these subtleties in the society,

248
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,719
you know more.

249
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
I hope you can treat him well.

250
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,599
He can't be hurt at any time.

251
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,239
Can you do that?

252
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,239
Zhenrong is my boyfriend,

253
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,679
I would never hurt him.

254
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,679
Hearing your words,

255
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,919
I am relieved.

256
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,440
Second,

257
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,520
now you both have found

258
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:20,679
the person you love,

259
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:22,520
I advise you

260
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:24,359
do not have any more other ideas.

261
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,760
After all, too many desires

262
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,559
are not good.

263
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,239
Yuzheng,

264
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:35,280
I am not a playboy.

265
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:38,000
How can I have other ideas?

266
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,640
Look, your brother is old
and likes nagging.

267
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,520
Miss Du,

268
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,919
can you do that?

269
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,080
Having Zhenrong

270
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,679
is the happiest thing in my life.

271
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,640
In my heart,

272
00:13:55,479 --> 00:13:57,479
nothing is more important.

273
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,039
Zhenrong,

274
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:11,039
you are in love,

275
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm happy for you.

276
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,320
But I still have to remind you

277
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,440
not to misjudge.

278
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,359
What do you mean?

279
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,200
You were just praising her.

280
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,119
Look at yourself now,

281
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,919
easily got pissed off for no reason.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,320
I say she's good or not,
it doesn't mean anything.

283
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,359
You two just met each other.

284
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,840
You guys need time to know each other.

285
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,799
Don't casually get yourself involved.

286
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,280
Are you worried about

287
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,239
I might be robbed of money or sex?

288
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:47,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,239
Well, I'm leaving.

290
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
Goodbye, Miss Du.

291
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:57,080
Bye. Mr. Lei.

292
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,239
Let's go.

293
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Turn left and go downstairs.

294
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,479
Zhenrong,

295
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,679
I,

296
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:25,960
I kind of want to quit.

297
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:31,280
For what?

298
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
Is it because

299
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:36,559
I helped you find the job?

300
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:39,200
I've already told you.

301
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,640
You got the job on your own, not me.

302
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:46,119
I'm afraid of being misunderstood

303
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,520
because of your relationship
with your brother.

304
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:50,200
Isn't your dream

305
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,679
to be an architect?

306
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,640
Boyuan is the best platform.

307
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,559
Promise me.

308
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,320
Don't give up no matter how hard it is.

309
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:02,679
Keep holding on!

310
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,919
Ok?

311
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,119
Ok.

312
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:11,200
Come on. Let me carry you.

313
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
I am gonna throw you into the river.

314
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,840
No!

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,760
I won't, come on, come!

316
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,440
Come on!

317
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,000
Come on!

318
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,239
My dear baby!

319
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,200
What did your brother just say to you?

320
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,080
Does he have a bad impression on me?

321
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,640
Does he not like me very much?

322
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,280
How so?

323
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,479
My brother said you were very nice,

324
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,159
very talented.

325
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,559
Why don't I believe it?

326
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:52,359
But Du Xiaosu,

327
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,440
you seem to get heavier.

328
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,159
How is it possible?

329
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:00,440
I just had one big meal.

330
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,559
I got heavier.

331
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,479
You finish it all for each meal.

332
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,000
Mr. Lei,

333
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,920
Miss Jiang came to see you again.

334
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,520
You were not here,

335
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,880
and she's really pissed off.

336
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,359
We can't keep it like this.

337
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,920
Why don't you get her a position?

338
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,319
Here it goes.

339
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,359
In Boyuan,

340
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,319
you find her an easy job

341
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,319
and keep her away from me.

342
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:26,920
Understand.

343
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,520
By the way, tell the new girl

344
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
come to me after work.

345
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,439
Do you mean Du Xiaosu?

346
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,439
Mr. Lei,

347
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,040
isn't it appropriate for
her to come here?

348
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,199
Miss Du,

349
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:16,680
come in, please.

350
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,160
Mr. Lei,

351
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,719
are you looking for me?

352
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:25,959
Miss Du,

353
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,000
have a seat.

354
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,439
How many times have I met with Miss Du?

355
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,319
It should be the third time.

356
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,479
Mr. Lei,

357
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:09,359
did I do something wrong?

358
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,439
Miss Du,

359
00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:12,920
what do you think of Zhenrong?

360
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:16,920
Zhenrong?

361
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,520
He is very nice.

362
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,520
If he is not a doctor,

363
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,560
or he can't help Miss Du to find a job,

364
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
is he still very nice?

365
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,000
What do you mean by that?

366
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,640
At dinner that day,

367
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,959
Zhenrong mentioned that

368
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,880
you got the job because you are capable.

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Sure.

370
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
Probably Miss Du is very capable.

371
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,119
But, Miss Du, I want you to know

372
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,439
so many people come to Boyuan

373
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,680
to apply for jobs every day.

374
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,479
Not everyone

375
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,479
can get a job in Boyuan like Miss Du.

376
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,959
The reason Boyuan has a job for Miss Du,

377
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,479
is because I made a call.

378
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
You are smart.

379
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,160
You ask someone I can't say no for help.

380
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,599
Mr. Lei,

381
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,520
I think you misunderstood.

382
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:14,719
Zhenrong asked you for help,

383
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,479
I was kept in the dark.

384
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,280
If I had known,

385
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:19,719
I would not have accepted it.

386
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:23,359
It sounds like that

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,719
Miss Du is a person with good character.

388
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,959
Well then.

389
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,599
By the way.

390
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,280
Miss Du was really
good at your last job.

391
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:36,239
Why did you quit?

392
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,239
I don't like to do entertainment.

393
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,800
There was nothing else to do
when I graduated from college.

394
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
I couldn't find a job.

395
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,560
It was only out of expediency.

396
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
Expediency?

397
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Miss Du,

398
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,119
the so called expediency

399
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:55,640
is to be inconstant.

400
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:57,880
You can make more money in Boyuan.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,319
That's why you quit your last job.

402
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
Can I think like this?

403
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,599
If one day you meet someone

404
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,160
better than Zhenrong,

405
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,160
Miss Du,

406
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,239
you will kick him away.

407
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,239
Mr. Lei,

408
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,520
you can humiliate me.

409
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:17,119
But you can't humiliate

410
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,599
the love between me and Zhenrong.

411
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:21,640
Zhenrong and I really love each other.

412
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,839
I really like him.

413
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
That's why I'm with him.

414
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,479
I never thought to
take advantage of him.

415
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,680
How can you say this to me?

416
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,079
It's because

417
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
I know who you really are.

418
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,079
What?

419
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:35,439
Now that Miss Du has short memories,

420
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,280
I don't have to

421
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,959
say the unnecessary words.

422
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,680
But I have to tell you

423
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,359
being in love is like looking for a job.

424
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,719
You've got what you want.

425
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,079
You should cherish it.

426
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Never

427
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
look up from one mountain to another.

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Zhenrong is my good friend,

429
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,839
also my brother.

430
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,680
I will never

431
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:58,239
allow anyone to hurt him

432
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,319
for one's own gain.

433
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,239
I understand your pains.

434
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,880
But I think you're worrying too much.

435
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Zhenrong loves me.

436
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,040
I love him too.

437
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,040
I would never hurt him in the least.

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That would be the best.

439
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:14,760
If I just

440
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,400
hurt Miss Du's self-esteem,

441
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,760
I apologize to you.

442
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,439
But I'll tell you again,

443
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,119
you've already had a lot,

444
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,359
and you are already very happy.

445
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
Zhenrong is a good man.

446
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,959
You should treat him well.

447
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,439
Don't let him down.

448
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,439
If Mr. Lei came here today,

449
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,319
just to tell me this,

450
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,920
I think

451
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,959
I could leave.

452
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,000
Miss Du,

453
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:50,640
remember what I said.

454
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,160
Mr. Lei,

455
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,520
thank you for your advice.

456
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,319
Yuzheng,

457
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:08,160
do you know
what Zhenrong is up to lately?

458
00:23:08,239 --> 00:23:09,319
He's not at home for the whole day.

459
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,359
Tell me the truth.

460
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,800
Does he have a girlfriend?

461
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,760
Keep an eye on him for me.

462
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,160
If anything happened to Zhenrong
out there,

463
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,400
do let me know.

464
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,400
Aunt Shao,

465
00:23:22,439 --> 00:23:23,800
Zhenrong indeed has a girlfriend.

466
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,359
For details,

467
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:26,560
you'd better ask him yourself.

468
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
Zhenrong is back.

469
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,079
Mrs. Zhao,

470
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,000
where is my mom?

471
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,079
Mrs. Shao,

472
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Zhenrong is back.

473
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,560
Why so late?

474
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:42,880
Mom.

475
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,239
There was an emergency.

476
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,319
It was pretty bad.

477
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,560
That's how I was held up.

478
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:50,400
You brat.

479
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,239
Let me ask you.

480
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,000
Is your mother unreasonable?

481
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,280
Where does this come from?

482
00:23:58,199 --> 00:23:59,239
Now that you have a girlfriend,

483
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
why don't you take her back home?

484
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,239
Without telling me,

485
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,920
are you afraid of me to bully her?

486
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,439
My brother is not a secret keeper.

487
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,359
You two fooled me.

488
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,439
Take your girlfriend back home tomorrow.

489
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,479
I will invite her for dinner.

490
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,359
Your mother will treat her well.

491
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,280
Am I understood?

492
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,000
OK. Fine.

493
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
It is the weekend tomorrow.

494
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,640
Then I

495
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,119
will take her back to meet you.

496
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What's her name?

497
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:29,839
Du Xiaosu.

498
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:31,599
What does she look like?

499
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:32,880
As beautiful as you are.

500
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,119
Dr. Shao, what are we to eat today?

501
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,479
Let's go home to have dinner.

502
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,719
Home?

503
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,079
To meet my mother.

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Come on.

505
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,400
You have to tell me in advance.

506
00:24:54,479 --> 00:24:56,800
Otherwise, I'm not prepared at all.

507
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,640
I don't even know how many people

508
00:24:58,719 --> 00:24:59,800
there are in your family.

509
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,800
If I just go there recklessly,

510
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,040
I'm afraid...

511
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,560
Do you love me?

512
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,880
But what if they don't like me.

513
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,800
My mom likes me.

514
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,719
I like you.

515
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,000
So,

516
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,959
my mom will definitely like you.

517
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:39,760
Let's go.

518
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:47,319
This

519
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,079
is your home?

520
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,079
Yes. Let's go inside.

521
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,239
Come on.

522
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,119
Shao Zhenrong,

523
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,719
I feel

524
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't know you any more.

525
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,199
Xiaosu,

526
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,520
I'm still who I am.

527
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,000
My family

528
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,920
has nothing to do with our relationship.

529
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,719
Since you are here,
don't try to run away.

530
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,280
Come on.

531
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:19,719
Let's go.

532
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:21,199
Come on.

533
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,199
Have some tea.

534
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,400
Thank you, Madam.

535
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,239
My son

536
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,359
is a very nice guy.

537
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,880
He is stubborn
and has a strong personality.

538
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
He is worried about gossiping

539
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,439
and refuses to
use his family's resources.

540
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,599
From school to work,

541
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,959
he basically did all that by himself.

542
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,079
He didn't use

543
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,280
much of the family's money.

544
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,959
I assume that
his colleagues in the hospital,

545
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,959
until now,

546
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,880
don't know about our family.

547
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,439
He is not to hide from you

548
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,280
for not telling you.

549
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,319
Dear,

550
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,439
don't take it personally.

551
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:05,839
No, I didn't.

552
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
It's just

553
00:27:07,719 --> 00:27:10,040
a little different from
what I thought.

554
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,920
Then what do you think

555
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,719
our family is like?

556
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,640
Just now,

557
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,920
when I came to the gate,

558
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,920
I got stunned at once.

559
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,359
But

560
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,599
you are being so nice.

561
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,640
You don't look like

562
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,520
a powerful woman
dominating the business world.

563
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,959
You are very courteous and accessible,

564
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,400
just like a teacher.

565
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,160
My mother was a college teacher.

566
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,040
Really?

567
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,239
She was the associate professor
of history.

568
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,119
More than a decade ago,

569
00:27:46,199 --> 00:27:47,119
his father got sick.

570
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:49,560
The business was on me.

571
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,680
For the family,

572
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,239
and also for the hard work
of two generations,

573
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,199
I had to stick to it.

574
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,640
To be honest,

575
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,040
at that time,

576
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,439
it was really hard.

577
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,880
Afterwards, his father passed away.

578
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:04,280
Business is also being taken care of
by some others.

579
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
I just care about major issues.

580
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I'm much at leisure now.

581
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
So I have time to have tea

582
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,439
and raise flowers at home.

583
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,479
Look at this big house.

584
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,359
There are only me and Mrs. Zhao.

585
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,439
Zhenrong seldom comes back.

586
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,800
I am pretty at leisure.

587
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,280
Though I don't push Zhenrong,

588
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,479
in fact I wish him could

589
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,359
have a girlfriend
who loves him tenderly.

590
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,599
In this way,
our house will be more lively.

591
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,239
We, parents,

592
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,719
just need something to hope for,

593
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,880
don't we?

594
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,479
Dear,

595
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:45,119
what do your parents do?

596
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,199
My father works in a bank.

597
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,760
My mother is also a teacher,

598
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,119
but

599
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
a primary school teacher.

600
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,040
That's good.

601
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,400
Where are you from?

602
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,520
Pingtan.

603
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,479
Very good.

604
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,359
Mr. Lei,

605
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,800
where are we going?

606
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:26,280
You'll know when we get there.

607
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:43,520
It's the first time you've stood
at some place so high, isn't it?

608
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,359
Yes.

609
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,079
The first time.

610
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,719
Then you're inevitably nervous.

611
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,599
Just like the cooperation
between Yutian and Xinsheng.

612
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:58,479
Tell me about it.

613
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,680
Your plan for this piece of land.

614
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,040
Right now?

615
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,359
Right here?

616
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,040
Why?

617
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,439
Can't you?

618
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,239
Mr. Lin,

619
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,719
you're not going to tell me
you're afraid of heights, are you?

620
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,520
Mr. Lei,

621
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,959
actually there is no need for us
to be here.

622
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,839
The sand table is good enough.

623
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,479
Because the sand table
and the actual site

624
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
are basically the same.

625
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,079
No.

626
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,640
I prefer seeing is believing.

627
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,599
Mr. Lin,

628
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,119
as for the value of this land,

629
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:34,400
I think Xinsheng is aware of that.

630
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,880
You

631
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,680
don't have the approval paper.

632
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,719
About this,

633
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:41,839
I'm not wrong, am I?

634
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
If we use

635
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,959
oriole from behind

636
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,199
to describe your
cooperation with Yutian,

637
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,479
isn't it appropriate?

638
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,520
Mr. Lei,

639
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,920
this project

640
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,160
is the sincere cooperation
between the two seniors after all.

641
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,800
Though there are difficulties,

642
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:04,280
we can solve them.

643
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,119
If this cooperation is successful,

644
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:08,880
it will be a monument.

645
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,359
What do you think?

646
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,920
A monument.

647
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
You are indeed forethoughtful.

648
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:34,920
Hello sir. How many of you, please?

649
00:31:35,199 --> 00:31:35,920
Table for two, please.

650
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:37,400
Find me a quiet place.

651
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,439
OK. Come in, please.

652
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,079
But these two places.

653
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,040
Here, the design is not reasonable.

654
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,520
Minor changes are needed.

655
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,959
Am I understood?

656
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:46,760
Yes.

657
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,280
I also think the details here...
(Shao Zhenrong)

658
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,119
Right.

659
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,000
Nothing.

660
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:55,959
Go on, it's OK.

661
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,119
As I said just now,

662
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,199
design it quickly.

663
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,160
OK. Thank you, Mr. Ning.

664
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:09,979
(Shao Zhenrong)

665
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:12,640
Hi.

666
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,760
Why are you calling me at this time?

667
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,880
I miss you.

668
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:24,040
It doesn't matter
whether you miss me or not.

669
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,839
I still have one hour of work.

670
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,800
Come over here after work then.

671
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,040
Xiaosu,

672
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,359
let's have dinner tonight.

673
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:42,880
It's on me.

674
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,199
Let's have dinner together.

675
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,760
Tonight,

676
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,520
I'm not available.

677
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,520
What're you up to?

678
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,560
Are you going out
with your boyfriend,

679
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,479
aren't you?

680
00:32:58,719 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm telling you,

681
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,880
it is said that
her boyfriend is handsome and excellent.

682
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:03,479
He is said to be a doctor.

683
00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:04,920
When will you introduce him to us,

684
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,199
huh?

685
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:06,760
Fine.

686
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I'll introduce to you next time.

687
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,439
Looking forward to that.

688
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,439
It is said her boyfriend is very nice.

689
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,719
See you tomorrow then.

690
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:15,839
See you.

691
00:33:15,959 --> 00:33:17,439
Introduce to us next time!

692
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,199
OK. Bye.

693
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,199
Bye.

694
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,599
Hello.

695
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,839
Is Miss Du there?

696
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,800
This is Shao Zhenrong's mother.

697
00:33:27,479 --> 00:33:28,479
Are you available?

698
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm waiting for you
in a coffee house nearby.

699
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,760
Aunt Shao,

700
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,119
at this hour...

701
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,719
I might...

702
00:33:40,959 --> 00:33:42,319
Just a few words.

703
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,479
Don't worry.

704
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,880
It won't take you long.

705
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,680
OK. I'll be there right away.

706
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:07,619

(Subscription Agreement)

708
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,560
Xiaosu!

709
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,919
Yes?

710
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,959
Let's buy a house.

711
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:16,760
Just two of us.

712
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,439
No one can disturb us.

713
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:28,679
Welcome.

714
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,120
Miss Du,

715
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,120
please have a seat.

716
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,560
Have a seat.

717
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,239
Two cups of coffee.

718
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:56,539
(Shao Zhenrong)

719
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,239
(Shao Zhenrong)

720
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,479
Miss Du,

721
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,919
I hope our conversation today

722
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,120
will only be confined to the two of us.

723
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,000
Please make sure that
you won't tell anyone else.

724
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,919
(Shao Zhenrong)

725
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:16,819
(Shao Zhenrong)

726
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,399
The subscriber you dialed is temporarily
not connected.

727
00:35:21,479 --> 00:35:22,520
Please redial later.

728
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,600
Miss Du,

729
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,040
you were saying

730
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,879
your home is far from Shanghai,
isn't it?

731
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,560
Yes, pretty far away.

732
00:35:43,439 --> 00:35:44,520
Hundreds of kilometers away.

733
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:52,879
Madam,

734
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,239
do you know Pingtan?

735
00:35:56,479 --> 00:35:57,320
Yes, I do.

736
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,399
I went there decades ago.

737
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,239
Then you must know the ancient bridge

738
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,679
carved with a fish turning into a dragon
in the peach blossom.

739
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,879
My home was nearby.

740
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,000
When I was a kid,

741
00:36:07,439 --> 00:36:09,399
my father often took me there to play.

742
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,959
There were small bridges,
flowing water and greens.

743
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,199
It was very very beautiful.

744
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,360
It was a pity that
we moved away afterwards.

745
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,959
But at that time,

746
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,639
my father loved taking pictures,

747
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,320
so many old pictures have been left.

748
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,679
As long as I think of my childhood,

749
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,719
I'll take out the pictures
and have a look at them.

750
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,439
Your father,

751
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,000
what is his name?

752
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:32,879
Du Maokai.

753
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,040
Drink.

754
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:06,039
(Du Xiaosu. Come over here quickly)

755
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,139
(Happy New Year)

756
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:27,520
Miss Du,

757
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,639
I'm done.

758
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,399
You are a clever girl.

759
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,959
You know what to do.

760
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,120
I hope you do well.

761
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,400
(Dad)

762
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,840
Dad.

763
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Xiao Su.

764
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,360
Have you had dinner yet?

765
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,959
Why are you calling so late?

766
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,399
How are you doing recently?

767
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,120
I am fine.

768
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,840
I am just missing you and mom.

769
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,199
It's cold in winter in Shanghai.

770
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,600
Wrap yourself up.

771
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,639
Are you good with Zhenrong?

772
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,120
Me and Zhenrong?

773
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
We are fine.

774
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,000
You and mom also need to
take care of yourselves.

775
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,520
I'll go back to see you when I'm free.

776
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,399
Don't worry.

777
00:38:47,879 --> 00:38:48,959
You are away from home,

778
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,479
take care of yourself.

779
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,120
So be it.

780
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:00,679
Hey gal, why you are home so late?

781
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,520
Where have you been?

782
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,280
Did you go out with Dr. Shao?

783
00:40:06,399 --> 00:40:07,719
I am talking to you.

784
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,000
What's the matter with you?

785
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Did your leader swear at you?

786
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,919
I am tired. I have to get some sleep.

787
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,760
