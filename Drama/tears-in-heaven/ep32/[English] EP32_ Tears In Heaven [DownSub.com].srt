I gotta go.

18
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,479
Have some of this, without alcohol.

19
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:22,839
Come, come, come.

20
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,000
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,759
Come.

22
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,279
All the guests here today

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,679
are my friends.

24
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,600
Let me introduce you to each other.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,639
This is a famous architect,

26
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,800
and a talented lady, Du Xiaosu.

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,399
Emma.

28
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,160
Her family do car hardware business.

29
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:41,839
A great beauty.

30
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,039
This is Ningning.

31
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,919
Partner of Dacheng firm.

32
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,119
Wow, this gentleman is

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,679
an Internet upstart, Xiaozhi.

34
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,839
Now, half of the famous
Internet celebrities

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,880
are signed with his company.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,759
I don't need to say much about her.

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,839
Super star. You should
have seen her on screens.

38
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,800
Super star. Super star.

39
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:01,360
Thank you.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,559
Super star, hello.

41
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,080
Miss Du,

42
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,839
I love architects.

43
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:11,279
Last time, when I was in
Dubai on vacation,

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,039
there is a building called...

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,039
Dancing Towers.

46
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,600
Dancing Towers.

47
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes, the Dancing Towers.

48
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,240
I heard that the designer

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,360
is also a great beauty.

50
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,839
Is Miss Du the same as her?

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,720
Have you participated in
the design of many landmark buildings?

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,639
Dance... Dancing Towers
is the creation of Zaha.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,639
She won the Pritzker Prize.

54
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,919
I think

55
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm not comparable to her.

56
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:38,759
Then Miss Du,

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,759
what projects have you been involved in?

58
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,880
Tell us more about it.

59
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:45,919
I... I just started my own studio.

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
All small cases.

61
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,720
Oh, small cases.

62
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,160
Miss Du, you are being modest.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,720
Don't just talk.

64
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,880
Have fun!

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,000
Mr. Lin,

66
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,720
why not stand in the light?

67
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,480
You're the center of attention.

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,799
No, I'm not.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm here just for company,

70
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,079
and I will leave soon.

71
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Don't go.

72
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,160
You're here for fun.

73
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,279
You have to have fun
before you go.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,760
Why you are so quiet?

75
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
Do I need to talk during dancing?

76
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,279
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

77
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,079
You don't have anything to say to me?

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
I heard you were back to Yutian.

79
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Congratulations!

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,760
That's it?

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Nothing else?

82
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Nothing else.

83
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:11,320
But I have something to say.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,799
Mr. Lin, when you feel unhappy,

85
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,320
drinking hurts you even more.

86
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,359
What makes you unhappy?

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,640
Buddy, tell me about it.

88
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,200
How do you know that I'm unhappy?

89
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:36,040
The feelings in your heart

90
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,079
are all on your face.

91
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,000
Let me guess.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,040
Now that my buddy is back

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,359
and you're still at that position,

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,000
you feel a little embarrassed
and uncomfortable?

95
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,679
Buddy, you're thinking too much.

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,359
Excuse me for a moment.

97
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't go, Mr. Lin.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
You haven't had enough fun yet.

99
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,799
You need alcohol now.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,399
It's fun here.

101
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,679
It's better than going home
and drinking alone.

102
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:20,119
Come on, fill up, fill up.

103
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,559
Xiaosu,

104
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:27,200
why cannot we just have a nice talk?

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,799
I don't know why.

106
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,200
I think, you and I,

107
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,640
seem to be running out of topics.

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,160
Well,

109
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,040
do you think I'm different from before?

110
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,279
Yes.

111
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,559
Don't you think people
behave differently

112
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,239
in different environments?

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,760
Maybe what I knew about you was wrong.

114
00:06:56,559 --> 00:07:00,640
Maybe this is where you belong to.

115
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,760
Xiaosu, I know

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,440
you may not like
this kind of environment.

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,119
But you have to get used to it.

118
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,600
No, I don't have to.

119
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
It is quite different from my own life.

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,760
You never know.

121
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,200
In the future,

122
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,480
maybe it will become
a part of your life.

123
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,480
It has nothing to do with me.

124
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,320
But it has something to do with me.

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,399
Don't you want to

126
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,720
try to get used to it for me?

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,640
Lei Yuzheng, you have your own friends.

128
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,200
Look at them.

129
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,279
They all have strong background,

130
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,200
and have been to
very famous universities.

131
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,959
They grew up
in such kind of environment,

132
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,640
so they feel comfortable to stay here.

133
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,480
But for me,

134
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,720
I have my own life.

135
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:54,359
Don't you think

136
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:56,079
I'm a little different from them?

137
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
That's why I asked Shangguan
to invite you here.

138
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,799
I just hope you could come more often to

139
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,959
some of this kind of parties.

140
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,839
Let you get used to it.

141
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,320
Do you think
I could really get used to it?

142
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,920
Xiaosu, I know

143
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,320
they may make you uncomfortable.

144
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,519
But once you get to know them,

145
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
they're not really so bad.

146
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,000
You shouldn't be biased to them.

147
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:27,880
Biased?

148
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,880
You think that
I cannot get along with your friends,

149
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,640
just because I have bias against them?

150
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,159
It seems that our perceptions on this

151
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,599
are still different.

152
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
Xiaosu,

153
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:39,400
I didn't mean that.

154
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,080
Lei Yuzheng,

155
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,239
to your friends, I don't need to

156
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,200
prove anything.

157
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,280
Perhaps, for the relationship
between us before,

158
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,039
I have misunderstanding on it.

159
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,719
Just take it as a dream.

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,559
Do you think everything we've

161
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,440
been through is a dream?

162
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,400
Everyone would be vulnerable sometimes.

163
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,159
You were in a different
situation back then.

164
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Maybe

165
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,039
you just needed someone to rely on.

166
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:17,640
So that's how you think of me.

167
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,080
In your mind,

168
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,599
I'm just a guy
who needs comfort when in trouble.

169
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,960
And when everything is getting better,
I will give you up?

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,640
Am I such kind of
heartless guy in your mind?

171
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,840
It seems today is not a good day

172
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:30,200
for us to talk about this.

173
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,080
I'd rather not talk,

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,919
lest it spoils your mood.

175
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,239
Xiaosu.

176
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,520
Everyone would be vulnerable sometimes.

177
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,200
You were in a different
situation back then.

178
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,880
Maybe

179
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,159
you just needed someone to rely on.

180
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:06,559
Tired?

181
00:10:09,119 --> 00:10:11,559
You cannot drive after drinking.

182
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,640
Let me drive for you.

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,719
Thank you.

184
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,599
Xu You, you must be tired too.

185
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,799
What about not going back tonight?

186
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,159
What do you mean?

187
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,359
I just said,

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,200
you could stay
at my place for the night.

189
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,400
Drive faster.

190
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:31,599
Have a seat, please.

191
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,599
Where are you going?

192
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,640
To change.

193
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,000
As a private investigator,

194
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,239
there is nothing wrong
with this professional vigilance.

195
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,919
But I don't think

196
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,400
Lin Xiangyuan and Xie Li will do this.

197
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,200
Because
they don't have the guts to do this.

198
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Mr. Lei, if you want to get it clearly,
it is not hard.

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
But have you ever thought of
the consequences?

200
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:27,760
If because of our investigation,

201
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,960
your situation
becomes more difficult.

202
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,559
I hope you won't blame us.

203
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,880
I have to reassess my opponent.

204
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,400
Xu You,

205
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm out for exercises
and will be back soon.

206
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,304
(Lei Yuzheng)

207
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,860
(Du Xiaosu)

208
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,599
Xiaosu, this is Xu You.

209
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,760
You're done exercising?

210
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,799
It's going to rain outside.

211
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:22,359
Have a good rest tonight.

212
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,479
Where shall I sleep?

213
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,520
Yuzheng,

214
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,479
Miss Xu's room

215
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:31,640
is ready.

216
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,239
Go get some sleep.

217
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,719
Your phone rang just now.

218
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm afraid it is something urgent,
so I answered it.

219
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,520
Mr. Lei, it's me.

220
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,039
I have something you want.

221
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:01,039
Come to me right away.

222
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,159
I'm afraid a long delay
may cause trouble.

223
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
I will send you
the location to your phone.

224
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,520
OK.

225
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,320
Any progress?

226
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:43,119
There is some progress.

227
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,280
We're still following up.

228
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,000
Any more information,

229
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
just call me.

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,599
Sure.

231
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Do you know me?

232
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,039
Why are you following me?

233
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,039
We work for someone.

234
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,080
Don't worry.

235
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,280
As long as you give us what you have,

236
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,080
we will not hurt you.

237
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,919
I don't know you,

238
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,679
and you don't know me, either.

239
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:45,440
Who are you following me?

240
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,640
For money? I can understand.

241
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,679
Take a man's money
to avert his misfortune.

242
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,599
But you have to think about it.

243
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,280
Persons like you

244
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,760
should have real skills.

245
00:16:58,239 --> 00:16:59,320
You can have a try.

246
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,640
Sorry.

247
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,199
Here you are.

248
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,439
But...

249
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,599
It's OK. It's just a scratch.

250
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,119
Talk.

251
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,319
Who made you follow me?

252
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,520
No talking?

253
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,680
Believe it or not, I'll break your arm.

254
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,640
You're afraid to say it out loud.

255
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,760
Go back and tell your boss.

256
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
If there is anything,

257
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,239
come to me directly.

258
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,160
Don't use such dirty tricks.

259
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Go.

260
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,460
(Calling 18931240079...)

261
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,632
(Calling Liu Siyang)

262
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,079
Liu Siyang, where are you?

263
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,760
Go to my place.

264
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Now!

265
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
Yuzheng, you are finally back.

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm really worried about you
in such a heavy rain.

267
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:44,119
Uncle Duan, is Siyang here?

268
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:46,079
Siyang is here,
waiting for you in the room.

269
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,839
By the way, Uncle Duan.

270
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,199
Did a stranger

271
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,239
call just now?

272
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,839
No. What happened?

273
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,599
Nothing.

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,239
Uncle Duan, I have something
to discuss with you.

275
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
It has been a long time

276
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,400
since you went back to
your hometown last time.

277
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,839
Why don't you go back to your hometown
for a while?

278
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,119
You're right.

279
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,719
Your dad passed away, and you grew up.

280
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:21,640
Uncle Duan is getting older and older.

281
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
It is time to go back to hometown.

282
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,119
Uncle Duan, you misunderstood.

283
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,319
What are you talking about?

284
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,760
I mean

285
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,719
you can go back to hometown
and have a rest for a while.

286
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,560
I'll pick you up later.

287
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,199
How can I let you go?

288
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,439
I have to take care of you.

289
00:19:38,359 --> 00:19:39,359
Really?

290
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:40,199
Of course.

291
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,719
OK, I will do as you said.

292
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,359
Please pack your bags tomorrow.

293
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll ask Qunfei
to buy the ticket for you.

294
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:48,599
Take you to the airport. Sounds good?

295
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,760
OK, go.

296
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,439
Siyang is waiting for you.

297
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,520
I will prepare you two some snacks.

298
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,079
Don't bother, Uncle Duan.

299
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,479
You can go to bed for rest.

300
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:07,439
Yuzheng.

301
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,839
have you seen the stock of Yutian
these days?

302
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,520
What happened?

303
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,160
These days, the stock of Yutian

304
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
has gone up so weirdly.

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,319
The stock of Yutian rose,
while the whole market was falling.

306
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,400
Siyang, have a look at this.

307
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,560
That's all they found.

308
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
Tomorrow, please check

309
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,280
all these accounts.

310
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:39,959
According to their report,

311
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,760
during that period, all these accounts

312
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,280
transferred a large amount of money

313
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,920
to buy Yutian's stocks.

314
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,080
(Insurance agencies won't sell stocks
in large amount by the end of the year)

315
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,479
Yuzheng, check out this report.

316
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,400
Was it the date that Yutian and S.G

317
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,800
signed the contract?

318
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,300
(Exclusive Reveal.
Saturday December 17, 2016)

319
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,319
Yes, it is.

320
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,239
Then, it is obvious.

321
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,880
The person who gave you the information

322
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:09,800
must have known there was something
wrong with the reporter who wrote it,

323
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,479
and made a copy of it.

324
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:15,319
So this reporter, Li Lu,
(Reporter: Li Lu)

325
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,520
before...

326
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,959
He knew everything.

327
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,920
Someone inside Yutian leaked the news.

328
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,280
On the same day,
the report was published.

329
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,160
Right.

330
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,719
It's absolutely not a coincidence.

331
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,520
We have to find this reporter,

332
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,959
and ask him about it.

333
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,079
Maybe

334
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,359
we can find out who did this.

335
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,199
Leave it to me.

336
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,239
You're too exposed.

337
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,599
Besides, there is someone
following you.

338
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,040
At this time, you must not
alert the enemy.

339
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,959
Take care.

340
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,000
Sure.

341
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,680
Hello.

342
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,400
Hello.

343
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,520
I really appreciate
reporter Li's talent.

344
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:03,359
I hope to get him
to give an interview to our boss.

345
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,280
I am so sorry.

346
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,560
Li Lu resigned.

347
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,079
Resigned?

348
00:22:08,439 --> 00:22:09,560
When?

349
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,599
Around one year ago.

350
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,400
He was in such a hurry.

351
00:22:15,719 --> 00:22:16,920
He quit in the morning,

352
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,800
and packed up and left in the afternoon.

353
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,199
Do you know where did he go?

354
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:24,520
I don't know.

355
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
By the way,

356
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:30,400
chief editor,

357
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,839
can you please take a look at this?

358
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,780
(Insurance agencies won't sell stocks
in large amount by the end of the year)

359
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,280
This is our newspaper.

360
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,479
This report was written by Li Lu, right?

361
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes, what's wrong?

362
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:42,839
You are so experienced in media.

363
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:45,839
Please look at this report of Yutian.

364
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,520
It was issued on the date of Yutian's
information leakage case.

365
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,479
The case hasn't been made public.

366
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,319
How did he know about it?

367
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,800
Well, you're an outsider.

368
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,199
If everything our reporters reported

369
00:22:58,439 --> 00:22:59,959
was after it has been made public,

370
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,920
wouldn't we be worthless?

371
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,920
Do you have Li Lu's home address?

372
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,040
Yes.

373
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:08,520
But you may not find him.

374
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,000
Why?

375
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,599
He is from Guizhou.
In Shanghai, he has no apartment.

376
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,199
He has been renting.

377
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,640
Who knows where he's moving to now?

378
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,680
From Guizhou.

379
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:21,920
So you have the address on his ID?

380
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,359
Excuse me, do you have anyone

381
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:33,560
named Li Lu here?

382
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:36,000
Li Lu resigned a year ago.

383
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,239
He also moved.

384
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:38,599
No one knows where he is now.

385
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,640
One year ago.

386
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,000
That means he resigned
as soon as the report was published.

387
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes, that means
he's afraid of being found out.

388
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,640
He was pretty sure

389
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,000
that someone is bound to find him.

390
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,160
So he hid.

391
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,319
By the way,

392
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,040
have you heard from the person
who gave you the information?

393
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,680
What happened?

394
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,160
It is my fault.

395
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,000
I didn't expect it so complicated.

396
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,640
Our investigation must have threatened

397
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,839
the interests of the opponent.

398
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,239
So...

399
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,000
They are putting all their eggs
in one basket.

400
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
Lin Xiangyuan is so cruel and merciless.

401
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,760
Maybe it is not Lin Xiangyuan.

402
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,400
He certainly didn't want me
to go back to Yutian.

403
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,000
But he should not be that kind of crazy.

404
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,479
Oh,

405
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,160
have a look at

406
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,040
these investment accounts.

407
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:38,239
I have investigated.

408
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:41,000
Before Li Lu reported it,

409
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,319
that is when Yutian and
S.G signed the contract,

410
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,760
all these accounts

411
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,000
kept buying large
amount of Yutian's stock.

412
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
When did they sell the stock?

413
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,560
That's so weird.

414
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,479
They didn't sell.

415
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:54,400
It is a large amount of money.

416
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,520
Even with profits, they did not sell.

417
00:24:58,439 --> 00:24:59,640
What were they thinking of?

418
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,920
They didn't care about the profits.

419
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,719
Siyang,

420
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
use all your resources,

421
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
and help me investigate
all these accounts'

422
00:25:06,959 --> 00:25:08,160
sources.

423
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,800
I will call Shangguan,

424
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,640
and ask him to help find Li Lu.

425
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,119
You focus on
investigating these accounts.

426
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,680
Mr. Lin,
according to our market research,

427
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,959
the financial budget of this year

428
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,040
is good.

429
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,479
So marketing department

430
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
hopes to add two more projects.

431
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:24,640
We want to initial a plan.

432
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,520
So, we hope, next year,

433
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,560
with the financial budget,

434
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,040
we can increase a bit.

435
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,319
Hope Mr. Lin will consider it.

436
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:35,920
Hello.

437
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,040
Mr. Lin?

438
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,839
Hello.

439
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:45,520
Here you are.

440
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,119
Nice to meet you.

441
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,599
Thank you for meeting me in person.

442
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:52,640
Thank you for meeting me in person.

443
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,839
OK. You go back to your work
and close the door for me.

444
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,640
Mr. Yu, I overheard a piece of news.

445
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,839
To be precise,

446
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,359
Yutian will cooperate with
an oversea company, S.G.

447
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,560
What kind of project?

448
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,000
Yutian Universal Entertainment Center.

449
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,439
Please.

450
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,800
Let me tell you.

451
00:26:23,239 --> 00:26:25,000
We are going to acquire Yutian.

452
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:27,599
What? Acquire Yutian?

453
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,599
Mr. Lin, don't be surprised.

454
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,239
It is just a business activity.

455
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:38,599
No. Do you know the consequences?

456
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,520
Consequences?

457
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,479
The consequences would be that
we will restructure Yutian

458
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
for listing again, separately.

459
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,040
Well...

460
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,839
Mr. Lin, do you have any suggestion?

461
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,000
It's too hard for me.

462
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,079
I'm working for Yutian.

463
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,319
We have considered that.

464
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,160
If the acquisition is successful,

465
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,040
we will continue to employ you

466
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:03,000
as the CEO of Yutian.

467
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,640
But

468
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:06,920
Mr. Lin has to cooperate with us
and support our acquisition.

469
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,239
Support?

470
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:10,680
How can I support?

471
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,199
Betray Yutian for
the benefits of others?

472
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:15,239
How am I going to survive in the field?

473
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,640
Now, I have to say,

474
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,319
for this kind of immoral behavior,

475
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:20,479
I cannot do it.

476
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,160
At this moment, you said no.

477
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,160
Don't you think it is too late?

478
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,239
It's all because of you.

479
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,280
Lei Yuzheng is investigating.

480
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,400
We've been cleaning up everything
for you.

481
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,839
What did I do?
What do you need to help me clean up?

482
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
You didn't know what you did?

483
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,359
You should be very clear.

484
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,359
Now, I tell you.

485
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,040
In a few days, we will formally
submit to the CSRC

486
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,920
the acquisition plan of Yutian.

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,959
Yutian will also be formally notified.

488
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:52,040
I made this call today,

489
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,079
just because we are on the same side.

490
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,119
As for whether you support us or not,

491
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,119
it's up to you, OK?

492
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,239
I need your promise.

493
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,199
Do you believe in my promise?

494
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,280
You are highly respected and creditable.

495
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,680
I believe you, so I told you this.

496
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:22,280
I believe that you will not
do anything to Yutian.

497
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,880
Let me tell you.

498
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,800
We are going to acquire Yutian.

499
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,280
Come and have some tea.

500
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,599
Yuzheng,

501
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
at this time,
you are still in the mood for tea?

502
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,079
I'm worried about you.

503
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:58,839
Worrying is useless.

504
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,520
What we need most now is to calm down.

505
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,040
Now, the key is that

506
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:05,839
we don't even know
what our opponent is planning

507
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,160
or even who the opponent is.

508
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,560
How can we win this game?

509
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,599
Oh, there's one thing weird.

510
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,599
Do you remember
what I told you before?

511
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,160
They only bought the stock,
but they didn't sell it.

512
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:18,079
That is to say,

513
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,439
when Yutian stock rose,

514
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,920
they did not sell.

515
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:25,479
But during the period
you were in prison,

516
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,479
Yutian's stock fell to the bottom,

517
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,119
and they secretly bought
a large number of Yutian's stocks.

518
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,319
You mean

519
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,000
they didn't use the internal information

520
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,239
to make easy money,

521
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,880
but to keep buying
Yutian stocks instead.

522
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,319
You're right.

523
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,560
Siyang.

524
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,079
Acquire.

525
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,359
Acquire what?

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,880
Acquire Yutian.

527
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:51,400
If I'm right,

528
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,959
the ultimate goal of them

529
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,319
is to acquire Yutian.

530
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,300
(Xie Li)

531
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Mr. Lin, I got information that

532
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,680
Lei Yuzheng was being
followed yesterday,

533
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,079
and almost had a car accident.

534
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,199
Got it.

535
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:20,560
Come in please.

536
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,920
Mr. Lin, your package.

537
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,439
Thank you.

538
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,688
(Statement of Customer
Transaction Details)

539
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,936
(Deposit in: 1 Million yuan)

540
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,160
What do you want?

541
00:30:56,319 --> 00:30:57,160
Mr. Lin,

542
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,880
it seems you have received it.

543
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:00,400
You deserve it.

544
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,040
Didn't we make a deal?

545
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,040
I cannot remember what I have promised.

546
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,439
It is only part of it.

547
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:08,599
Not enough?

548
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:12,959
Yes, I should be responsible for that.

549
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,880
But I didn't expect you'd do it.

550
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,319
And I never expected that
Lei Yuzheng would go to prison.

551
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:19,199
I never thought of betraying Yutian.

552
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,319
Mr. Lin,

553
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,680
you are being nice now?

554
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,160
I'm telling you it is too late.

555
00:31:27,239 --> 00:31:29,160
If Lei Yuzheng finds out anything,

556
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,719
we're gonna have a big problem,
and so are you.

557
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:33,599
Mr. Lin,

558
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:36,119
we kept helping you.

559
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,640
If you can cooperate,

560
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,599
we will not only keep you safe,

561
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
but also, when it is done...

562
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,680
What the hell do you want me to do?

563
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You just need to check how Lei Yuzheng

564
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,439
deals with the acquisition,

565
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,439
and tell me every move
that Lei Yuzheng makes.

566
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,880
Just keep us informed.

567
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,400
What if I don't agree?

568
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,079
You are smart.

569
00:31:59,199 --> 00:32:00,920
About what the consequence would be,

570
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,199
you should be clear.

571
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,479
Mr. Lin, you are back.

572
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:41,160
Where is Fanlv?

573
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,839
Fanlv has been upstairs all day.

574
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,880
Didn't come down?

575
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,439
What are you doing?

576
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,359
Go away.

577
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,560
Please don't torture yourself.

578
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:15,800
Get out of here.

579
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
What do you want?

580
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:34,464
(Shangguan's calling)

581
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,839
Buddy, I have found Li Lu's girlfriend.

582
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,000
Her name is Wang Mian.

583
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,839
Great!

584
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,359
Please send me the photo
and address of Wang Mian.

585
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,719
Shangguan,

586
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,000
she should be off work soon.

587
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:55,280
Is the information correct?

588
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,119
Should be here.

589
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,560
Wait a little bit.

590
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,760
Buddy, look, it's that her?

591
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,280
Shangguan, go and get the car.

592
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:19,399
What are you doing?

593
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,919
Recently, has anyone been here

594
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,560
to ask you about Li Lu?

595
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,800
I don't know what you are talking about.

596
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:26,280
Listen.

597
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,639
In the future,
if anyone asks you about Li Lu,

598
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,919
you should just say he's dead.

599
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,280
You're the one who's dead!

600
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,679
Why should I listen to you?

601
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:34,479
Be smart. Be wise.

602
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,679
Otherwise, I'll deal with you.

603
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,399
What are you doing? Let me go.

604
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,719
Let her go. Follow me.

605
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,520
Help.

606
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,760
Go.

607
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:46,679
How is it?

608
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,479
Run.

609
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,080
Buddy, let me take you to the hospital.

610
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:13,639
No, take me home.

611
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,080
Where is Wang Mian?

612
00:35:15,919 --> 00:35:16,840
Run away.

613
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,320
What kind of people are they?

614
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:19,280
Even with knives.

615
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,679
Are they sent by Xie Li
and Lin Xiangyuan?

616
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,679
They are too bold.

617
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,080
Wang Mian ran away.

618
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,239
After such a scare,

619
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,719
it will be harder to find her.

620
00:35:32,879 --> 00:35:34,040
We have to find her.

621
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,080
Through her, we can find Li Lu.

622
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:38,280
Otherwise, we cannot have any progress.

623
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,120
We are trying to find her, so are they.

624
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,600
I'm just afraid they are too desperate,

625
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,520
and do cruel things.

626
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,320
Based on what they did,

627
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,560
they're not going to give up.

628
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,360
As long as we keep investigating,

629
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,879
they will attack not only Wang Mian

630
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:55,120
but perhaps others.

631
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,639
So, you're worried about Du Xiaosu?

632
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:02,520
I said "others".

633
00:36:17,632 --> 00:36:18,848
(Lei Yuzheng
How are you doing?)

634
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,040
What are you doing?

635
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,600
Stay here alone.

636
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,320
Are you thinking about Lei Yuzheng?

637
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,919
No.

638
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,479
What are you talking about?

639
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,199
Xiaosu,

640
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,840
based on my years of love experience,

641
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,760
you have three choices now.

642
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,399
What are they?

643
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,040
The first one, break up.

644
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,080
Completely remove
Lei Yuzheng from your mind.

645
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,080
Forget him.

646
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,800
Then find a more handsome
and richer guy.

647
00:37:04,919 --> 00:37:06,120
Make him angry and regret.

648
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,040
The second one.

649
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,919
You need to be proactive and get him.

650
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,239
The third one.

651
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,360
For the third one...

652
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,239
Same as you are now.

653
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,080
Stay here with a look of sorrow
on your face and keep waiting.

654
00:37:22,439 --> 00:37:23,520
Go to hell!

655
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,439
I'm sorry.

656
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,320
I'm late. It's the traffic jam.

657
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,879
It's OK. I just arrived.

658
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,879
Thank you.

659
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,520
For me?

660
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:14,679
Thank you.

661
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,239
What's wrong with you today?

662
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,479
So gentle.

663
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:24,879
I am always so gentle.

664
00:38:27,919 --> 00:38:29,919
I think you're being weird today.

665
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,479
Invite me for dinner.

666
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,719
Give me flowers.

667
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,199
Is there anything needing my help?

668
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
I just want to be
a nice person in your mind.

669
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,120
It's that hard?

670
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,399
I just want to invite you for dinner.

671
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,000
OK. Take a look.

672
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,679
What do you want?

673
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Help yourself please.

674
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,639
Of course, I will.

675
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,000
Qunfei,

676
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,000
why are you being so nice today?

677
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,159
Suddenly, invite us for dinner.

678
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:58,199
Why cannot I invite you for dinner?

679
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,679
I'm in a good mood today.

680
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,320
So...

681
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,159
I want everyone to get together
for dinner.

682
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,959
You just want to be with Siqi, right?

683
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:07,360
I don't want to
be the third wheel between you two.

684
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:09,320
No.

685
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:11,679
I really want us
to have dinner together.

686
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,120
Just a gathering.

687
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:14,639
Xiaosu,

688
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,360
you think too much this time.

689
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,879
Qunfei really wants to invite you
for dinner this time.

690
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,600
I'm really just for company.

691
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,479
OK, no problem.

692
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:23,600
Only if you two

693
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,280
don't mind I'm a third wheel.

694
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:27,159
Fine.

695
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,040
Stop talking and eat.

696
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,239
OK. OK. We will arrive very soon,

697
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,080
Go.

698
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,120
Go.

699
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,479
-Where?
-Over here.

700
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,360
What do you think?

701
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:46,159
The view is quite nice.

702
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,600
He Qunfei,

703
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,679
it must be expensive here, right?

704
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:51,959
Of course.

705
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,239
How can you be so generous?

706
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,719
What do you mean?

707
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm not mean at all.

708
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,159
You treat Siqi so generous.

709
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,959
But to me, you are so mean.
