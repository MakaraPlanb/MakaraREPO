I gotta go.

18
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,479
Have some of this, without alcohol.

19
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:47,839
Come, come, come.

20
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,000
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,759
Come.

22
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,279
All the guests here today

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,679
are my friends.

24
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,600
Let me introduce you to each other.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,639
This is a famous architect,

26
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,800
and a talented lady, Du Xiaosu.

27
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,399
Emma.

28
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,160
Her family do car hardware business.

29
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:06,839
A great beauty.

30
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:08,039
This is Ningning.

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,919
Partner of Dacheng firm.

32
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,119
Wow, this gentleman is

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,679
an Internet upstart, Xiaozhi.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,839
Now, half of the famous
Internet celebrities

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,880
are signed with his company.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,759
I don't need to say much about her.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,839
Super star. You should
have seen her on screens.

38
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,800
Super star. Super star.

39
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,360
Thank you.

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,559
Super star, hello.

41
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,080
Miss Du,

42
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,839
I love architects.

43
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,279
Last time, when I was in
Dubai on vacation,

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,039
there is a building called...

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,039
Dancing Towers.

46
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,600
Dancing Towers.

47
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,600
Yes, the Dancing Towers.

48
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,240
I heard that the designer

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,360
is also a great beauty.

50
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,839
Is Miss Du the same as her?

51
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Have you participated in
the design of many landmark buildings?

52
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,639
Dance... Dancing Towers
is the creation of Zaha.

53
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,639
She won the Pritzker Prize.

54
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,919
I think

55
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm not comparable to her.

56
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,759
Then Miss Du,

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,759
what projects have you been involved in?

58
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,880
Tell us more about it.

59
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:10,919
I... I just started my own studio.

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,000
All small cases.

61
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,720
Oh, small cases.

62
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,160
Miss Du, you are being modest.

63
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,720
Don't just talk.

64
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,880
Have fun!

65
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,000
Mr. Lin,

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
why not stand in the light?

67
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,480
You're the center of attention.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,799
No, I'm not.

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm here just for company,

70
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:51,079
and I will leave soon.

71
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Don't go.

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,160
You're here for fun.

73
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,279
You have to have fun
before you go.

74
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,760
Why you are so quiet?

75
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,000
Do I need to talk during dancing?

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,279
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

77
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,079
You don't have anything to say to me?

78
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,320
I heard you were back to Yutian.

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Congratulations!

80
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,760
That's it?

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Nothing else?

82
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Nothing else.

83
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,320
But I have something to say.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,799
Mr. Lin, when you feel unhappy,

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
drinking hurts you even more.

86
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:49,359
What makes you unhappy?

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,640
Buddy, tell me about it.

88
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,200
How do you know that I'm unhappy?

89
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:01,040
The feelings in your heart

90
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,079
are all on your face.

91
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,000
Let me guess.

92
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,040
Now that my buddy is back

93
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,359
and you're still at that position,

94
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,000
you feel a little embarrassed
and uncomfortable?

95
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,679
Buddy, you're thinking too much.

96
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,359
Excuse me for a moment.

97
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't go, Mr. Lin.

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,160
You haven't had enough fun yet.

99
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:33,799
You need alcohol now.

100
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,399
It's fun here.

101
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,679
It's better than going home
and drinking alone.

102
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,119
Come on, fill up, fill up.

103
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,559
Xiaosu,

104
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:52,200
why cannot we just have a nice talk?

105
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,799
I don't know why.

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,200
I think, you and I,

107
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,640
seem to be running out of topics.

108
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Well,

109
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,040
do you think I'm different from before?

110
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,279
Yes.

111
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,559
Don't you think people
behave differently

112
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:15,239
in different environments?

113
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,760
Maybe what I knew about you was wrong.

114
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:25,640
Maybe this is where you belong to.

115
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:28,760
Xiaosu, I know

116
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,440
you may not like
this kind of environment.

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,119
But you have to get used to it.

118
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
No, I don't have to.

119
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
It is quite different from my own life.

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
You never know.

121
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,200
In the future,

122
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,480
maybe it will become
a part of your life.

123
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,480
It has nothing to do with me.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,320
But it has something to do with me.

125
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,399
Don't you want to

126
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,720
try to get used to it for me?

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,640
Lei Yuzheng, you have your own friends.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,200
Look at them.

129
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,279
They all have strong background,

130
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,200
and have been to
very famous universities.

131
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,959
They grew up
in such kind of environment,

132
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,640
so they feel comfortable to stay here.

133
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,480
But for me,

134
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,720
I have my own life.

135
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,359
Don't you think

136
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:21,079
I'm a little different from them?

137
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,000
That's why I asked Shangguan
to invite you here.

138
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,799
I just hope you could come more often to

139
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,959
some of this kind of parties.

140
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,839
Let you get used to it.

141
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,320
Do you think
I could really get used to it?

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,920
Xiaosu, I know

143
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,320
they may make you uncomfortable.

144
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,519
But once you get to know them,

145
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
they're not really so bad.

146
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:50,000
You shouldn't be biased to them.

147
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,880
Biased?

148
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,880
You think that
I cannot get along with your friends,

149
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,640
just because I have bias against them?

150
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,159
It seems that our perceptions on this

151
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:00,599
are still different.

152
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,520
Xiaosu,

153
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,400
I didn't mean that.

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,080
Lei Yuzheng,

155
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,239
to your friends, I don't need to

156
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,200
prove anything.

157
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,280
Perhaps, for the relationship
between us before,

158
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,039
I have misunderstanding on it.

159
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,719
Just take it as a dream.

160
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,559
Do you think everything we've

161
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,440
been through is a dream?

162
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,400
Everyone would be vulnerable sometimes.

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,159
You were in a different
situation back then.

164
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,640
Maybe

165
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,039
you just needed someone to rely on.

166
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:42,640
So that's how you think of me.

167
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,080
In your mind,

168
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,599
I'm just a guy
who needs comfort when in trouble.

169
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,960
And when everything is getting better,
I will give you up?

170
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,640
Am I such kind of
heartless guy in your mind?

171
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,840
It seems today is not a good day

172
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,200
for us to talk about this.

173
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
I'd rather not talk,

174
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,919
lest it spoils your mood.

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,239
Xiaosu.

176
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,520
Everyone would be vulnerable sometimes.

177
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:15,200
You were in a different
situation back then.

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,880
Maybe

179
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,159
you just needed someone to rely on.

180
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,559
Tired?

181
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:36,559
You cannot drive after drinking.

182
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,640
Let me drive for you.

183
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,719
Thank you.

184
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,599
Xu You, you must be tired too.

185
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,799
What about not going back tonight?

186
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,159
What do you mean?

187
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,359
I just said,

188
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,200
you could stay
at my place for the night.

189
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,400
Drive faster.

190
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,599
Have a seat, please.

191
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,599
Where are you going?

192
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,640
To change.

193
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,000
As a private investigator,

194
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,239
there is nothing wrong
with this professional vigilance.

195
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:36,919
But I don't think

196
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,400
Lin Xiangyuan and Xie Li will do this.

197
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:43,200
Because
they don't have the guts to do this.

198
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Mr. Lei, if you want to get it clearly,
it is not hard.

199
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
But have you ever thought of
the consequences?

200
00:11:51,359 --> 00:11:52,760
If because of our investigation,

201
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
your situation
becomes more difficult.

202
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,559
I hope you won't blame us.

203
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,880
I have to reassess my opponent.

204
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,400
Xu You,

205
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm out for exercises
and will be back soon.

206
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,304
(Lei Yuzheng)

207
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:19,860
(Du Xiaosu)

208
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,599
Xiaosu, this is Xu You.

209
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,760
You're done exercising?

210
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,799
It's going to rain outside.

211
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,359
Have a good rest tonight.

212
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,479
Where shall I sleep?

213
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,520
Yuzheng,

214
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,479
Miss Xu's room

215
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,640
is ready.

216
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,239
Go get some sleep.

217
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,719
Your phone rang just now.

218
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm afraid it is something urgent,
so I answered it.

219
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,520
Mr. Lei, it's me.

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,039
I have something you want.

221
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:26,039
Come to me right away.

222
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,159
I'm afraid a long delay
may cause trouble.

223
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,760
I will send you
the location to your phone.

224
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,520
OK.

225
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
Any progress?

226
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,119
There is some progress.

227
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:09,280
We're still following up.

228
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,000
Any more information,

229
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,320
just call me.

230
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,599
Sure.

231
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Do you know me?

232
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,039
Why are you following me?

233
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,039
We work for someone.

234
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,080
Don't worry.

235
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,280
As long as you give us what you have,

236
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,080
we will not hurt you.

237
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,919
I don't know you,

238
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,679
and you don't know me, either.

239
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:10,440
Who are you following me?

240
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,640
For money? I can understand.

241
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,679
Take a man's money
to avert his misfortune.

242
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,599
But you have to think about it.

243
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
Persons like you

244
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:22,760
should have real skills.

245
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,320
You can have a try.

246
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,640
Sorry.

247
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,199
Here you are.

248
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,439
But...

249
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,599
It's OK. It's just a scratch.

250
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,119
Talk.

251
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,319
Who made you follow me?

252
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,520
No talking?

253
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,680
Believe it or not, I'll break your arm.

254
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,640
You're afraid to say it out loud.

255
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,760
Go back and tell your boss.

256
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
If there is anything,

257
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,239
come to me directly.

258
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,160
Don't use such dirty tricks.

259
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,640
Go.

260
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,460
(Calling 18931240079...)

261
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,632
(Calling Liu Siyang)

262
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,079
Liu Siyang, where are you?

263
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Go to my place.

264
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,880
Now!

265
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,920
Yuzheng, you are finally back.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,560
I'm really worried about you
in such a heavy rain.

267
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,119
Uncle Duan, is Siyang here?

268
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,079
Siyang is here,
waiting for you in the room.

269
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,839
By the way, Uncle Duan.

270
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,199
Did a stranger

271
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,239
call just now?

272
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,839
No. What happened?

273
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,599
Nothing.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,239
Uncle Duan, I have something
to discuss with you.

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
It has been a long time

276
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:32,400
since you went back to
your hometown last time.

277
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,839
Why don't you go back to your hometown
for a while?

278
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,119
You're right.

279
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,719
Your dad passed away, and you grew up.

280
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,640
Uncle Duan is getting older and older.

281
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,280
It is time to go back to hometown.

282
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,119
Uncle Duan, you misunderstood.

283
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,319
What are you talking about?

284
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,760
I mean

285
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,719
you can go back to hometown
and have a rest for a while.

286
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,560
I'll pick you up later.

287
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,199
How can I let you go?

288
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,439
I have to take care of you.

289
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,359
Really?

290
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,199
Of course.

291
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,719
OK, I will do as you said.

292
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,359
Please pack your bags tomorrow.

293
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,640
I'll ask Qunfei
to buy the ticket for you.

294
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,599
Take you to the airport. Sounds good?

295
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,760
OK, go.

296
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,439
Siyang is waiting for you.

297
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,520
I will prepare you two some snacks.

298
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,079
Don't bother, Uncle Duan.

299
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:21,479
You can go to bed for rest.

300
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:32,439
Yuzheng.

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,839
have you seen the stock of Yutian
these days?

302
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,520
What happened?

303
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,160
These days, the stock of Yutian

304
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,760
has gone up so weirdly.

305
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,319
The stock of Yutian rose,
while the whole market was falling.

306
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,400
Siyang, have a look at this.

307
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,560
That's all they found.

308
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,800
Tomorrow, please check

309
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
all these accounts.

310
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,959
According to their report,

311
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:06,760
during that period, all these accounts

312
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,280
transferred a large amount of money

313
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,920
to buy Yutian's stocks.

314
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,080
(Insurance agencies won't sell stocks
in large amount by the end of the year)

315
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,479
Yuzheng, check out this report.

316
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,400
Was it the date that Yutian and S.G

317
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,800
signed the contract?

318
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,300
(Exclusive Reveal.
Saturday December 17, 2016)

319
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,319
Yes, it is.

320
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,239
Then, it is obvious.

321
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,880
The person who gave you the information

322
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,800
must have known there was something
wrong with the reporter who wrote it,

323
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,479
and made a copy of it.

324
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,319
So this reporter, Li Lu,
(Reporter: Li Lu)

325
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,520
before...

326
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,959
He knew everything.

327
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Someone inside Yutian leaked the news.

328
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,280
On the same day,
the report was published.

329
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:49,160
Right.

330
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:51,719
It's absolutely not a coincidence.

331
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,520
We have to find this reporter,

332
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,959
and ask him about it.

333
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,079
Maybe

334
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,359
we can find out who did this.

335
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,199
Leave it to me.

336
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,239
You're too exposed.

337
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,599
Besides, there is someone
following you.

338
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,040
At this time, you must not
alert the enemy.

339
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,959
Take care.

340
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,000
Sure.

341
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,680
Hello.

342
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,400
Hello.

343
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,520
I really appreciate
reporter Li's talent.

344
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,359
I hope to get him
to give an interview to our boss.

345
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,280
I am so sorry.

346
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,560
Li Lu resigned.

347
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:33,079
Resigned?

348
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,560
When?

349
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,599
Around one year ago.

350
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,400
He was in such a hurry.

351
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,920
He quit in the morning,

352
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,800
and packed up and left in the afternoon.

353
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,199
Do you know where did he go?

354
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,520
I don't know.

355
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,280
By the way,

356
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,400
chief editor,

357
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,839
can you please take a look at this?

358
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,780
(Insurance agencies won't sell stocks
in large amount by the end of the year)

359
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,280
This is our newspaper.

360
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,479
This report was written by Li Lu, right?

361
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,400
Yes, what's wrong?

362
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,839
You are so experienced in media.

363
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,839
Please look at this report of Yutian.

364
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,520
It was issued on the date of Yutian's
information leakage case.

365
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,479
The case hasn't been made public.

366
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:17,319
How did he know about it?

367
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:20,800
Well, you're an outsider.

368
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,199
If everything our reporters reported

369
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:24,959
was after it has been made public,

370
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,920
wouldn't we be worthless?

371
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,920
Do you have Li Lu's home address?

372
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes.

373
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,520
But you may not find him.

374
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,000
Why?

375
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,599
He is from Guizhou.
In Shanghai, he has no apartment.

376
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,199
He has been renting.

377
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,640
Who knows where he's moving to now?

378
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,680
From Guizhou.

379
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,920
So you have the address on his ID?

380
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,359
Excuse me, do you have anyone

381
00:22:57,439 --> 00:22:58,560
named Li Lu here?

382
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:01,000
Li Lu resigned a year ago.

383
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,239
He also moved.

384
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,599
No one knows where he is now.

385
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
One year ago.

386
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,000
That means he resigned
as soon as the report was published.

387
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes, that means
he's afraid of being found out.

388
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,640
He was pretty sure

389
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:14,000
that someone is bound to find him.

390
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:15,160
So he hid.

391
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,319
By the way,

392
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,040
have you heard from the person
who gave you the information?

393
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,680
What happened?

394
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,160
It is my fault.

395
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,000
I didn't expect it so complicated.

396
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,640
Our investigation must have threatened

397
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,839
the interests of the opponent.

398
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,239
So...

399
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,000
They are putting all their eggs
in one basket.

400
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,640
Lin Xiangyuan is so cruel and merciless.

401
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,760
Maybe it is not Lin Xiangyuan.

402
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,400
He certainly didn't want me
to go back to Yutian.

403
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,000
But he should not be that kind of crazy.

404
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,479
Oh,

405
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,160
have a look at

406
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,040
these investment accounts.

407
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,239
I have investigated.

408
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,000
Before Li Lu reported it,

409
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,319
that is when Yutian and
S.G signed the contract,

410
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,760
all these accounts

411
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,000
kept buying large
amount of Yutian's stock.

412
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
When did they sell the stock?

413
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,560
That's so weird.

414
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,479
They didn't sell.

415
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,400
It is a large amount of money.

416
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:21,520
Even with profits, they did not sell.

417
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,640
What were they thinking of?

418
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
They didn't care about the profits.

419
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,719
Siyang,

420
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,880
use all your resources,

421
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,920
and help me investigate
all these accounts'

422
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,160
sources.

423
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,800
I will call Shangguan,

424
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
and ask him to help find Li Lu.

425
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,119
You focus on
investigating these accounts.

426
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,680
Mr. Lin,
according to our market research,

427
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,959
the financial budget of this year

428
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,040
is good.

429
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,479
So marketing department

430
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,880
hopes to add two more projects.

431
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:49,640
We want to initial a plan.

432
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
So, we hope, next year,

433
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
with the financial budget,

434
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
we can increase a bit.

435
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:57,319
Hope Mr. Lin will consider it.

436
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:00,920
Hello.

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,040
Mr. Lin?

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,839
Hello.

439
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:10,520
Here you are.

440
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,119
Nice to meet you.

441
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,599
Thank you for meeting me in person.

442
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:17,640
Thank you for meeting me in person.

443
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,839
OK. You go back to your work
and close the door for me.

444
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,640
Mr. Yu, I overheard a piece of news.

445
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,839
To be precise,

446
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,359
Yutian will cooperate with
an oversea company, S.G.

447
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,560
What kind of project?

448
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,000
Yutian Universal Entertainment Center.

449
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,439
Please.

450
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,800
Let me tell you.

451
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:50,000
We are going to acquire Yutian.

452
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:52,599
What? Acquire Yutian?

453
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,599
Mr. Lin, don't be surprised.

454
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:59,239
It is just a business activity.

455
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,599
No. Do you know the consequences?

456
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,520
Consequences?

457
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:09,479
The consequences would be that
we will restructure Yutian

458
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,640
for listing again, separately.

459
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,040
Well...

460
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,839
Mr. Lin, do you have any suggestion?

461
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,000
It's too hard for me.

462
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,079
I'm working for Yutian.

463
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,319
We have considered that.

464
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,160
If the acquisition is successful,

465
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,040
we will continue to employ you

466
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,000
as the CEO of Yutian.

467
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:28,640
But

468
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,920
Mr. Lin has to cooperate with us
and support our acquisition.

469
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,239
Support?

470
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,680
How can I support?

471
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,199
Betray Yutian for
the benefits of others?

472
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,239
How am I going to survive in the field?

473
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,640
Now, I have to say,

474
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,319
for this kind of immoral behavior,

475
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:45,479
I cannot do it.

476
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,160
At this moment, you said no.

477
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:49,160
Don't you think it is too late?

478
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,239
It's all because of you.

479
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,280
Lei Yuzheng is investigating.

480
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,400
We've been cleaning up everything
for you.

481
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,839
What did I do?
What do you need to help me clean up?

482
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,400
You didn't know what you did?

483
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,359
You should be very clear.

484
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,359
Now, I tell you.

485
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:11,040
In a few days, we will formally
submit to the CSRC

486
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,920
the acquisition plan of Yutian.

487
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,959
Yutian will also be formally notified.

488
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,040
I made this call today,

489
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,079
just because we are on the same side.

490
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,119
As for whether you support us or not,

491
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,119
it's up to you, OK?

492
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,239
I need your promise.

493
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,199
Do you believe in my promise?

494
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,280
You are highly respected and creditable.

495
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,680
I believe you, so I told you this.

496
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,280
I believe that you will not
do anything to Yutian.

497
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,880
Let me tell you.

498
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,800
We are going to acquire Yutian.

499
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,280
Come and have some tea.

500
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,599
Yuzheng,

501
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
at this time,
you are still in the mood for tea?

502
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,079
I'm worried about you.

503
00:28:22,719 --> 00:28:23,839
Worrying is useless.

504
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,520
What we need most now is to calm down.

505
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,040
Now, the key is that

506
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,839
we don't even know
what our opponent is planning

507
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,160
or even who the opponent is.

508
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,560
How can we win this game?

509
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,599
Oh, there's one thing weird.

510
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,599
Do you remember
what I told you before?

511
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,160
They only bought the stock,
but they didn't sell it.

512
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,079
That is to say,

513
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,439
when Yutian stock rose,

514
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,920
they did not sell.

515
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,479
But during the period
you were in prison,

516
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,479
Yutian's stock fell to the bottom,

517
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:56,119
and they secretly bought
a large number of Yutian's stocks.

518
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,319
You mean

519
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,000
they didn't use the internal information

520
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,239
to make easy money,

521
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,880
but to keep buying
Yutian stocks instead.

522
00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:04,319
You're right.

523
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,560
Siyang.

524
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,079
Acquire.

525
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:12,359
Acquire what?

526
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
Acquire Yutian.

527
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,400
If I'm right,

528
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,959
the ultimate goal of them

529
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,319
is to acquire Yutian.

530
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:31,300
(Xie Li)

531
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Mr. Lin, I got information that

532
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,680
Lei Yuzheng was being
followed yesterday,

533
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,079
and almost had a car accident.

534
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,199
Got it.

535
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:45,560
Come in please.

536
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
Mr. Lin, your package.

537
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,439
Thank you.

538
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,688
(Statement of Customer
Transaction Details)

539
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,936
(Deposit in: 1 Million yuan)

540
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,160
What do you want?

541
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,160
Mr. Lin,

542
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,880
it seems you have received it.

543
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,400
You deserve it.

544
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,040
Didn't we make a deal?

545
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
I cannot remember what I have promised.

546
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,439
It is only part of it.

547
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,599
Not enough?

548
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:37,959
Yes, I should be responsible for that.

549
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,880
But I didn't expect you'd do it.

550
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,319
And I never expected that
Lei Yuzheng would go to prison.

551
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,199
I never thought of betraying Yutian.

552
00:30:45,199 --> 00:30:46,319
Mr. Lin,

553
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,680
you are being nice now?

554
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
I'm telling you it is too late.

555
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:54,160
If Lei Yuzheng finds out anything,

556
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,719
we're gonna have a big problem,
and so are you.

557
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,599
Mr. Lin,

558
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:01,119
we kept helping you.

559
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,640
If you can cooperate,

560
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,599
we will not only keep you safe,

561
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,880
but also, when it is done...

562
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,680
What the hell do you want me to do?

563
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You just need to check how Lei Yuzheng

564
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,439
deals with the acquisition,

565
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,439
and tell me every move
that Lei Yuzheng makes.

566
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,880
Just keep us informed.

567
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,400
What if I don't agree?

568
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:24,079
You are smart.

569
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,920
About what the consequence would be,

570
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,199
you should be clear.

571
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,479
Mr. Lin, you are back.

572
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,160
Where is Fanlv?

573
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,839
Fanlv has been upstairs all day.

574
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,880
Didn't come down?

575
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:32,439
What are you doing?

576
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,359
Go away.

577
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,560
Please don't torture yourself.

578
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,800
Get out of here.

579
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,160
What do you want?

580
00:32:58,984 --> 00:32:59,464
(Shangguan's calling)

581
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,839
Buddy, I have found Li Lu's girlfriend.

582
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
Her name is Wang Mian.

583
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:04,839
Great!

584
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,359
Please send me the photo
and address of Wang Mian.

585
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,719
Shangguan,

586
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:19,000
she should be off work soon.

587
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,280
Is the information correct?

588
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,119
Should be here.

589
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:24,560
Wait a little bit.

590
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,760
Buddy, look, it's that her?

591
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:38,280
Shangguan, go and get the car.

592
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,399
What are you doing?

593
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,919
Recently, has anyone been here

594
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,560
to ask you about Li Lu?

595
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,800
I don't know what you are talking about.

596
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,280
Listen.

597
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:53,639
In the future,
if anyone asks you about Li Lu,

598
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:54,919
you should just say he's dead.

599
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,280
You're the one who's dead!

600
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,679
Why should I listen to you?

601
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,479
Be smart. Be wise.

602
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,679
Otherwise, I'll deal with you.

603
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,399
What are you doing? Let me go.

604
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,719
Let her go. Follow me.

605
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,520
Help.

606
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,760
Go.

607
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,679
How is it?

608
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,479
Run.

609
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,080
Buddy, let me take you to the hospital.

610
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,639
No, take me home.

611
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,080
Where is Wang Mian?

612
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:41,840
Run away.

613
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,320
What kind of people are they?

614
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:44,280
Even with knives.

615
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,679
Are they sent by Xie Li
and Lin Xiangyuan?

616
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,679
They are too bold.

617
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,080
Wang Mian ran away.

618
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,239
After such a scare,

619
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:56,719
it will be harder to find her.

620
00:34:57,879 --> 00:34:59,040
We have to find her.

621
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
Through her, we can find Li Lu.

622
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:03,280
Otherwise, we cannot have any progress.

623
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,120
We are trying to find her, so are they.

624
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm just afraid they are too desperate,

625
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,520
and do cruel things.

626
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,320
Based on what they did,

627
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,560
they're not going to give up.

628
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,360
As long as we keep investigating,

629
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,879
they will attack not only Wang Mian

630
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,120
but perhaps others.

631
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,639
So, you're worried about Du Xiaosu?

632
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,520
I said "others".

633
00:35:42,632 --> 00:35:43,848
(Lei Yuzheng
How are you doing?)

634
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,040
What are you doing?

635
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600
Stay here alone.

636
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,320
Are you thinking about Lei Yuzheng?

637
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,919
No.

638
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,479
What are you talking about?

639
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,199
Xiaosu,

640
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,840
based on my years of love experience,

641
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,760
you have three choices now.

642
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,399
What are they?

643
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,040
The first one, break up.

644
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,080
Completely remove
Lei Yuzheng from your mind.

645
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,080
Forget him.

646
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,800
Then find a more handsome
and richer guy.

647
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:31,120
Make him angry and regret.

648
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,040
The second one.

649
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,919
You need to be proactive and get him.

650
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,239
The third one.

651
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:41,360
For the third one...

652
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,239
Same as you are now.

653
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,080
Stay here with a look of sorrow
on your face and keep waiting.

654
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,520
Go to hell!

655
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:10,439
I'm sorry.

656
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm late. It's the traffic jam.

657
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,879
It's OK. I just arrived.

658
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,879
Thank you.

659
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,520
For me?

660
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:39,679
Thank you.

661
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,239
What's wrong with you today?

662
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,479
So gentle.

663
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,879
I am always so gentle.

664
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:54,919
I think you're being weird today.

665
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,479
Invite me for dinner.

666
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,719
Give me flowers.

667
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,199
Is there anything needing my help?

668
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,080
I just want to be
a nice person in your mind.

669
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,120
It's that hard?

670
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,399
I just want to invite you for dinner.

671
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,000
OK. Take a look.

672
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,679
What do you want?

673
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Help yourself please.

674
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:14,639
Of course, I will.

675
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,000
Qunfei,

676
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,000
why are you being so nice today?

677
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,159
Suddenly, invite us for dinner.

678
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,199
Why cannot I invite you for dinner?

679
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,679
I'm in a good mood today.

680
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,320
So...

681
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,159
I want everyone to get together
for dinner.

682
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,959
You just want to be with Siqi, right?

683
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,360
I don't want to
be the third wheel between you two.

684
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,320
No.

685
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:36,679
I really want us
to have dinner together.

686
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,120
Just a gathering.

687
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:39,639
Xiaosu,

688
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:41,360
you think too much this time.

689
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,879
Qunfei really wants to invite you
for dinner this time.

690
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:45,600
I'm really just for company.

691
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,479
OK, no problem.

692
00:38:47,719 --> 00:38:48,600
Only if you two

693
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:51,280
don't mind I'm a third wheel.

694
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,159
Fine.

695
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,040
Stop talking and eat.

696
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,239
OK. OK. We will arrive very soon,

697
00:39:03,399 --> 00:39:04,080
Go.

698
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Go.

699
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,479
-Where?
-Over here.

700
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:08,360
What do you think?

701
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,159
The view is quite nice.

702
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,600
He Qunfei,

703
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,679
it must be expensive here, right?

704
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:16,959
Of course.

705
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,239
How can you be so generous?

706
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,719
What do you mean?

707
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm not mean at all.

708
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,159
You treat Siqi so generous.

709
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,959
But to me, you are so mean.
