And this...

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,119
Steamed buns?

19
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,800
Nanxiang steamed buns, with crab meat.

20
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,559
I remember you love it.

21
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,279
Why bother?

22
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,919
As long as you are happy,
no bother at all.

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,039
Fanlv,

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,919
I still remember

25
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,199
the day we met for the first time.

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,759
It was a rainy day like this.

27
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,119
I went to your place with no umbrella.

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,919
The rain made me
look like a drowned rat.

29
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,279
Without thinking,

30
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,440
you put Mr. Jiang's clothes on me.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,479
Really? I don't remember.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,240
From that moment on, I felt that
you are the one.

33
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
No matter what happens in the future,

34
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,679
I'll take good care of you.

35
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,240
So don't be burdened.

36
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,440
Because,

37
00:03:07,399 --> 00:03:08,320
I want to.

38
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,279
Let's go. I'm a little tired.

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,119
Put this on.

40
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:21,960
Don't catch a cold.

41
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,880
Dad, I'm back.

42
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:50,839
Mr. Jiang.

43
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,000
Xiangyuan,

44
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,440
thank you for

45
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,399
bringing Fanlv home in such heavy rain.

46
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Not at all.

47
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,399
Have something to eat before you leave.

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,600
Ms. Li.

49
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,039
Don't bother, Mr. Jiang.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,759
You two have a nice evening.

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
I'm heading off now.

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,440
If so, I won't keep you.

53
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:10,320
OK.

54
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,640
Dad, I wanna go to bed now.

55
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,200
Fanlv, wait a minute.

56
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
I have something to talk to you.

57
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,760
Tell me,

58
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,119
what's your relationship
with Lin Xiangyuan now?

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
What relationship can I have with him?

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,559
Why do I feel that

61
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,279
he's having a crush on you?

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,839
Crush on me? I don't like him.

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
It's good that you know that.

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,040
You are from different worlds.

65
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,279
The boundary should be clear.

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,559
Apart from work,

67
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:51,000
there should be nothing else.

68
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,839
Dad, you always think highly
of him, don't you?

69
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,920
And you have praised him
for his hard work.

70
00:04:58,119 --> 00:05:00,679
You said few young talents have
entrepreneur spirit like him.

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,200
These are two different things.

72
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,559
Maybe one day when I'm happy,

73
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,320
they become the same thing.

74
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,839
Fanlv,

75
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,519
you're not really in a relationship,
are you?

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,359
I'm just kidding.

77
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,399
Fanlv, you are not young anymore.

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
Lin Xiangyuan is not an idiot.

79
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,720
He's so proactive.

80
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
Isn't it because you

81
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,239
give him a wrong signal?

82
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,359
Be more cautious about the relationship.

83
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:35,720
Since you don't like him,

84
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,200
you should let him know clearly.

85
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:41,440
Let him know this is impossible.

86
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,040
Lin Xiangyuan

87
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,399
is very smart, ambitious

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,040
and clever, but his horizon
is not broadened.

89
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:53,359
He's hard to make a big hit,
so he's not a good match.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,320
Enough, dad.

91
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,000
Why are you talking about such stuff?

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Nothing relevant. I'll go to bed now.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,079
You too, dad.

94
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,679
Miss Jiang,

95
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,480
I asked a friend to bring you this
from overseas.

96
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,239
Limited edition, and it's for you.

97
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,279
Nice work, Lin Xiangyuan.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,160
Very efficient.

99
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,000
For anything Miss Jiang wants,

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,440
I must try my best.

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,440
Have you heard?

102
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:30,399
What?

103
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,160
Du Xiaosu has resigned.

104
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,600
Yes.

105
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:40,359
I thought she was
just putting on an act.

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,000
Unexpectedly, she really did it.

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,679
She made up her mind

108
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,720
to leave Yutian, a big tree
that shelters her from wind and rain.

109
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,839
She really has courage.

110
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
As her classmate,

111
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,119
don't you wanna help her?

112
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,000
Miss Jiang, don't make fun of me.

113
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,959
Since the last annual meeting,

114
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
we haven't been in touch at all.

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,000
Resolute enough.

116
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,320
After all, she's an adult.

117
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
She'll take care of herself.

118
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,079
If Yuzheng knew about this,

119
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,000
what will be his attitude?

120
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,559
What would you do
if you were Lei Yuzheng?

121
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,519
I don't know.

122
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,600
I see.

123
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,279
You are not in his place,
so you will never know the pain.

124
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,119
I'm back.

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
Is your business done?

126
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,239
Yes.

127
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,040
All done?

128
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,679
Congratulations.

129
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,679
You are now

130
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:58,519
a free woman.

131
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
No income, no organization,
and no social security.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,959
As your best friend,

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,000
I can only treat you

134
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,519
with spare ribs noodle, and...

135
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,160
Wow, this is awesome.

136
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,920
Nothing else at home?

137
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:11,119
What are you thinking?

138
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,799
It's lucky we still
have something to eat.

139
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,160
Siqi,

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,239
I saw Qunfei
at the company two days ago.

141
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
What did he say to you?

142
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,239
All of it.

143
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,399
He's in great pain now.

144
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,239
He said you always ignore him.

145
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,959
Always with Shangguan.

146
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,080
He even told you this?

147
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,919
Is he a psycho?

148
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,119
Do you know
he followed me the other day?

149
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200
That's because he cares about you.

150
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,520
I know he treats me well.

151
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,440
But, look,

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,039
we are not living in a vacuum.

153
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,960
We cannot live long just with love.

154
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,400
Let me give you an example.

155
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,200
It's like...

156
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
There is a person.

157
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,919
Every day, he keeps saying that

158
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,280
he'll treat you well.

159
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,520
But he just gives you instant noodles

160
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,119
with different flavors every day.

161
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,520
Like the way I'm treating you right now.

162
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:00,880
There is another person.

163
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,880
He is rich.

164
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,239
He would never say to treat you well,

165
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
but he can take you

166
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:09,440
to have big meals, such as steaks,
and go shopping every day.

167
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,039
Miss Su,

168
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,000
who would you choose if you were me?

169
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,520
I'll choose the one I have feelings for.

170
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,440
I regret asking you.

171
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:21,239
He Qunfei is really into you.

172
00:09:21,359 --> 00:09:22,960
Don't hurt him.

173
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,520
How did I hurt him?

174
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,239
I know my current situation well.

175
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,280
As for He Qunfei,

176
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:30,840
he treats me well.

177
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,159
But you know what?

178
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,760
If I choose to be with him,

179
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,799
I'll have to face such a hard life.

180
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,080
Let's talk about the other man,

181
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,359
Shangguan.

182
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,960
He is a nice guy, and rich.

183
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:44,159
Both handsome and rich.

184
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,520
He's smart and capable.

185
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
So,

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,320
I know I've got no chance.

187
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,400
But it doesn't matter.

188
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
Anyway, I, Zou Siqi

189
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:54,320
never thinks of marrying to a rich man.

190
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,479
That's not my life.

191
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:01,840
(Shangguan)

192
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,359
Shangguan,

193
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,880
I haven't eaten yet.

194
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,159
OK, OK, I like it.

195
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:15,679
OK, I'm on my way.

196
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,799
See you later. Bye.

197
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,919
OK, OK, I'm on my way.

198
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:22,719
What are you doing?

199
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,320
Don't look at me like that.

200
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,320
A sophisticate in
the financial circle like him

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,039
tells me one piece of information,

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,359
and we could say goodbye

203
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,960
to these instant noodles, OK?

204
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,080
Bye.

205
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,440
Say goodbye...

206
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,640
I mean, don't be fooled by him.

207
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,880
Those finance guys. They're all
smart and insidious.

208
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:41,919
Don't be fooled

209
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
by the big cakes he shows to you,

210
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,080
losing both the man and the money.

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,639
(Housing Rental Website)

212
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:11,200
Four thousand five hundred yuan.

213
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,880
77305

214
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,320
Hello,

215
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,960
I saw the information
on the rental website.

216
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,400
You have an apartment

217
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,320
on Yan'an West Road to rent, right?

218
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,799
Already rented out.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,559
Hello,

220
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,080
I saw the information online.

221
00:12:02,239 --> 00:12:04,119
You have an apartment
to rent, don't you?

222
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,100
(Send Message)

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,100
(Du Xiaosu)

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,472
(What are you doing?)

225
00:12:22,119 --> 00:12:23,599
OK to see in person.

226
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,648
(Let's meet if you're not busy.)

227
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,400
OK, I'll ask around.

228
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
Thank you.

229
00:13:00,768 --> 00:13:02,464
(Lei Yuzheng
Let's meet if you're not busy.)

230
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,719
Coming.

231
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,080
Two bowls of shredded eel noodles.

232
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:15,400
This one without coriander is yours.

233
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,039
All eels left today,

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,440
I put them all in,

235
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,799
because I'm closing.

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,400
Thank you.

237
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,799
But it's really too much.

238
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,039
Not at all.

239
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,119
You haven't been here for a long time.

240
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,520
Eat more.

241
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,440
He is your new boyfriend?

242
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,760
Madam,

243
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,840
you go ahead.

244
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Don't worry about us.

245
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:41,760
Take your time.

246
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
Sorry to

247
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,719
ask you out so late.

248
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,479
It's OK.

249
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,640
I should have told you early.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,719
How's it going?

251
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,359
After leaving Yutian,

252
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,719
any plans?

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,960
I was able to have a job in Yutian

254
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,679
because of Zhenrong's help.

255
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,320
Actually, when I knew

256
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
your relationship with Zhenrong,

257
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,799
I was planning to quit anyway.

258
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,559
But Zhenrong stopped me.

259
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,159
He encouraged me to use my own expertise

260
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,239
to prove myself.

261
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,000
Have you proven yourself yet?

262
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,880
Although I'm not the best,

263
00:14:24,479 --> 00:14:26,039
I tried my best.

264
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,960
Especially after getting involved with

265
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,320
the Entertainment Center project,

266
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,760
I felt the joy of the work.

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,159
And it was very fulfilling.

268
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,000
If so,

269
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,479
why did you give up Yutian?

270
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,799
I thought a lot on the island.

271
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,880
Also, I found a new goal in life.

272
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:47,000
I want to start my own business.

273
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,799
Start your own business?

274
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,320
For something, if you don't do it now,

275
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,840
you would never have the chance
to do it in the future.

276
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,960
I want to start my own studio.

277
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:00,559
Not only to survive and make money,

278
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,039
it's also a dream.

279
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,280
I hope to use my own ideas

280
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,479
and my hands

281
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,200
to let every client have a

282
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,359
sweet and warm house with love.

283
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,960
Ideal is noble, but reality is cruel.

284
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,479
Miss Du,

285
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,919
think about it.

286
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,840
Nowadays, it's hard to
start your own business.

287
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
I know.

288
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,400
Ten entrepreneurs and nine fail.

289
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,400
Only one survives with half life left.

290
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,320
But I have to try.

291
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:27,599
Standing on the street,

292
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,520
waiting for the pie
to fall from the sky by itself,

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,119
is not suitable for me.

294
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,119
OK.

295
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,400
Do you have a specific plan?

296
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,359
Rent a place first.

297
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,760
Want me to help you?

298
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:40,960
No need, no need.

299
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,799
You are dealing with tens of millions
of businesses every day.

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,919
If this piece of cake

301
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,039
needs your attention,

302
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,919
it's wasting your talents.

303
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:50,400
But,

304
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,960
your kindness is well received by me.

305
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
In case of something really important,

306
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,159
I'll surely ask you for help.

307
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,080
OK.

308
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,520
Since you said that,

309
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,440
I have to remind you.

310
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,119
Even you are unemployed,

311
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,679
the contractual relationship
is not negotiable.

312
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,039
The loans must be paid off on time.

313
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,880
Don't worry, creditor.

314
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,840
I won't run away.

315
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,280
I wrote "I Owe You" myself,

316
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,320
and I'll pay it back,

317
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,599
even if I have to put all in.

318
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:33,632
(Pudong South Road)

319
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,119
What's wrong with you?

320
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,520
The place you just recommended,

321
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,719
it's ridiculous.

322
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,280
No wonder you didn't go in.

323
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,159
At the door gate,

324
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,960
many chicken coops around.

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,520
Listen,

326
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:52,880
it doesn’t matter if I can make deals
with my clients.

327
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,320
As soon as they come in

328
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,479
and see those

329
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,080
chicken coops,

330
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,760
they will think of me

331
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
as a designer for chicken coops.

332
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,840
Miss Du,

333
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,719
that place is good enough.

334
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
With the rent rate you offered,

335
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,760
you can only have chicken as neighbors.

336
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,040
Don't we still have
several places to see?

337
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,719
Let's go and see others.

338
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,560
They'll be better than that.

339
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,400
I know you've been working hard.

340
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,479
Let's take a look please.

341
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,359
There must be good ones.

342
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,680
There must be ones better than that.

343
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,079
I'll buy you coffee later.

344
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:28,119
Hurry up. Let's go.

345
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,160
It's out of fuel.

346
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,880
Is it?

347
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,199
It's enough.

348
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,680
Please, please...

349
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
Let's go over there and have a look.

350
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:37,520
There.

351
00:17:37,719 --> 00:17:38,599
OK...

352
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
You back?

353
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,719
I'm exhausted.

354
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,079
I walked for the whole day today.

355
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:58,599
I can't even feel my legs.

356
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,760
Now, you know

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,680
the boss is hard to be.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,560
Money and resources are both necessary.

359
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,680
Well, ask Lei Yuzheng for help.

360
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,239
He's a big boss.

361
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,160
To help you get things done,

362
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,680
it's like a piece of cake.

363
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:16,839
This will not do.

364
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,680
This is only the first step.

365
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,280
Too soon to consider for asking help.

366
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:21,959
Otherwise, why do I have to
start my own business?

367
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,439
You suffer yourself
just for saving your face.

368
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,359
Qunfei said he wanted to help.

369
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
He can't even help himself,

370
00:18:30,719 --> 00:18:31,839
and now, he wants to help you?

371
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,160
He is a kind and nice guy.

372
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,079
I have already thought about it.

373
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,439
I'll ask Shangguan

374
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,520
to see if he's willing to invest in us.

375
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,000
I think this is the only way
to work it out, OK?

376
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:43,560
Let's stick to this rich sponsor.

377
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,079
With a little bit of his money,

378
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,160
you don't need to
worry about your studio.

379
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,640
Definitely booming

380
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,199
with a lot of clients coming in.

381
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,439
The key is that

382
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,680
I could buy a small share

383
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,040
to have a finger in the pie.

384
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,319
Right?

385
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,640
Zou Siqi,

386
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,319
it's not started yet,

387
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,920
and you're dreaming about
sharing the pie?

388
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,319
You fell into the money hole.

389
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,959
A deep money hole.

390
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:05,959
I just wanna

391
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,040
help you in smart ways, OK?

392
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,079
Stop.

393
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,000
Thank you.

394
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,800
I believe in my own abilities.

395
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,880
I can definitely find a suitable place.

396
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:15,839
Good night.

397
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,199
OK, you are the most capable.

398
00:19:40,199 --> 00:19:41,199
Xiaosu,

399
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,199
is it you? Xiaosu.

400
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,920
Sister.

401
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,520
What a coincidence!

402
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,920
How wonderful we can meet on the street!

403
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,119
Really. Come. Have a seat.

404
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:51,640
Do you know?

405
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,160
A couple of days ago,
I talked with my friend about

406
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,000
having not seen you for years.

407
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,959
I was thinking

408
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,400
if I could meet you some day.

409
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,560
Then here we are.

410
00:19:58,719 --> 00:19:59,319
Really?

411
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,079
Waiter, please take my order.

412
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,599
What would you like?

413
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Two cakes please.

414
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,520
Thank you.

415
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,119
What a coincidence!

416
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,479
What were you doing just now?

417
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,719
I saw you all by yourself there.

418
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,160
I'm looking for a place.

419
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,119
Looking for a place?

420
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,359
What for?

421
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,680
I wanna start my own business.

422
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,599
I think it's good to
start your own business.

423
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,280
It's freer.

424
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:22,319
I just started it. Nothing is ready yet.

425
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,160
So,

426
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:25,439
I just started to look for a place.

427
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,079
A place...

428
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,280
What a coincidence!

429
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,520
Long time ago,

430
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,760
I rented a studio,

431
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,359
and it will expire in a year.

432
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,920
But

433
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,280
I just received a job offer from abroad,

434
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,199
and I might be leaving soon.

435
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,160
I was thinking about

436
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,239
what to do with the studio.

437
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,119
Sister, how about this?

438
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,680
Let me rent your studio.

439
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,000
No.

440
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,800
Why?

441
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,920
Do you think

442
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,119
I can't start my own business?

443
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,839
You don't have faith in me?

444
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,359
On the contrary, Xiaosu.

445
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm very optimistic about you.

446
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,959
When I was in school, I told many people

447
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,479
that you are naturally talented.

448
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,800
You are very good at this.

449
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,400
As for the studio,

450
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,680
you just use it.

451
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,280
No need to pay for the rent.

452
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,880
Count me in as a shareholder.

453
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:19,880
To start your own business,

454
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,439
you'll face problems and challenges.

455
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,439
If you need help,

456
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,920
please come to me anytime.

457
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,439
Although I'm abroad,

458
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,760
I still have many friends in China.

459
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:29,239
If you need,

460
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:30,920
they can help.

461
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,520
No need, sister.

462
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,079
You agree to rent the studio to me...

463
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,959
No... to let me use the studio for free.

464
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,680
It already helps me a lot.

465
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,160
Really appreciate it.

466
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,560
Why are you being so polite to me?

467
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:41,680
Let's eat.

468
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Mr. Lei,

469
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,239
I wanna take two hours off this morning.

470
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,400
Is it OK?

471
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,760
The studio of a friend of mine
is opening today.

472
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,359
I want to send my blessing in person.

473
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
We need some documents for
the meeting this afternoon.

474
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,319
Have you prepared yet?

475
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,400
You take two hours off.
You want me to prepare them by myself?

476
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,319
But I promised her.

477
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:04,160
He Qunfei,

478
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,079
friends and work,

479
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,760
which is more important?

480
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,479
Do you need me to tell you the answer?

481
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:11,280
But,

482
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,079
it's Du Xiaosu.

483
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,640
Du Xiaosu. Boss Du.

484
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,000
Do you like it? Isn't it gorgeous?

485
00:22:31,199 --> 00:22:33,199
I've spent fortune this time.

486
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,040
Roses?

487
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,760
How come you spent so much money?

488
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,160
Because I love you.

489
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,199
Thank you, sister.

490
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,680
It's about the time.

491
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,719
The guests should be here any time.

492
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,319
Can you receive the guests for me?

493
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,040
I have other things to do.

494
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,400
Only being a boss for a few minutes,

495
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,719
and you start to give me orders now.

496
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:52,040
Aren't you my best friend?

497
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:53,760
I can only rely on you.

498
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,680
Love you.

499
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,239
Do me a favor.

500
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,760
Be careful.

501
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,599
OK.

502
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,640
Very expensive.

503
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,520
Why are you here?

504
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,640
You are not welcomed here.

505
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,920
I'll pass your words to her.

506
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,319
Please let me in.

507
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
Let me say congratulations to Xiaosu.

508
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,599
The flowers stay and you go.

509
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,520
Xiaosu.

510
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,719
Qunfei.

511
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
You're here.

512
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,239
Why don't you come in?

513
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
I...

514
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,560
Qunfei is on my guest list.

515
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,199
He is your guest,

516
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,040
but I'm your shareholder.

517
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,760
I don't wanna see him.

518
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:46,959
Siqi,

519
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,839
I wanna apologize. Can you forgive me?

520
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,839
But you have to understand.

521
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:54,400
I'm angry with you
because I care about you.

522
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:02,400
Today is a big day for your best friend.

523
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,000
Can you give face to me and

524
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:05,160
don't make trouble?

525
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,760
Be happy.

526
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
Recently,

527
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,000
I've been thinking about
what you said before.

528
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,520
You always scolded me
for not being motivated enough.

529
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm now having preliminary plans

530
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,640
for our future.

531
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,040
Please forgive me once more.

532
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:23,920
Excuse me,

533
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,040
which one is Miss Du?

534
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:26,239
I am.

535
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,160
Please sign here for your flower basket.

536
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,280
Flower basket?

537
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,536
(Congratulations)

538
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,719
Du Xiaosu,

539
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,319
is someone having a crush on you?

540
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,432
(Lei Yuzheng
Miss Du, congratulations.)

541
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,160
Du Xiaosu.

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,359
The boss.

543
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,959
Being a boss at such a young age.

544
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,239
Awesome.

545
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,599
Yes, I am the boss.

546
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,040
And also a designer.

547
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:42,680
Why are there only yourself

548
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,439
in here?

549
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,119
I just opened this studio not long ago.

550
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,160
I haven't recruited anyone yet.

551
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,839
I want to know,

552
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,560
for house decoration,

553
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,680
what do you need?

554
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:54,640
We...

555
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,839
Little girl,

556
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,560
you have no client right now,

557
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,239
and we must be the first one.

558
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,119
You should offer us a big discount.

559
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,680
Well...

560
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,719
It depends on
the size of your department.

561
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
We offer different levels of discount.

562
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,119
There will be discount.

563
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,239
I want to know,

564
00:26:15,479 --> 00:26:17,800
do you want to decorate a new one
or renovate an old one?

565
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,160
-Well...
-Old one. Old one.

566
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:20,760
Old apartment renovation.

567
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,040
Small project.

568
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,719
It won't cost much.

569
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,959
Honey, right?

570
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,000
How about this?

571
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,479
We can go to take a look
if you have time now.

572
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:30,839
Sure.

573
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,479
Alright.

574
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,079
OK.

575
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:32,920
Then, let's go.

576
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,119
Let's go, honey.

577
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,000
Come in.

578
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,920
Miss Du, come in.

579
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,599
Please, come in.

580
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,680
Look, this is my apartment.

581
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,680
Come, come.

582
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,000
Mainly the bathroom over there.

583
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,839
The bathroom is a bit problematic.

584
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,119
Come, take a look.

585
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,400
Over here.

586
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,000
Are you sure you just want to

587
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,560
simply renovate this bathroom?

588
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:05,000
Yes.

589
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:06,959
Only ten years old.

590
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
By the way, this flush toilet

591
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,199
definitely has a problem.

592
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
The drains are all clogged up,

593
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,599
and they need to be unclogged.

594
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,640
I think you should find

595
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,640
a sewer dredging company.

596
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,760
You are the right person.

597
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,079
You are in decoration business.

598
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,319
To you, this is just a piece of cake.

599
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,680
Easy to fix.

600
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,359
Right?

601
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,400
I think your bathroom

602
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:29,560
needs renovation.

603
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,280
It will

604
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,119
take one week.

605
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,439
One week?

606
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,199
Are you kidding me?

607
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:38,400
You wanna earn more labor cost?

608
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:39,520
Just two days,

609
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,680
and you'll get it done for sure.

610
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,719
Two days?

611
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:45,119
What? Two days not enough?

612
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,439
If so, I'll find someone else.

613
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,920
Many decoration companies out there,

614
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,760
and I can easily find one.

615
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,599
OK, two days are fine.

616
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,560
Two days.

617
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,319
Deal.

618
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,439
How's your day?

619
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:12,280
Look, what delicious food I got for you?

620
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,880
Foie Gras Sushi.

621
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:15,680
Enjoy it.

622
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Why are you being so nice today?

623
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,319
So generous.

624
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,719
Did Qunfei buy these for you?

625
00:28:22,479 --> 00:28:24,280
He's not that generous.

626
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:25,760
Shangguan took me to

627
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,680
a super premium
Japanese restaurant today.

628
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,520
You can take advantage of me.

629
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,800
Then I won't eat.

630
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,839
I don't wanna take advantage of you.

631
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,839
It's your call.

632
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
You deserve to starve to death.

633
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:38,719
Siqi,

634
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:41,280
didn’t you and Qunfei get back together?

635
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,199
So...

636
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,719
My best friend,

637
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
you cannot tell him

638
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,800
that I had dinner with Shangguan.

639
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,199
Don't tell He Qunfei, OK?

640
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,280
Siqi,

641
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,000
if you don't like He Qunfei,

642
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,040
you can just

643
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:57,920
tell him clearly.

644
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,000
Don't lie to him.

645
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,400
Lie to him?

646
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,760
What you said is like

647
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm sitting on the fence.

648
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,520
I didn't mean that.

649
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
It's unfair.

650
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,400
There is nothing
black and white in this world.

651
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,479
Shangguan helps me make money.

652
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,040
I wanna have a better life.

653
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,040
What's wrong with it?

654
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,880
If you wanna have a better life,

655
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,160
you can rely on yourself.

656
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,560
Get it on your own.

657
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,199
That would be the best.

658
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,239
Madam,

659
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,079
are you satisfied with it?

660
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,839
That's not bad.

661
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
This floor drain and toilet

662
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,079
are unclogged.

663
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,880
-OK.
-And...

664
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,839
This heater is a bit old,

665
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,640
so I changed to a new one.

666
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,920
A new one?

667
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Really not bad.

668
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,439
And this perfume.

669
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,000
This is for you.

670
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,040
Hope you like it.

671
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:47,400
Thank you.

672
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,319
By the way, the money,

673
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,119
this is for you.

674
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,880
Thank you.

675
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,920
Please, count it.

676
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:54,880
OK.

677
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,719
Thank you for the hard work.

678
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,439
Thank you.

679
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,680
What time is it?

680
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,520
Why doesn't Siqi come back?

681
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,640
Going out on a date again?

682
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:25,184
(He Qunfei)

683
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,640
Hello, Qunfei.

684
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:28,599
Xiaosu.

685
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:30,760
Is Siqi with you?

686
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,719
Why didn't she answer the call?

687
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,560
I...

688
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,359
Did she go out with Shangguan again?

689
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,479
No.

690
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:41,839
She is at home.

691
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,959
She... She just...

692
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,119
She is in the bathroom just now.

693
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:46,959
Really?

694
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:48,920
You are not lying to me, Xiaosu?

695
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,800
How could I lie to you?

696
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,119
She's really in the bathroom.

697
00:30:52,479 --> 00:30:53,560
Or,

698
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:55,040
I'll ask her to
call you back in a while.

699
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:56,119
OK.

700
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,839
Don't forget.

701
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,719
OK. Bye.

702
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,040
Hello. Who is this?

703
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,760
Are you the merchant of B1101
in Yuanyang Center?

704
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,199
Yes, I am.

705
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,719
I am the property management
of Yuanyang Center.

706
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,079
Please go to your store soon.

707
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,839
Something happened there.

708
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,520
-I'm so angry!
-Take it easy.

709
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,959
Please speak slowly.

710
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,040
I can't speak slowly!

711
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:34,839
I tell you...

712
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,680
It's her.

713
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Du!

714
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Stop there!

715
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,599
You keep saying that you are a designer,

716
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,599
but you turn out to be a thief.

717
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,719
Don't get emotional.

718
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Please speak slowly.

719
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,359
Maybe you are wrong about a good person.

720
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,400
I am wrong about a good person?

721
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,800
Madam, what do you mean?

722
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,560
She stole my stuff.

723
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,280
Madam, do we have any misunderstanding?

724
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,479
How could I steal your stuff?

725
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:56,959
This little girl

726
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,680
is good at pretending

727
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,079
to be innocent.

728
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,800
Why not become an actor?

729
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,079
Look, she is wearing a necklace.

730
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,359
This necklace is very valuable.

731
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,040
It must be stolen.

732
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,599
Don't talk nonsense.

733
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,319
Madam,

734
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
please don't sling mud at me,

735
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,760
and talk nonsense.

736
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,079
Talk nonsense?

737
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,040
Let me ask you.

738
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,520
There is a partition

739
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
above the sink in my apartment.

740
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:17,439
I put a jade bracelet in it.

741
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,079
It is an ancestral bracelet.

742
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,319
I put it there.

743
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,199
I have never seen any jade.

744
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,079
I don't even know
what the bracelet looks like.

745
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,040
Let me search you!

746
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,119
How can you search me?

747
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,040
I have to search you today!

748
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,959
Enough!

749
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,160
Stop!

750
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,719
Miss,

751
00:32:32,439 --> 00:32:33,280
if you really have it,

752
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:34,479
please give it back to us.

753
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,359
My wife has a bad temper.

754
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,760
She won't stop if she cannot find it.

755
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,119
Sir,

756
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,119
I really didn't take anything.

757
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,599
How could I take your stuff?

758
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,199
You are still making excuses.

759
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,479
Don't admit it?

760
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:49,959
I have to search you?

761
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,520
I must search you today!

762
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Go away. Stop!

763
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,280
Madam, stop!

764
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,280
Madam, don't do this.

765
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,719
Stop making trouble!
You cannot search me.

766
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,040
Madam,

767
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:00,959
are you OK? Are you alright?

768
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,719
You... You beat me up!

769
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,280
You beat me up!
I will have a fight with you!

770
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,119
What are you doing? Madam, Madam!

771
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,520
It is illegal.

772
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,160
Officer,

773
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:19,599
it's this woman.

774
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,800
She stole my jade bracelet.

775
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
This person has gone too far.

776
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,959
You have to arrest her.

777
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,400
Sentence her a few more years.

778
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:26,760
Will she dare to steal things?

779
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,319
I already said that

780
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,719
I didn't take it.
What I said is what I did.

781
00:33:28,959 --> 00:33:29,520
You have no evidence.

782
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,199
Why are you framing me?

783
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,400
You didn't steal it?

784
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,079
Well,

785
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,880
no one came to my apartment these days,

786
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,880
except you.

787
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,239
OK, stop yelling.

788
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,959
Officer,

789
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,920
I already said that

790
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,520
I really didn't take it.

791
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,319
You can get the surveillance video

792
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,040
and you are allowed to search my place.

793
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,719
I am a designer.

794
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,839
My studio just opened up.

795
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,920
This is the first deal I made.

796
00:33:52,479 --> 00:33:53,680
I didn't have much sleep
in the past two days and

797
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,680
only earned 800 yuan.

798
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:58,920
You can say that my design
is not good enough,

799
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,560
or I'm not doing well enough.

800
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,839
But you cannot wrong me, nor

801
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,560
slander me.

802
00:34:04,439 --> 00:34:05,839
We will investigate thoroughly

803
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
and won't wrong a good person,

804
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,800
nor let off a single bad one. OK?

805
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,760
Officer, let me tell you.

806
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
I know a lot about women like her,

807
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,760
a recent graduate

808
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,439
who earns little money

809
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,239
but wants good clothes and

810
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,320
luxury bags.

811
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,320
How can they get the money?

812
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,520
They ask for it from their parents

813
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:23,879
and boyfriends.

814
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,800
And if it does not work, they steal

815
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,360
and don't even feel ashamed.

816
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
Stop it.

817
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,080
Don't argue anymore, OK?

818
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:32,439
And you, call your family, OK?

819
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,840
We have to make a record here.

820
00:34:39,936 --> 00:34:41,024
(Zou Siqi)

821
00:34:42,368 --> 00:34:44,320
(Audio-video Surveillance Area)

822
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,656
(He Qunfei)

823
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,159
Why didn't the two answer the phone?

824
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:21,376
(Lei Yuzheng)

825
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,040
Mr. Lei,

826
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,560
this is Du Xiaosu.

827
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,639
I have some trouble here.

828
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,199
Could you please
come to the police station?

829
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Mr. Lei,

830
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,719
I...

831
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,840
No need to say anything,

832
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,639
and leave everything to me.

833
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,120
Mr. Wang,

834
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,399
I have paid the bail.

835
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,560
This has nothing to do with her.

836
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,879
Go and figure out what happened.

837
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,679
I will sue the shrew outside

838
00:36:30,879 --> 00:36:32,360
for defamation and malice.

839
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,479
If she is still being unreasonable,

840
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,639
I will take on her to the end.

841
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,679
Understood, Mr. Lei.

842
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:48,919
It is all right now.

843
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,159
I will take you home.

844
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,639
Let's go.

845
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,320
Officer,

846
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,639
why could she leave?

847
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,800
My bracelet is still not found yet.

848
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,479
How can she go?

849
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,760
Officer, stop her!

850
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:39,919
Honey, honey, honey...

851
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,719
-What's the matter ?
-It's misunderstanding.

852
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,600
What's wrong?

853
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,479
We really wronged this girl.

854
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:43,800
How can it be?

855
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,439
I found the bracelet.

856
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,239
Bracelet is found?

857
00:37:58,199 --> 00:37:59,800
I can do it by myself.

858
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,120
Don't move.

859
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Bear it.

860
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,280
You can really fight.

861
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:19,959
For this kind of person,

862
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,439
even no need to say one extra word.

863
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,479
Next time, just call the police,

864
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,479
and leave everything to the lawyer.

865
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,600
Do not fight when you are alone.

866
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,280
Now I know the society is so complicated

867
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,879
and learned from this experience.

868
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,280
The scars on your face,

869
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,479
don't let them touch water these days.

870
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,080
Otherwise,

871
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,120
you will not look as beautiful as before

872
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:45,600
with scars on the face.

873
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,399
Don't be so exaggerated.

874
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,120
Xiaosu,

875
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:54,040
you are facing these people every day.

876
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,600
I'm really worried.

877
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:59,800
No cross, no crown.

878
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,320
I will have my bread.

879
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:03,040
Everything will get better.

880
00:39:03,439 --> 00:39:04,199
Isn't it?

881
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,840
What can I say?

882
00:39:07,439 --> 00:39:08,360
I always feel that

883
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
you are blindly optimistic.

884
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,439
Come here.

885
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,719
Let me...

886
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
Thank you for helping me today.

887
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:35,760
In the future,

888
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,639
you are the first honorary guest member

889
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,239
in my studio.

890
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,199
As long as you need decoration,

891
00:39:41,399 --> 00:39:42,239
I'll give you

892
00:39:42,439 --> 00:39:44,199
friendship discount
and the lowest price.

893
00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,080
Just friendship?

894
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:53,399
Let's go!

895
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,159
