71
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't show off!

72
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:10,760
I know.

73
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,320
Bro,

74
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
thank you for

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,640

00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,679
Don't worry.

80
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:32,279

81
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,399
Besides,

82
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040

89
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,519
there is another person

90
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,519
I've been worried about.

91
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,320
Go for it! Come on!

92
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,840

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,280

94
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,159

95
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,679
What are you doing sitting here
in the early morning?

96
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,119
Shao Zhenrong is leaving
for Yunnan today.

97
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,320
Yunnan?

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Why are you still sitting here?

99
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,159

100
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,080
Xiaosu,

101
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,799
in a girl's life,

102
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,080
it's not easy to meet a man
who loves you.

103
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,080
Not to mention that

104
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,039
you two really like each other.

105
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
Don't you miss him!

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,000
You'll regret it!

107
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,239
Don't worry. Just go. I'll clean it up.

108
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,559
Be careful!

109
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,919
Luckily, this cup is of good quality.

110
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,880
It's not broken.

111
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,799
God bless.

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
God bless Xiaosu.

113
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,440
Does Du Xiaosu know you're leaving?

114
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,200
She knows.

115
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,080
She's on her own,

116
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,760
away from home and working for living.

117
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,239
Her parents are not with her.

118
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,479
She carried all the grievance
on her own.

119
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,119
There's no one to share.

120
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,080
She likes to do everything

121
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,119
by herself.

122
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,320
So,

123
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,719
please take care of her for me.

124
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,520
You're treating
your bro like a babysitter.

125
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:09,239
She knows you're leaving,

126
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,280
and she doesn't come to see you off.

127
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,760
Forget it.

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,559
She must have her difficulties.

129
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,400
If she doesn't come,

130
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,640
we won't be embarrassed.

131
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,679
I've thought about it.

132
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,559
Seeing what she is like now,

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
it's useless for me to force her.

134
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,359
Just take this time

135
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,400
to let her think about it.

136
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,239
It's good for her to figure it out.

137
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,280
Dr. Shao, time for security check.

138
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,599
I'm leaving, bro.

139
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,880
Wish you a good journey.

140
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,320

143
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080

you'll encounter,

165
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,119
Where is the airport lounge?

166
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,640
OK. Hold on one second.
I'll check for you.

170
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,640
Yes.

171
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not even the time to take off yet!

172
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,440
Thank you.

173
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,400
You're welcome.

174
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,880
Sorry, the number you dialed
has been powered off.

175
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,820
(Xiaosu, I'm taking off soon. I'll miss
you and wait for me to come back.)

176
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:11,960
I'll wait for you.

177
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,479
I'll wait for you to come back.

178
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,880
Miss Du. What a coincidence!

179
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,960
You also come to the airport
to see someone off.

180
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,159
I...

181
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,239
I come to...

182
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,760
Don't you tell me that

183
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,799
you come to the airport
to see Zhenrong off.

184
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
I'm sorry I'm late.

185
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:42,440
Not seeing Zhenrong,

186
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,320
I feel very sorry.

187
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:47,520
You are sorry?

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,599
For not seeing

189
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,000
how hurt Zhenrong is?

190
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,559
I will wait for him to come back.

191
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Fine.

192
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
What you mean is

193
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,400
you're going to

194
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,479
make up with him again?

195
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,320
OK.

196
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,159
In this world,

197
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,520
some people regard love

198
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,320
as air and water.

199
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Some people regard love

200
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,799
as icing on the cake.

201
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,520
And Zhenrong,

202
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,479
he regards love as life.

203
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,840
To you, Miss Du,

204
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:32,880
what is love?

205
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,760
Du Xiaosu,

206
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,000
you've changed over and over again.

207
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,280
Have you ever thought
about his feelings?

208
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,760
Don't look at me like this!

209
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,760
Have I wronged you?

210
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,119
No, I didn't!

211
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,559
You didn't?

212
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:03,320
It's you went to the hospital
on purpose to approach my brother.

213
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,440
It's you who pester him
with his kindness and simplicity.

214
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,599
It's still you not to take care of his
feelings, and you just called it off!

215
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:14,880
Du Xiaosu,

216
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
what makes you?

217
00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:20,719
I said I didn't!

218
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,239
I didn't pester him.

219
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,440
I've also told you

220
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,520
I'm serious.

221
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,239
You're serious?

222
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,880
Du Xiaosu,

223
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:35,200
your seriousness is really cheap.

224
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,359
Remember what I said today.

225
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,320
You'd better start

226
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,599
praying for him from now on.

227
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,760
If anything happens to him,

228
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
it isn't over!

229
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,320
Miss Du?

230
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,200
Hello. Welcome to Damiani.

231
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,000
Hi.

232
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:15,520
Miss Du?

233
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,320
Yes, I am.

234
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,960
Hi.

235
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,640
The diamond ring that Dr. Shao ordered

236
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,119
has been here for a week.

237
00:16:23,479 --> 00:16:25,599
But he didn't come for it.

238
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,080
We can't reach him.

239
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:29,039
So, we called you.

240
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,039
Luckily,

241
00:16:32,119 --> 00:16:34,039
back then, Mr. Shao left two numbers.

242
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,479
Otherwise,
if the retention period is overdue,

243
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,679
we really don't know what to do.

244
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,679
Fine. I have to strike first!

245
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,919
How about I marry you?

246
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,760
Why not?

247
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,199
When did he place an order?

248
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,760
About half a month ago.

249
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,280
Miss Du. So lucky you are!

250
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,839
The staff in our store
are all envious of you.

251
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:15,959
Your boyfriend loves you so much.

252
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Where are you going?

253
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,119
I've booked the ticket to Yunnan.

254
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,719
Business trip?
Haven't heard you mentioned that.

255
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,760
You shouldn't be...

256
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,280
Siqi,

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,640
I'm going for him!

258
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,760
I have to!

259
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,280
Well, put down your luggage first.

260
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,920
Impulsion brings trouble.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,079
Come and sit.

262
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,560
I can understand how you feel.

263
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,000
But honey, don't you forget

264
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,479
how hard it was for you to break up.

265
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:10,920
Siqi,

266
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,119
have you ever seen a perfect love?

267
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,599
Of course I haven't.

268
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,040
I would've got married
if I have seen one.

269
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:18,800
So,

270
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,119
love is the joy and sorrow of the world.

271
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,000
In reality, every relationship

272
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,640
will encounter all kinds of obstacles,
more or less.

273
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,119
I love Zhenrong, and he loves me.

274
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,280
I really regret it now.

275
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,040
Why did I give up

276
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,040
so easily back then?

277
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,760
It hurt him

278
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,479
and also myself.

279
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,040
His mother is against of us.

280
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,680
I can try hard and make changes,

281
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,199
or figure out how
to make his mother accept me.

282
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,280
I shouldn't just pronounce

283
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:53,719
the death of our love.

284
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,319
I want to make a bet for this.

285
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,319
Is it from him?

286
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,839
Let me have a look.

287
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,119
When was it?

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,079
So beautiful!

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,640
It turns out that
all his promises to me are true.

290
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,439
Every single life scene about the future

291
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,839
we've talked about

292
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,839
is real.

293
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,400
So Siqi,

294
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:28,160
I have to go for him.

295
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,839
I'm going to tell him

296
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,800
I was wrong.

297
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,359
I...

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,040
I do!

299
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,079
Does he know that you're going for him?

300
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,280
He has been unable to get through.

301
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,000
But I can't wait.

302
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,079
So I asked for leave.

303
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,760
I want to give him a surprise.

304
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't know what to say about you.

305
00:19:58,479 --> 00:19:59,359
I have to leave.

306
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,160
Are you leaving right now?

307
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
Slow down!

308
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,439
The news just reported
a heavy rain there.

309
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,820
(Live Scene in Yunan)

310
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,199
Have you brought an umbrella with you?

311
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,119
Take care and be safe!

312
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
The flight has been delayed
for more than two hours.

313
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,119
Is the flight still available?

314
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,760
Don't worry. Please calm down.

315
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:31,760
Since there is a heavy rain
in Kunming right now,

316
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,239
the flight condition is terrible.

317
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,599
We're also waiting for the notice
from our superiors.

318
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,439
We can't rule out the possibility
of taking off tomorrow.

319
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,359
We're also waiting for the notice.

320
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:41,760
Please be patient, will you?

321
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:42,800
Tomorrow?

322
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,680
It's not available until tomorrow?

323
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,079

as soon as we have any news.

00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,160
Are you OK with that?

327
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
How long do we have to wait?

328
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,359
I know you'll come back to us.

I can't get in touch with you.

334

about you. Is everything OK with you?)

00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,392
(Shao Zhenrong)

375
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:36,392
(Shao Zhenrong)

376
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,079
Miss.

377
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,079
Is this your phone?

378
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,719
Miss?

379
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
Miss?

380
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,319
Is this your phone?

381
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,439
Thank you.

382
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,319
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed

383
00:24:57,479 --> 00:24:58,800
is not in the service area
for the time being.

384
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,599
The traffic interruption

385
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,560
has brought great difficulties

386
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,000
to the rescue work.

387
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,280
At present, the Municipal Party
Committee and the government

388
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,880
are actively organizing rescue forces

389
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,079
to strive for precious time

390
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,839
to rescue the people
in the disaster area.

391
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:15,099
(Jiangnan Historical Relic Industry
Science and Technology)

392
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:19,079
Sir,

393
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:19,920
to Shilin!

394
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,119
Take me to Shilin Hospital!

395
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:31,680
No blood pressure.

396
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,680
Ready for defibrillation!

397
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:35,599
Charge 200 Joules.

398
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:46,012
One adrenaline.

399
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,479
Hi, Miss Nurse.

400
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,599
I want to check...

401
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Xiaosu,

402
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:13,880
no matter what difficulties
you encounter,

403
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
I will accompany you to the end

404
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,119
as long as you give me the chance.

405
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,479
I have faith

406
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,920
to make you love me more every day.

407
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:29,160
Xiaosu,

408
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
wait for me to come back.

409
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,160
You can't go in there!

410
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,119
He's being rescued inside!

411
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,719
Let me go in there just for a second!

412
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,719
You really can't go inside!

413
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:45,920
You can't go in there!

414
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:46,319
Come on!

415
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,040
Please calm down!

416
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,119
Please! Just let me in for a second!

417
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:49,359
You really can't go in there!

418
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,479
I'm sorry!

419
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:23,880
Zhenrong,

420
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
wake up!

421
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,079
Open your eyes and look at me, will you?

422
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:29,959
Zhenrong!

423
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,400
I'm sorry for your loss.

424
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:42,520
Sorry for my loss?

425
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,560
Why did you say that to me?

426
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,959
I beg you. Please give it another try!

427
00:28:48,439 --> 00:28:50,000
We've really tried our best.

428
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,359
I beg you. I know you can do it!

429
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,199
Doctor.

430
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I know you are very good!

431
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,400
I know you can wake him up!

432
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,040
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,439
No!

434
00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:01,319
No!

435
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,599
Let him go!

436
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,560
Don't touch him!

437
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,760
Don't you touch him!

438
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,599
He can't leave me alone!

439
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,760
You can't leave him alone here.

440
00:29:09,439 --> 00:29:10,280
Doctor!

441
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:11,520
Doctor, I beg you!

442
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,719
Please help him!

443
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,920
Please do help him!

444
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,680
I beg you, doctor!

445
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,439
No way.

446
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,439
He really can't be gone just like this,
doctor!

447
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:20,119
We've really tried our best.

448
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,239
Ms. Shao had an emergency shock

449
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,719
caused by excessive grief.

450
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,839
I'll give her some medicine later.

451
00:29:47,239 --> 00:29:48,160
Have some rest.

452
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,119
No big deal.

453
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:51,839
Mrs. Zhao.

454
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:53,839
Please

455
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,199
take good care of Aunt Shao at home.

456
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:56,640
Yuzheng,

457
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,040
you want to...

458
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,400
I'll go to get him back home.

459
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,040
Zhenrong.

460
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:15,119
Zhenrong.

461
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,280
How about I marry you?

462
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,680
OK.

463
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
You said yes!

464
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,280
You've said that
you're going to marry me!

465
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
From now on,

466
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,760
Shao Zhenrong belongs to Du Xiaosu.

467
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Zhenrong.

468
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:42,920
You woke up.

469
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,520
You woke up.

470
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,760
You've been sleeping
for most of the day.

471
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,280
What time is it now?

472
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,079
It's already afternoon.

473
00:31:10,432 --> 00:31:12,712
Please sign over here.

474
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:22,840
(Death Notice)

475
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,959
You're lying to me, aren't you?

476
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,920
Where did you hide Zhenrong?

477
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm going to look for him now!

478
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,599
I'm going to look for him now!

479
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,280
You must've hidden him.

480
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,079
Where did you hide Zhenrong?

481
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,800
It must be you to hide him!

482
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,719
Calm down!

483
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,680
Then I am leaving, bro.

484
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:48,880
Bye.

485
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,040
Zhenrong!

486
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,079
Zhenrong, wake up!

487
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm having a dream, aren't I?

488
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:52,760
You and the doctor got together

489
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,079
and played a joke on me, didn't you?

490
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,560
I know you won't leave me.

491
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,959
Get up and let's go home.

492
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,079
Get up, will you?

493
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,880
Get up! Get up!

494
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,280
Why are you like this?

495
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,880
You can't leave me just like this!

496
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,119
Didn't you say that

497
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,599
you would marry me?

498
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,880
Look at this.

499
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,959
The ring.

500
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:39,439
I got the ring you ordered for me.

501
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:45,319
I know

502
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:48,560
you're about to propose to me,
aren't you?

503
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,319
Zhenrong!

504
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,119
Wake up!

505
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,119
Don't sleep!

506
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,199
I'll change!

507
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,840
Why are you here?

508
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:18,439
You don't deserve it!

509
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,159
Mr. Lei,

510
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,439
don't be too sad.

511
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,959
For the loss of Dr. Shao,

512
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,719
we're also very sorry.

513
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,679
On the way back from Dake Country,

514
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,879
he was encountered with debris flow.

515
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,159
The car overturned.

516
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,719
His internal organs were badly squeezed.

517
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,040
Actually, on the way back,
he was already...

518
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
Thank you.

519
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,479
My brother is the most extravagant.

520
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,479
He has a large collection of watches
of famous brands.

521
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,360
He has such a good taste.

522
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,919
Have a sleep.

523
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,600
Let me get you back home.

524
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,679
How is it so sudden?

525
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,600
I had dinner with Zhenrong
just a few days ago.

526
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,520
He is just gone like this.

527
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,760
So poor Aunt Shao is!

528
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,760
And his girlfriend.

529
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,320
Aren't they getting married?

530
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:08,320
It was natural calamity and
man-made disaster that came together.

531
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:12,879
This is destiny.

532
00:36:14,399 --> 00:36:15,439
He was doomed.

533
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,800
They're not meant to be together.

534
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,120
Do you have to be so particular
about going to a funeral?

535
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,800
Zhenrong was like my brother,

536
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,760
and we three grew up together.

537
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,399
I certainly should

538
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:39,679
honor him for the last time decently.

539
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,040
Aunt Shao,

540
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,320
I brought him back for you.

541
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,919
Zhenrong.

542
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:10,080
Why leaving your mother here alone?

543
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,639
Aunt Shao,

544
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,239
you have two sons.

545
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,080
Zhenrong's gone.

546
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,399
I'm your son!

547
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
I will take care of you.

548
00:37:23,879 --> 00:37:24,879
Kaixuan,

549
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,439
let Zhenrong

550
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,600
in first.

551
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:02,679
Zhenrong,

552
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,399
you told me before

553
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,719
that you dreamed of coming cross

554
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,239
someone you're destined to meet

555
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,840
neither too early,

556
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,800
nor too late.

557
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,399
But at the very moment,

558
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,080
you realized that the person is

559
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,280
right there waiting for you.
