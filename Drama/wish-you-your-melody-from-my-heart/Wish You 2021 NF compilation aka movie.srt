00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,876
Breathing heavily

2
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:48,089
I'm running to you

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:54,804
You used to look at me with affection

4
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:02,771
Don't go too far

5
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,942
I trace back in my memory

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:14,032
To go back
To where I used to walk with you

7
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:24,918
I wish for you

8
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,677
I won't lose you even for a moment

9
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:43,937
I want you to

10
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,528
Hey.

11
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,115
Is everyone there?

12
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,742
I'm almost there.

13
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,786
Okay.

14
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,954
I'll see you in a bit.

15
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:13,151
"GOOD MORNING PARIS"

16
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,158
Good work, guys.

17
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:03,493
You too.

18
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,494
Bye.

19
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,495
-Bye, Sang-i.
-Bye.

20
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,871
-Bye.
-Bye.

21
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,850
YOU'VE RECEIVED 1,353,800 WON

22
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,404
The bus is here.

23
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,746
What's up with you seeing me off today?

24
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,457
Will you make me work again?

25
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,501
Bye. Thank you for your work today.

26
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,503
-Bye.
-Bye.

27
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,307
Excuse me.

28
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,937
Hey, Kang In-su.

29
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,982
Don't forget to check the video.

30
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,651
And don't be so surprised.

31
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:19,819
All right.

32
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,406
-Bye.
-Bye.

33
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,710
Thank you.

34
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,052
IN-SU'S MUSIC BOX

35
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,180
"WISH YOU: THE ORIGINAL MIX"

36
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,300
Thank you
for your hard work today, everyone.

37
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,971
Let's work hard
on the ongoing project too.

38
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,139
-Okay.
-Okay?

39
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,557
Let's go for it!

40
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,350
Let's have a toast.

41
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,810
-Good work!
-Good work!

42
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,770
Let's drink, everyone.

43
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,814
-Bottoms up!
-Please spare me.

44
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,607
I might pass out.

45
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,444
Let's make it to go to work
on time tomorrow!

46
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,778
Goodness.

47
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,905
-What are you saying?
-You're so mean.

48
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,490
I'll be watching all of you.

49
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,117
Please go easy on us.

50
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,994
You know that's a hard thing to do.

51
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,289
Oh, right. Gyeong-sik.

52
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,915
-I told you.
-I…

53
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,267
Was I out for too long?

54
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,186
Who's the guy in that video?

55
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,896
He's good-looking.

56
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,900
His name is Kang In-su.
I'm into his song these days.

57
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,278
-Would you like to hear it?
-Yes.

58
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,745
-It's not bad.
-No.

59
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,507
Can you please send this video to me?

60
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,799
Sure, I will.

61
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,513
You know what, Sang-i?

62
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,142
You're very cute.

63
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,234
It's fun to tease you.

64
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,821
I'll go back in.

65
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,209
Let's have another round!

66
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,628
Can we be late for work tomorrow, ma'am?

67
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,088
Of course not!

68
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,217
Ma'am!

69
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,468
Wait for me.

70
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,938
Come on.

71
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,440
Sang-i. Shall we go somewhere else?

72
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,776
-Really?
-Yes.

73
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,199
Did I surprise you again?
Of course I was just kidding.

74
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,285
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,454
You're very hardworking.

76
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,874
When I was a part-timer,
I just killed time.

77
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,210
I'm enjoying my work.

78
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,337
That's why I'm working hard.

79
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,507
Should I ask my boss
to hire you as a full-timer?

80
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,342
I swear allegiance.

81
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,429
Oh.

82
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,786
Sang-i.

83
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,289
-Sang-i.
-Yes?

84
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,333
Are you not going?

85
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,461
I'm sorry.

86
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,430
Where's Gyeong-sik?

87
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,639
Let's eat this!

88
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,975
Again? Gosh, I'm so sick of it.

89
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
Excuse me, ma'am.

90
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,688
I'm sorry…

91
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,193
but can I…

92
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,694
You can go.

93
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,030
I'll make up an excuse for you.

94
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,908
Go get his autograph
or take a picture with him.

95
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,535
Get his number too if you can.

96
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,456
Thank you.

97
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,904
Isn't this the best
when you feel frustrated?

98
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,157
What are you frustrated about?

99
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,577
Hey. When you look at the number of hits,

100
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,163
don't you feel sorry for me?

101
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,291
I'm working my butt off for you.

102
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,342
Hey. Is that my fault?

103
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,137
It's because you did a lousy job
with the video.

104
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,598
How can you say that to your buddy?
For goodness' sake.

105
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,767
Whatever. Just drink, you punk.

106
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,611
-Excuse me.
-We'll order in a bit.

107
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,822
Sorry. It's not that.

108
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,700
Well…

109
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,292
I think I left something here.

110
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,418
Excuse me.

111
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:45,973
What are you doing?

112
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,482
It's not here.

113
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,442
I'm sorry.

114
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,615
What's wrong with him?

115
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,386
Sang-i! Here.

116
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,597
Hi.

117
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,778
Did everyone else go home?

118
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:42,863
Yes, they called it a day.

119
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,535
How did it go?

120
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,078
Did you take a picture with him?

121
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:54,583
You are a timid person, aren't you?

122
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,001
It's nothing like that.

123
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,088
Well, I went back there.

124
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,758
But he was already gone.

125
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,846
I was disappointed.

126
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,640
I bet.

127
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,767
I'm disappointed too.

128
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,522
Hopefully, you can run into him again.

129
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,817
Ma'am! A glass of beer, please!

130
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,944
Have a drink.

131
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,946
Okay.

132
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,338
Hey. Are you working now?

133
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,259
I'll send you a video.

134
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,969
Watch it now, and let's talk.

135
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,431
Yes. I want to know
what you think about it.

136
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,434
Bye.

137
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:10,826
In-su.

138
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,661
Shall we work together?

139
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:14,997
I like your song.

140
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,500
Or let's be friends.

141
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,835
How about that?

142
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,196
Breathing heavily

143
00:15:53,952 --> 00:15:55,621
A minor and G.

144
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:58,832
I think that's it.

145
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,669
Okay.

146
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,382
Don't go too far

147
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,341
Good.

148
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:12,513
I trace back in my memory

149
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:19,561
To go back
To where I used to walk with you

150
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:29,822
I wish for you

151
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,455
I won't lose you even for a moment

152
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:48,090
I want you to

153
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:57,683
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

154
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,734
We were attracted to each other
Like destiny

155
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,780
We recognized each other right away

156
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,407
I feel

157
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:20,414
That your name and my name

158
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,584
Are becoming one

159
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,544
Hello?

160
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,300
Hey!

161
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,844
Excuse me!

162
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,723
I'm sorry.

163
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,309
Hey, you can't sing loudly at this hour.

164
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,145
Don't make me repeat this again.

165
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,189
Please be quiet. All right?

166
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,900
I got it. I apologize.

167
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,444
Don't make noise, for goodness' sake!

168
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,332
How have you been? It's been so long

169
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,213
It was good to see you smile
In such a long time

170
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:13,675
Hope you're doing fine
As you were in my dreams

171
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,885
I guess I'll never

172
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,136
That's enough.

173
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:19,097
What do you think?

174
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,684
It sounds familiar.
Songs like this are a dime a dozen.

175
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,813
It wouldn't suit anyone's taste.
Don't you agree?

176
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,609
Say something.
Am I the only one who thinks so?

177
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:33,529
All right. Next.

178
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,030
I'll play the next one.

179
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,782
I'm so fine

180
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:41,620
This is my paradise

181
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,039
Don't cross the line

182
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,959
Just keep watching me

183
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,043
Stop!

184
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,212
I'm so fine

185
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,338
Ma'am.

186
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,382
Please listen more--

187
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,134
Hey. You think I'm an amateur?

188
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,637
The intro is the same as the chorus.
What more should I expect?

189
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,099
Aren't you sick of
listening to the same thing every time?

190
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,185
Just take risks instead. Do you get it?

191
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,110
-Ma'am.
-Go ahead.

192
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,696
-Sang-i.
-Yes?

193
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,906
Can you play Kang In-su's video?

194
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:19,992
Yes.

195
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,958
Breathing heavily

196
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,005
I'm running to you

197
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:36,008
He's still a gemstone
that needs to be processed,

198
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,426
but I like him.

199
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,846
He has his own distinctive charms.

200
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,683
I think we should give it a go
and work with him.

201
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,436
Don't go too far

202
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,982
I trace back in my memory

203
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,777
Yu-jin. Can you make it work?

204
00:19:57,195 --> 00:19:58,071
Ma'am.

205
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,325
Can you work on it alone

206
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,493
and take responsibility for it all?

207
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,579
If you give me a chance,

208
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,456
I'd love to give it a go.

209
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,499
Ask for anything you need.

210
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,002
It's your first project. Do it well.

211
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,546
That's it for today.

212
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,465
Thank you, ma'am.

213
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,510
-He's so handsome.
-This is the edited version. Watch it.

214
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,803
-That guy?
-Yes.

215
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,720
He's cute.

216
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,638
-Isn't he?
-Yes.

217
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,431
Go ask for his number.

218
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,474
I can't.

219
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,892
You go ahead and try it.

220
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,978
Stop talking nonsense.

221
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,649
Here. Special coffee for Kang Star.

222
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,318
-Leave it there.
-Come on.

223
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,737
You make me feel sad.

224
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,657
You should at least taste it.

225
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,451
It must taste like coffee.
Don't make a fuss.

226
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
Kang Star. Have you watched
the video I uploaded?

227
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,084
I liked it. Good job.

228
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,210
Are you an idiot?

229
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,006
What are you happy about?
Can't you see what's going on?

230
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,261
I mean…

231
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,764
the number of hits
hasn't increased any further.

232
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,307
How can it be so low?

233
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,398
For goodness' sake. Hey, dude.

234
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:57,566
Don't be scared.

235
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,819
You're never serious.

236
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,489
I must be out of my mind.

237
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,951
I always give you free coffee.
I'm your cameraman and manager.

238
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,911
I even upload your videos on YouTube.

239
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,082
Have you ever been thankful to me
for all that?

240
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,794
Why are you so touchy?

241
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,838
Who makes cute Min-seong so angry?

242
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,716
-Huh?
-Let go of it, In-su.

243
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,426
Or I'll punch you.

244
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,136
-Go.
-Hey, Choi Min-seong.

245
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,721
-You're scaring me.
-Ouch.

246
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,723
For goodness' sake. Let go of it.

247
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,891
Excuse me.

248
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:36,354
Can I get your phone number?

249
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:44,029
I actually needed a lot of courage
to ask you for this.

250
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,408
-Do you have a girlfriend--
-He does.

251
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,203
He has a fiancee.
He's getting married soon.

252
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,045
I'm sorry.

253
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,675
Hey. Why did you say that?
I'm not getting married.

254
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,178
You'll soon become a superstar.

255
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,305
You shouldn't be dating anyone.

256
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,390
No way.

257
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,270
Min-seong. You're good enough
to be my manager.

258
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,314
-You punk.
-Hey.

259
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,565
For goodness' sake!

260
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,442
You do this to me habitually.

261
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,693
Hey, she left.

262
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,862
-You can't meet girls. Let go.
-Bring her back.

263
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,240
My cheeks hurt so much. Let go of them.

264
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,699
-Let go of mine first.
-Let go.

265
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,700
-Hey.
-Excuse me.

266
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,035
Are you Mr. Kang In-su?

267
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,832
Surprise.

268
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,584
I didn't expect you
to review it so quickly.

269
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,379
Thank you for doing that.

270
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,674
I'm the one who should say that.

271
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,968
You can always recommend new singers.

272
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,805
But, strangely, I feel nervous.

273
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,307
I can't believe it.

274
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,146
Kang In-su will definitely accept
your offer, right?

275
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,065
Actually, there's a problem.

276
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,528
Thanks to you, I got a chance to work
on my own project for the first time.

277
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,364
But there's no way…

278
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,950
I can contact Kang In-su.

279
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,122
What should I do? Oh, right.

280
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,000
Didn't you say you got his number?

281
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,042
You didn't?

282
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
I'm sorry, ma'am.

283
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,800
You're a big fan of his.
Then you should have his number.

284
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,554
Should I leave a message
on his YouTube page

285
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,638
saying I'm interested?

286
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,100
Isn't this place nice?

287
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,853
Yes.

288
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,856
Come here to take a walk
when you feel frustrated.

289
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,693
It's my secret place
that I haven't introduced to anyone,

290
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,570
but I'm showing it to you now.

291
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,739
Thank you.

292
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,159
There's a reason I brought you here.

293
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,120
Sang-i.

294
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,457
I hate to beat around the bush.

295
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,375
I'll be straight with you.

296
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,589
Okay. Go ahead.

297
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,134
You want to do it with me?

298
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,353
You're so handsome.

299
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,688
Drink this while you're talking.

300
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,065
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

301
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,151
We watched your video.
Have you taken vocal lessons?

302
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,778
He's a gifted singer.

303
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,781
You're the perfect person
for our new project.

304
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,833
Sang-i. I want to make a proposal to you.

305
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,297
-Sorry?
-Join the planning team as an assistant.

306
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,217
I'll pay you double
for working on the Kang In-su project.

307
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,679
-Oh.
-Stop working part-time.

308
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,932
Why don't you work full-time
for me instead?

309
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,813
Are you astonished by my offer?

310
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,733
You're saying
you want to hire me permanently,

311
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,693
-right?
-Hold on.

312
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,904
Hello?

313
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,740
Oh, okay.

314
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,075
Good job.

315
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:19,327
Bye.

316
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,830
In-su accepted my offer.

317
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,249
Shall we get back to work?

318
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
I'll do my best!

319
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,426
How was the surprise event?

320
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,344
Wasn't it great?

321
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,557
Goodbye.

322
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,350
Kang Star.

323
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,688
What are you saying?
It's not like I'm joining the army.

324
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,400
Don't laugh. Don't you know
how idol singers are produced?

325
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,902
Did you sign without knowing that?

326
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,279
Dude. Your father is…

327
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,160
Sorry.

328
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,125
-Sang-i.
-Yes?

329
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,877
Is this a celebratory performance?

330
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,672
There are not many people here tonight.

331
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,717
People will come as we play.

332
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,302
Yes. Let's start playing.

333
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:18,887
We can do it.

334
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,599
By the way, what if things go wrong
for me again?

335
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,269
Gosh, you're talking crap again.

336
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,855
You think I did all that work
just to hear you say that?

337
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,524
You're a future superstar chosen by me.

338
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,401
If you talk like a wimp again…

339
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,237
I'll turn into your detractor.

340
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,573
You got it, dude?

341
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,201
Min-seong.

342
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,704
Thank you.

343
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,001
That was so cheesy. Jeez.

344
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,007
If things don't work out again,
will you go back home?

345
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,842
I don't know.

346
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,053
It'll be one way or the other.

347
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,337
Hey. Isn't the pianist good?

348
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,181
It was hard to contact him.
This is Mr. Kang In-su, ma'am.

349
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,808
-Hi. I've heard a lot about you.
-Nice to meet you.

350
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,811
Please take good care of In-su.

351
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,563
Oh, I'm his friend and manager.

352
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:08,807
Good morning.

353
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,478
Mr. Yoon Sang-i.

354
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,898
Goodness. You've grown slack.

355
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:17,857
Good morning.

356
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,859
Ms. Lee wanted you as her assistant,

357
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,027
so I approved.

358
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,196
But you already got on my bad side.

359
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,407
I'm sorry.

360
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,702
The rookie you recently recruited
with Ms. Lee.

361
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,329
What was his name?

362
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,830
-In-su.
-Kang In-su!

363
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,249
Yes, I know.

364
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,877
He's quite mysterious.

365
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,010
Anyway, you got a big promotion
to assistant.

366
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,971
So train him well and redeem yourself.

367
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,473
I'll do my best.

368
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,809
You know doing your best isn't enough.

369
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,905
Good morning.

370
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,418
Sang-i.

371
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,211
Yes?

372
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,755
This is a press release.
Can you do a spell-check?

373
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,716
I have to go to the recording studio--

374
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,675
It's urgent.

375
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,885
You can do it quickly and go, right?

376
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,692
Sweetie. This is In-su,
who will get a test today.

377
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:43,985
And this is Min-seong.

378
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,028
Hello.

379
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,446
Nice to meet you.

380
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,747
-Mr. Yoon.
-Yes?

381
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,749
I said it's urgent.

382
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,001
If it'll take longer, give it back.

383
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,004
I'm sorry. I'll finish it quickly
and print it out.

384
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,802
Do you know where Ms. Lee Yu-jin is?

385
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,514
She must be in the recording studio.
That guy…

386
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,601
-Kang…
-Kang In-su.

387
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,187
Yes, him. She said she needed to test him.

388
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,482
What do you think of him?

389
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,027
Team leader likes him,
so things will work out well for him.

390
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,198
Anyway, please finish that quickly.

391
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,282
Yes, ma'am.

392
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,999
He's not bad.

393
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,380
When the singer is handsome,
you become harsh on him.

394
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,839
He's better than that.

395
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,634
When the singer is handsome, you like him

396
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,344
even before you listen to his song.

397
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,304
Have you already fallen in love with him?

398
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,141
He's handsome and good at singing as well.

399
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,559
What does that tell you?

400
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,894
I really like him.

401
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,729
I'm sorry it took so long, ma'am.

402
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,398
Thank you.

403
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,860
I'll send you an Excel file
via the Messenger app.

404
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,278
It's the singles sales data.

405
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,614
Can you make a chart of it
and send it to me?

406
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,660
Does it need to be done urgently?

407
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,953
What?

408
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,289
If not, can I go
to the recording studio first--

409
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:21,582
For what?

410
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,130
Ms. Lee Yu-jin might need some help.

411
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,311
Never mind. I'll make a chart
and send it to you.

412
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:51,404
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

413
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,114
In-su. That was great.

414
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,658
Can we listen to your other songs?

415
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,659
Yes.

416
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,369
But can I take a break?

417
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:01,080
Wasn't it good?

418
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,335
Excuse me.

419
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,009
Let's plan it well

420
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,178
and make it look salable.

421
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,555
Come on. You want to make a plan already?

422
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:20,224
We still have a long way to go, Yu-jin.

423
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
Stop whining. You're a pro.

424
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,275
By the way, pride is all that matters
for kids like him.

425
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,486
I'm not sure if he'll listen to me.

426
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,279
He's not even our new trainee.

427
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,489
Don't be scared.

428
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,657
Our higher-ups
already approved this project.

429
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,785
Let's do what we can.
If it doesn't work…

430
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:39,911
Then what?

431
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,291
Then I'm sure
you'll take care of it for me.

432
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,877
What do you think of him?

433
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,670
You know what my answer will be.

434
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,005
You found the right person.

435
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,343
It's like winning the lottery.
It's going to be a great success.

436
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,471
Where did you find such a talented guy?

437
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,431
Yu-jin. You're really good.

438
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,101
What?

439
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,186
Why are you saying that to me?

440
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,856
Okay.

441
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,318
All right. I said yes.

442
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:16,030
Mr. Yoon Sang-i.

443
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,114
Yes? I'm almost done.

444
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,449
No, it's not about that.

445
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,035
Ms. Lee Yu-jin is asking for you--

446
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,161
I'll be back.

447
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,668
What's going on?

448
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,671
Did he tell Ms. Lee about everything?

449
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,006
Why hasn't he come back? Call him.

450
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,638
The person you've dialed isn't available.

451
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:41,848
Jeez.

452
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
You'll be charged after the tone.

453
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,560
Hey, Dam-ro!

454
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,602
Yes?

455
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,229
There's a guy named In-su outside.

456
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,397
Tell him to get back.

457
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,398
Yes, sir.

458
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,786
-He's not outside.
-What?

459
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,079
I can't find him.

460
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,665
Gosh.

461
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,001
I wondered
why things were going so smoothly.

462
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,506
It was exhausting trying to find a cafe
in this neighborhood.

463
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,467
Goodness. You must've been waiting long.

464
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,468
-Hello.
-Hello.

465
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,262
Here.

466
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,976
I didn't know your tastes,
so I bought the same kind for you all.

467
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,188
Everyone.

468
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,274
Please take good care of In-su today.

469
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,318
Okay. Let's begin if you're ready.

470
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,403
Okay.

471
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,036
I was really flustered.

472
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,294
Isn't it surprising?

473
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,547
When I run into you

474
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:00,051
I feel like a broken machine

475
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,846
What's wrong with me?

476
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,308
All day

477
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,145
I can't stop smiling

478
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:18,402
I don't look like myself

479
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:25,785
My feelings for you keep growing inside me

480
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,704
I can't stop myself

481
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:29,830
He's good.

482
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,627
From going to you

483
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:41,300
Can I take a step closer to you?

484
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:49,058
I can't hide my feelings
No matter how hard I try

485
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:54,271
I'm still shy of telling you
How I feel about you

486
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,233
But if it's okay with you

487
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:03,072
I want to get closer to you
Little by little

488
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,226
Excuse me.

489
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,073
Are you…

490
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,009
Before signing the contract,

491
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,596
let me tell you there are four rules
we need you to follow.

492
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,724
Of course, those will be included
in the contract as well.

493
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:16,145
"First, the agency provides the artist
with a place to stay

494
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,147
and exercises control over them.

495
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,819
Second, the artist must delete
their social media accounts

496
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,404
such as Facebook or Instagram

497
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,907
or entrust the agency
with full powers over them."

498
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:40,628
Well… we want our new singers
to look mysterious.

499
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,339
But this goes against the trend.

500
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:50,054
"Third, the agency
takes 70 percent of the profits.

501
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,890
Fourth, the artist follows
the agency's directions

502
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,600
when producing music."

503
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,193
Well… Ms. Lee Yu-jin.

504
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:09,824
I have a comment to make on this
as Mr. Kang In-su's former manager.

505
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,119
-This is--
-Am I supposed to follow all those rules?

506
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,583
They're standard rules of this agency.

507
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,627
It'd be great if you could follow them,

508
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,088
but please tell us
if you want to change anything.

509
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,678
I'll entrust
my social media accounts to you.

510
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,933
But please keep everything about me secret
until I make my debut.

511
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,728
No one outside this agency must know.

512
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,357
And regarding the accommodations
you provide…

513
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,861
I don't want them.

514
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,904
I just want to stay at my place.

515
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,242
Why?

516
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,000
It's tiring to move my stuff.

517
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,882
In-su doesn't like to move

518
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,760
except when he does music.

519
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:15,055
-For goodness' sake.
-Okay.

520
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,476
But you still need to be
under the control of this agency.

521
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,102
Of course.

522
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,980
I'll ask one of my team members
to stay with you.

523
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,316
You can do that.

524
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,735
What about the percentage
of the profits you get?

525
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,069
Regarding profit-sharing…

526
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,366
I'll give you carte blanche.

527
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,536
I want to produce an album.

528
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,372
I want my songs to be on the charts.

529
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,708
That's what matters to me.

530
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,336
If I can make that happen,

531
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,838
I'll leave the rest up to you.

532
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,843
Why would you do that?

533
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,183
I want someone…

534
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,769
to see it.

535
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,688
Your girlfriend?

536
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,523
Or…

537
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,069
your sweetheart?

538
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,837
I should take this too.

539
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,552
What on earth is happening now?

540
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,392
Can I pick a team member
who will stay with you now?

541
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,937
Yes. I have an extra room in my place.

542
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,691
Who will be staying with me?

543
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,734
Mr. Yoon Sang-i will.

544
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,486
What? Me?

545
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,988
Mr. Yoon is my assistant

546
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,322
and the assistant producer

547
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,783
who will stay with you
until you make your debut.

548
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,665
I'm Kang In-su.
I'm looking forward to working with you.

549
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,626
I'm Yoon Sang-i.

550
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,202
Who's calling?

551
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,709
Hi, Ms. Lee.

552
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,149
-Just a second.
-Okay.

553
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,860
Gosh, I lost.

554
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,403
Have a seat.

555
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,075
What brings you here?

556
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,911
I just wanted to see you.

557
00:44:24,661 --> 00:44:26,080
-Sorry?
-Goodness.

558
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,082
Did I surprise you again?

559
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,541
Of course, I was just kidding.

560
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,794
Oh, I see.

561
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,963
I came here to give you a mission…

562
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,840
but you made me feel bad.

563
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,717
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

564
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,720
Fine. Are you moving in tomorrow?

565
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,516
-Yes.
-Are you happy?

566
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,352
What do you mean?

567
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,313
As a big fan of Kang In-su,
you'll be staying with him.

568
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,065
Aren't you happy?

569
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,781
By the way, what's the mission?

570
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:01,907
Oh.

571
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,452
It's about Kang In-su.

572
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,497
Keep an eye on him for 24 hours a day.

573
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,458
Find out if he has a girlfriend

574
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,836
or if there's anything we don't know.

575
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,093
What's wrong? You don't want to do it?

576
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,055
Well… Keeping an eye on someone is…

577
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,392
We need to help Kang In-su make his debut.

578
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,726
It has to be successful.

579
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,356
Thanks to you,
I found a diamond in the rough.

580
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,316
But let's be rational here.

581
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,444
He still has a long way to go.

582
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,574
Sang-i. Keep in mind
what I'm about to say to you now.

583
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,494
Our job is to find talented artists
and train them.

584
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,789
But that's to eventually sell them
in the market.

585
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,876
We're no different
from warriors on a battlefield.

586
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,671
If there's anything
that could reduce their commercial value,

587
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,048
we need to get rid of it.

588
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,553
Are you scared?

589
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,017
What's ahead of us is the real deal.

590
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,275
Here's a corporate credit card.

591
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,695
Use it from now on.

592
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,197
And don't forget.

593
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,615
Once you take it,

594
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,116
the battle begins.

595
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,209
Kang In-su's real character.

596
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,295
Don't you want to see it?

597
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,538
Not this.

598
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,877
I'll go for a denim jacket.

599
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,594
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Sang-i.

600
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:30,973
Let's go for it.

601
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:35,602
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kang.
I'm Yoon Sang-i.

602
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,574
BAUOE-RO

603
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,704
Hi.

604
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:37,789
Come on in.

605
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,467
-Are you a pervert?
-What?

606
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,553
No, no. I'm not.

607
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,888
I didn't mean to see it.

608
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:38,725
You have a nice body.

609
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,145
Go ahead and unpack.

610
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,108
And here's your key.

611
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,410
By the way, your house is really nice.

612
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:58,912
My house?

613
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:03,625
It'll take at least a month
to tell you the story about it.

614
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,878
But you'll find out as you stay here.

615
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,716
By the way, how old are you?

616
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,426
I was born in 1996.

617
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,054
In 1996? We're the same age.

618
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,265
No wonder I felt friendly towards you.

619
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,685
I was born early in 1996.

620
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:24,938
You're older then.

621
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,442
It's still the Year of the Rat.

622
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,569
Now what?

623
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,321
Are you older than me,
or are we the same age?

624
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,783
Either one is fine with me.

625
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,581
Let's just be friends.

626
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,458
We both are rat people.

627
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:47,836
Nice to meet you.

628
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,930
We're friends. Don't be so polite.

629
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,080
Hi, Ms. Lee.

630
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:27,626
Okay, I will. Bye.

631
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,008
Ms. Lee wants me to bring you
to the recording room tomorrow, Mr. Kang.

632
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,261
-Mr. Kang?
-Oh.

633
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,849
You, In-su.

634
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:05,664
Hi, Ms. Lee.

635
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,625
Just a second.

636
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,674
In-su.

637
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:18,343
The original song
is only with guitar accompaniment.

638
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,845
It's too plain,

639
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,555
so I arranged it.

640
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:24,015
Listen and try singing to it.

641
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,912
They're about to begin.

642
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,207
In-su?

643
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,295
No, there's nothing in particular.

644
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,730
Is something wrong?

645
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,192
Gosh, it's hard to make a living.

646
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,445
Did he say something to you too?

647
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,031
No, he didn't.

648
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,033
That jerk is a complete nutcase!

649
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:26,661
Does he think
he's as great as Beethoven or Mozart?

650
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:29,039
I'm no pushover either.

651
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,042
Do you know
how long I've been in this field?

652
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,085
Gosh, my pride has been hurt.

653
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,505
Sang-i. Listen up.

654
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:42,636
Go tell him to come back in an hour.
Or there won't be a next time.

655
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,678
Yes, sir.

656
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,681
I see.

657
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,434
Bye.

658
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,771
In-su.

659
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,985
I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

660
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,654
Shouldn't you get back?

661
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,489
-The producer told me to--
-Let's go.

662
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,310
MS. LEE YU-JIN

663
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,066
Don't answer it.

664
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,568
We need to do something after this.

665
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,654
Don't take it. Just eat.

666
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:55,750
What happened in the recording studio?

667
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,506
In-su.

668
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,261
I don't feel like singing today.

669
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,431
Let's just call it a day.

670
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,233
What should I do?

671
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,945
The producer thinks
it's because he arranged In-su's song

672
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,405
without consulting him.

673
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:30,076
I heard he stormed out of the studio
as soon as the intro began. Is that true?

674
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,871
I was talking to you on the phone
at that time,

675
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,998
so I don't know what exactly happened.

676
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,791
He hasn't signed with us yet.

677
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,793
Let him do as he pleases.

678
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,420
Yes, ma'am.

679
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,428
In-su.

680
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,060
Go ahead.

681
00:55:57,937 --> 00:55:59,189
I know how you feel.

682
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:04,444
But please don't do this.
Let's go back and solve it.

683
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,780
Solve what?

684
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,866
Is it something I need to solve?

685
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,579
I think you embarrassed
the producer earlier.

686
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,622
What?

687
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,249
Are you worried about him?

688
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,713
That's not what I mean.

689
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,591
I just hope things will work out.

690
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,719
Have you listened to the arranged version?

691
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,768
I was talking on the phone, so I couldn't.

692
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,103
That wasn't my song.

693
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,569
It was just an arranged version.
It was a misunderstanding.

694
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,862
I listened to the song…

695
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,323
and you didn't.

696
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,785
But you think I misunderstood it?

697
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,580
Fine.

698
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,500
Leave me alone.

699
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,840
I'm sorry, but let me say this.

700
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:09,300
I didn't listen to the arranged version,

701
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,427
but the agency has a plan for you.

702
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,888
They didn't make the plan to ruin you.

703
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,598
So please don't do this--

704
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,309
What do you know about music?

705
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:22,480
You think I'm doing this
just to become popular?

706
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,902
You don't know why I'm doing this…

707
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,364
and why I have to do this.

708
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,243
Do you?

709
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,630
Jeez.

710
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,554
Where's In-su?

711
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,224
Can you give us a minute?

712
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,228
Come on, Yu-jin.

713
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:06,357
Shouldn't you take my side
in a situation like this?

714
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,861
Don't you know what's more important now?

715
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,655
Right. I should be obedient.

716
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,033
I'm just a producer.

717
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,660
But you can't do this to me.

718
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,539
Gosh, it's really hard to make a living.

719
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,378
I'm sorry.

720
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,673
I think I ruined everything.

721
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,801
Come on. Are you already discouraged?

722
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,015
I think it's a good thing
that we could see the artistic side

723
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,183
of In-su this time.

724
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,478
I did it deliberately to see that.

725
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,104
What?

726
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,814
Deliberately?

727
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,566
I'm sorry.

728
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:53,488
But I had to test him to see
if he's a real artist or not.

729
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,450
I'm sorry to have fooled you,
but I wanted to see it.

730
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,536
It's the first time for both of us.

731
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,748
We work in different ways,
but our goals are the same.

732
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,209
We both want In-su
to make his debut successfully.

733
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,047
It was pretty tough for the first event.

734
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,258
But please tell In-su…

735
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,303
to arrange the song as he wants.

736
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,015
He can get help
from either you or someone else.

737
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:25,186
But if he fails to convince me,
he'll have to follow my directions.

738
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,940
He'll definitely accept it, right?

739
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,151
This is the best offer I can make to him.

740
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:20,927
I wish for you

741
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:25,932
You're the reason

742
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:32,230
I won't lose you even for a moment

743
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:40,446
I want you to

744
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:45,326
You believe me

745
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:51,916
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

746
01:01:57,713 --> 01:01:58,673
Hey.

747
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:01,926
I thought you wouldn't be back
anytime soon.

748
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,891
I'm sorry.

749
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:15,481
-It was good.
-What?

750
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,693
The one I heard at the recording studio
was rubbish.

751
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,695
The one you arranged for the piano…

752
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:22,905
was much better.

753
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,247
I actually didn't know what it lacked.

754
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,959
But you remedied it.

755
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,922
Well…

756
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,759
I didn't do anything.

757
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,094
Sang-i.

758
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,224
I'm sorry.

759
01:03:00,568 --> 01:03:02,403
Will you not accept my apology?

760
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,159
That's not what friends do.

761
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,789
I'm the one who's sorry.

762
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,503
You're a talented musician.

763
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:21,214
But I looked down on you.

764
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,425
I'm really sorry.

765
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,345
Why don't we…

766
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,097
arrange the song together?

767
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,854
Ms. Lee also wants you
to arrange it as you want.

768
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:45,571
It's you.

769
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,241
What?

770
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,243
You are…

771
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,329
my other half.

772
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,715
Shall we play it together?

773
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,156
Here.

774
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,826
Come on. Open your mouth.

775
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:32,869
I'll feed you.

776
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,246
Here.

777
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,249
This place is good.

778
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,503
-Is it delicious?
-Goodness.

779
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,381
You guys are having a good time.

780
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:47,884
Why are you so startled?
You gladly let him feed you.

781
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:51,429
Hi, Min-seong. I called him
because I was in a good mood.

782
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:53,889
What's going on? You started without me?

783
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,893
You got kicked out,
so I came to look after you.

784
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,437
But you two are having a good time.

785
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:00,896
Let me fill your glass.

786
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,569
We're all the same age,
so can I speak casually?

787
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,071
He looks relaxed now that we're friends.

788
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:14,118
Anyway, let's have a toast
to celebrate our reunion.

789
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,457
For Kang In-su's successful debut.

790
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,292
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

791
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,825
Hey, hey. Jeez.

792
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,244
-Sang-i.
-What?

793
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:39,412
I'm Min-seong.

794
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,958
-Min-seong.
-What?

795
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:45,918
I feel great tonight.

796
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,877
For goodness' sake.

797
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,254
Be careful of the car.

798
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:54,468
Sang-i is a good musician as well.

799
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,387
-Hey, Min-seong.
-What?

800
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,140
-Let's have another drink.
-You had enough.

801
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:00,808
Let's drink more, Sang-i.

802
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,564
Come on, try to walk in a straight line.

803
01:07:06,647 --> 01:07:07,606
You're so heavy.

804
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,775
Oh, boy.

805
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:13,070
Hey.

806
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,203
Why did he drink so much tonight?

807
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:25,708
Actually…

808
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,003
something happened to him today.

809
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,300
You know what?

810
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,929
I've known In-su for a long time.

811
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,514
Anyway…

812
01:07:42,516 --> 01:07:44,977
I've never seen him so drunk like this.

813
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:50,191
But for some reason…

814
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:52,943
seeing him like this…

815
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,404
makes me feel relieved.

816
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,202
And I feel reassured
knowing that you're by his side.

817
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,168
What do you mean?

818
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,171
I'm glad that it's you, Sang-i.

819
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,508
I think you wouldn't make him feel lonely.

820
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,222
I heard who discovered him.

821
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,433
It wasn't your boss but you.

822
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,772
I'm sure he was really happy to hear that.

823
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,358
It means you appreciated his worth.

824
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:39,198
I always felt bad for him,

825
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,033
so I nagged him a lot.

826
01:08:46,705 --> 01:08:49,959
You felt bad for him? Why?

827
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,170
I don't know the details either.

828
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,215
But I think his parents…

829
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,926
are very powerful people.

830
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,595
They don't want him to be a singer…

831
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,431
and it looks like
they're trying to interfere.

832
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,434
He's a jolly person
who always makes jokes.

833
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,938
He doesn't show his feelings well…

834
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,858
so I'm just guessing.

835
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:21,532
I'll do my best.

836
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,953
No, I'll do whatever I can…

837
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,541
to help him sing.

838
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:39,175
This dude
doesn't easily open up his heart.

839
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:42,553
But…

840
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,891
I think he trusts you.

841
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,232
Thank you, Sang-i.

842
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,325
I'll get going.

843
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,416
Please…

844
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,337
take good care of my friend.

845
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,053
No, I'm talking about this part.

846
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,596
It'll work out well.

847
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:45,921
It's good.

848
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,798
It's simple but not plain.

849
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:48,966
What do you think?

850
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,634
My answer is the obvious one.

851
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,845
It's very good.

852
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,348
Well…

853
01:13:56,431 --> 01:14:00,060
I knew In-su was good,
but I'm surprised to know

854
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,354
that Sang-i has great taste in music.

855
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,524
It was good.

856
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,027
If you add drums, bass guitar,
and some string instruments,

857
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,529
it'll be much better.

858
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,406
What do you think?

859
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,784
I'm fine if that's fine with In-su.

860
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,080
I'm also fine if Sang-i is fine.

861
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,795
My goodness. You guys have good teamwork.

862
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,797
Let's call it a day

863
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:30,799
and meet at the meeting room tomorrow.

864
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,469
We'll ask everyone to review it.

865
01:14:34,052 --> 01:14:36,388
And that'll be the final screening.

866
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:42,227
Since Ms. Lee loves it so much,
you won't have to worry about it.

867
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:46,273
You have a nice house.
Why did you want to come here?

868
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:47,774
I've been curious.

869
01:14:48,066 --> 01:14:50,777
-I've always wanted to come.
-You're a wacko.

870
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:00,871
You too.

871
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,335
You're a wacko too.

872
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,808
It's different from what I thought.

873
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:27,064
It may look shabby,
but it's well-equipped.

874
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,608
No, I meant it's cozy.

875
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,236
In my imagination…

876
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,238
your place was always bleak.

877
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:38,116
I thought I'd see
only a mattress in your room.

878
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,203
Goodness. What do you take me for?

879
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:42,955
I'm not homeless.

880
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:47,042
I've always wanted to come to your place.

881
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,047
Why?

882
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:53,257
I don't know.

883
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,009
Just because.

884
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,858
Let's go out.
There's something I want to show you.

885
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:30,460
The view is amazing.

886
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:32,671
Isn't it nice?

887
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:35,382
I used to work part-time here.

888
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,718
I sometimes come here to drink.

889
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:41,763
You wouldn't need snacks.

890
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,104
What a good boy.

891
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,151
Did you want to show me this nice place?

892
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:57,654
What the heck.

893
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,493
Can I sleep over here tonight?

894
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:11,418
Yes…

895
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,628
if that's okay with you.

896
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,384
But you might feel uncomfortable…

897
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:20,552
because of me.

898
01:17:24,097 --> 01:17:25,474
What the heck are you saying?

899
01:17:26,266 --> 01:17:27,392
Don't stick close to me.

900
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:34,983
I feel great today.

901
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,154
It always felt like…

902
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,157
things were at a standstill.

903
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,793
Your album will be released soon.

904
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,338
But I can't believe it.

905
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:04,137
Actually, I don't know.

906
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:10,727
I'm still anxious.

907
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:18,402
Will it work out well?

908
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,911
Oh, come on.

909
01:18:27,994 --> 01:18:30,414
You're supposed to be full of confidence.

910
01:18:33,625 --> 01:18:36,336
You're always full of confidence too.

911
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,672
But aren't you anxious?

912
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,092
Of course, I am.

913
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:52,853
Oh, right. Shouldn't we invite Min-seong
on a day like this?

914
01:18:53,437 --> 01:18:56,022
Let's do that after my album is released.

915
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,400
Tonight…

916
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:00,777
just the two of us.

917
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:05,907
Just us?

918
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,580
Here.

919
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,043
Sang-i.

920
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,714
You made me really happy.

921
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:25,510
Let's say "be happy" instead.

922
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,972
Be happy, Kang In-su. Always.

923
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,982
Yes. Let's be happy.

924
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:49,910
Thanks to you,
I could move forward little by little.

925
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:54,706
Jeez.

926
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:58,293
Stop saying cheesy things.

927
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,928
Thank you, Sang-i.

928
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,011
I'm sorry.

929
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,745
I can't stay with you tonight.

930
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,710
I'll get going.

931
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:41,451
ARE YOU OKAY?

932
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:36,506
I feel that your name and my name

933
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:41,052
Are becoming one

934
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,221
Isn't it good?

935
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:44,681
Ma'am.

936
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,644
-The chairman…
-Me?

937
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:52,438
Good job. It's a great song.

938
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:01,072
Your training period was the shortest
in this company.

939
01:26:04,617 --> 01:26:05,660
Aren't you happy?

940
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:15,295
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

941
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:22,010
Please wait a little bit

942
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:26,890
The time we spent together

943
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,226
Will shine us like a star

944
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:34,731
IN-SU

945
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:36,918
That's ridiculous.

946
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:38,711
We need to stop the project?

947
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,380
Because In-su is the son…

948
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,091
of our parent company's chairman?

949
01:27:43,174 --> 01:27:44,425
I know how you feel.

950
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:48,429
It seems that he's been pressuring
all the agencies not to cast In-su.

951
01:27:49,138 --> 01:27:52,976
But he never imagined
his own record label would train his son.

952
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,895
It'll be a big loss if we lose him.

953
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:58,564
Is there any way we can keep him?

954
01:27:58,648 --> 01:27:59,941
Do you want to get fired?

955
01:28:00,024 --> 01:28:02,986
The chairman doesn't want him
to be a singer. What can we do?

956
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,570
We can't release his album.

957
01:28:04,654 --> 01:28:06,906
Besides, who would make an investment?

958
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,209
You didn't know either?

959
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:22,338
You didn't even get a hint
while you were staying with him?

960
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,881
He's the chairman's son?

961
01:28:25,758 --> 01:28:27,301
That's bewildering.

962
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:30,763
I can't understand.

963
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,891
How can he do this to his own son?

964
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:36,019
It's his son.

965
01:28:38,187 --> 01:28:39,856
And you can't do this to him either.

966
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:58,332
The person you've dialed isn't available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

967
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,044
What kept me going was you…

968
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:44,796
Sang-i.

969
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,673
It's all over now…

970
01:29:48,841 --> 01:29:49,759
so goodbye.

971
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:52,887
I don't want you to see me now.

972
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:55,890
But I can't imagine you leaving me.

973
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,102
Bye.

974
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:01,896
Take care.

975
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:09,570
The person you've dialed isn't available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

976
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,829
The person you've dialed isn't available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

977
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,082
-Hey.
-Did you get a hold of him?

978
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:22,208
No.

979
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:26,462
I'm sorry.

980
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,674
Why are you saying sorry to me?

981
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,176
I'm just sorry…

982
01:30:33,427 --> 01:30:34,554
about everything.

983
01:30:35,346 --> 01:30:36,931
For goodness' sake.

984
01:30:37,014 --> 01:30:38,766
Things never go smoothly for him.

985
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,031
He's not here either.

986
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:58,369
There's one more. Let's check that place.

987
01:30:58,452 --> 01:30:59,787
Follow me.

988
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:00,788
Hurry, Sang-i.

989
01:31:01,622 --> 01:31:04,876
Gosh. I thought he might be here.

990
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:07,712
Is there any other place he could be?

991
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:11,799
Darn it.

992
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:15,887
Let's scatter and look for him.

993
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,430
Okay.

994
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:14,959
It's me.

995
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:16,877
Kang In-su.

996
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,374
Stop nagging me!

997
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:11,807
In-su.

998
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:14,977
Look at you.

999
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,153
Kang In-su.

1000
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:26,906
It's you, right?

1001
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:29,825
Did you think…

1002
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,244
something bad happened to me?

1003
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,873
Come on.

1004
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:39,126
I'm Kang In-su, a guy full of confidence.

1005
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:47,051
Let's go.

1006
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,144
I wanted to prove to my father…

1007
01:36:58,312 --> 01:37:00,231
that I can make it as a singer…

1008
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:03,817
even though he tries to stop me.

1009
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,529
I wanted to tell him…

1010
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,824
that I'd live my life without his help.

1011
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:15,871
But I realized one thing…

1012
01:37:17,957 --> 01:37:19,083
after I met you…

1013
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:23,546
and while I was living with you.

1014
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:27,383
I'm really happy…

1015
01:37:29,051 --> 01:37:31,720
when I sing with you
and make a song with you.

1016
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:43,482
Can you help me move forward again?

1017
01:37:51,156 --> 01:37:52,866
Don't disappear without a word again.

1018
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:09,800
Let's go…

1019
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:13,220
and do music for ourselves.

1020
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,856
Do they make good songs because they work
in a nice place like this?

1021
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:24,857
Yes.

1022
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:26,317
Isn't it inspiring?

1023
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:28,861
-Are they coming?
-They're here.

1024
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:36,827
What's going on?

1025
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,832
I'm betting my life on you two crazy boys.

1026
01:38:42,791 --> 01:38:44,126
Me too!

1027
01:38:44,209 --> 01:38:46,629
Now, I might have to struggle more
to make a living.

1028
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:48,589
What are you saying?

1029
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:53,093
I'm not here because of you
but because they have great potential.

1030
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:57,681
Breathing heavily

1031
01:38:58,599 --> 01:39:03,437
I'm running to you

1032
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:09,818
You used to look at me with affection

1033
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:17,660
Don't go too far

1034
01:39:17,743 --> 01:39:22,790
I trace back in my memory

1035
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:29,630
To go back
To where I used to walk with you

1036
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:37,596
I wish for you

1037
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:41,975
You're the reason

1038
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:48,899
I won't lose you even for a moment

1039
01:39:52,152 --> 01:39:56,990
I want you to

1040
01:39:57,074 --> 01:40:01,662
You believe me

1041
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:08,419
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

1042
01:40:12,089 --> 01:40:16,176
Even though we don't say anything

1043
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:21,014
We can feel

1044
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:28,772
That we'll spend many days together

1045
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:36,280
We were attracted to each other
Like destiny

1046
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:41,076
We recognized each other right away

1047
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:45,706
I feel that your name and my name

1048
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:51,336
Are becoming one

1049
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:55,174
I wish for you

1050
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:07,144
I won't lose you even for a moment

1051
01:41:09,938 --> 01:41:16,487
I want you to

1052
01:41:19,615 --> 01:41:26,455
Our dazzlingly beautiful names

1053
01:41:29,875 --> 01:41:33,670
Please wait a little bit

1054
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:38,467
The time we spent together

1055
01:41:39,676 --> 01:41:46,266
Will shine us like a star

1056
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:48,185
