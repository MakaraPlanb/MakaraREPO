What do you think of the paper?

31

It’s okay. The last question
is a bit difficult, though.

32
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,240
The first item took me a long while.

33
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,150
The paper is really a bit difficult.

34
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,080
I wonder how they did in the exam.

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,520
I’ll go have a look.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,030
Mm.

37
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,590
My answers are

38
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,630
-Yun Xiang.
-B, B, D, C, F.

39
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,000
-Excuse me.
-What?

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,590
Where are you going?

41
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,310
Did you finish the paper?

42
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,310
I did.

43
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,430
I just don’t know
if the answers are right.

44
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,280
Especially the first item
of the last question.

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,710
As soon as I finished it,
I had to hand in the paper.

46
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,560
You worked out the first item?

47
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,280
What’s your answer?

48
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,240
B’s parameter value is

49
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
zero to positive infinity.

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,520
Well done!

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
That’s the right answer!

52
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,120
Come on.

53
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
It’s simply the first item.

54
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,400
Who can’t work it out?

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,240
The paper is very difficult.

56
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,190
Even the first item is difficult, too.

57
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,910
It even took Han Yayi a long while.

58
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,870
But you gave the right answer!

59
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,000
You mean

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,510
I answered a question correctly

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,510
that even you found difficult?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,680
Well,

63
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,000
strictly speaking,

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,000
she found it difficult.

65
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,120
I didn’t.

66
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,870
Then I’ll pass the exam, won’t I?

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,070
Come on.

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,950
Thank you, Monitor.

69
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,750
You’re welcome.

70
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,830
Yun Xiang, Chuan!

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
I answered it correctly!

72
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,430
So did I.

73
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,310
The last question muddled me,

74
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,190
but I

75
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,390
answered the first item
with an effort.

76
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,360
-With an effort?
-You were lucky enough.

77
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,560
That was a tough problem.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Bros,

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
shall we celebrate tonight?

80
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,360
Why not?

81
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,120
But I don’t think
you’ll celebrate with us.

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,560
What do you mean?

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,360
Yeah.

84
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,920
Who else can he celebrate with?

85
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,070
I see.

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,190
He’ll go back home
and tell his parents the good news.

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,630
How dumb you are!

88
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,240
Without the mark,
how can he tell the good news?

89
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,390
Chief,

90
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,000
you did quite a good job in the exam.

91
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,560
Who do you think
you’re most grateful to?

92
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,000
You’re right.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,630
Well,

94
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,510
what would you advise me?

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,100
Oops,

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,480
look at all the smiles.

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
Looks like you did well in the exam.

98
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,600
We did better than you, of course.

99
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,000
Sure.

100
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,630
You’ve flattered academic students
for quite a few days.

101
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,950
If you didn’t do well in the exams,

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
your efforts would be wasted.

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
How mean you sound!

104
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
We’re in good mood today,

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,750
and we don’t like to argue with you.

106
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,390
You.

107
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,750
Leave immediately.

108
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,520
All right.

109
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,360
I’m waiting to hear
about your good marks

110
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,070
and congratulate you, all right?

111
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,430
He’s going crazy again.

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Ignore him. Let’s go.

113
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,070
How did you do in the exam?

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,480
Would you like
to check the answers with me?

115
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
No.

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,190
I don’t want to know I’m number two

117
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,430
as soon as I finish the exam.

118
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,630
Leave some hope to me.

119
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,830
What if you defeat me

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,830
this time?

121
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,120
What? You didn’t do a good job?

122
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,830
Yes, I did quite a good job.

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,430
Shall I make a concession next time?

124
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,680
No.

125
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,920
Thank you for your kindness.

126
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,430
When I get the first place next time,

127
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,240
I’ll make a concession to you, too.

128
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,240
Are you going to the lecture tonight?

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,240
(Li He)
Emergency. See you at the school gate.

130
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,360
Wait a second.

131
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,070
Li He texted me.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,310
I gotta go. He’s got an emergency.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,430
What happened? What’s the emergency?

134
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,240
Something serious.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,600
Hey.

136
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,720
Li He.

137
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,950
Wait, wait a minute.

138
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
This is what you mean serious?

139
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,600
You even asked me to get changed.

140
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,430
Yeah.

141
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,720
The exams are over.

142
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,040
Shouldn’t we relax ourselves?

143
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,510
Fine, then.

144
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,830
Enjoy yourself. I’ll leave you alone.

145
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,480
Wait.

146
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,800
Don’t leave.

147
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,240
These days,

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,680
you’ve been busy helping with my study

149
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,950
and reviewing your own study.

150
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,160
Even if you’re a spring,

151
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
you can’t keep winding yourself.

152
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,680
I really want to thank you.
Give me a chance.

153
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,240
A small moment, then.

154
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,360
Let’s go. Let’s go.

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,750

Thanks for today.

I’m very happy.

235
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,750
You’re welcome. I enjoyed myself, too.

236
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,960
You did?

237
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,440
But you look like you suffered.

238
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,840
You get me wrong.
I quite enjoyed myself.

239
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,390
I didn’t suffer at all.

240
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
I first came to the amusement park

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,870
on my fifth birthday.

242
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,360
At that time, I thought it was

243
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,150
the most interesting place in the world.

244
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,440
So, I didn’t go away with my parents

245
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,670
until it came to the closing time.

246
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,840
The large facilities

247
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,790
we just enjoyed...

248
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,870
I couldn’t enjoy them when I was little.

249
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,150
But now,

250
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,120
when I can enjoy them,

251
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,600
my father has been gone.

252
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,550
Since then,

253
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
I’ve never come here again.

254
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,080
The facility we just rode

255
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,270
where we flew up and down...

256
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,550
It was my first time to ride it.

257
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,360
So, it was my first time

258
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
to experience the zero gravity!

259
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,200
That was cool and I was super happy!

260
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,600
So, I’m really grateful to you.

261
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,080

266
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Then,

267
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,030
shall we go ride the Roller Coaster?

268
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,360
-Oh, wait, wait.
-Let’s go!

269
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550

270
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,120

271
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,080
Let me adapt myself to it.

272
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,270

-I saw my name.
-I passed the exams.

292
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,840

Where’s yours?

295
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,120
Chuan,

296
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,790
do you know the most shocking thing?

297
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,000
The most shocking thing is that

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I got 97 points in the Chinese exam.

299
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,270
(Li He, Chinese, 97 points)
How did you do that?

300
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,080
Time to buy some lottery.

301
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
We passed the exams!

302
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,480
Excuse me, are you Li He

303
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,360

304
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,300
I am.

305
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,910
Mr. Ma asked to see you in his office.

306
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,550
Okay. Thank you.

307
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,460
See us?

308
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,480
Did you make trouble again?

309
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,680
I didn’t.

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,910
What’s going on?

311
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,600
No idea.

312
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,030
Mr. Ma.

313
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,510
Come in. Come here.

314
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,360
You asked to see us?

315
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,510
Come on.

316
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,960
Did you check the marks
of the monthly test?

317
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,480
We just did.

318
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,440
You did a great job.

319
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,200
Most of you passed the exams.

320
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,000
So,

321
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
cheating works very well.

322
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
It’s much easier
than studying hard, isn’t it?

323
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,580
Don’t stare at me like that.
Come and have a look.

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,390

Did you post it?

328
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,150
Mr. Ma, we didn’t cheat.

329
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,870
Answer me. Did you post it?

330
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,320
Yes.

331
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,480
Is this your QQ number?

332
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,270
Yes.

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,150
But after I posted it, I...

334
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,390
You posted it

335
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,790
and then bought the answers
to cheat in the exams.

336
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,440
So, most of you passed the exams, right?

337
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,910
-Mr. Ma.
-What’s up?

338
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,200
What are you coming for?

339
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Here’s a document for you to sign.

340
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,750
Hold on.

341
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,440
I’m handling the cheating problem
of your classmates.

342
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,600
Cheating?

343
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,600
You suspect them of cheating in exams?

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,240
I don’t simply suspect them.
I’ve got evidence!

345
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,870
May I see it?

346
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,600
So, you suspect Jiang Yuan
of buying the answers

347
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
to the monthly test?

348
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,790
It’s his QQ email. He admitted that.

349
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,870
It’s my email.

350
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:31,870
But we didn’t check the answers.

351
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,630
Neither did we cheat.

352
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Look, Mr. Ma.

353
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,030
It was sent to Jiang Yuan’s email,

354
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,320
but it can’t prove that

355
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,510
it contains answers to the monthly test.

356
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,000
Look at the screenshot.

357
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Here’s only the title of the attachment,
but no content.

358
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,960
There may be nothing in it.

359
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,150
It can just be some misunderstanding.

360
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,670
Open your email and let me check.

361
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,360
The email is gone.

362
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,200
I deleted it.

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,590
Chief.

364
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,920
Chief, I received it.

365
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,550
-What?
-I received it.

366
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,680
-What?
-What did you receive?

367
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,110
Answers to the monthly test.

368
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:14,790
Yesterday,

369
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,680
I posted for some help.

370
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,680
Someone said he had the answers.

371
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,270
Look.

372
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,500
(Answers to all subjects
of the monthly test for Grade 3.)

373
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,310
Stick out your hips.

374
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:27,920
What for?

375
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Stick out your hips!

376
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,510
What for?

377
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,920
What are you doing?

378
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,680
Why aren’t you happy
when we have the answers?

379
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,880
Answers?

380
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,680
You’re absolutely cheating,
don’t you know?

381
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,720
I don’t think so.

382
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,680
We’ve studied hard for a long time.

383
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,480
But time is limited.

384
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,830
We’ll just use a little help.

385
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,160
Well, tell me.

386
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,200
Mm.

387
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,750
If we can’t run fast,

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,880
can we use the dope?

389
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,240
Can we?

390
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,040
No.

391
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,340
(Delete)

392
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,060
(Confirm to delete)

393
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,830
Remember.

394
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,640
We may suffer, but we can’t fall behind.

395
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,270
We can lose,

396
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,310
but,

397
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,110
we must be dignified.

398
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,680
Mm.

399
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,550
Good.

400
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,440
Very good.

401
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,960
Here’s the screenshot of the post

402
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,590
and the email.

403
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,030
But there isn’t the attachment.

404
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,880
There’s no evidence then, right?

405
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,270
Mr. Ma,

406
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,880
if we had the answers,

407
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,270
why didn’t we get full marks?

408
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,400
Full marks?

409
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,680
If you got full marks,
I would quit my job!

410
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,030
I’m asking you the last time.

411
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,200
Did you cheat?

412
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,720
We didn’t. But do you trust us?

413
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,920
You deleted the email, didn’t you?

414
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,240
You bought the answers, didn’t you?

415
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,070
How can I trust you without evidence?

416
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
How do I know if you checked the answers
or deleted them?

417
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,110
Well,

418
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,160
luckily, I deleted the email.

419
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,030
If I kept it,

420
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,110
we wouldn’t be vindicated.

421
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,110
Li He,

422
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,160
don’t think I can’t punish you

423
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,200
simply because you deleted the email!

424
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,110
I’m going to circulate a notice

425
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,750
and cancel your marks!

426
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,920
Mr. Ma, I think...

427
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,510
Go ahead, then!

428
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,270
In your eyes, PE student like us
must have cheated

429
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,240
whenever we get good marks!

430
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,110
We must always be worse!

431
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,590
And we can never improve, right?

432
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,110
Chief.

433
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes.

434
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,830
I asked Jiang Yuan to buy the answers.

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,960
They’re innocent.

436
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,310
Punish me in whatever way you want.

437
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,830
I’ll accept it.

438
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,830
I was too greedy. It was my fault.

439
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,200
Li He, stop!

440
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,790
Mr. Ma,

441
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,030
it doesn’t matter if you don’t trust us.

442
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,510
But if you want to punish him,

443
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,070
punish us, too.

444
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,440
What?

445
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,720
Jiang Yuan!

446
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,310
Mr. Ma, please sign it.

447
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,180
All right.

448
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,070
We’ll leave you alone.

449
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,440
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

450
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,830
What boys!

451
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,160
Where’s the evidence?

452
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,030
Where’re Li He and his teammates?

453
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,510
I don’t know. I didn’t see them.

454
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,790
What happened?

455
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,350
Stand up!

456
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,480
Good morning, Miss Luo.

457
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,310
Sit down, please.

458
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,830
Miss Luo, Li He...

459
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,510
I know what happened.

460
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,960
Let’s have the class first.

461
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,830
So, last time, we learned
about the language of honey bees.

462
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,000
We know that
there’re different varieties of bees.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,160
Some of them live in large groups.

464
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,510
And some of them make their nests
in holes underground, right?

465
00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:05,860
(The art of life lies in movement.)

466
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,720
Mr. Bai?

467
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,680
Enjoy the food.

468
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,480
You’re not hungry?

469
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,510
Come on. Even fried chicken
can’t cheer you up?

470
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Mr. Bai.

471
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,200
Does everybody

472
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,400
really hate us?

473
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,440
I don’t know.

474
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,720
You really don’t know
how to comfort people at all.

475
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,680
We had planned to cheat.

476
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,310
But we gave up the plan.

477
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,790
You certainly gave up.

478
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
If you cheated,

479
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
I wouldn’t have bought you
the fried chicken.

480
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,270
Be quick. Eat the chicken

481
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,400
and go back to your class, all right?

482
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,830
We don’t want to go back.

483
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,750
You don’t want to go back

484
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,270
even when I come and invite you?

485
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,550
Look.

486
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,400
What a good place!

487
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,400
You’ve got a secret base.

488
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,640
Looks good.

489
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,680
Don’t look at Mr. Bai.

490
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,550
Before you have the resistance mood,

491
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,550
let me make myself clear.

492
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,510
I never thought you cheated
in the exams.

493
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,240
However,

494
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,350
you bought the answers, right?

495
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
We didn’t look at the answers.

496
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,070
The email was deleted.

497
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,960
No one believes us.

498
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,830
I do.

499
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,480
I’m your head teacher.

500
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
I know you more than anyone else.

501
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,350
I witnessed how hard you studied
before the exams.

502
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
To be honest,

503
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,510
there would be no problem

504
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,350
if you wanted to pass the exams.

505
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
What did I say?

506
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,830
I said my students were all brilliant,

507
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,830
didn’t I?

508
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,440
Especially you, Lin Chuan.

509
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,110
You got good marks
in Math and Chemistry.

510
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,550
Work harder,

511
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,720
and maybe you can be at the top.

512
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,590
Chuan,

513
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,270
if you can be at the top of the ranking,

514
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,510
we’ll be so proud.

515
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
Is that so?

516
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,480
I hadn’t really thought about it.

517
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,000
And you, Li He.

518
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,480
Mr. Liu told me that

519
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,680
not even many academic students

520
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,510
solved the first item
of the last tough question.

521
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,400
But you answered it correctly.

522
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,830
Your answer was a bit complicated,

523
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,550
but the theory was clear.

524
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,830
Good job.

525
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,200
Not really.

526
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,030
I only solved the first item.

527
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,920
So,

528
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,030
don’t ever underestimate yourselves.

529
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,750
I have high expectations of you.

530
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,920
We understand!

531
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,700
Come on.

532
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,640
Let’s get back to the class.

533
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Thank you, Miss Luo.

534
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,750
Miss Luo,

535
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,000
I think you make a perfect couple.

536
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,110
You finally see that?

537
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,550
Look at her.

538
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,110
Enjoy the chicken.

539
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,160
-Enjoy it.
-Take it with you!

540
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,750
You finally see that?

541
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,550
Chief,

542
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,510
are they staring at us?

543
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,510
Let them be. Who cares?

544
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,880
A clean hand wants no washing.

545
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,750
You’re right.

546
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,880
Miss Luo trusts us.

547
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,160
Why must we be scared?

548
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,640
Come on.

549
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,070
After this,

550
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,240
have you learnt your lesson?

551
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,510
Sure, I have.

552
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,680
Using dishonest methods will always
make me anxious.

553
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,030
But using my own talent reassures me.

554
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,240
I’m sorry

555
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,880
to get you involved.

556
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,240
Don’t simply apologize.

557
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,790
Shouldn’t you do something?

558
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,310
Yes.

559
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,350
My treat, all right?

560
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,000
You mean they really bought the answers?

561
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,590
It must be true!

562
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,270
Monitor has the evidence.

563
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,480
Mr. Ma was furious!

564
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,590
Also,

565
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,510
do you know

566
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,790
why they weren’t back in the last class?

567
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,400
-Why?
-Why?

568
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,240
Because they felt guilty!

569
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,240
But Monitor and Zeyu helped them
to review for quite a few days.

570
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,960
But,

571
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,830
if they really wanted to cheat,

572
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,070
why did they ask them for help?

573
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,680
The reason is obvious.

574
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,440
They were finding an excuse

575
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,200
for their good marks!

576
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,350
I didn’t know they were so scheming.

577
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,400
Now,

578
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,270
everyone in our grade is saying that

579
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,440
some students in our class
cheated in the exams.

580
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,550
Think about it.

581
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,270
What will they think of us?

582
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,790
Will they think we also cheated?

583
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,880
That’s what worries me!

584
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
How unfair it is to us!

585
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,960
How unfair!

586
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,270
What are they?

587
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,920
They’re a fly

588
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,440
in the ointment!

589
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,790
Who do you mean?

590
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,550
Jiang Yuan!

591
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,270
Jiang Yuan!

592
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,030
Jiang Yuan!

593
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,790
What?

594
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:59,110
Can’t I complain about your mistake?

595
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,750
Watch your mouth!

596
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,070
Where have you been?

597
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,000
Let’s go.

598
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,160
Li He.

599
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,160
Wait!

600
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,200
Go back to your seats.

601
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,880
It’s class time. Where’re you going?

602
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,880
It doesn’t matter where we’re going.

603
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,350
Why doesn’t it matter?

604
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,200
You want to skip two classes?

605
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,160
Why can’t we?

606
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,110
Aren’t we supposed to be bad students?

607
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,550
I thought we could be friends.

608
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,880
Looks like we were absolutely wrong,

609
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,550
Monitor.

610
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,720
They don’t mean that.

611
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,960
-They just...
-All right, Yun Xiang.

612
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,110
Don’t waste time on her.

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,640
By the way,

614
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,070
thank you, Monitor,

615
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,590
for passing around

616
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,720
the email.

617
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,180
(You’ve got a new message.)

618
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,880
(Li He, Lin Chuan,
Jiang Yuan and Yun Xiang)

619
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,580
(cheated in the monthly test)

620
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,280
(and their marks are hereby cancelled)

621
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,860
(with a notice of criticism
throughout school.)

622
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,270
You know what?

623
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,400
Some students were criticized
for cheating in the exams.

624
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,920
PE students in the best class, I hear.

625
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,270
I knew it would be them.

626
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,270
-Mr. Ma posted an official notice.
-Really?

627
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,700
-Don’t they all have high marks?
-That’s scary news.

628
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,840
(How embarrassed they are!)
They have strong arms and weak heads.

629
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,740
(They were caught cheating, right?)
Why must they study?

630
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,640
(They’re now notorious.)
They were even caught cheating.

631
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,480
-They can’t succeed...
-I thought athletes like them...

632
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,440
-in anything.
-had the most self-respect.

633
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,000
(How daring they were!)
Yeah.

634
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,080
(Look at the cheating students.)
No students in our school

635
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,520
-have ever cheated in exams before.
-Only they did that.

636
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,480

Why

671
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,590
did you try to help Li He?

672
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,590
I simply think

673
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,590
they didn’t cheat in the exams

674
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,680
and they shouldn’t have been wronged.

675
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,270
You trust them so firmly?

676
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,240
Yeah. I witnessed how hard they studied.

677
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,640
I trust them without doubt.

678
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,960
They did want to buy the answers.

679
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,440
They could learn a lesson.
Isn’t that good?

680
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,030
Do you think they cheated?

681
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,270
No.

682
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,750
I don’t think so, either.

683
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,350
So, I just want to do
what I think is right.

684
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,110
Or I would regret.

685
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,400
Do what I think is right?

686
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,200
What did you say?

687
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,270
Nothing. Let me help you.

688
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,880
See you. See you.

689
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,220
-See you, Mr. Ma.
-Be careful on your way back.

690
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,340
Be careful.

691
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,680
-See you, Mr. Ma.
-See you.

692
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,580
See you, Mr. Ma.

693
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,160
-See you. See you.
-See you.

694
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
See you. See you.

695
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:50,820
See you.

696
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,400
(Reply when you read the message.)

697
00:31:59,400 --> 00:31:59,940
(I’ve got something to tell you.)

698
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,200
You nearly eat with your nose.

699
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,070
Oh.

700
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,640
Don’t check your phone when eating.

701
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,440
Mm.

702
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,750
Whose reply are you waiting for?

703
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,240
No one’s.

704
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,680
I’m not waiting for anything.

705
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,240
Come on.

706
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,240
What’s going on in there?

707
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:07,310
He brushes shoes when he’s unhappy.
He’s doing that again.

708
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,790
Something must be upsetting him.

709
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,070
Get in and comfort him.

710
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,960
I’m not going.

711
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,400
It’s a good thing for a young man
to be frustrated.

712
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,880
Oops.

713
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,240
Let’s have something delicious
for dinner

714
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,550
and he’ll be alright.

715
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,920
Make one more dish.

716
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,590
Okay.

717
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:39,510
(Yuan Caixi)

718
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,680
Reply when you read the message.

719
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,640
I have something to tell you.

720
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,310
Caixi,

721
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
I’m quite tight-lipped.

722
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,590
Mother kept asking me,
but I told her nothing.

723
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,440
Loyal boy.

724
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,440
I just wondered

725
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,110
why I didn’t
keep the screenshot carefully

726
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,920
-and why I let Pan Hao see it.
-Stop.

727
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,590
A famous philosopher once said that

728
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,670
we should find fault with others
before ourselves

729
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,670
unless we couldn’t.

730
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,760
Even if you kept it carefully,

731
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,760
when Mr. Ma posted the criticism,

732
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,030
the whole school would still think
they had cheated.

733
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,000
But you didn’t hear

734
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,320
what Jiang Yuan said to me today.

735
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,150
I thought we could be friends,

736
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,360
Monitor.

737
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,710
After I heard that, I...

738
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,880
He said that out of anger.

739
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
He didn’t really mean that.

740
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,480
Out of anger?

741
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,960
If they were simply angry,

742
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,880
Li He should have replied to me,

743
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,590
hasn’t he?

744
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,000
How shall I put it?

745
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,590
Usually,

746
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,710
we’re tolerant towards strangers,

747
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,030
but strict with friends.

748
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,070
They regard you as a real friend.

749
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,000
So,

750
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,030
when they thought
you gave Pan Hao the screenshot,

751
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,880
they felt so angry and aggrieved

752
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
and then they said something angrily.

753
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,030
Angry?

754
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,630
Aren’t I angry?

755
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,480
Why didn’t they even think about it?

756
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,800
Why would I show the screenshot
to the whole class?

757
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,710
Yeah.

758
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,280
How stupid he is!

759
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,110
He not only misunderstood you,
but was also misunderstood for cheating.

760
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,550
Come on, Caixi.

761
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,280
You should ask him for an explanation.

762
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,120
Ask him for an explanation?

763
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,760
Yeah, you should go.

764
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,110
Are you...

765
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,030
Are you scared of him?

766
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,030
Come on, bad boy.

767
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,840
Now you can talk with irony?

768
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,030
You think I don’t understand?

769
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,590
Don’t underestimate me.

770
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,400
It’s no big deal.

771
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,030
Don’t act like a child.

772
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,880
Li He.

773
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,480
Wait.

774
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,190
Li He!

775
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,110
Why are you running after me?

776
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,760
If I weren’t, you wouldn’t listen to me.

777
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,960
Then why don’t you talk loudly?

778
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,030
Do you think
I showed Pan Hao the screenshot

779
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,110
and asked him to show it
to the whole class?

780
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,000
No.

781
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,280
No? Then why didn’t you
reply to me on QQ?

782
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,070
I was angry at that time!

783
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,150
But when I thought about it,

784
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,480
I knew it couldn’t be you.

785
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,630
Angry?

786
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
What were you angry about?

787
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,960
I felt embarrassed, okay?

788
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,150
Finally, I passed the exams,

789
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,150
but my marks were cancelled in a notice

790
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,480
and we were even slandered for cheating!

791
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,510
But I trust you for not cheating.

792
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,360
I not only trust you,

793
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,150
but also your friends.

794
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,320
Thank you for trusting us.

795
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,440
But seriously,

796
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,760
how are you going to solve it?

797
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,800
I’ll solve it in my own way.

798
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Your own way?

799
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,420
-Yeah.
-I’m warning you!

800
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,590
Don’t use any trick! Do you hear me?

801
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,070
Come to classes on time
and never skip classes!

802
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,230
Otherwise, I’ll...!

803
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,670
You’ll what?

804
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,030
I...

805
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,590
I haven’t decided yet.
I’m simply warning you.

806
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,670
All right.

807
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,710
I’ll keep that in mind.

808
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,510
I owe this to you.

809
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,480
I’m going to class.

810
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,590
What’s on your mind?

811
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,480
I’m wondering

812
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,190
how to prove that

813
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,070
they didn’t cheat in the exams.

814
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,630
Look.

815
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,440
The criticism has been posted.

816
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,320
If it’s finalized, what would they do?

817
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,110
When I first saw the email,

818
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,190
I found something wrong with it.

819
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,590
First, Jiang Yuan posted and asked

820
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,480
how to pass the monthly test easily.

821
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,550
Possibly,

822
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,760
he wanted to make a concentrated effort,

823
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,700
(How to pass the monthly test easily?)
instead of buying answers.

824
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,960
But two minutes later,
someone said he had answers

825
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,280
and asked Jiang Yuan
to friend him on QQ.

826
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,110
Soon, he sent Jiang Yuan the answers.

827
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,710
But normally,

828
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,760
the papers aren’t taken out
until one day before the test.

829
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,840
So, when Jiang Yuan received the email,

830
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,670
there were no papers yet.

831
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,110
But it can be our conjecture only.

832
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,960
We’ve got no evidence.

833
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,360
That’s simple.

834
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,150
When we restore the deleted email,

835
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,070
we’ll know if it contains the answers.

836
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Mr. Zhang, be quick.
I’m going to the meeting first.

837
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,150
Okay, Mr. Qiu. Go without me.

838
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,150
I’ll catch up
after turning off my computer.

839
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,110
Come in, please.

840
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,480
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

841
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,280
Hello, hello.

842
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,840
Can we use your computer?

843
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,960
My computer?

844
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,920
-Yes.
-What for?

845
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,440
For some extracurricular information.

846
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,590
With what?

847
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,150
Then search engine.

848
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,920
Oh, I have one.

849
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,000
Here’s Baidu.

850
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,800
Okay.

851
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,400
Don’t open these file folders.

852
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,900
-Mm.
-Mm.

853
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,800
They’re very important.

854
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,630
Remember to turn it off
after you use it.

855
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,670
-Okay, Mr. Zhang.
-All right.

856
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,030
I’m in a hurry for a meeting.

857
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,590
Thank you.

858
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,550
