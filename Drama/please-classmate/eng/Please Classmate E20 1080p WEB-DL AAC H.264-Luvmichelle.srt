17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,790
Mom, we’re back.

18
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,350
Mom.

19
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,520
Mom.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,870
It flies up!

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,120
We made it!

22
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,430
Isn’t it great?

23
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,430
Caixi.

24
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,560
I’m a little tired.

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,280
Come on.

26
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,030
Come sit with me for a while.

27
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,960
Why do you get tired so quickly?

28
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,280
I’m older than you.

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
I’m not as energetic as you are.

30
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,080
I’m better than Dad!

31
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,080
Since you are better than me,

32
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,280
will you take care of
your mom and brother?

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,080
Of course. I want to be
the head of our family.

34
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,840
The head should take care of everyone.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,150
That’s great.

36
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,240
In this case,

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,190
I can rest assured.

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,590
When I get old,

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,800
you will be the one to
take care of your mom and brother.

40
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,430
I don’t want you to get old.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,750
Then I don’t want to be better than you.

42
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,000
You will grow up slowly.

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,630
And I will get old day by day.

44
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,190
This is normal.

45
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,150
If I don’t want to grow up,

46
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,560
will you not get old?

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,190
Silly girl.

48
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,960
Caixi.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,310
You must grow up
and become strong enough.

50
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,960
Then when I get sick,

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,840
you can take care of me,
your mother and your brother.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,960
I don’t need to be any better than you

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,310
to take good care of you.

54
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,470
Actually, the important thing

55
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,960
for your mom and brother
is companionship.

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,750
Come on.

57
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,680
Actually,

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,710
it’s fun to grow up.

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,590
You will have more friends,

60
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,630
see the wider world,

61
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,190
and see a more beautiful
scenery than this.

62
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,190
More beautiful than now?

63
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah, much more beautiful.

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
I want to see it.

65
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,040
Then you should grow up quickly

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
and enjoy the beautiful scenery for me.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,900
But I want to see it with you,

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,600
Mom and Haoxi.

69
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,240
Don’t worry.

70
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
I will always be there for you.

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,750
Mom!

72
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,180
(Dad, Happy Birthday)

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,680
Mom.

74
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,360
Try it and see if it’s tasty.

75
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

76
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,310
Mom, what’s this red one?

77
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,950
Yummy.

78
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,000
It’s so delicious.

79
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,120
Today is Yuan Caixi’s father’s birthday?

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,750
Yes.

81
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,430
Her parents were deeply in love.

82
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
They only celebrate his birthday.
They don’t celebrate

83
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,750
his death anniversary
to not make Aunt sad.

84
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,510
Every year on this day,
monitor and Haoxi will go home.

85
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
They don’t want Aunt to feel lonely.

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,160
Don’t think too much about it.

87
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,040
Monitor is down today
not because of you.

88
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,120
Caixi.

89
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,950
Come in.

90
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,430
What’s the matter?

91
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,870
Caixi.

92
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,680
How much do you remember about our dad?

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
When Dad was gone,

94
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,750
I was only four years old.

95
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,240
I can’t remember anything.

96
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,000
Caixi.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,070
Tell me about him.

98
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,870
Come with me.

99
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:51,070
Caixi, why are we here?

100
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,830
Come on, help me move this.

101
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,430
Caixi.

102
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,070
What’s this?

103
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,030
The password is
our parents’ wedding anniversary.

104
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,360
This is...

105
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,510
This is me?

106
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
Who else could it be?

107
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,390
See if there is anything else.

108
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,390
This is the diary

109
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,030
Dad wrote when he was sick.

110
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,320
Don’t read it.

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
It will only make us sad.

112
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,270
I want to read it.

113
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,390
Yuan Haoxi, Dad has been
gone for so long.

114
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,720
What’s the use to read it now?

115
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,960
It’s of no use.

116
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
But he is my dad.

117
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,790
I want to know what happened to him.

118
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,360
March 1, 2008.

119
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,030
The doctor said it might be leukemia.

120
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Yanan doesn’t believe it.

121
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,910
But I know the chances are high.

122
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,630
I have a poor appetite recently.

123
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,320
I feel dizzy and tired.

124
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,670
And the bruises won’t heal
for a long time.

125
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,550
I guess it’s leukemia.

126
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,790
She kept telling me

127
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,750
we can make it.

128
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,120
But I know

129
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,510
she is comforting herself.

130
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,550
All right.

131
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Stop reading it.

132
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,200
Caixi.

133
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,630
It’s enough.

134
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,630
All right.

135
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,840
It’s okay.

136
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,790
Let him read it.

137
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,030
Mom, we just can’t sleep tonight.

138
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,150
So we come up...

139
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,270
Yeah, Mom. Don’t get angry.

140
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,360
Why would I be angry?

141
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,870
You did nothing wrong.

142
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,080
I know

143
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Haoxi was too young when your dad left.

144
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,240
You want to know what your dad was like.

145
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,390
Haoxi.

146
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,600
Before you read it,
I want you to remember

147
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,030
that your father was the kindest,

148
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,600
the most responsible,

149
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,270
and the best dad.

150
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,510
He has also been the most handsome man

151
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,720
in my heart.

152
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,840
Yeah.

153
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,030
I haven’t used

154
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,790
this computer for a long time.

155
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,390
You are back.

156
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,440
Yeah, Mom.

157
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,150
Well.

158
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,000
You scared me.

159
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,910
Get off me. Don’t bother me.

160
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,390
Listen,

161
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,080
I have no money for you.

162
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,480
Dad.

163
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,080
What?

164
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,870
It’s nice to have you
and my mom by my side.

165
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,550
Are you going crazy again?

166
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,080
Go away!

167
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,030
It’s too gross!

168
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,120
Go away!

169
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,720
It doesn’t work on your dad. Come to me.

170
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,200
Let me give you a hug. Come on.

171
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,750
Come on.

172
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,080
Tell me what happened today.

173
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,910
-Mom.
-Well?

174
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,470
When Grandpa died,

175
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,510
how did my dad comfort you?

176
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,600
What?

177
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,080
Why do you ask this suddenly?

178
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,080
My good friend’s father passed away.

179
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,440
I don’t know how to comfort her.

180
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,270
Her family passed away,

181
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,550
she must be very sad.

182
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,270
Actually, it’s no use
no matter how you comfort her.

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,810
You’d better

184
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,030
just stay by her side.

185
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
Don’t ask too many questions.

186
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,550
It would be the best

187
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,320
if there is something

188
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,550
that can distract her.

189
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,360
Or you can cook something she likes.

190
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,030
That’s how your dad
comforted me at that time.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
Yeah.

192
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,030
Tell me what your monitor likes to eat.

193
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,150
She loves chicken wings.

194
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,390
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

195
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,910
-Cabbage.
-Yeah.

196
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,750
Anything else?

197
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,910
How do you know that, Mom?

198
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,750
Silly boy, I’m your mother.

199
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,360
I know what you are going to do
when you raise your butt.

200
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,910
Mom, you are impressive.

201
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,840
It’s getting late.
You two go to bed earlier.

202
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,550
-Okay.
-Okay.

203
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,960
Good night.

204
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,630
I wish there is a time machine

205
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,480
that can let me see Dad again.

206
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,870
Dad will be pissed off

207
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,390
to see you like this.

208
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,030
Well?

209
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,240
Caixi, what’s this?

210
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,550
Nothing. I hit the desk today.

211
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,000
Don’t scare me.

212
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,790
I just saw the photos of Dad
when he was sick.

213
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,120
The bruises...

214
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,840
Caixi.

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,550
Won’t you have leukemia?

216
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,510
You are the one who is sick.
Let me warn you,

217
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,720
I won’t die before you die.

218
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,550
Go back to sleep.

219
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,790
Then I can rest assured.

220
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
Remember what you said.
You must stay alive to that time.

221
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,480
Okay.

222
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,630
-Not a minute less.
-I got it.

223
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,720
I will outlive you.

224
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,670
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

225
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,960
-Yuan Caixi!
-Ugh...

226
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,600
Let’s go.

227
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,870
Wait, Yuan.

228
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,080
Are you okay?

229
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,960
-Yuan!
-Yuan Caixi!

230
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,480
Yuan, have you had
a bad appetite recently?

231
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,030
Why are you eating less?

232
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,270
The school doctor said that you are
too tired and undernourished recently.

233
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,850
Yuan Caixi, are you okay?

234
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,150
Do you feel dizzy again?

235
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,070
I have a poor appetite recently
and feel dizzy and tired.

236
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,720
And the bruises won’t heal
for a long time.

237
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,880
I guess it’s leukemia.

238
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,790
Leukemia is too scary.

239
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,720
(Yuan Caixi)

240
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,300
Tell me, is the traitor Ning Zeyu

241
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,070
or Han Yayi?

242
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,590
(Li He)

243
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,310
Well, why can’t I be telepathic?

244
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,630
Can you use your telepathy

245
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,240
to know today is my dad’s birthday

246
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,920
and come to comfort me
because you don’t want me to feel sad?

247
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,790
Don’t underestimate the IQ
of the world champion.

248
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,440
World champion, you should go to sleep.
Good night.

249
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,720
Monitor, I’ve always been there.

250
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,440
Okay, I know.

251
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, monitor.

252
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,350
Are you also going to the clinic?

253
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,790
No, I’m going to the toilet.

254
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,880
Oh, I’m gonna go.

255
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,960
-Okay.
-Bye.

256
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,920
Come in.

257
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,000
Hello, what can I help you?

258
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,110
I have something to ask you.

259
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,830
Okay.

260
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,960
-I have a friend...
-Oh.

261
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,750
You have a friend.

262
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,110
I have a friend

263
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,030
who has a poor appetite.

264
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,590
She always feels dizzy and falls easily.

265
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,110
The most important thing is
that she got a lot of bruises on her.

266
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,960
Where? Let me see.

267
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,200
It’s not me.

268
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,480
It’s a friend of mine.

269
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay, then tell me about

270
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,590
the bruises on your friend.

271
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,030
She gets bruises

272
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,550
when her body hit somewhere.

273
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,790
And the bruises won’t heal
for a long time.

274
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,750
Are there any other symptoms?

275
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,310
Her father

276
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,070
died of leukemia.

277
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
Leukemia is not a genetic disease,

278
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,240
but if she has
a family history of leukemia,

279
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,790
she is at high risk for leukemia.

280
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,510
If she often feels tired

281
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
and has a poor appetite,

282
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
and the bruises won’t heal,

283
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,880
I suggest she go to
a big hospital for a checkup.

284
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,680
Yuan.

285
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Where did you go?
I’ve been looking for you.

286
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,030
What’s wrong?

287
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,030
Yuan, let me see your math paper.

288
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,830
I slept last night and didn’t write it.

289
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,270
Write it yourself first.

290
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,110
Just let me see it for once.

291
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,400
The last time. Just for once.

292
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,070
You either sleep
or read comics every day.

293
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,200
Do you know you are
a student of Grade 3?

294
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
The college entrance examination
is six months later.

295
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Are you going to see
my math paper at the time, Han Yayi?

296
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,590
What’s wrong?

297
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,920
It’s just a paper.
Don’t you always let her see it?

298
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,310
Why are you so angry today?

299
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,640
Yuan Caixi.

300
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,240
-Stop chasing me.
-Yuan Caixi.

301
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,920
What’s happening?

302
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,800
You run so fast

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,030
and you don’t let me chase you?

304
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,160
Fine.

305
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,510
I won’t chase you.

306
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,920
But you need to tell me
what’s wrong with you.

307
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
Nothing.

308
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,550
By the way,

309
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,000
do you have a match two days later?

310
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,750
Yeah, it’s the day after tomorrow.

311
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,920
Are you really okay?

312
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,270
I’m fine. I don’t know
what’s wrong with me recently.

313
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,440
I think there is too much on my mind.

314
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,750
Don’t be sad.

315
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,480
Go back to class.

316
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:18,960
Yeah.

317
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,110
Which question? I’ll teach you.

318
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,310
Are you not angry with me anymore?

319
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,590
You are not angry anymore.

320
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,680
How can I be angry?

321
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,440
That’s great.

322
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,510
Sorry that I lost my temper.

323
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,270
I guess I’m too stressed recently.

324
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,200
It’s okay.

325
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,110
Yuan, considering how sad I’m,

326
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,310
write the paper for me

327
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,680
to redeem yourself.

328
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,790
I won’t beat you if you
get your hands off me.

329
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,000
No problem.

330
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,000
Here.

331
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,470
Does your family run a mini mart?

332
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,880
You give her strawberry milk every day.

333
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,920
I heard that sweet food
can relieve stress.

334
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,750
It’s okay, Monitor.

335
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
I’ll bring you a box of milk
from my house.

336
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,110
Thank you.

337
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,240
It’s nice to have you.

338
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,030
You’re welcome.

339
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,110
Am I the most handsome man?

340
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,790
Yuan.

341
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,350
Kinship is a paddle
and friendship is a sail.

342
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,000
Let’s travel on the ocean of
the college entrance examination!

343
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,440
-Well-said!
-Bravo!

344
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:04,750
Write the homework. Hurry up.

345
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,640
Zeyu?

346
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,720
Shouldn’t you be
in the classroom right now?

347
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,440
I just want to be
in a different environment.

348
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,440
Your book.

349
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,070
Thank you.

350
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,620
(Secrets of Blood)

351
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,270
You can take it. I’ll find another book.

352
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,070
Did your father die of leukemia?

353
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,200
Han Yayi said you have
lost your appetite recently.

354
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,790
You even fainted

355
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,110
more than once.

356
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,310
Don’t take a wild guess.

357
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,590
I never take a wild guess.

358
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,960
I said it’s just a friend of mine.

359
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,400
If my judgment is right...

360
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,750
Where else?

361
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,640
Ning Zeyu!

362
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
What’s wrong?

363
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,440
I don’t know.

364
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,160
Aren’t they the two
straight A students in Class 2?

365
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,550
Oh, Zeyu and monitor are having a fight.

366
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,030
Come with me.

367
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,070
Ning Zeyu!

368
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,880
Get off me!

369
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,720
Did you go to the hospital?

370
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,750
Why should I go to the hospital?

371
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,830
I said it’s a friend of mine.

372
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,790
Even Li He won’t believe it.

373
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,480
-It’s really a friend of mine.
-Which friend?

374
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,240
As far as I know, you only have
one friend, Han Yayi.

375
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,070
Is it Han Yayi?
Does Han Yayi have leukemia?

376
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,590
Don’t curse her.

377
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,480
Who is that then?

378
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,880
Did you go to the hospital?

379
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,880
No.

380
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,510
Why?

381
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,790
I’m scared.

382
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,590
Does Aunt know it?

383
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:10,170
My mother, Yuan Haoxi, Li He

384
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,000
and Han Yayi, they all have no idea.

385
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,030
If I hadn’t met you today,
no one would know it.

386
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,720
Yuan Caixi, what are you thinking about?

387
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,400
It’s such an important thing.

388
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,070
Don’t you think you should
talk to your family first?

389
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,070
How should I tell them?

390
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,400
My dad died of leukemia.

391
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,200
How should I tell this to my mom?

392
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
Tell her that I got
the same disease as my dad?

393
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,350
How will my mom take it?
She will go crazy!

394
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,440
But keeping it from her
can’t solve the problem.

395
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,140
It’s leukemia.

396
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,030
It’s not a cold or any minor illness.

397
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,550
You can’t get treatment
if you don’t say it.

398
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,480
What should I do with you?

399
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,550
I don’t know what to do.

400
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,920
Zeyu.

401
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,750
Can you promise me one thing?

402
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,270
Fine. Go ahead.

403
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,070
Keep it a secret for me.

404
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
You must keep it a secret for me.

405
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,200
You can’t tell anyone, especially Li He.

406
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,720
He is going to have a match.

407
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,880
I can’t affect him.

408
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,310
I’m not important. His match
is the most important thing.

409
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,160
Can you do it?

410
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,400
Please.

411
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,110
I’m begging you.

412
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,440
Fine.

413
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,070
To the end of the month.

414
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,510
I’ll keep it secret for you
only to the end of the month.

415
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,480
If you don’t go to
the hospital next month,

416
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,720
-I will tell them for you.
-Okay.

417
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,750
Let’s go. Let me take you back.

418
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,810
I put the key at the door of
the broadcasting room.

419
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,640
It’s under the mat.

420
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,310
Remember to take it tomorrow.

421
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,880
Are you all right?

422
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,160
I’m fine. Let’s go.

423
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,550
What’s happening?

424
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,200
You can’t keep a secret forever.

425
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
It’s better to say it earlier.

426
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,750
Li He.

427
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,680
I’ve been waiting for you for a while.

428
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,350
Didn’t you go to the library?

429
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,720
I didn’t find you.

430
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,830
Where have you been?

431
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,880
There are a few questions
I don’t know how to solve.

432
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,160
So I went back to ask Zeyu.

433
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,030
Have you finished?

434
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,350
-Yeah.
-Can I take you home?

435
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,790
Yeah.

436
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay.

437
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,640
Let’s go.

438
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,720
Bye.

439
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,400
-Let’s go.
-Yeah.

440
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,400
What questions did you ask Ning Zeyu?

441
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,200
Different values of X should be solved

442
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,000
by different analytic functions.

443
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,350
Piecewise function?

444
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,400
That’s all you asked?

445
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,350
Yeah.

446
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,750
I left after I asked him.

447
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,750
It sounds right.

448
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000
Ning Zeyu spends all his time

449
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,830
doing homework or writing programs.

450
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,680
There should be nothing else he can say.

451
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,070
Let’s go.

452
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,790
Rest early tonight.

453
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
I’ll pick you up tomorrow morning.

454
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,510
Well, you don’t need to.

455
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,510
Why not?

456
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,790
Aren’t you going to have a match?

457
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,200
Just stay focused on
preparing for the match.

458
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,240
You don’t need to pick me up.

459
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,160
Picking you up won’t affect the match.

460
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,200
But...

461
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,880
There is no but.

462
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,480
Yuan Caixi.

463
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,110
You are you. The game is the game.

464
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,680
There is no conflict between you two.

465
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,270
Whether there is a game or not,

466
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,350
I will pick you up and take you home.

467
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,590
Do you hear me?

468
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,880
What are you looking at?

469
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,070
You don’t want to go home
or you don’t want to leave me?

470
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,030
Let’s go.

471
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,710
The weather is great.

472
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
The moon is really round.

473
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,440
Tell Chief. Don’t tell Chief.

474
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,070
Tell Chief.

475
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,590
Don’t tell Chief.

476
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,960
Tell Chief. Don’t tell Chief.

477
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,260
(Chuan)

478
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,670
What if I think too much about it?

479
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,630
I must be thinking too much about it.

480
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,700
(Chief)

481
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,440
Hello, Chief.

482
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,670
Hello, Chuan.

483
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,110
Why did you call me?

484
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,190
Nothing, actually.

485
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,960
What is nothing?

486
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,590
Well... it’s...

487
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,920
Just say it.

488
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,280
I need to get up early tomorrow.

489
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,210
I will buy breakfast for monitor

490
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:52,230
and then send her to school.

491
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,920
Chief.

492
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,880
I saw monitor and Zeyu together again.

493
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,150
And then?

494
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,760
Then?

495
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:03,550
I said that I saw them together again.

496
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,510
Chuan, are you stupid?

497
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,440
We are at the same school.

498
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,360
What’s so strange to see them together?

499
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,880
When you were running
during the night classes,

500
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,630
I saw them talking very intimately.

501
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,510
Were they near the library?

502
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,920
Yes, near the library.

503
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,150
She told me about it.

504
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,320
She was going to study near the library.

505
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,960
Later, there was a math problem
she couldn’t solve.

506
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,630
So she went to ask Zeyu.

507
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,510
What’s wrong?

508
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,550
No way.

509
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,880
Ask him a math problem in that place?

510
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,840
You don’t understand
the world of straight A students.

511
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,320
Stop guessing.

512
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,620
Chief.

513
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,840
Do you believe whatever
Yuan Caixi told you?

514
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,920
Yeah, she won’t lie to me.

515
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,030
All right, there is nothing else.

516
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Chief, good night.

517
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,110
Silly boy.

518
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,150
Well, well, Li He.

519
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
You are silly indeed.

520
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,900
(Renke Buns)

521
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,320
Aunt, I want a meat bun
and a vegetable bun.

522
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,280
And some black rice porridge.

523
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,230
-One more red bean bun.
-Okay.

524
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:46,590
I’ve paid the money, Aunt.

525
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,320
Zeyu.

526
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,880
Why are you here?

527
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,320
I can’t rest assured to let you
go to school alone.

528
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,710
But I left home
half an hour earlier today.

529
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,480
I know with my knees

530
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,510
that you will leave early
to avoid Li He.

531
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
Well?

532
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
Didn’t you leave early to avoid him?

533
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,190
Now you want him to show up?

534
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,480
Let’s go.

535
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,840
Okay.

536
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Monitor!

537
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,110
Let me carry the bag for you.

538
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,440
It’s okay, I can carry it myself.
