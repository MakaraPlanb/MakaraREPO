17
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,480
Mr. Zhang, hurry up.
I’m going to the meeting first.

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,350
Okay, Mr. Qiu. You go ahead first.

19
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,350
I’ll turn off the computer.

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Come in.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,760
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Hello.

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,120
Can we use your computer?

24
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,230
Use my computer?

25
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,730
Yes.

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,370
For what?

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,660
Just look for some information.

28
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,870
How?

29
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,430
Use the search engine.

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,200
All right.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,280
Well, here is Baidu.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,070
Okay.

33
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,680
Don’t do anything to these folders.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,190
Okay.

35
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,070
It’s very important.

36
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,910
Remember to turn it off
after you finish it.

37
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,960
-Okay.
-Okay, Mr. Zhang.

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,310
I have a meeting now.

39
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,870
Thank you.

40
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,840
Mr. Qiu, wait for me.

41
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,030
Bros.

42
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
To prove our innocence,

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,870
I have an idea.

44
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,930
Go ahead.

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,360
We will 100% support you.

46
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,460
(Cracked successfully)

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,800
A lot of things happened,

48
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,680
but

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,960
we can use our own strength

50
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,190
to prove our innocence.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,280
I agree.

52
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,280
Me, too.

53
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah.

54
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,240
That’s it.

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,430
Come on.

56
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,470
Come on!

57
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,030
Is that the answer?

58
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,310
No.

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,960
These answers are all wrong.

60
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,590
If they copy this,

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,630
there is no way
they could pass the exam.

62
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,470
I guess

63
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,120
they just want Li He
to do worse in the exam.

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,430
As a result,

65
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,560
Li He and his friends
deleted the answer.

66
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,310
They didn’t see it at all.

67
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,400
That person wants to go with it

68
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,400
and frame them?

69
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,840
Yeah.

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,430
This person did put some effort into it.

71
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,560
Are you sure it was from that person?

72
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,800
Yeah.

73
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,910
It’s his alt, but guess what?

74
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,710
It’s connected to his phone number.

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,270
Have you finished?

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,270
Yeah.

77
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,260
(To: Mr. Ma)

78
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,220
(To: Mr. Ma)

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
Come on, take a look!

80
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,750
These are the PE students
of Class 2,

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Li He, Lin Chuan, Jiang Yuan, Yun Xiang.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Take a good look at them.

83
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,830
They were the four people who cheated.

84
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,870
It has nothing to do with

85
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,160
other PE students.

86
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,600
Well?

87
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,430
I can’t make a comment
about your cheating?

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,680
Yeah?

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,360
That’s the

90
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,190
famous long-distance running champion,

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,310
Li He.

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
Well, do you want to beat me up
with your clenched fist?

93
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,800
Come on. Do it.

94
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,000
Come on.

95
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,830
Do it.

96
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,510
Can you act like a man?

97
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,070
Come on.

98
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,480
I know what you want.

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,720
Well,

100
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,830
you just accused us of cheating,

101
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,510
now you are trying to provoke us
into picking a quarrel with you,

102
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,160
right?

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,310
What are the efforts for?

104
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,560
What for? Nothing.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,720
I just want everyone to know

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,870
what kind of person you are.

107
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,310
I don’t know what kind of person he is.

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
But I know what kind of person
you are, Zhang Ye.

109
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,430
Monitor.

110
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,800
In terms of the major,

111
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,120
Li He comes first in long-distance race.

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,720
What about you?

113
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,600
Number two forever.

114
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,070
That’s right.

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
You are kind of like me.

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,360
In terms of character,

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,680
Li He is a good loser.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,510
He wore that tortoise suit
after he lost.

119
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,000
In fact, he could have won.

120
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,750
But he chose to come back to help me.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,240
In terms of grades,

122
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,750
Li He passed three tests.

123
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,310
How about you?

124
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,950
I think you failed all of your tests.

125
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,310
You know better than I do

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,310
whether they cheated or not.

127
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,380
(Answers for biology)

128
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,560
These are fake.

129
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,070
The answers are fake.

130
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,480
There is no way they could
pass the exam with these answers.

131
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,950
Mr. Ma.

132
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,000
This is the evidence
that they didn’t cheat.

133
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,000
Where did the evidence come from?

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,270
It was on the desk when I came back.

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,360
Therefore, can we
keep their grades this time?

136
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,680
They didn’t cheat.

137
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,680
Logically, yes.

138
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,430
But it’s a fact
that they bought the answer.

139
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,510
You can still punish them.

140
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,830
But we have to prove
their innocence first.

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,870
Let me think about it.

142
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,510
Fine.

143
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,430
I’ll ask the Academic Affairs Office

144
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,920
and keep their grades.

145
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,560
You might also need to
apologize to them.

146
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

147
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,270
What did you say?

148
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,430
Mr. Ma, think about it.

149
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,310
If you are wronged,

150
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,830
would you also want an apology?

151
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,270
Mr. Bai.

152
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,830
Do you always feel that I’m against

153
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,680
the PE students?

154
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,120
Think about it.

155
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,310
If we tolerate

156
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,680
those students who are making trouble

157
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,120
and do nothing about it,

158
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,920
how would those disciplined
and hardworking students

159
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,800
think of it?

160
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,040
Is there any kid who doesn’t
want to play around?

161
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,190
But some students just don’t do that.

162
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,630
Their life is simply between
home and school.

163
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,750
They study hard.

164
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,270
They can do it.

165
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,750
Why can’t the PE students do it?

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,430
Mr. Ma.

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
From today,

168
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,040
I will be stricter with them.

169
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,430
But before that,

170
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
they need an apology.

171
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,800
That’s impossible.

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,270
Just go back.

173
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,190
Go back to class.

174
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,430
Yuan, you are really cool.

175
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,390
Everyone.

176
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,000
There is an announcement.

177
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,630
After an investigation by the school,

178
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,510
the PE students in Class 2, Grade 3,

179
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,270
Li He, Lin Chuan,
Jiang Yuan and Yun Xiang

180
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,360
didn’t cheat

181
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,160
in the exam this month.

182
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,070
The notice of criticism
yesterday is withdrawn.

183
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,270
And the grades of these four
PE students

184
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,510
will be retained.

185
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,320
On behalf of the school,

186
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,270
I want to apologize to
these four students

187
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,750
for the notice of criticism yesterday.

188
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,960
Zhang Ye.

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
After the investigation,
the school found

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,630
that you traded with the people outside
the school for monthly exam answers.

191
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,960
Mr. Ma asked you to
go to the office and verify it.

192
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,000
Go to the office with me.

193
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,790
Yuan, sorry for what I said yesterday.

194
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,870
No big deal.

195
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,600
Let’s go.

196
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,600
To be honest,

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
the punishment won’t be small this time.

198
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,240
Zhang Ye.

199
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,480
Why did you do that?

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,720
There is no why.

201
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,320
Come in.

202
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,000
How did you come?

203
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,150
Mr. Ma.

204
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
We want to retake the exam.

205
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,030
Retake the exam?

206
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,250
Yeah.

207
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,790
Let’s

208
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,910
retake the exam.

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,390
Retake the exam?

210
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:43,960
Yes.

211
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
A lot of things happened,

212
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,080
but

213
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,320
we can use our own strength

214
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,600
to prove our innocence.

215
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,670
I agree.

216
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,720
-Me, too.
-Me, too.

217
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,030
Yeah.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
Although the answers are fake,

219
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,120
it’s true that we wanted to
take a shortcut.

220
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
The four of us

221
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,320
want to take the test fair and square.

222
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,510
Okay.

223
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,790
I respect your opinion.

224
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,790
It seems that you have
a strong sense of ethics.

225
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,910
Li He.

226
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,720
Is there any problem with you?

227
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,080
The truth is revealed.

228
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,960
You still want to retake the exam
and show off.

229
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,870
Will it kill you not to show off?

230
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,670
You’ve come first in running.

231
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,360
I admit that I can’t run faster
than you do.

232
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,750
People all know your name
when they speak of the South Campus.

233
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,270
But why is that?

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,750
The academic students
and PE students are at odds.

235
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,870
But your classmates still defend you.

236
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,670
They defended you when you wore

237
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,670
the tortoise suit in the cafeteria.

238
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,670
They also helped you with the exam.

239
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,840
Why?

240
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,870
Why all the good things happened to you?

241
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,960
Because I’m not thinking
about it at all.

242
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,750
I just do

243
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,030
what I want to do.

244
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,360
I don’t think you should
look at these things.

245
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,480
Don’t look at me.

246
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,750
Don’t look at others.

247
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,030
You should look at yourself.

248
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,320
Mr. Ma, I’m leaving.

249
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,030
Yeah.

250
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,080
The young and vigorous boy.

251
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,820
(The four PE students didn’t cheat)
Guys, there is a new message.

252
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,150
Haven’t they made an announcement?

253
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,270
Is it necessary to send a group message?

254
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
Isn’t it a good thing
that they didn’t cheat?

255
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,790
Compared to Zhang Ye,

256
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,720
I think the PE students
in our class are good enough.

257
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,080
Yeah, I heard that Li He
asked to retake the exam.

258
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,630
I really thought they cheated

259
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,240
when I saw the screenshot.

260
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,670
Looks like

261
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,080
we misunderstood them this time.

262
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,360
We did.

263
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,270
They did so many bad things before.

264
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,270
Who knows they would
become good people suddenly?

265
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,910
Representative, here is my homework.

266
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,750
Ning Zeyu.

267
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,480
Do you have to make such a loud noise?

268
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,510
I have to.

269
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,960
I’m afraid I can’t drown out your voice
talking behind other people.

270
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,240
Don’t chime in with others.

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,080
It won’t hurt you to gossip less.

272
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,600
Just go back.

273
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,350
♪Achoo I sneezed♪

274
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,690

282
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,480
Does it feel good to strike back?

283
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
In fact,

284
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,910
I was quite nervous.

285
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,790
Nervous?

286
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,030
I think you quite enjoyed it.

287
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,270
Thanks.

288
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,440
You’re welcome.

289
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,440
By the way,

290
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,030
you can make your parents
happy this time, right?

291
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,960
Not yet.

292
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,270
We need to retake the exam.

293
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,960
Retake the exam?

294
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,630
Yeah.

295
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,390
There is a little episode this time.

296
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,240
I’ve decided with Chuan and the others

297
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,000
to retake the exam together.

298
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,550
Aren’t you scared?

299
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,510
Scared of what?

300
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,000
What if you fail the exam?

301
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,390
If you are afraid
every time before the match,

302
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
you will never win.

303
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,910
By the way,

304
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,750
how do you know Zhang Ye did it?

305
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,630
What evidence did Mr. Ma get?

306
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,150
We recovered the emails
that had been deleted

307
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,120
and found that the sender is Zhang Ye.

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,790
Actually, there is another person
you should thank.

309
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,550
Coming.

310
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,840
Why did you come?

311
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,200
Is there anyone else in your house?

312
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,200
Whether or not, I don’t welcome you.

313
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,840
But you still helped me.

314
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Is it because you have
nothing better to do?

315
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,960
Damn.

316
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,840
Don’t sit on the bed.

317
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,910
The pants are clean.
I washed it yesterday.

318
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,150
What’s the matter? Just leave if there
is nothing. There is no meal for you.

319
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,910
I’m not here for a meal.

320
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,000
I’m here to invite you
to my house for a meal.

321
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,600
Why are you so kind?

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,510
You did me a favor.
I invite you to a meal.

323
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,270
Then I won’t own you anything.

324
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,150
You think too much about it.
I didn’t do it for you.

325
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,750
Fine, I’ve invited you anyway.

326
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,600
You can come or not as you want.

327
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,080
Wow.

328
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,840
(SEXY BRAIN)
No way, Ning Zeyu.

329
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,000
You are reading this?

330
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,390
-What are you doing?
-Put my book down.

331
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,000
I’m surprised that the prodigy
Ning Zeyu is reading

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,910
something sexy at home.

333
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Good for you.

334
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,910
Take a look and see
if you can understand it.

335
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
C programming language.

336
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,440
Do you know how to program?

337
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,440
Otherwise?

338
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,630
Do you think your email just
showed up by itself

339
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,600
and said, hello, Li He,

340
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,510
I’m here to prove your innocence,

341
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,150
I showed up because I heard your call?

342
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,510
Is it like this?

343
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,840
Bravo.

344
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:14,030
Well, can you hack
other people’s computer

345
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,840
and see if they

346
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,720
have any suspicious emails or messages?

347
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,720
Thank you, bro.

348
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,150
I’m learning C programming language,

349
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,200
not how to commit cyber crime
and get myself in jail.

350
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,480
To be honest,

351
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,750
I’m quite envious of you.

352
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,080
You’re so smart.

353
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,360
No wonder my mom told me that

354
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
she wanted to adopt you as my brother
when I was little.

355
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,550
Such a nice boy.

356
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,150
Actually, I was envious of you.

357
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,150
Every time you’re home,
you see a feast on the dinner table.

358
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,600
Your mom and dad ask most frequently

359
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,720
about whether you’re happy or not

360
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,480
instead of

361
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
whether you’ve got full scores or not.

362
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,150
Envy me?

363
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,270
You should’ve told me earlier.

364
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,270
If so, I can invite you to my home

365
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,080
for dinner more often.

366
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,680
Wow. You’re talking
as if you’re the cook.

367
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,000
But you’re really awesome.

368
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,750
I mean it.

369
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,830
I hope you can soon become...

370
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,510
That...

371
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,550
Programmer, right?

372
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,880
Anyway, just the best talent
in your field.

373
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,750
Understand?

374
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,790
Then you can never beat me
in this life time.

375
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,000
Your mom will again compare you to me.

376
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,550
Let her do it.

377
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,310
I’m not scared.

378
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,830
You can never run faster than me.

379
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,160
Don’t worry.

380
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,350
My scores are getting higher now.

381
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,960
I’ll beat you sooner or later.

382
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,270
Oh.

383
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,550
Take this back. Sexy brain.

384
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,550
Maybe I underestimated you before.

385
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,480
But I won’t go easy on you from now on.

386
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,510
Fine. Let’s wait and see.

387
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:12,030
Don’t complain

388
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,270
when you’ve chosen
your direction and path.

389
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,750
(Li He)
A man can only defend rainbows

390
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,680
when he can endure rains and storms.

391
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,110
Where did he Google this?

392
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,640
Why’s this picture?

393
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,540

394

395
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,160
(Li He)
Monitor, watch me play basketball tomorrow?

396
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,510
I have to study.

397
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,790
Don’t tell me that you have to study.

398
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,030
(Sent to Li He)
Okay. See you tomorrow.

399
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,270
I thought you could
throw a three-pointer.

400
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,830
You were too late to see it.

401
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,160
Who said I didn’t?

402
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,640
You threw five times in total.

403
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,400
One of them is a layup, right?

404
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,750
You know layup?

405
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,110
Of course.
A girl knows basketball too.

406
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,310
Wow. Such confidence.

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,880
Why don’t you try it, monitor?

408
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,200
Why not?

409
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,880
Do a layup.

410
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,720
Come on.

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,550
Come on.

412
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,750
One. Two. Ouch.

413
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,880
Your move is called

414
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,350
holding a urine bowl
by us professional players.

415
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,000
I said I know basketball.
I never said I can play.

416
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,830
Let me teach you.

417
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,400
A layup is like this.

418
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
One. A big step. Two. A small step.
Three. Jump high.

419
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
Now, you’re passing the ball
at your left side.

420
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,200
Then take a big step
with your right foot.

421
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,750
One. Take a big step.

422
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,640
Hold the ball with both hands.

423
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,140
Okay.

424
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,920
Two. Take a small step

425
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,200
with your left foot.

426
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes. A small step.

427
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,510
Then, use this momentum and jump high.

428
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,400
Yes.

429
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Jump high.

430
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,510
At this time, the ball should be
on the right side of your head.

431
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,680
Then, throw the ball.

Ye Jingxi.

482
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,480
He’s here?

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,480
There it is.

00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,000

It is really Ye Jingxi.

488
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,480
No way.

489
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,310

490
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,270
Being a celebrity is such a big deal.

491
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,270
Let’s go.

492
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,070
Here’s the drink.

493
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,030
Thank you.

494
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,750
Thanks.

Wan.

496
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,400
Will Ye Jingxi shift
the focus of his work

497
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,510
to the domestic market?

498
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,510
Yes. His contract
with the foreign agency

499
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,790
has expired.

500
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,750
It’s been 6 or 7 years

501
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,680
since he became a trainee?

502
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,790
Almost.

503
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,000
He started training abroad
since Junior High.

504
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,030
His returning to China

505
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:52,240
is a decision of discretion
by him and his agency.

506
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,350
Will there be any big events
when he come back?

507
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,830
An album release? Acting?
Any reality shows?

508
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,240
We’ll have to wait for
official announcements.

509
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,550
Okay. Thank you.

510
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,480
Thanks.

511
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,880
Thanks. Let’s take a 10-minute break.

512
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,030
I heard that you haven’t had lunch.

513
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,270
This cake is for you.

514
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,310
No.

515
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,310
I don’t eat desserts.

516
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,830
But this cake is so good.

517
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,350
You need some sugar.

518
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,070
No, I really don’t

519
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,960
because I’m sweet enough.

520
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,400
So handsome.

521
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,790
Monitor.

522
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,550
Look at the moon. It’s big and round.

523
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,240
It’s our neighborhood’s street lamp.

524
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,510
The celebrity we saw today
is a bit familiar.

525
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,240
Who is he?

526
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
I’ve told you already. He’s Ye Jingxi.

527
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
No wonder I thought I’ve heard the name.

528
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,310
I heard someone mention his name.

529
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,880
Han Yayi is always talking about him.

530
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,400
He’s her idol.

531
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,550
If she knows we’ve seen her idol,

532
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,830
she’ll be so mad.

533
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,720
If she’s mad, Chuan will be mad too.

534
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,960
But I think

535
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,030
I’m more handsome

536
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,350
if I comb my hair backward

537
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,510
and get a nice makeover.

538
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,550
Li He,

539
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,240
it’s good to have a correct
understanding of yourself.

540
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,240
Right!

541
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,720
You think the same.

542
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,200
You have good taste.

543
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,200
Look at how fragile he is.

544
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,110
How can he be more handsome than I am?

545
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,400
He can’t protect you.

546
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,640
Fine. I’ll go now.

547
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,880
Oh.

548
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,670
Oh.

549
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,750
I learned how to shoot basketball today.

550
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,510
Thank you.

551
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,440
I had fun today.

552
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,200
See you tomorrow.

553
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,510
-Bye. See you.
-Bye.

554
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,720
Bye-bye.

555
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,440
Our monitor has good taste.

556
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,200
This is a real man.

557
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Look at the abs.

558
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,400
Look at the v-lines.

559
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,620
(Ye Jingxi: First day back in China)

560
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,460
(I worked from dawn to dusk.
Feeling a bit tired.)

561
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,810
(Jingxi, take care of your health.)

562
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,900
(You’re still so handsome
when you’re exhausted.)

563
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,040
(Jingxi, don’t forget to eat on time.)

564
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,160
I’m such a sinner.

565
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,400
Any news from me

566
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,510
will get my fans so excited.

567
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,750
Oh my god.

568
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
How could you sit like this?

569
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,110
What if people take a photo?
Sit straight.

570
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,030
Let them do it. Why should I be scared?

571
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,960
Your persona is cold and distant.
Don’t act like this.

572
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,070
Listen.

573
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,480
A real idol

574
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,750
is handsome

575
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,400
whatever he does.

576
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,000
Oh! Jingxi,

577
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,750
you’ve really decided to
go back to school?

578
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,550
Yes.

579
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,000
I not only have to go back to school,

580
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,400
I also need to find a person.

581
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
You’ve really made the decision?

582
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,030
You’ll give up many opportunities.

583
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,000
I’ve made up my mind.

584
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,830
(Han Yayi)
Yuan, is he handsome?

585
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,790
Have you seen his face?
I’m about to cry.

586
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,680
(Sent to Han Yayi)
I saw vaguely cuz crowd was big.

587
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,110
My tears have dried.

588
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,880
Why is the fate so cruel?

589
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,680
You haven’t even listened
to any of his songs.

590
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,790
I forbade you from looking at his face.

591
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,350
Fine. Fine. I’ll study now.

592
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,440
Yuan, come over here.

593
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,720
Happy birthday, Yuan.

594
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:27,880
Make a birthday wish.

595
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,680
I wish I can be the first in every exam.

596
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,000
Your wish is boring.

597
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,480
You’re boring!

598
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,160
Don’t be mad. This is my gift.

599
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,270
If you blow the whistle,

600
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,160
I’ll immediately appear

601
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,200
like Superman.

602
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,400
Is there a Superman
who loves to eat like you do?

603
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,720
Bear. Bear. Bear.

604
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,510
Yuan, go.

605
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,830
Let’s go.

606
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,360
Why did I dream of Bear?

607
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,070
And I dreamed of the things
I don’t want to dream of the most.

608
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,840
It must be because I’m so tired
from playing basketball.

609
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,880
Why is your skirt so short?

610
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,550
Haven’t you changed it last time?
Why again?

611
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,150
Go home and change it.
This is so not like a student.

612
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,070
Fine, Mr. Ma.

613
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,670
So troublesome.

614
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,280
Stop.

615
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,480
Why is your hair so long?

616
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,360
What?

617
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,230
Do you want a makeover at my office?

618
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,710
No, Mr. Ma.
I can do it myself when I go home.

619
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
Fine. Go. Go. Go.

620
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,590
-Good morning, Mr. Ma.
-Yuan Caixi.

621
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:26,760
Yuan Haoxi.

622
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,480
Learn from your sister.

623
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,360
She’s such a good example that
even I want to learn from her.

624
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,400
Yes. Yes. Yes.

625
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,480
I know, Mr. Ma.

626
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,400
Go. Go. It’s time for class.

627
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,800
Good morning, Mr. Ma.

628
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,840
Keep the spirit strong!

629
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,030
(Ye Jingxi revealed return to senior high)
Jingxi came back?

630
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,000
Which one do you think is better?

631
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,590
Yuan Haoxi or Ye Jingxi?

632
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,740
(Ye Jingxi chose to study
at a domestic senior high.)

633
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,860
-No way.
-It’s real.

634
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,070
Look at their post on
official Weibo account.

635
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,630
Look at this.

636
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,280
I have no other wishes as long as
he can come back to China.

637
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,840
He’s so handsome. Gosh.

638
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,630
This photo. This one.

639
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,960
Good morning.

640
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,920
Today, our class has
a new transfer student.

641
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,880
He’s identity is a bit special.

642
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,920
I wish we can help him

643
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,190
adapt to the new environment.

644
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,780
(Class 2, Grade 3)

645
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,950
Ye Jingxi.

646
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,210
Ye Jingxi.

647
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,990
It’s really him.

648
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,090
Ye Jingxi.

649
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,190
Quiet down.

650
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,280
Sit down.

651
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,480
This is our new student. Ye Jingxi.

652
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,760
Hello, I’m Ye Jingxi.

653
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,480
I guess you all know who I am.

654
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,070
There’s no need for self-introduction.

655
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,590
You can sit at the back for now.

656
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,590
We can adjust your seat later.

657
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,550
Hello.

658
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,550
Miss.

659
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,630
Hello to you too.

660
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,190
Class has begun. Get back to your seat.

661
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,070
Yuan, you know Jingxi?

662
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,480
How’s that possible?

663
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,510
Eyes up here.

664
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,840
It’s time for class.

665
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,670
Okay. Class dismissed.

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,670
This is mine.

670
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,150
Wait.

671
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,670
