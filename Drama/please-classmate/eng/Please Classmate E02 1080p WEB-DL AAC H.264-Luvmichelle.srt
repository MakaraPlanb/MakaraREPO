-Li He, you are the most handsome boy.
-Li He!

00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,020
Rise and shine.

-Li He, you are the most handsome boy.
-Get up now.

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,190
Li He, you are the most handsome boy.

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,590
Mom.

23
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:39,960
I’m hungry.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
Lady knight, is there any breakfast?

25
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,400
Little brat, ask your dad.

26
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,520
Knight.

27
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,710
Is there any breakfast?

28
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,190
Knight, I’m hungry.

29
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,240
Dad, my mom is hungry!

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
Got it!

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
I think I’m adopted.

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
Well.

33
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,360
You’ve improved.

34
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
You could still stand up
after the physical test yesterday.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,800
I’m fine.

36
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,680
No matter how tired I’m,

37
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
I’ll still get up and write
your Quality Handbook.

38
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,720
Look,

39
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,160
don’t threaten us with the handbook.

40
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,800
It’s not something a man would do.

41
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,190
Indeed.

42
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
We are no match for you.

43
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,750
You were quite masculine

44
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,920
when you picked on a girl yesterday.

45
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,070
I didn’t.

46
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,310
When did I pick on a girl?

47
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,480
Since I was born, when have I...

48
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,310
All right.

49
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,270
It’s too noisy.

50
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,800
Damn!

51
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,950
How dare you touch my head!

52
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,240
I can kick your ass
even in front of your house.

53
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,360
Wait.

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,430
What are you doing?

55
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,190
Mom.

56
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,000
Good morning, Aunt.

57
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,560
What are you doing out there?

58
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,120
Dump the trash.

59
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,680
Silly boy.

60
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,510
You should learn from Zeyu.

61
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,950
Look how good his grades are.

62
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,750
Aunt, Li He has improved a lot
in his study.

63
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,040
He got 50 points in math.

64
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,270
Well.

65
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,480
50 points.

66
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,160
It means he scored 20 more points.

67
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,870
-Yeah.
-That’s great.

68
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,430
Well done.

69
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,800
Aunt, since Li He

70
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,270
is so talented in learning,

71
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,190
why don’t you send him to a cram school?

72
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,870
Yeah.

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,070
He.

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Let me send you to a cram school.

75
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,480
Just try a little harder,

76
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,360
and you might

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,630
be able to score 100 points.

78
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,390
Don’t bother, Mom.
It’s totally a waste of money.

79
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,950
How is that a waste of money?

80
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,310
If I don’t spend the money

81
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,800
on the cram school,
you will still spend it

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,560
on the skin of the game.

83
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,750
Well, that’s it.

84
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,240
I really don’t need it, Mom.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,310
It’s a waste of money. I mean it.

86
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,240
Come on, just go to school.

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,190
I will study hard.
You don’t need to help me.

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,830
-Goodbye, Aunt.
-You are going to be late.

89
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,390
-No, Mom.
-Just go.

90
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,430
These two silly boys.

91
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,240
Are you trying to
find the exercise paper

92
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,430
of the positional relationship
between straight lines?

93
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,390
When did you get up?

94
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,560
I remember I winded up your clock.

95
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,950
Do I need a clock to get up?

96
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,480
Your butt.

97
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,920
Next time I should see

98
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,070
if it’s you in bed first.

99
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,070
Caixi.

100
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,510
It’s for the first grade.
You don’t need it anyway.

101
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,390
Just lend it to me.

102
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

103
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,750
I’m your brother.

104
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Caixi.

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,360
It’s too difficult.

106
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,360
No.

107
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,510
Yuan Haoxi.

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
Don’t you try to take it away.

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Mom, Yuan Haoxi stole my papers again!

110
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,190
-Haoxi, do you want to get beat up?
-Yuan Caixi.

111
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,920
-Don’t mess with your sister.
-It’s fine you don’t lend me the paper.

112
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,870
But you told on me.

113
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,920
Do you still have conscience?

114
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,720
So what?

115
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,390
Fine.

116
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,000
Someone else will lend it to me.

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,390
Stop following me.

118
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,920
Who is following you?

119
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,390
The school is in this way.

120
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,030
Why do you go
in the opposite direction every day?

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,670
You asked me not to follow you.

122
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,480
Yuan Haoxi, hurry up.

123
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Coming.

124
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,150
Yuan Haoxi.

125
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,120
Hello.

126
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,720
This is the paper for you.

127
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,030
Thank you.

128
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,480
You are a kind, beautiful

129
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,270
and good girl indeed.

130
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey.

131
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,550
We’re going to be late
if we don’t leave now.

132
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,390
All right, look forward to seeing you

133
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:35,960
again at school.

134
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,390
-Yuan Haoxi.
-See you later.

135
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,320
The bell is ringing.

136
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,600
-Yuan Haoxi.
-See you later, bye.

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,870
Coming.

138
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,240
Good morning, Zeyu.

139
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,150
What a coincidence.

140
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,440
Yeah. It’s really a coincidence.

141
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,510
It has been a coincidence
for two years, Zeyu.

142
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,670
Just ignore him. Let’s go.

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,340
Let’s go.

144
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,600
Well, well. Zeyu.

145
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,000
There is nothing wrong with you

146
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,440
except your taste.

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,200
My sister is just a piece of wood.

148
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,960
Yuan Haoxi, take it.

149
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,600
Give it to me.

150
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
I’m here.

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,220
Thank you.

152
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,370
Let’s go.

153
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,670
Yuan Haoxi!

154
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,670
Here.

155
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,550
It’s the paper you want.

156
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,510
Thank you.

157
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,120
I got it from my brother.

158
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,480
Thanks.

159
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,080
Hey.

160
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,790
Your hairstyle is really stunning.

161
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,270
Really?

162
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,000
Of course.

163
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,550
Can I invite you to
a movie this weekend?

164
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,910
Sure.

165
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,630
Who would bear to reject you?

166
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,510
(Looking back on the past successes)
At the beginning of the new semester,

167
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,140
(Looking ahead to new highs)
I’d like to thank all the leaders first

168
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,860
(Let’s march forward together)
for coming to Sen Yong High School.

169
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,080
Sen Yong High School

170
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,240
has been through ups and downs
for 20 years.

171
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,720
We are going to ring out
the old and ring in the new.

172
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,720
There is no making without breaking.

173
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,270
At the beginning of the new semester,

174
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,360
our Sen Yong High School

175
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
will have a bright future.

176
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,960
From this year,

177
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,360
we plan to bring the academic

178
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,790
and PE students together,

179
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,960
allowing students

180
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,870
to develop all-round ability,

181
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,600
reach their potential,

182
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,240
and have a better future.

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,080
This is also an attempt of Sen Yong

184
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,150
in teaching.

185
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,120
I hope the leaders

186
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,390
at all levels of the Municipal
Education Commission of Education

187
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,200
can often come to Sen Yong

188
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
and offer more advice

189
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,550
on our work.

190
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,030
Stand up.

191
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,000
Good morning, Miss Luo.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,750
Have a seat.

193
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,320
The cram school for
the second semester in grade two

194
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,600
is going to end.

195
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
One week later,

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,000
we will officially start
the third year of high school.

197
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,200
Before that,

198
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,030
I have something to announce to you.

199
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,550
Because our school

200
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,390
replanned the campuses,

201
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,150
the South Campus
is about to be eliminated.

202
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,270
From the next semester,

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,000
our school will implement

204
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,270
the co-ed system,

205
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,480
which means

206
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,150
academic students and PE students

207
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,390
will take classes together.

208
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,360
We will also have
four PE students in our class.

209
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,390
No way.

210
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,630
How can we take classes with gorillas?

211
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,440
They will hold us back.

212
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,440
They will interfere with our study.

213
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,390
You can’t be serious.
There is no way it would work.

214
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,980
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,200
Yuan Caixi.

216
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Miss Luo.

217
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,550
I don’t agree with it.

218
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,000
Academic and PE students
have different goals

219
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
and different ways of learning.

220
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,870
We can’t live in peace at all.

221
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,870
Why should we take classes together?

222
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,670
Exactly, why is that?

223
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,600
Sit down.

224
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,670
Settle down!

225
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,630
You are about to become seniors.

226
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,550
Is your goal
to live in peace with others

227
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,630
or to get admitted to your ideal school?

228
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,600
You hate PE students
and have prejudices against them

229
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
because you don’t know them enough.

230
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,320
But the world is big.

231
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,080
Everyone is different.

232
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,080
I still hope

233
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,440
you can take this chance

234
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,670
to learn how to embrace the differences

235
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,550
and get better together.

236
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,870
Okay?

237
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,030
-Yes.
-Yes.

238
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,630
Now I’ll announce the names
of the four classmates

239
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,670
who will join us.

240
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,440
They are Yun Xiang,
Jiang Yuan, Lin Chuan

241
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
and Li He.

242
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,720
No way.

243
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
We can never merge with Class 2.

244
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,480
Chief.

245
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,750
If we merge with Yuan Caixi’s class,

246
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,870
what kind of life will we live?

247
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
I think

248
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,000
if we merge with Class 2,

249
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
it must be...

250
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,790
I heard that the academic students
in North Campus do dozens of papers every day.

251
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,000
If we merge with them,

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,080
I guess it won’t take long

253
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,270
before we become

254
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,390
lifeless learning machines like them.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,150
Oh, no.

256
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,080
It’s too scary.

257
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,630
We only have four classes now.

258
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,750
If we merge with them,

259
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
we’ll have to take six classes a day.

260
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,510
No way.

261
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,720
My head hurts when I think about it.

262
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,120
Who doesn’t?

263
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,840
But Mr. Bai said

264
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,390
that the principal made the decision.

265
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,150
Well?

266
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,910
Do you want to mess with the principal?

267
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,390
I don’t want to be a learning robot.

268
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,550
Chief.

269
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,750
Since we can’t change the fact
that we are going to merge with them,

270
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,910
for our future happiness,

271
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,910
shouldn’t we do something first?

272
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,240
Chuan.

273
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,630
I’m thinking

274
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,790
that since we got an issue with
Class 2 before,

275
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,600
we need to

276
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,080
show them

277
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,000
who the boss is

278
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,720
before

279
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,240
we take classes together.

280
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,080
In this way,

281
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,510
even we merge with them,

282
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,440
they dare not walk over us.

283
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Therefore...

284
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,960
They are coming.

285
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,350
Thanks, Caixi.

286
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,660
Let’s go.

287
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,270
Thanks, Caixi.

288
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,510
Ah!

289
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,200
Oh my god.

290
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,880
God, what’s going on?

291
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,750
What happened?

292
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,350
Caixi.

293
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,550
Ah.

294
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,680
It’s them again.

295
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,680
Don’t you have anything else to do?

296
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,110
Why don’t you use the time to study?

297
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,880
-Don’t. Caixi. Don’t.
-Do you think I’m a pushover?

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,110
We still have papers to finish.

299
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,880
Let’s finish the papers.
English papers. Math papers.

300
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,480
The papers.

301
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,510
We have a lot of papers to finish.

302
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Let’s finish the papers first.

303
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,070
I hate those PE students most.

304
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,270
Zeyu.

305
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,270
I really want to prank them back.

306
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,000
Easy.

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,070
The PE students will finish
the training at four o’clock.

308
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,790
It’s too hot.

309
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,880
It’s hot

310
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,440
I want to laugh when I think of
their stupid faces.

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,400
Yeah.

312
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,200
It’s hot.

313
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,000
Hold on, let’s eat together after this.

314
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
Okay. What to eat?

315
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,960
I’ll go in first.

316
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,030
Let’s talk later.

317
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,790
I’m going inside.

318
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,510
Chief.

319
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,750
Have you seen my clothes?

320
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,070
Well, where are my clothes?

321
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,720
My clothes are also gone.

322
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,680
Mine is gone, too.

323
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,510
Don’t run.

324
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,030
-Stop! Get back!
-Stop!

325
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,510
Don’t run! Don’t run!

326
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,480
-You are going to die!
-I’ll kill you if I get you!

327
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,880
Stop!

328
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,030
Don’t run!

329
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,160
Stop!

330
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,640
What are you doing?

331
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,790
To get our clothes back.

332
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,880
Do you need my help?

333
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,380
No need.

334
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,480
You are too kind.

335
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,000
Stand still.

336
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
Are you proud?

337
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,240
Are you here to study sports

338
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,400
or body art?

339
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,510
Li He.

340
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
Are you going to score more points
with your muscle

341
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,960
in your college entrance examination?

342
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,300
Well?

343
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,310
What are you laughing at?

344
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,160
He is quite handsome.

345
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,550
He is in great shape.

346
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,440
Yes, only if he is gentle like Zeyu.

347
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,070
Well, you don’t say.

348
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,920
The PE students
do have little body fat.

349
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,200
All of you are shirtless.
Have you got no shame?

350
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,160
I feel ashamed of you all!

351
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,750
Handsome?

352
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,250
Yeah.

353
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,750
You can’t see the blackboard.

354
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,070
But you can see that clearly.

355
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,960
Ah.

356
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,000
Han Yayi.

357
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,510
What’s the use of only being handsome?

358
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,720
You can’t be that superficial.

359
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,680
Yuan, that’s exactly

360
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,510
what my mom said to me.

361
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,270
Explain it to me!

362
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,160
We were taking a shower.

363
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,310
Did I allow you to talk?

364
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,310
Why are you laughing?

365
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,110
Wear this in class tomorrow

366
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,240
if you laugh again, do you hear me?

367
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,550
Mr. Ma, didn’t you ask me to explain it?

368
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,400
I also asked you to study hard.

369
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,440
Have you done that?

370
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,510
Have you ever listened to me?

371
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
You are shirtless in broad daylight.

372
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,700
Well?

373
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,240
What will other students think of you?

374
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,750
When will you stop being troublesome?

375
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,350
What are you doing?

376
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,720
Taking pictures?

377
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,880
Come on, let’s take pictures together.

378
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Go back to the classroom now!

379
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,680
Wait.

380
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,590
Han Yayi, let’s go.

381
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,240
Go back to the classroom!

382
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
Take pictures.

383
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,640
Look. There are people taking pictures.

384
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,140
Well.

385
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,350
You must be very proud.

386
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:01,940
Well.

387
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,590
Are you big stars?

388
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,270
Chief.

389
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,030
It was too humiliating today.

390
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,750
Those academic brats

391
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,750
played dirty.

392
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,830
It’s our fault that we weren’t prepared.

393
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,720
How to be prepared?

394
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,070
We hid in the locker room.

395
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,070
What else could we do being naked?

396
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,440
Chief.

397
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,720
We can’t go on like this.

398
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,960
They will walk over us

399
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,750
after we merge with them.

400
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
It must be the brat Ning Zeyu

401
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,590
who is behind this.

402
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,440
Chief.

403
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,070
Why don’t we

404
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,790
deal with their leader first?

405
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,110
The third row. The second line.

406
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,030
Yeah, the third row.

407
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,000
The third row.

408
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,310
Let me see if you can keep being smug.

409
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,070
Nailed it?

410
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,510
-What?
-Nailed it?

411
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Of course.

412
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,960
You can count on me.

413
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,960
Are you sure it’s the right seat?

414
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,400
I won’t make a mistake.

415
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,270
I counted one by one.

416
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,310
The third row and the second line.

417
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,310
It’s definitely Ning Zeyu’s seat.

418
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,830
Good.

419
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,270
Let’s go to take a look.

420
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,350
Let’s go.

421
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:18,790
Oh, right.

422
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,000
I got the English reference book
for you.

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,550
Oh, thank you.

424
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:24,810
What’s wrong?

425
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,680
Caixi.

426
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,270
How is your skirt stuck?

427
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,310
Yuan.

428
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,640
What’s up?

429
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,240
It sticks together.

430
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,480
Oh no, Yuan.

431
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,680
What to do with this?

432
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,070
It sticks together. I can’t get it off.

433
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,680
What to do?

434
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,160
The bell is about to ring.
It’s Miss Luo’s class.

435
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,070
She will teach the papers.

436
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,960
I’ll try again.

437
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:24,880
Han Yayi.

438
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,480
Yeah?

439
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,680
Scissors.

440
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,960
Scissors. Scissors.

441
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Well...

442
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,350
Well...

443
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,750
Yuan.

444
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,070
There is a big hole behind.

445
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,440
It’s too revealing.

446
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,440
Here are the clothes
from your classmate, Ning Zeyu.

447
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,550
Wow, Zeyu.

448
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,750
Zeyu is thoughtful indeed.

449
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,960
Well, Yuan. Go to
change your clothes now.

450
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,860
(Clinic)

451
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,350
You are lucky

452
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,640
to get away with this time.

453
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,160
What does it have to do with my luck?

454
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,030
Do you know how I got away with it?

455
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,240
It’s because of your stupidity.

456
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,160
It’s still better than playing dirty.

457
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Indeed.

458
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,270
You guys are fair and square.

459
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,880
Have you taken care of it?

460
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,200
Yeah.

461
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,590
Yuan Caixi.

462
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,160
Sorry.

463
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,880
Hey!

464
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,550
I’m apologizing to you.

465
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,920
It was an accident.
We didn’t mean to prank on you.

466
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,590
Are you sick? Take medicine
if you are sick!

467
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,400
You even prank on the wrong person.
What else can you do?

468
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,070
Could you please stop being so childish?

469
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,720
Is it interesting to keep fighting?

470
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,720
And you.

471
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,880
Please stay away

472
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
from me from now on.

473
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,270
Remember to take medicine on time.

474
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,750
Hey.

475
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,720
This student.

476
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,310
Is that girl your classmate?

477
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,400
She left something here.

478
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,310
Take it back for her.

479
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,750
Okay.

480
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
Thank you, Doctor.

481
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,480
You’re back, Chief.

482
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,160
What’s in your hand?

483
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,750
Not important.

484
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,030
Jiang Yuan.

485
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,510
What’s wrong with you?

486
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,110
You made a mistake about
Yuan Caixi’s seat and Ning Zeyu’s seat.

487
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,270
I don’t know.

488
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,070
The third row and the second line.

489
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,880
What’s wrong?

490
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,160
It’s no problem.

491
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,000
Was that the third row
and the second line?

492
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,480
You found the second row
and the third line.

493
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,790
The row is horizontal
and the line is vertical.

494
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,720
-You remembered it wrong.
-Do you hear it?

495
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,920
Chief, don’t be angry. It’s no big deal.

496
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
Come over.

497
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,510
Stand still.

498
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,750
Look.

499
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,880
You can’t even tell
the row and the line.

500
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
What else can you do in the future?

501
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
You’ll remember it
after a few more times.

502
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,960
Row... row is horizontal.

503
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,510
Line is vertical.

504
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,920
Line is vertical.

505
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,830
I got it.

506
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,510
Look at my brain.

507
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,110
What are you doing?

508
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:52,030
It’s time for class.

509
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,960
It’s time for class.

510
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,030
Stop chatting. Stop chatting.

511
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,720
Come on, you two.

512
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,110
Which class are you from?

513
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:57,790
Class 1.

514
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:59,110
Class 1. Do you still know that?

515
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,000
Hurry back to your classroom.

516
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,830
The bell is about to ring.

517
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,920
Come on, move. Move.

518
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:06,790
Chief.

519
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,790
There are two seats.

520
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:11,880
What’s wrong?

521
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:14,200
Do we deserve it?

522
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,510
Those seats

523
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,400
are for students with poor grades.

524
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,680
Well.

525
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,110
Why can’t you behave well?

526
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,270
Didn’t you learn a lesson
from the physical test?

527
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:29,880
Well, Chief.

528
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,960
I happen to be short-sighted.

529
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,550
I can see clearly sitting here.

530
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,160
Wait.

531
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,270
You are the monitor.

532
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,030
Did you arrange the seats?

533
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:48,960
Well?

534
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,830
Do you want to cause trouble on the
first day we take classes together?

535
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,160
I’m the monitor.

536
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,070
I’m responsible for seating you.

537
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,310
-But...
-You are responsible for it?

538
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,110
I’m just curious.

539
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,000
Which of us four

540
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,590
should sit there?

541
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,590
Come at me if you have any problem.

542
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,510
Don’t take it out on my brothers.

543
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,110
Let me explain it to you.

544
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,750
Our class...

545
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,880
Your campus is gone.
Still picky about the seats?

546
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,070
It’s good enough to still have seats.

547
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,200
What did you say?

548
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,750
What do you want to do?

549
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,680
What do you want to do?

550
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,270
I want to ask her what she means.

551
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,880
I also want to ask you

552
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,830
what these two seats mean.

553
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,000
I don’t mean anything.

554
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,350
I’m responsible for this matter.

555
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,880
But as for which of you
will take these two seats,

556
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,030
it depends on your grades.

557
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,270
We take seats based on our grades here.

558
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,550
No one is against you.

559
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,200
What’s the noise about?

560
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,640
Do you want to take
the class on your feet?

561
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,720
Miss Luo.

562
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,750
These PE students

563
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,880
cause trouble as soon as they are here.

564
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,510
They are picky about the seats

565
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,750
and they threaten our classmates.

566
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
They are not gregarious at all.

567
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,030
You are gregarious.

568
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,400
Then why don’t you sit here?

569
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,110
I heard that your grades
are not good, either.

570
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,310
You should be
at the bottom of your class.

571
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,960
All right.

572
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,750
Stop fighting.

573
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,160
All of the academic students,

574
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,070
come out with me.

575
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,200
PE students stay here.

576
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,640
Sit down.

577
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,030
You want to go out for training, right?

578
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
You think the English class
is boring, right?

579
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,310
I know it.

580
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,590
I also know you don’t want to

581
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,160
merge with them.

582
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,640
But do you have any choice?

583
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,790
The South Campus is gone.

584
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,480
But you are still here.

585
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
You are the representatives
of the South Campus.

586
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,270
Aren’t you afraid

587
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:01,680
that they call the South Campus students

588
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,830
a group of animals
with all brawn and brains

589
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,160
behind your back?

590
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,960
They can say whatever they like.

591
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
We only need to

592
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,680
run well

593
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,880
and run fast.

594
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,920
Okay.

595
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,720
Let’s change the topic.

596
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
I know some of you

597
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,920
want to become

598
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,510
the world champion.

599
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,030
Right?

600
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,110
All right.

601
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:44,640
Today is the first
special running exercise

602
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,750
after the merging.

603
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,070
You’ve

604
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,960
all failed.

605
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,920
But the beginning is
the most difficult part.

606
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,750
From today,

607
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,070
I will train you hard.

608
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:52,790
Right now,

609
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,920
you can go back to take classes.

610
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,160
Sir.

611
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,400
How can we take classes like this?

612
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,720
Is it too much for you?

613
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,790
If you can’t take this little exercise,

614
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,550
can you handle the grueling review
in Grade Three?

615
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,340
How do you feel right now?

616
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,080
(Lang Ping)
Feel wonderful.

617
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,130
It’s been a pretty long trip
and long tournament.

618
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,920
We started from
the beginning until the end.

619
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,500
I think it’s a perfect result.

620
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,480
Yes. Perfect result. Amazing.

621
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,830
You got great fans with you here
in Japan and everybody is watching.

622
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,420
Do you want to give
a little message to the fans?

623
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,070
We always love to play in Japan.

624
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,240
Do you know

625
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,110
3% of the candidates
for college entrance examination

626
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,960
fail due to poor health every year?

627
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,880
From the third year of high school,

628
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,880
you will get up
at six o’clock every day.

629
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
The self-study starts at seven o’clock.

630
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,720
There is a one-hour break at noon.

631
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,350
The evening self-study
ends at ten o’clock.

632
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,550
In this way,

633
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,350
you will spend nearly fourteen hours

634
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,720
on studying every day

635
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,440
for 365 days.

636
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,680
Are you strong enough

637
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,110
to take it?

638
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,150
Therefore,

639
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,190
intellectual and physical education

640
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,360
are complementary.

641
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,320
If you win the championship

642
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,800
and bring glory to our country one day,

643
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,710
you can also be like them.

644
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,510
I know you are mutinous.

645
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,320
But what’s your place to be mutinous?

646
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,920
Can you talk fluently in English?

647
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,590
Have you ever passed the math,
physics and chemistry exams?

648
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,480
I think you know it better than I do.

649
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,550
If you want to undo the bias,

650
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,880
you need to try harder
like the way you run on the playground

651
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,590
and prove it to me.

652
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,150
I know you look down on

653
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,590
those PE students.

654
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,190
But what you don’t know is

655
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,590
that any of the professional athlete

656
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,590
on the field

657
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,510
is as mentally strong as you are.

658
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,030
The body is the home of the soul.

659
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,440
Training the body

660
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,670
is training the will.

661
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,760
Making you run

662
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,150
is not to waste your study time.

663
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,760
I want you to have

664
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,710
a better body and spirit for learning.

665
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,110
Maybe you can’t understand it now.

666
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,960
But after you keep running
for half a month,

667
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,880
you will know the good side of running.

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,510
Teacher.

669
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,670
When do we run every day?

670
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,800
After you take three classes.

671
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:29,230
Everyone, attention!

672
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,670
Right turn!

673
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,960
Right about. Keep in step!

674
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,630
(Send to Spicy Hot Pot Restaurant)
How is it going?

675
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,480
Okay.

676
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,920
I’ve adjusted the seats.
You sit in the back for now.

677
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,760
It’s Miss Luo’s decision.

678
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,880
Pan Hao.

679
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,030
I’ve adjusted the seats.

680
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,480
You sit in the back for now.

681
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,840
I asked the monitor to
help PE students.

682
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,110
Zhao Qiang.

683
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,150
You sit behind Lin Chuan.

684
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,510
We’ve just begun
to take classes together.

685
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,710
It is normal for you to have
some misunderstandings.

686
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,710
After all,

687
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,070
you don’t know each other.

688
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,630
But I do hope

689
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,230
you can let go of prejudice

690
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,840
and help each other.

691
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,710
Let’s spend

692
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,150
the last year of high school together.

693
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,670
Goodbye.

694
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,070
Cut your hair.

695
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,630
-Bye, Mr. Ma.
-Bye.

696
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,510
Bye, Mr. Ma.

697
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,760
Stay safe. Stay safe.

698
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,670
See you tomorrow, Mr. Ma.

699
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,100
Bye.

700
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,960
See you. Bye.

701
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:30,920
Chief.

702
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,360
Are we going to go against
the academic students?

703
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,510
I also think what Miss Luo said

704
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,800
does have a point.

705
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,230
Yeah.

706
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,110
We can’t solve any problems

707
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,400
if we keep messing around.

708
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,550
It’s better to draw a line between them.

709
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,920
Okay.

710
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
As long as they

711
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,280
don’t mess with us,

712
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,070
we won’t pick on them.

713
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,360
Okay.

714
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,510
I’ll listen to you.

715
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Then we won’t pick on them anymore.

716
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,280
Chief,

717
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
I think you and Yuan Caixi

718
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,230
will have a story.

719
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,670
What story?

720
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,000
Even if there is a story,

721
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,150
it would still be a horror story.

722
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,630
Keep training.

723
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,190
Yuan.

724
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,880
You are so cool.

725
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,280
You even made Li He
eat out of your hand.

726
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,000
I can also do that to you,
do you believe it?

727
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,360
I don’t know

728
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,760
whether the days ahead will be peaceful,

729
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,510
or do we only need to know each other?

730
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,230
Well, it has nothing
to do with me anyway.

731
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,510
As long as it won’t affect my study.

732
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,590
Well.

733
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,030
You’ve become an emotionless
learning machine again.

734
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,590
I think you really

735
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,710
want to experience the feeling

736
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,280
of eating out of my hand.

737
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,960
Sorry. Mercy. Yuan.

738
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,760
Wait.

739
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,590
Yuan.

740
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,110
Do you like this?

741
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,440
This one is not for you.

742
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,980
(Retail Price ￥5,800.00)

743
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,920
Not to mention the price.

744
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,550
Let’s go.

745
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,150
Let’s go back.

746
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,030
Caixi.

747
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,920
How are you feeling on the first day
of taking classes with PE students?

748
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,710
Are you used to it?

749
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,960
Don’t mention it.

750
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,800
Not so good.

751
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,590
Not used to it. It’s really troublesome.

752
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,760
Caixi.

753
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,070
I think you are angry with shame.

754
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,150
What do you mean?

755
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,760
You think he is troublesome

756
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,510
because of what happened

757
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,110
in the radio room, right?

758
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,360
Yuan Haoxi.

759
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,480
I found that you are

760
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,510
getting nosier and mouthier.

761
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,110
Mom! Mom! Mom!

762
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,590
Wait, what happened

763
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,230
in the radio room?

764
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,840
Tell me about it.

765
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,440
Yuan Haoxi.

766
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,110
Mom!

767
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,670
Caixi.

768
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,510
You should be friendly
to your classmates.

769
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,840
Just forgive them.

770
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,230
Come on.

771
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,630
Why should I be friendly to them?

772
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,710
I’d better use the time

773
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,230
to do more exercise.

774
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,110
But I know the school has a reason

775
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,840
to make this decision.

776
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,960
By the way, Mom.

777
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,320
Do you have a college reunion

778
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,230
a few months later?

779
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,070
Yeah.

780
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,880
You must dress yourself up
before you go.

781
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,440
Don’t you have something

782
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,670
like talent shows?

783
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:35,480
Just rest assured.

784
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,710
Your mom

785
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,800
has natural charms

786
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,400
everywhere.

787
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,440
-I don’t need to dress myself up.
-Of course.

788
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,400
Mom.

789
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,920
Find some time to practice the piano.

790
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,670
You can show them a thing
or two at the reunion.

791
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,960
This is a timely reminder.

792
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,670
I should practice the piano on weekends

793
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,760
and try to get back the feeling.

794
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,070
Mom.

795
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,570
Yeah.

796
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,710
The first semester’s scholarship

797
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,800
in Grade Three is 5,000 yuan.

798
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,550
I’ll win

799
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,630
the scholarship for you.

800
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,130
Well.

801
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,760
Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.

802
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:02,610
I see.

803
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,590
Don’t worry.

804
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,360
Caixi.

805
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,480
There is one more thing
I want to remind you.

806
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,190
Classmates should be

807
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,360
tolerant of each other.

808
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,800
Of course.

809
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,590
I know I don’t need to

810
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,000
worry about it.

811
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,360
My daughter has no negative reviews
no matter where she goes.

812
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,480
No negative review?

813
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,420
Mom.

814
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,150
Do you know Yuan Caixi at all?

815
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,230
-She is really popular at school now.
-Shut up.

816
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,320
Everyone in the school knows
that she is number two forever.

817
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,710
Yuan Haoxi!

818
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,190
Mom.

819
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,800
Come over!

820
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,510
Mom.

821
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,510
I think you are... Mom.

822
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,360
Beat him.

823
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,030
Harder.

824
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,800
I haven’t said it yet.

825
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,280
You’re number two forever.

826
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,440
Look who’s talking.
You are no match for Ning Zeyu.

827
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,190
You are number two.
