Here.

21
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,510
I don’t know about that either.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,150
The data from your previous experiments
is too messy.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,230
I’ll think about it.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,840
It’s too difficult.

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,560
Have you finished the lab report?

26
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,070
No. Stop nagging me.

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,870
I’m working on that.

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,920
What are these?

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,870
I don’t understand at all.

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,310
You can ask me
if you have any questions.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,190
I’ll just write something.
No need to ask you.

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,000
Monitor!

33
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,630
I do have questions.

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,870
I have many questions.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,030
I’m the biggest question myself.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,430
Help me to do the report, please.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,310
Oh.

38
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,560
OK.

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,150

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,030
Look at mine.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is to make organic matter decompose

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,150
into carbon dioxide and water

43
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,870
and leave inorganic salts.

44
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,240
According to the experimental steps,

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,280
we add hydrogen peroxide as oxidant,

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,560
which converts iodine ion into iodine.

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
The chemical equation is

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,470
two moles of iodine plus
two moles of hydrogen

49
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,630

I keep hoping
that it’s just a fake news.

95
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,510
So I’ve been re-watching it.

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,120
Where are you now?

97
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Gintama Benizakura.
Katsura Kotarou was missing.

98
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
Sakata Gintoki had been looking for him.

99
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Hey, tell me,

100
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,120
will there ever be a friendship

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,560
that transcends life and death
like theirs

102
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,360
in reality?

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Of course there is.

104
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
Just like the four of us.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,870
No matter any one of us

106
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,800
is in trouble or danger,

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,750
I believe

108
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,000
the rest of us

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,950
will try our best to help them.

110
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,360
And of course,

111
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,070
we are classmates now.

112
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,630
I’ll help you, too

113
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,310
no matter what trouble or danger
you may in.

114
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
What’s wrong?

115
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,360
Nothing. Nothing.

116
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,160
It’s just

117
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,070
that this is the first time
I have heard such answer.

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,120
Huh?

119
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,510
Because usually when I talk to people
about this,

120
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,870
they tell me that I think too much

121
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,480
about something that’s unrealistic.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,750
How’s that unrealistic?

123
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,680
Life should be full of imagination.

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,830
Look at my mouth.

125
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,310
Who do I look like?

126
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,560

127
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Honekawa Suneo.

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,750
So don’t care what they say.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,190
Let’s go back to class.

130
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,120
I have a few questions to ask you.

131
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,830
About lab report.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,510
Okay.

133
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,950
Yuan Haoxi, can we have lunch
together tomorrow?

134
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,830
Okay.

135
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,750
Sure.

136
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,040
Is there anything you don’t understand
about this part?

137
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,950
I can teach you.

138
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,360
Let me see.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,240
Do you really have time tomorrow?

140
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,870
Yes.

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,070
Let me see.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,600
Yuan Haoxi.

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,160
There. Go there.

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,270
She’s teaching me.

145
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,800
I’ll study hard today.

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,750
Well, see you at home.

147
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,310
Have you received the message
from Miss Luo?

148
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,160
Yes, I have.

149
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,040
Do you want to buy books?

150
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,630
I want to borrow the discount card
from you.

151
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,720
I saw on your card that it’s 10% off.

152
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,680
It’s much cheaper
than buying books directly.

153
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,390
So can I borrow it?

154
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,430
My card?

155
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,160
Yeah.

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,870
Sisyphe’s discount card.

157
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,390
All the students in the class
want to buy books.

158
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,630
If I buy them with your card,

159
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,240
I can help them save money.

160
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,600
-Please lend to me.
-I…

161
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,560
Please!

162
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,310
Okay then.

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Give it back to me when you’re done.

164
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Okay, I’ll give it back to you
tomorrow morning.

165
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,510
Alright.

166
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,750

167
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,870

168
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,750

172
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,600

173
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,040

174
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,800
What

175
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,120

178
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,160
Left alone on a deserted island,
I’d practice swimming,

179
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,480
so that I could escape.

180
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,160
All right, you two, sit down.

181
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,680
Ning Zeyu.

182
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,720
Read it for us.

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,080
What would you do if you found yourself
alone on a deserted island?

184
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,630
Left alone on a deserted island,

185
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,720
I’d practice swimming,
so that I could escape.

186
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,790
What would you do if you were forced
to do something?

187
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,840
Forced to do something,

188
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,080
I’d probably do nothing.

189
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,480
Good. Have a seat.

190
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
How do we pronounce this word?

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,240
It’s not a big deal.

192
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,910
It’s island.

193
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,390
You’re in your senior year.

194
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,000
Don’t read this word wrong again.

195
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,280
The “is” is silent.

196
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,280
I don’t know what an “is land” is.

197
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,510
(Ning Zeyu)
Let’s do the basic exercises.

198
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,600
The academic students do Part A.

199
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Ning Zeyu.

200
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,910
-PE students, you do Part B.
-Ning Zeyu.

201
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,270
You have to start with the basics.

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,320
Huang Yuan.

203
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,840
What’s up?

204
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,790
Can you give the card back to me now?

205
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,600
Oh, let me look for it.

206
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,120
Okay.

207
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,840
Have you found it?

208
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
I remember putting it in my bag.

209
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,360
But it’s gone.

210
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh.

211
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,320
After I bought the books,

212
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,750
because there were too many
exercise books,

213
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,440
I put the card

214
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
directly in the plastic bag
with the books.

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,510
Where’s the plastic bag?

216
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,270
I may have thrown

217
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:21,440
the plastic bag
into the garbage station.

218
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,320
Where’s Caixi?

219
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,150
She

220
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,670
seems to have gone
looking for something.

221
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,790
Looking for something?

222
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:10,960
Yes.

223
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Has she lost something again?

224
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,200
What happened?

225
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,150
I

226
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,910
borrowed her Sisyphe’s VIP card

227
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,720
and lost it.

228
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,960
And she may be looking for it
in the garbage station.

229
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,270
Stop looking for it.
I’ll get you another one later.

230
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,320
No.

231
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,240
Why not?

232
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,150
I’m just about to buy a few books,

233
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,240
and it’s enough to get you another card.

234
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,440
That card is so important to me.
Another one won’t do.

235
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,870
But…

236
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,960
Why is that?

237
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,600
You can apply for a new one
if you spend 200 yuan for books.

238
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,840
Don’t mind me. Just go home.

239
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,600
Go back now. I must find the card today.

240
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,390
What are you doing?

241
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,840
I… I’m looking for that card.

242
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,550
You lost the card I gave you?

243
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:22,600
I didn’t throw it. Huang Yuan did it.

244
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,790
You gave the card I gave you
to Huang Yuan?

245
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,000
I didn’t give it to her.
She borrowed it that day,

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,150
and I lent it to her.

247
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,270
And she might have
thrown it this morning.

248
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,600
I’m looking for it.

249
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,200
And you let him help you?

250
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,480
What on earth are you doing here?

251
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,750
Just go if you don’t want to help.

252
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,510
Ning Zeyu.

253
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,750
Can you look there for me?

254
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,480
No need.

255
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,600
I’ll get you a new one.

256
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,150
Li He!

257
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,300
(SiSYPHE)

258
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,380
(Sisyphe VVVIP Discount Card)

259
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,100
(Garbage Station)

260
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:33,960
Ning Zeyu.

261
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,910
Why are you here?

262
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,120
I can’t believe you found it.

263
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,750
Why are you here?

264
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,030
Caixi said she lent you the card
to buy books

265
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,870
and you threw it away.

266
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,030
You did it on purpose.

267
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,510
I… I didn’t do it on purpose.

268
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,720
I put it in the bag
and forgot it.

269
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,390
That card is too thin.

270
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,720
I didn’t notice.

271
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,390
I… I really didn’t do it on purpose.

272
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,870
It is indeed thin.

273
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,870
Whether you did it on purpose or not,

274
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,080
please be careful in the future.

275
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,030
Do not casually throw away
other people’s things,

276
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,480
otherwise people will think
you are immoral.

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,670
Ning Zeyu.

278
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,670
Why do you always help Yuan Caixi?

279
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,390
It’s just an unimportant card.

280
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,270
Is it worthy for you to dig through
the garbage?

281
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,510
It’s not up to you to decide
whether it’s important.

282
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,200
If she

283
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,080
thinks it’s important,

284
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:26,910
then it’s important.

285
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,030
You think it’s important even though
other boy gave it to her?

286
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,240
Li He, let go of me!

287
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,600
What do you want?

288
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,480
Be quiet.

289
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,120
Stop dragging me.

290
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,550
-I…
-Ouch!

291
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,360
Why do you girls always
pull other people’s hair?

292
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,480
I’m warning you,

293
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
if you do that again,
I’ll pull all your hair out.

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,150
And I’m warning you,

295
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,600
if you ever give the things
I gave you to others,

296
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,670
I’ll definitely do that again.

297
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,270
-Are you sick?
-Yes. And you can do nothing about it.

298
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
Explain it to me.

299
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,630
Why did you give the thing
I gave you to someone else?

300
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,240
I told you I didn’t give it
to anyone else.

301
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,910
I lent it to Huang Yuan that day.

302
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,720
And after she accidentally threw it,

303
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,440
I went looking for it.
Ning Zeyu happened to pass by.

304
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,870
That’s it?

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
That’s it. That’s the whole truth.

306
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,870
Then please get out of my way.

307
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,440
I need to go back…

308
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,960
Go back?

309
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,550
Stop looking for it.

310
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,000
I’ll get you another one later.

311
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,720
I want to go home.

312
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,750
Can’t I go home?

313
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,870
Okay.

314
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,720
Let me walk you home.

315
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,440
No need. I can go home myself.

316
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,270
It’s going to be dark soon.
It’s not safe.

317
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,080
Stop!

318
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,150
Don’t follow me!

319
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,670
I don’t need you to walk me home.

320
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,870
I’m not safe with you.

321
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,510
Don’t follow me.

322
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,840
-I told you it’s not safe.
-Li He!

323
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,200
No need. I’ll be fine.

324
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,910
I’ll be safe without you.

325
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
Okay.

326
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,150
What movie do you want to watch?

327
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,320
You’re worth watching than a movie.

328
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,390
What kind of milk tea would you like?

329
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,030
Milk tea?

330
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,600
Look at you.

331
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,150
You should cut down on your milk tea.

332
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,790
Okay.

333
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,750
-Drink water. That’s good for you.
-Okay.

334
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,670
-Bye.
-Bye.

335
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,870
Dad. Mom.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,720
Why are you back so late?

337
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,270
I went to the library after school

338
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,270
to look up some information.

339
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,790
Remember to let us know in advance
if you’ll be back late.

340
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,670
Otherwise we would be worried.

341
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
Okay, I know.

342
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,910
It probably won’t happen again.

343
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,480
“Probably”?

344
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,080
“Probably” means it’s your
subjective assume.

345
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I told you before,

346
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,030
no matter what you do,

347
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,120
don’t make judgments based on
your own subjective consciousness,

348
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,550
but on the basis of facts.

349
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,600
You have to do things

350
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,240
from a lawyer’s point of view.

351
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,120
-You can’t always…
-Alright. Let him eat first.

352
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,310
Eat.

353
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,840
Okay.

354
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,550
Oh, right.

355
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
Do those PE students in your class

356
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,750
affect your study?

357
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:16,880
Er…

358
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,750
Eat.

359
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,880
If your study is affected,

360
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,240
I’ll report it
to the school authorities.

361
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,830
I’m not affected,

362
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,720
either are the teachers.

363
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,550
That’s good.

364
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,480
Remember,

365
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,030
you’re not like them.

366
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,310
And you’ll have

367
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,480
different future.

368
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,720
I know.

369
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,060
(Certificate of Honor Ning Zeyu)

370
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,160
Stop looking for it.
I’ll get you another one later.

371
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,830
That card is so important to me.

372
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,510
Another one won’t do.

373
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,340
(Exclusive issued by the owner.
The one and only.)

374
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,580
(Class 2, Grade 3)

375
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,550
Huang Yuan.

376
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,790
Although I believe you didn’t do that
on purpose yesterday,

377
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,200
I still want to tell you that
in the future,

378
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,960
when you borrow something from others,

379
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,310
remember to take good care of it,

380
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,480
because what may not be important
in your eyes

381
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,640
is very important to others.

382
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,200
I know now.

383
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,510
Sorry.

384
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,110
Where did you find it?

385
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:56,590
It’s a secret.

386
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,110
Thank you.

387
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,720
So how would you like to thank me?

388
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,830
I only have this.

389
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,510
Ah…

390
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,400
Then I’ll accept it.

391
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,310
Thank you.

392
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,310
What?

393
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,960
What did he say to you?

394
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,640
Ning Zeyu found the card for me.

395
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,720
That’s not a big deal.

396
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,240
I have lots of cards.
You can throw them all away.

397
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
I can always get one for you.

398
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,030
Stand up!

399
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,240
Good morning, Mr. Ma.

400
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,110
Please sit down.

401
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,880
Are you surprised

402
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
to see me?

403
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,110
I am here today to announce that

404
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,030
in order to avoid such an accident

405
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,200
as the one

406
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
in the chemistry lab,

407
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,240
the PE students

408
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
will write an extra chemistry paper

409
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,880
every day for the next week.

410
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,640
What?

411
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,920
So you’ll learn the lesson.

412
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,790
And for the academic students,

413
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,550
there will be a relay race for our grade

414
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,240
in the next two weeks.

415
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,550
In order to improve
your physical fitness,

416
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,000
the school has decided
to modify the rules

417
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,640
to allow academic students

418
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
to participate in the race.

419
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,240
Mr. Ma,

420
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,550
we’re going to have an exam
in a few days.

421
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,350
Participating in the race

422
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,240
will affect our studies.

423
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,960
Right. Right.

424
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,440
Poor physical strength
also affects your studies.

425
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,440
Mr. Bai

426
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,480
will explain the details

427
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
to you later,

428
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,790
OK?

429
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,480
Alright now.

430
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,310
Don’t take this as a punishment.

431
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,440
It’s just

432
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,790
an edutainment activity.

433
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,480
Relay race

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,110
can exercise the body
and relax the mind.

435
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,680
And most importantly,

436
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,790
it’s about class honor.

437
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,830
Everyone has to take it seriously.

438
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,070
Especially the academic students.

439
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,160
Don’t think you can fool around

440
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,590
just because it’s a sport activity.

441
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
I repeat,

442
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,110
it’s about class honor.

443
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,960
Please rest assured.

444
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,030
We have Li He. We can sure

445
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,480
-win the honor.
-Yes, he is right.

446
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,980
Hey!

447
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,720
Sit down. Sit down.

448
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:57,840
Sit down.

449
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,590
Sit down.

450
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,160
Don’t show off.

451
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,510
I told you many times. Don’t show off.

452
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,960
Thank you. Thank you. That’s too much.

453
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,440
We can’t underestimate the enemy,

454
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
or we’ll lose.

455
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,640
Don’t take it lightly.

456
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,830
Let’s begin the class.

457
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,110
Let’s take a look at Unit 4.

458
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,000
Space exploration.

459
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,020
I.

460
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,720
Me.

461
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,300
I. My. Me. Mine.

462
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,450
He. His. Him.

463
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,790
She. Her. Hers.

464
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,880
I’m good, right?

465
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,110
Chief, this is English for junior high.

466
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,510
But it’s still English.

467
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,680
I’m learning it from scratch.

468
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:36,660
Chief.

469
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,550
Are you delusional from getting a card?

470
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,590
Say no more.

471
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,550
Or I’ll punch you.

472
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,960
I reluctantly agree

473
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,920
with what Chief said.

474
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,440
Gross.

475
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,590
Memorizing words?

476
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,240
As a PE student, you’re not running

477
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,350
but to study here.

478
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,550
Are you being tamed, Li He?

479
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,550
So obedient.

480
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,510
Can you still run?

481
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,310
Chuan.

482
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,200
Who was the champion of
the interschool competition last year?

483
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,960
You.

484
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,310
Me?

485
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,750
Who was the champion of
the city-level competition last year?

486
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,290
Still you.

487
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,440
Still me?

488
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:14,960
Yes.

489
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,110
Then I wonder

490
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,000
why there was no Zhang Ye

491
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,480
in the award list.

492
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,510
Even if I can’t run,

493
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,160
I can still beat you.

494
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,960
Enough with the talk.

495
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,720
Let’s compete.

496
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,680
I dare you!

497
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,030
Okay.

498
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,830
Now?

499
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,160
It’s not fun to compete between us.

500
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,160
How about the two classes?

501
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,640
What do you mean?

502
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,160
The relay race is coming.

503
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,400
If Class 2 wins Class 1,

504
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,830
I’ll call you “Dad”

505
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,830
in front of everyone.

506
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,350
But if Class 1 wins Class 2,

507
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,680
you’ll

508
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,030
have to bring me food for a week.

509
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,720
Stop.

510
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,720
I can do that for you for a month,

511
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,200
because it’s not gonna happen.

512
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,110
Also,

513
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
you’ll need to dress up as a turtle
when you do that.

514
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,110
Okay?

515
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:56,900
Do you dare?

516
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,000
Of course I do.

517
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Then don’t be a coward.

518
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,750
Okay.

519
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,720
If you win,

520
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,160
I’ll call you “Dad”.

521
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,750
If I win,

522
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,310
you dress up as a turtle
and bring food for me.

523
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,070
Okay?

524
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,160
Eat.

525
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,790
Chief.

526
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,310
Do you really compete with him?

527
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,070
This is supposed to be
a class competition.

528
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,480
We have no problem,

529
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,830
but the academic students...

530
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,270
Chief, I think we should…

531
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,790
we should…

532
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,000
What should we do?

533
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,270
Admit defeat?

534
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,350
A promise is a promise.

535
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,640
Let me tell you,

536
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,880
no matter how slow
the academic students run,

537
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,310
I can win the competition.

538
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,310
Don’t worry.

539
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,350
-Eat.
-Okay.

540
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,380
Right.

541
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,790
Ye.

542
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,270
It’s not a good bet

543
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,510
to win.

544
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,550
After all, Li He has been running faster

545
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:50,030
than you for three years.

546
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,110
You’re truly stupid.

547
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,680
It’s not between Ye and Li He,

548
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,510
but the two classes.

549
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,750
Do you understand?

550
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,270
Thanks to them,

551
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,480
the rules of the relay race
were changed.

552
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,160
The academic students
in Li He’s class

553
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,680
are always at the bottom
of every sports competition.

554
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,070
They’re weak.

555
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,200
They can’t even run.

556
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,960
At the end, we’ll win.

557
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,160
That’s right.

558
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,750
Just wait and see.

559
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,200
Li He

560
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,830
will definitely dress up as a turtle.

561
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,700
Let’s go.

562
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,790
The race is totally 800 meters.

563
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,000
Four students participate in each class,

564
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,270
and each should run 200 meters.

565
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,200
The requirement is

566
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,480
that the four students

567
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,720
must be two PE students
and two academic students,

568
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,680
and must be

569
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,110
two boys and two girls.

570
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,270
Even though only four students
can be chosen,

571
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,480
I do hope everyone

572
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,960
can participate actively

573
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:37,920
to build up your body.

574
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,400
Now stretch your muscles.

575
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
After that,

576
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
we’ll start the tryouts.

577
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:43,750
Since it’s the first time
for the academic students

578
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,510
of our class to participate
in the relay race…

579
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,070
Li He!

580
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,640
Yes!

581
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,640
-Jiang Yuan!
-Yes!

582
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,590
-Lin Chuan!
-Yes!

583
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,590
-Yun Xiang!
-Yes!

584
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,200
Come out and give us
a demonstration later.

585
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,070
Do you understand?

586
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,030
Yes!

587
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,830
Dismissed!

588
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,640
Yuan Caixi.

589
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,400
You sprained your ankle two days ago.

590
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,200
Don’t run today.

591
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,510
Stretch it for me.

592
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,070
I don’t know how to do that.

593
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,550
Easy.

594
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,440
Stretch my muscles.

595
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,160
Come.

596
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:09,750
Oh.

597
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,920
Let me do it.

598
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
Stretching is easy. Get some rest.

599
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,010
Okay.

600
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,590
Come on.

601
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,070
Put your hand on my back
and push it down.

602
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,110
Come on.

603
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,240
Li He.

604
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,310
Am I doing it right?

605
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,400
You again? So annoying.

606
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
Go away. I don’t need your help.

607
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,400
What do you mean?

608
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,350
Okay. One, two, three.

609
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
You…

610
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,590
You can’t talk and get distracted

611
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,440
while you’re stretching.

612
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,350
Okay. One, two, three.

613
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
You…

614
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,440
You’ll do a demonstration later.

615
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,640
What if you don’t run well?

616
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,310
It would be so embarrassing.

617
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:56,820
Again.

618
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,240
Come on. Hang on.

619
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,550
Sixty.

620
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,510
Sixty.

621
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,480
Sixty.

622
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,510
Sixty.

623
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,440
Sixty.

624
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,200
Sixty.

625
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,920
Sixty.

626
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,060
Sixty.

627
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,070
Sixty.

628
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,160
On your marks!

629
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,400
Ready?

630
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,110
Go for it!

631
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,830
By the Xunyang River a guest
is seen off one night.

632
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,110
Chill the autumn, red the maple leaves
and in flower the reeds.

633
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,200
The host alights from his horse,
the guest is aboard.

634
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,720
They raise their cups to drink
but have no music.

635
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,160
Drunk without joy,
in sadness they must part.

636
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,400
At the time of parting the river
seems steeped in moonlight.

637
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,240
Suddenly out on the water
a lute is heard.

638
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,640
The host forgets to turn back,
the guest delays going.

639
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,640
The host forgets to turn back,
the guest delays going.

640
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,550
Seeking the sound in the dark,
we ask who is the player.

641
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,440
The lute is silent, hesitant the reply.

642
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Rowing closer, we ask if we may
meet the musician.

643
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,880
Call for more wine, trim the lamp
and resume our feast.

644
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,440
Only after a thousand entreaties
does she appear.

645
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,920
Her face half-hidden behind the lute
in her arms.

646
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,160
She tunes up and plucks the strings
a few times.

647
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,920
Touching our hearts
before even the tune is played.

648
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,110
Li He is so great.

649
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,680
He is great.

650
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
What’s so great about him?

651
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,720
Ready?

652
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,400
So, Caixi,

653
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,550
have you felt the charm of running?

654
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,750
Now it seems that…

655
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,720
A little bit.

656
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,680
Although your grades
are better than mine,

657
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
when it comes to the playground,

658
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,310
-that is where I shine.
-Run!

659
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,640
I think you should worship me
as a teacher,

660
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,350
so that you won’t fall
and sprain your ankle.

661
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,640
Oh, right.

662
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,160
-Let me ask you a question.
-Okay.

663
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,830
Why do you like running so much?

664
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,480
Hmm…

665
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,720
Maybe

666
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
it’s the same as you like to read.

667
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,750
I feel free that way.

668
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,310
You’re right.

669
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,240
I do like to read.

670
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,400
But I just want to

671
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,720
get in a good university in finance.

672
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,000
Hey, what about you?

673
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,030
I thought you said
you wanted to be an athlete.

674
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,920
Yes.

675
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,640
It’s great to be an athlete.

676
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,510
I can run and win honor for the country.

677
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,310
It’s a win-win.

678
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,680
Don’t you ever think about

679
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,110
getting into a good university?

680
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,590
No.

681
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,480
I just want to keep running.

682
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
That won’t do.

683
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,880
You’re in your senior year.

684
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,270
You should think about it.

685
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,640
Why?

686
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,830
Are you worrying about me, Caixi?

687
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,750
Thank you. I’ll think about that.

688
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,480
I’m not worrying about you.

689
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,270
Ready?

690
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,480
Run!

691
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,720
Go for it, Han Yayi!

692
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,640
Run!

693
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,160
Everyone, assemble in the stands.

694
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,030
Drink… Where’s the water?

695
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,070
Yeah.

696
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,160
According to the test results,

697
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,510
the participants are selected.

698
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,350
Huang Yuan.

699
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,070
Dai Qing.

700
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,310
Lin Chuan.

701
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,160
Li He.

702
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
Congratulations to all four of you.

703
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,310
I hope these four students

704
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,590
can do their best

705
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,510
to compete for this honor for our class.

706
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,200
Okay?

707
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,110
Okay.

708
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
Get some rest.

709
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,240
What’s the matter?

710
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,790
How’s it going?

711
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,790
Do they stand a chance?

712
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,830
Your students are so weak.

713
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,160
The boys ran the 100 meters
in about fifteen seconds.

714
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,110
This is the passing score
for sports girls.

715
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,720
My students?

716
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,030
They’re also your students.

717
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,070
You mean we…

718
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,270
I mean they are in the same class.

719
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,880
What?

720
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,350
Am I wrong?

721
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,030
Yes.

722
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,350
Yes.

723
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,160
You’re right.

724
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,510
Let’s go.

725
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,590
Mr. Ma wants to see you.

726
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,350
What for?

727
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,440
Then

728
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,480
Lin Chuan is the first,

729
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,070
Dai Qing is the second,

730
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,000
Huang Yuan is the third

731
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,070
and I am the fourth.

732
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,960
Okay?

733
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,680
Hey!

734
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,680
Why should you decide?

735
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,270
This is a class competition.

736
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,270
We should discuss the order together.

737
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,160
Why do you have so many complaints?

738
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,790
Did he ask you?

739
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,480
Enough.

740
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,920
There’re totally four people
in the relay race.

741
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,510
In addition to the number of seconds,

742
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,920
we need to consider the explosive power,

743
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,200
the balance force when turning,

744
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,920
and the improvisational power
of each person.

745
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,270
If you have all of these,

746
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,070
go ahead.

747
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,160
Then that’s final.

748
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:11,960
Lin Chuan is the first,

749
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Dai Qing is the second.

750
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,640
Don’t worry. Chuan is in front of you.

751
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,030
Even if you run a little slower,

752
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,070
we will not be far behind.

753
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,310
I’ll try my best.

754
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,550
Huang Yuan is the third.

755
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,480
She is currently the best
among the girls.

756
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,640
And I am the fourth.

757
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,200
Don’t worry.

758
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,200
Even if you run a little slower,

759
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,160
no matter how much we fall behind,

760
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
I will catch up with them for you.

761
00:32:58,830 --> 00:32:59,790
Yuan,

762
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:01,550
do you think we can win this time?

763
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,750
I don’t know.

764
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Let’s wait and see.

765
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,400
Yuan,

766
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,000
now you talk like Miss Luo,

767
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,030
with profound philosophy.

768
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,590
Let’s go.

769
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,550
Have you got the turtle suit?

770
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,160
What? No.

771
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,750
Last time I asked you whether you wanted

772
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,240
Master Roshi
or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle,

773
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,000
you didn’t reply.

774
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,880
What were you thinking?

775
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Why would I want something so pretty?

776
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,240
Get me the ugliest one.

777
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay, I get it.

778
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,880
Don’t be nervous. Relax.

779
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,310
It doesn’t matter if you win or lose.

780
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,510
It doesn’t matter if you win or lose,

781
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,790
but if you win,
you can write less test paper.

782
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,640
Is it time to check in?

783
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Go for it!

784
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,110
Go for it!

785
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:15,880
Where’s Huang Yuan?

786
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,280
Maybe she’s in the bathroom.

787
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,630
I just got back from the restroom
and didn’t see her.

788
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,320
What?

789
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,360
Where could she go
on such an important time?

790
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,550
She got cold feet.

791
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,480
What?

792
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,590
I felt something was wrong with her
when I saw her.

793
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,110
She seemed to have a cramp in her leg.

794
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,710
But she can’t just run away like that.

795
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,960
There’s a race coming up.
What are we gonna do?

796
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,110
I’ll go.

797
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,360
I’ll replace her.

798
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,670
Stop joking.

799
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,190
You still have a foot injury

800
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,590
and you haven’t trained with us.

801
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,760
It’s too dangerous for you to run now.

802
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,110
Then what are we gonna do?

803
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,400
What’s wrong?

804
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,280
Miss Luo.

805
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,590
Huang Yuan is missing,
and Yuan wants to run for her.

806
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,590
Caixi, your foot is injured.
Don’t try to be brave.

807
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,960
I’m okay.

808
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,800
Let me have a try.

809
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,150
Chief,

810
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,110
there’s no time.

811
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,190
Right.

812
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:34,840
Fine.

813
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,480
Caixi,

814
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,590
are you really okay?

815
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,670
I have to be okay.

816
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,030
Zhao Qing, the academic student
in Class 1,

817
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,360
runs so fast.

818
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,800
She would have been a PE student

819
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,110
if her family had not objected.

820
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,030
You have a foot injury
and weren’t trained with them.

821
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,880
I’m really worried.

822
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,110
I…

823
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,480
Don’t worry.

824
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,440
Leave it to me.

825
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,280
Just try your best.

826
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,030
No matter how much we fall behind,

827
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,510
I will catch up with them for you.

828
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,960
Just be safe.

829
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,510
Dear students,

830
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,960
it’s time

831
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
for the annual class relay race.

832
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,210
(Annual Interclass Relay Race of Senior)
This competition

833
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,880
is not only to test
your physical strength,

834
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,920
but also the tacit understanding,

836
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,510
and trust between you.

I hope you

838
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
can make efforts

839
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,510
and try your best.
