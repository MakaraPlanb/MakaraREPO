Caixi, come here.

18
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,760
Something new came up again.

19
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,070
Look.

20
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,820
(Updates on the popular idol, Ye Jingxi)

21
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,660
(Ye Jingxi and a female classmate...)

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
So many photos.

23
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,590
Monitor, I just comforted you.

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,430
You hung out with him
so many times alone.

25
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,400
You didn’t even tell me?

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
Is this the right time for that?

27
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,120
The focus of the problem is this.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,800
Monitor, have you really
spent time alone with Ye Jingxi?

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,680
Definitely not.

30
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,400
Look at this one.

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
The one taken in the canteen.

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,190
There are many people around us.

33
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,750
Moreover, Han Yayi
stood right next to me.

34
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,120
Oh. Right.

35
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,470
I was there too that day.

36
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,120
Yes.

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,870
Who on earth took these photos?

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,870
Look.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
Some were taken in the canteen.

40
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,870
Some were taken on the campus.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,960
Someone is stalking you?

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
No way.

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,630
An overly obsessed fan?

44
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,280
No.

45
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,680
Bear said that his fans
are well-mannered.

46
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,280
He doesn’t have obsessive fans.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
Then who is it?

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,150
Where do these photos come from?

49
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,030
Jingxi is so careless.

50
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,030
Hurry. Find out
where these photos came from.

51
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,840
Okay. I know.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Find Ms. Bo from publicity department.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,840
Ms. Hua.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,750
Mr. Wan. Bad news!

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,520
What?

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,910
Fans went to confront the girl.

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,750
How do you know?

59
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,870
A rational fan told me that
she couldn’t stop them.

60
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,710
Explain it to the fans.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,030
It’s not like what they believe in.

62
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,080
Hurry.

63
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,190
Jingxi.

64
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,590
Jingxi.

65
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,960
(Idol Ye Jingxi’s hidden history)

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,430
This is too much.
They’re digging deeper.

67
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,150
They went through all the news
since Bear’s debut

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,520
and his family background.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
How can they not
respect a person’s privacy?

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,190
Monitor, don’t be mad.
That’s just the way haters are.

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,910
Zeyu, I’ll hang up now. I’ll call Bear.

72
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,870
Okay. Keep the contact.

73
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,400
Sir, please head to Chunxi Road
at maximum speed.

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Hurry. Now!

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,280
The number you just dialed is busy now.

76
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,380
Sorry.

77
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,360
The number you just dialed is busy now.

78
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,270
Call him later.

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
Ms. Hua might have
confiscated his phone.

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,070
Call him later.

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Caixi,

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,430
someone seems to exposed the incident of

83
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,920
Ye Jingxi moving house
when he was a kid.

84
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,600
According to insider information,

85
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,310
the girl in the photo is
Ye Jingxi’s childhood sweetheart.

86
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,070
They knew each other
since primary school.

87
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,870
It’s unknown whether she was involved in
the accident that caused

88
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,240
Ye Jingxi to move house at Grade 3.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
Who said this?

90
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,070
Okay.

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,310
Don’t be mad.

92
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,510
There are many stories on the internet.

93
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,600
Everyone has their own opinions.

94
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,720
It can’t be Ye Jingxi
who told the story.

95
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,390
There were many people
present at that time.

96
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,720
Maybe someone accidentally leaked it.

97
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,630
Hello, Bawan, what’s going on?

98
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,750
Monitor, is Jingxi with you?

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,800
No.

100
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,430
Monitor, when Jingxi contacts you,

101
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,430
you must tell me immediately.

102
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,600
I’m afraid he...

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,270
He...

104
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,870
Wait. What? Just tell me.

105
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,000
His fans went to your house
to confront you.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,800
He might have rushed there to stop them.

107
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,160
Okay, I see.

108
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,580
Let’s go.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,750
What?

110
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,560
Let’s go home.

111
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,390
It’s too dangerous to go home now.

112
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,510
Bear knew that
my home address has been leaked.

113
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,600
He’s heading towards my home.

114
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,270
It’ll be disastrous
if he meets his fans.

115
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,020
Then...

116
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,430
Then what should we do?

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,950
Come. Let’s go.

118
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,480
Ah! These two.

119
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Your clothes.

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
It’s her.
She’s using Jingxi to gain attention.

121
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,510
That’s her.

122
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
I’m here.

123
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,390
Jingxi.

124
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
-Are you all right?
-I’m fine.

125
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
Hurry. Let’s go.

126
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,120
Have some water first.

127
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,750
Thanks.

128
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,360
I found it.

129
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Disinfect it first.

130
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:33,750
Li He.

131
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,070
Do you know how to do it?

132
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,600
I get injuries everyday
because of running.

133
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Of course, I know.

134
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,040
Hurry.

135
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,480
It’ll hurt a bit. Tell me if it does.

136
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,310
Hum.

137
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,040
Does it hurt?

138
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,630
I’ll be gentler.

139
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,140
Okay.

140
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,630
Fine.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,840
Try to bear it.

142
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,030
Okay.

143
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,440
What?

144
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,910
Thank you.

145
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,150
You don’t need to thank me.

146
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,750
It’s what I should do.

147
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,910
I really don’t understand the fans

148
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
we met today.

149
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,960
Why don’t they join the track team?

150
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,670
They’re strong and fast.

151
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,600
They pushed me today.

152
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,320
I felt that I was bleeding inside.

153
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,910
Ah!

154
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,480
How’s Bear doing?

155
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,440
Don’t worry.

156
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,440
Those fans

157
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,790
can’t catch him.

158
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,870
Even if they do,

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,120
they won’t do anything to him.

160
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,030
I hope so.

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
Anyway,

162
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,600
those fans are too destructive.

163
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,870
They’re so strong.

164
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,600
You sleeve...!

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,670
Today, I really...

166
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,120
Gush.

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,790
But I’m not worried about his fans.

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,200
I’m worried about what will happen

169
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,960
when he returns to his agency.

170
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,910
It’s from Bear.

171
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,790
Yuan.

172
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,750
I’m sorry for causing
all this trouble to you.

173
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,080
But please trust me.

174
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,840
I’ll take care of it.

175
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,960
The number you just dialed is busy now.

176
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
Please redial later.

177
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,670
Call him later.

178
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:38,750
He will contact us

179
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,600
when he’s handled it.

180
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,360
He asked you to trust him, didn’t he?

181
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,030
Okay.

182
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,870
I hope this incident can be over soon.

183
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,120
(Zeyu)
Ning Zeyu.

184
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,200
Zeyu.

185
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,390
Hello, Zeyu.

186
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,320
How’s everything going on?

187
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,550
Are you all right?

188
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,630
Yes.

189
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,910
We’re home now.

190
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,140
Okay.

191
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,200
As long as you’re safe.

192
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
Don’t think too much.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Go to bed early.

194
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,480
Yes.

195
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,480
Okay.

196
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,240
Jingxi.

197
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
I’ll be back in ten minutes.

198
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Ms. Hua fainted.

199
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,390
She’s in the hospital now.

200
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,510
What?

201
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
Come here and take a look.

202
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,390
I’ll come right away.

203
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,630
Sir, please head to the hospital.

204
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,480
Right now.

205
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,720
How’s it?

206
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,960
Listen to the doctor.

207
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,750
Ms. Yan fainted because of fatigue,

208
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,030
low blood sugar, and low blood pressure.

209
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,960
They all hit so suddenly.
That’s why she fainted.

210
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,240
She’ll be fine in a few days.

211
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,440
Does she need
some nutrition supplements, or...?

212
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,630
Don’t worry.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,480
Just let the patient take more rest.

214
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
-Thank you, doctor.
-Thanks, doctor.

215
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,080
Don’t worry.

216
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,200
I’ll take a look inside.

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,270
Let her rest.

218
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,110
I...

219
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,630
I’ll just take a look.
I won’t bother her.

220
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,670
Let her rest.

221
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,440
Are you mad?

222
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,840
Let me pass.

223
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,630
I can explain.

224
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,200
Jingxi,

225
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,550
it’s too late now.

226
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,600
Let me drive you home.

227
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,440
It’s not that serious, right?

228
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,630
I can explain.

229
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,270
Jingxi,

230
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,150
have you seen the trending topics?

231
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,440
You went to find her
amid this huge scandal.

232
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,630
You want the affair to get more severe?

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,240
The agency can handle it.

234
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,870
I know your classmates
are important to you.

235
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,200
Yuan Caixi is even more important.

236
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,390
But you can’t always be so capricious.

237
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:15,960
Go back, Jingxi.

238
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,360
I’ll take you home.

239
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,840
Ms. Hua.

240
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,550
It’s my fault.

241
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,120
I’m sorry.

242
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,840
Take some rest.

243
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,360
I’ll go to bed.

244
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,240
Me too.

245
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,150
Let’s go to bed.

246
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,660
You...

247
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,390
You’re not leaving?

248
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,030
Let’s go.

249
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,470
Come on.

250
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,550
-Caixi. Caixi. Caixi.
-You...

251
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,630
This... this is my room.

252
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
I’ve thought about it.

253
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,200
When disaster struck,
help came from all sides

254
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,840
Besides, we’re classmates.

255
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,360
He and I are

256
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,390
excellent new-generation men.

257
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,000
It’s our responsibility
to keep you safe.

258
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,240
So, tonight,

259
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,630
we’ll sleep here.

260
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,080
Fine.

261
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,840
I can also protect her if I sleep there.

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,910
Yuan.

263
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,030
Don’t be angry if I tell you this.

264
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,720
So many girls are willing to
be put in your position.

265
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,600
Do you know that?

266
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,600
You were besieged by fans.

267
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,910
Jingxi used himself as the bait
to distract them.

268
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,750
And Li He escorted you home.

269
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,320
Is there anything that’s more romantic?

270
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:37,960
Is there?

271
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,600
Answer me!

272
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,270
Han Yayi,

273
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,910
you won’t even comfort me
when I’m injured?

274
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,000
Yuan.

275
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
I’m injured as well.

276
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
Can’t you see?

277
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
My heart is aching.

278
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,870
Yuan.

279
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,380
Fine.

280
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,510
-I’m injured too.
-Keep aching. Bye.

281
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,440
Wait. Wait. Wait.

282
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I’m sorry, Yuan.

283
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,630
I’m sorry.

284
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,670
Yuan. Yuan.

285
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,630
Seriously,

286
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,360
this news came out of nowhere.

287
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,910
The photos don’t
show the girl’s face.

288
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,440
But...

289
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,240
But classmates all know it’s me.

290
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes.

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,750
Which heartless person
took those photos?

292
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,910
Who is this heartless person

293
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,120
that’s still unaware of what she did?

294
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,200
I...

295
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,440
I just don’t get it.

296
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,080
Why are there suddenly so much gossip?

297
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,360
Where do these photos come from?

298
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,960
Stop wasting your energy.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,840
If even you

300
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,440
can figure it out,

301
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,360
then, it’s weird.

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,030
Let’s talk tomorrow.

303
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,300
Me...?

304
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,120
Yep.

305
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,640
What did I do?

306
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,480
Come on, Han Yayi.

307
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,270
Why aren’t you a bit smarter

308
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,640
after being with me for three years?

309
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,590
If you have time,

310
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,480
go through those photos again.

311
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,720
One of them was taken by you.

312
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,400
Me?

313
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,350
How’s that possible?

314
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,070
Well. Some of them
were taken by others.

315
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,240
Look.

316
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,350
Your sister also said that

317
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,440
they’ve never spent time alone.

318
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
So those photos were edited.

319
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,830
The key question is...

320
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,550
Where do they come from, right?

321
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,200
Take a look at your classmates’ Qzones.

322
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
These photos were all taken from

323
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,880
our classmates’ Qzones.

324
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,030
The other classmates were edited out.

325
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,350
But my sister’s face was also blurred.

326
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,640
It seems that my sister is protected.

327
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,270
The paparazzi
isn’t completely heartless.

328
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,830
He tried to protect high school students

329
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,680
Paparazzi want to protect you?

330
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,110
I know it.

331
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,000
In this case,

332
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,590
the one who stole these photos

333
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,880
didn’t intend to put monitor in trouble.

334
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,030
This person might be someone

335
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,030
who’s close to us.

336
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,440
Yes!

337
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,880
I guess

338
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
this person just wants to

339
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,960
collect your photos, edit them,

340
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,920
and post them on the internet
for attention.

341
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,200
But it’s hard to guess

342
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,270
how they end up
in the hands of paparazzi.

343
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,240
Good job, Yuan.

344
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,240
You have my utmost respect.

345
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,440
But,

346
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,070
at this point,

347
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,750
do you know who the culprit is?

348
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,030
Who is he?

349
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,880
Well done, Li He.

350
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,310
You’re not completely brainless.

351
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Go to sleep first.

352
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,480
Ouch. My hand.

353
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,750
To be honest,

354
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,720
I did guess it.

355
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,440
But I don’t want to say it now.

356
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,880
Is he...

357
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,270
Someone we know...?

358
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,240
Our classmate...?

359
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,960
I’ll confirm it when I find the chance.

360
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,200
I’ll tell you

361
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,960
once I’m certain.

362
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,240
Okay.

363
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,030
Then, you must tell me.

364
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,880
Oh! Yuan, are you safe

365
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,200
in your house now?
Why not sleep at my place?

366
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
It’s fine. Don’t worry about me.

367
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,000
Fans have left already.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,720
Besides, I’ve got Yuan Haoxi.

369
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,480
Moreover, Li He

370
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,880
is here today.

371
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,590
What?

372
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,680
He’s still there?

373
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,550
He hasn’t left?

374
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,510
Where is he sleeping at?

375
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,790
Han Yayi.

376
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,030
This is all you care about?

377
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,350
Don’t you feel touched by

378
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,070
what he did for you?

379
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,110
I’m indeed touched.

380
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,720
If it weren’t for him today,

381
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,400
I really wouldn’t know what to do.

382
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,550
Well.

383
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,030
Besides feeling touched?

384
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,270
Wow. It’s so late. It’s time to sleep.

385
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,750
Hello? Yuan.

386
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,790
Why are you sleepy when we talk about
the most important question?

387
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,830
Okay. Fine.

388
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,110
Why aren’t you so interested in study?

389
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,750
Bye.

390
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,340
(In-Patient)

391
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,480
Notice the media.
Hold a press conference.

392
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,790
Ye Jingxi will

393
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:12,720
explain everything.

394
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,240
And he will also...

395
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,960
Is that still necessary?
Ye Jingxi is livestreaming.

396
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
Livestream.

397
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,160
To my friends who care about me,

398
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,750
thank you for your concern.

399
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,400
My personal life took up

400
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,030
public media resources,

401
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,440
I’m really sorry.

402
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
From the beginning,

403
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,640
I’ve been really grateful to
those who like me.

404
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,110
It’s all my fault that

405
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,720
such things happened.

406
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,240
I’m sorry for

407
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,550
not being discreet enough.

408
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
It’s my fault.

409
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,790
I also let down

410
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,310
my agency’s trust and support.

411
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,790
My dear fans.

412
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,110
My colleagues.

413
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,680
I’m sorry.

414
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,790
Besides apologizing,

415
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,270
I beg you not to disturb my classmates,

416
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,440
my friends.

417
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,510
They’re my good friends
who genuinely care about me.

418
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,240
The photos that are spreading
on the internet

419
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,400
have all been photoshopped.

420
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,030
My agency and I

421
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,110
will definitely find the source
of those edited photos

422
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,000
and defend our rights
by taking legal measures.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,720
In the end.

424
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,480
My fellows.

425
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,640
My friends.

426
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,310
Monitor.

427
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,240
The straight-A student.

428
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,790
The world champion.

429
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,480
I’m so sorry.

430
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,070
Ms. Hua.

431
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,590
I’m so sorry for

432
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,070
letting you down.

433
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,640
I’ll learn to grow up.

434
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,240
I’ll be a wise person

435
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,000
who knows how to care for others.

436
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,160
Please, trust me.

437
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,880
I’ll handle this incident the right way.

438
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,070
From now on,

439
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,590
I’ll learn how to make music.

440
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,550
I hope you can like the me

441
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,350
who’s focused on producing music.

442
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:33,920
Thanks.

443
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,550
I asked him to go abroad and act.

444
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,590
But he insisted on learning music.

445
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,510
Jingxi has a tough life as a star.

446
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,240
He’s the person I remember him to be.

447
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,030
I’m almost his fan now.

448
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,310
Let me peal the egg shell for you.

449
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,550
What are you doing? Go head.

450
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,030
My neck is hurting.

451
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,000
Really?

452
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,750
I stayed in the same position

453
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
for a night.

454
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,310
A message from Bear.

455
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,880
(Bear)
We found out who leaked the photos.

456
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,240
I’ll send you the evidence.

457
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,350
It’s really him.

458
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,960
I suspected him too.

459
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:50,920
But then I thought we are classmates.
How could he?

460
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,310
Zeyu.

461
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,030
We know who posted the photos.

462
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes. I guessed it too.

463
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,790
But now we have

464
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,030
another matter to take care of.

465
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,920
What?

466
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,440
Haven’t we already found the guy?

467
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:09,160
But the point is he’s not the one
who posted those photos.

468
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,550
We need the poster to delete photos
or explain everything

469
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,920
so as to fix this problem
once and for all.

470
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,790
That’s right.

471
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,480
After all, Bear did so much.

472
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,790
We need to do something as well.

473
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,350
What should we do now?

474
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,510
I’ve found his personal email address

475
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,790
through his IP address.

476
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,240
But, I just don’t know
how to ask him out.

477
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,200
That’s simple.

478
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,480
I guess

479
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,440
you’re waiting for us.

480
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,070
You asked the wrong person.

481
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,400
-I’m here to meet...
-That’s right.

482
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,960
That’s us.

483
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,160
I’m the one

484
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,240
who claimed to have more photos
of Ye Jingxi,

485
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,640
sent you an email, and asked you out.

486
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,000
Don’t go, sir.

487
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,720
Let’s talk.

488
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,880
Do you know the consequences
of your behavior?

489
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,480
You used edited photos to

490
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,720
cook up rumors and
slander a person on the internet.

491
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,510
If Ye Jingxi’s agency wants to
hold you accountable,

492
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,480
you not only have to delete photos,
apologize publicly,

493
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,030
but also have to compensate the damages.

494
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,350
So, we suggest that

495
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,440
you immediately delete the posts,

496
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
issue an apology letter,
and restore the truth.

497
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Otherwise, we’ll hand over
all your information

498
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,920
to Ye Jingxi’s agency.

499
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,680
They’ll teach you what to do.

500
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,480
Pan Hao.

501
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,750
What?

502
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,110
You came here by the request of monitor.

503
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,720
But you’re gonna flee when you see me?

504
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,510
Why?

505
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,350
What?

506
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,270
I don’t understand what you’re saying.

507
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,030
Stop pretending, bro.

508
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,720
I know you’re not that bad.

509
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Otherwise,
you wouldn’t edit Yuan’s face.

510
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,240
Tell me.

511
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,270
What on earth happened?

512
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,350
You didn’t intend to
spread the rumors, right?

513
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,720
I told you. I don’t understand
what you’re saying.

514
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Fine.

515
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,030
I’ll report it to the school.

516
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
No.

517
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,160
Please, no.

518
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,030
You’re allowed to post my photos?

519
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,590
I won’t be lying if I tell others

520
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,510
that you posted those photos.

521
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,510
Why can’t I?

522
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,270
I didn’t do it on purpose.

523
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,960
Once,

524
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,680
I posted a photo of you surrounded
by classmates in the store.

525
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,830
They were all buying water for you.

526
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,310
I said you were putting on airs.

527
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,720
Then your fans started to curse me.

528
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,240
I just said that in the moment of anger.

529
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Then you sent my photos

530
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,640
to paparazzi?

531
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,550
No, I didn’t.

532
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,640
They did ask me for your photos.

533
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,240
I declined.

534
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,550
But he threatened me.

535
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,550
He said he’d tell my classmates
that I hated on you.

536
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,680
I’m afraid that
my classmates might find out.

537
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,110
I had no other options.

538
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,510
He asked me to

539
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,510
give him that account.

540
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,400
So many people were cursing me.

541
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,160
I don’t want that account anyway.

542
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,830
So I agreed.

543
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,270
Then, how did the paparazzi

544
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,920
have so many more photos?

545
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,240
At that time, he gave me a website

546
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,000
and asked me to fill in
my account and password.

547
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,550
I didn’t think too much.

548
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,270
Once I did it,

549
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,400
my phone...

550
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,790
My phone was hacked.

551
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,920
And the photos in it

552
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,200
as well as my QQ account
were all hacked.

553
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,000
I panicked.

554
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,440
I threatened him.

555
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,160
I said I would expose him.

556
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,200
He said if I dare to make it public,

557
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,680
he would tell others that

558
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,000
I sent him the photos.

559
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,550
I didn’t mean it.

560
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,790
I didn’t expect things to
take such a drastic turn.

561
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,440
Actually, I’m here to apologize.

562
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,830
It’s not too late to apologize.

563
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,070
(Bear)

564
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,720
Monitor always knew it’s you.

565
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,680
But she didn’t say it.

566
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,590
Pan Hao.

567
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,550
We only know each other for a semester.

568
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
I’m not close to you.

569
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,510
You played pranks on me in Grade 2.

570
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
Did I?

571
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,590
I don’t remember.

572
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,160
You’re the chief at South Campus.

573
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,440
How can you remember anyone?

574
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,590
Of course.

575
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,510
No one notices me
ever since I was a kid,

576
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
not even my parents.

577
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:16,310
They like to compare me to others
ever since I was a child.

578
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,110
They say I’m worthless.

579
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,510
So I studied so hard

580
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,550
and made it into Sen Yong.

581
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,440
I think that’s

582
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,960
the only thing I’m proud of.

583
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,880
But when I’m in high school,

584
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,000
there are Zeyu and monitor

585
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,400
in the class.

586
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,830
The others can only see them.

587
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Then, later,

588
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,790
you athletic students came to the class.

589
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,030
I just don’t get it.

590
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,480
You’re not good at study.
You’re troublesome.

591
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,640
But more and more people like you.

592
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,640
Later,

593
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,200
you came here.

594
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,400
You’re the only people
others care about.

595
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,480
-Who can notice you, right?
-Who can notice...?

596
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,590
Right?

597
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,920
I think Yuan can take care of

598
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,000
the paparazzi.

599
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,590
As for you,

600
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,240
I think you’ve learned your lesson.

601
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,590
So...

602
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,240
You forgave me?

603
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,640
When I chose to be an artist,

604
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,070
I wished to be noticed by more people.

605
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,550
I understand how you feel.

606
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,720
But I wish, you can fight for the things

607
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,160
you want with your own strength,

608
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,790
as opposed to
taking advantage of others.

609
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,350
Monitor.

610
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,440
I’m sorry.

611
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,440
How about me?

612
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,790
Ye Jingxi,

613
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,830
I’m sorry.

614
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,640
Yes. Don’t breach the contract.

615
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,240
Let him contact our lawyers.

616
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,480
Why me?

617
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,720
Pan Hao, how many times I’ve told you.

618
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,110
You must behave at school.

619
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,160
How about you?

620
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,510
You caused so much trouble.

621
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,640
Your dad and I were supposed to
go on a business trip last night.

622
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,510
We had to change our flight for you.

623
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,680
Don’t you know how it affected our work?

624
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,480
What? He needs to be transferred
to another school?

625
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,550
Well.

626
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
This incident indeed has
a bad influence.

627
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,240
It’s not a big deal.

628
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,400
If this isn’t the right school for Hao,

629
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,590
let’s just transfer him.

630
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,830
Are there any due procedures?

631
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:57,640
I’m in a hurry.

632
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,160
Today...

633
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,440
Even if you’re in a hurry...

634
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,310
Hello?

635
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,960
This is your son.

636
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,880
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

637
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,440
His father is really...

638
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,550
I know he didn’t do it

639
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,590
on purpose.

640
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
However,

641
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,480
considering that

642
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,270
Hao’s study will be affected

643
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,960
if the other students find out,

644
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,030
so, we invite you here for a talk

645
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,880
to decide if you can agree
to transfer him.

646
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,920
Mr. Ma.

647
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,200
Principal.

648
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,070
Let me be transferred to another school.

649
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,640
Miss, you have a good taste.

650
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,310
This is the bestseller in our store.

651
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,830
This bracelet means a sweet secret.

652
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,510
It might bring good luck.

653
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,920
Really? I’ll take this then.

654
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Okay. Here’s the checkout counter.

655
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,350
Do you need me to wrap it for you?

656
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,640
No, I can just wear it.

657
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Maybe I’ll have good luck
the moment I leave the store.

658
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
Sir, are you buying present
for your friend?

659
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,150
Yes.

660
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,360
This little crown is good.

661
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,030
It’s cute.
Girls all want to be princesses.

662
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,510
She might not want to be a princess.

663
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,670
She just want to be the No.1.

664
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,590
Wow.

665
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:28,000
Your friend is good at study.

666
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,510
She’s forever the first place
in my heart.

667
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,400
Wrap it for me.

668
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,280
Okay.

669
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,280
(Yuan Caixi)
Zeyu, when will you come back?

670
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,710
This afternoon.

671
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,230
Okay.

672
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,550
Come to Bear’s house. Let’s celebrate.

673
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,920
He said he wants to thank us.

674
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,800
Okay. See you later.

675
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,440
Well.

676
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,110
Why isn’t me who’s in the kitchen now?

677
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,960
Because the person who’s in the kitchen

678
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,480
believes that she cooks better than us.

679
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,000
So, we’re so obedient?

680
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,070
Yes.

681
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,320
Don’t try to disobey her.

682
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,360
Dare we disobey Yuan?

683
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,510
No.

684
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,110
Well.

685
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,320
Monitor.

686
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,830
Huh.

687
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,030
Do you need my help?

688
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
No. I can do it myself.

689
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,030
I always cook for Yuan Haoxi at home.

690
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,590
Look.

691
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,400
What I just told you?

692
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,590
Aren’t you afraid that
she’d bomb your kitchen?

693
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,000
It’s not that bad?

694
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:33,960
Right?

695
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,150
Are you all right, monitor?

696
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,150
-I’m fine. Fine.
-Let me help you.

697
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,000
No. Sit down.

698
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,480
Listen. The outcome is what’s important.

699
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,480
Don’t mind the process.

700
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,760
Ah. Ning Zeyu has arrived.

701
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,550
For all these years, you’ve never had

702
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,480
the chance to laugh at monitor.

703
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,760
Here comes the chance.

704
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,440
She’s cooking.

705
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,190
What? She’s not good at it.

706
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,150
It’s more than that.

707
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,190
Yuan Haoxi told me that

708
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,960
her cooking is horrid.

709
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,110
Horrid?

710
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:28,960
Ah! That’s not right.

711
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,590
Resident Evil style.

712
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,630
It’s done.

713
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,630
My mom is looking for me.
I’ll go home now.

714
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,320
Yes. I need to do work out.

715
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,670
Bawan wants me for work.

716
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,360
Freeze.

717
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,440
What’s wrong with you?

718
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,920
You’re leaving when
I’ve just finished cooking?

719
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,510
Don’t you know that this curry beef stew

720
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,960
is the feast I cooked specially for you.

721
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,550
-If you won’t eat it, tell me earlier.
-Curry beef stew?

722
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,360
I thought this is black sesame paste.

723
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,320
Fine. Just go if you don’t want it.

724
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,590
We’ll eat it.

725
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,710
Let’s eat it.

726
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,110
Of course, we will.

727
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,620
Let’s eat it.

728
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,150
Well.

729
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,840
How about...?

730
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,760
-Ye Jingxi eats first.
-Come on.

731
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,600
-Have a try first.
-Bear.

732
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Have a taste first.

733
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,280
Me... ?

734
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,070
Let me help you.

735
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,630
Have a taste.

736
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,590
Wait. Yuan.

737
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,320
A cook must taste the dish first, right?

738
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,710
Have a try first.

739
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,960
Fine.

740
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,230
This... this...

741
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,280
This is not right.

742
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,760
I followed the recipe!

743
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,840
Why does it taste like this?

744
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,230
Monitor.

745
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,550
Cooking needs talent.

746
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,360
You might just not be talented in it.

747
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,000
Yes.

748
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,110
Let’s eat something else.

749
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:19,920
I’m hungry.

750
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,190
You must all be hungry. Are you?

751
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,480
Are you hungry?

752
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,630
Are you?

753
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,880
Yes.

754
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,510
Great.

755
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,440
Have you finished?

756
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,630
Almost.

757
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,480
Let’s go play a round.

758
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,190
Let’s go.

759
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,590
Come on.

760
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,000
Let’s go.

761
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,920
These two...

762
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,070
Oh. Zeyu.

763
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
How’s your training?

764
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,760
You must have learned a lot?

765
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,630
Yes.

766
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,880
Indeed. This time, I’ve learned that

767
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,360
there are people who’re more talented.

768
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,760
That’s true.

769
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,440
But this time, I...

770
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,320
Especially from this incident.

771
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,840
I used to care about nothing
in the past.

772
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,760
My biggest worry is how to beat you

773
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,590
and become No.1.

774
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,710
But Pan Hao’s incident
made me understand that

775
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,670
every one of us

776
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,800
has our own worries.

777
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,000
This has indeed taught me something.

778
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,670
That’s true.

779
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,150
-But...
-Well.

780
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,550
For the three years
we spent in the same class,

781
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,510
I’ve never found out that

782
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,480
Pan Hao wants attention so badly.

783
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,000
As a monitor,

784
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,510
I paid no heed to it.

785
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,440
If we care for him more,

786
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
he might not do those things.

787
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,190
Right?

788
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,670
Yes.
