17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,230
Be careful. Be careful.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,350
Yuan?

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,710
Are you feeling better?

20
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,120
Thanks to you, she kept throwing up.

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,070
What do you mean thanks to me?

22
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,710
I didn’t know my pizza was spoiled.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,070
Besides,

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
I suffered as much, all right?

25
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,590
Be careful next time.
Clean out your fridge

26
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,230
and don’t eat expired food anymore.

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you hear him, Bawan?

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,790
I’m telling you.

29
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,510
Ye Jingxi.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,070
Yes?

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,310
In fact,

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,910
Ms. Hua sent us.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,590
Ye Jingxi.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,630
Call me Bear.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,520
Bear.

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,800
Mm.

37
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,960
Perhaps,

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,280
we were thinking too simply,

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,590
without considering the consequence.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,840
So,

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,910
you must listen to Ms. Hua.

42
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,800
Do whatever she asks you to,

43
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,280
and don’t try to resist. Got it?

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,150
I see.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
You’re now working for my company, too?

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,870
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,590
We’re serious.

48
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,680
At first,

49
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
I thought

50
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
you loved to snub,

51
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,630
simply because you were a star.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,870
But now,

53
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,870
I know life isn’t easy for you, either.

54
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,470
Work hard. I think highly of you.

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,750
Humph.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,630
Humph?

57
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,520
What?

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
Bed No.1, time for injection.

59
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh.

60
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,910
I’ll get the injection.

61
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,400
Injection? Oh, yes. I’ll leave.

62
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,710
Why don’t you leave?

63
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,800
We’re all men. Why are you embarrassed?

64
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,560
We’re not your fans.
We won’t take photos of you.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Be quick. Take off your pants.

66
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,680
Turn around.

67
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,590
Nurse, give him the injection carefully.

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,030
Thank you.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,310
He has fair skin.

70
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,590
Press it.

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,840
Thank you. Thank you.

72
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,000
Well,

73
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,870
you have a good shape.

74
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,030
See? I trained him.

75
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,680
I don’t think he looks stronger than me.

76
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,800
What?

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,030
You’ve got a good shape, too?

78
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,680
Why not take off your clothes
and compete with him?

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,430
How do you feel now?

80
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,400
Any better?

81
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,590
Though you two

82
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,470
have seen

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,840
my hips,

84
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,630
it doesn’t mean

85
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,750
you can threaten me.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,630
How do you know
we didn’t take photos of you?

87
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,480
How dare you!

88
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,160
Why don’t we dare?

89
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:25,830
Be careful.

90
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,950
This time...

91
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,390
Mm?

92
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,800
I’m grateful to you.

93
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,510
But,

94
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,390
as for Yuan...

95
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,560
I know what you mean.

96
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,600
All right.

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
I’ll get to the point, then.

98
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,270
I know you always stop me

99
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,680
from staying with Yuan alone.

100
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,270
Yes.

101
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,310
I admit that.

102
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,000
You’re straightforward.

103
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,750
I also know that

104
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,240
you help me with study

105
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,160
so that you can keep an eye on me.

106
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,830
Time’s limited. Get to the point.

107
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,920
The point is

108
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,750
I like Yuan Caixi.

109
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,680
So do I.

110
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,480
I’m sorry,

111
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,480
but I love her most.

112
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,070
I grew up with her.

113
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,430
She and I have a lot in common.

114
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,800
No offense,

115
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,720
but I carried her on my back, hugged her,
and carried her on my shoulder.

116
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,480
What are you doing?

117
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,120
When I count from three to one,

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,420
-let go of me! Do you hear me?
-You’re not convinced?

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,750
Three, two, one.

120
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,430
It hurts! It hurts!

121
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,510
What? You get cocky, huh?

122
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,800
I’m a patient.

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,310
I’m still lying in bed.

124
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,920
You’re a patient, so what?

125
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
I just got an inspection. Let go of me.

126
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,430
You weak men,
what do you want to do?

127
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,720
Fight against me?

128
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,750
You know what?

129
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,750
Even if you fight me together,
you can’t hurt me.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,920
If you’re not convinced, hold it in!

131
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,070
Li He,

132
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,270
you must understand.

133
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,920
Even you hugged her,
carried her on your back and shoulder,

134
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,070
that was because she was poisoned, hurt

135
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,240
and got stuck in fire.

136
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,830
Don’t take that seriously.

137
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,390
Even if you and she
have a lot in common,

138
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,240
she and I have common memories, too.

139
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,310
Get your hands off me!

140
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,390
You’re both unconvinced, right?

141
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,680
How can you two

142
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
make her feel safe?

143
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,190
Ah?

144
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,630
If you’re unconvinced,

145
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,120
compete with me like a man does.

146
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,630
Okay.

147
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,120
Come on.

148
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,680
Come on. I must compete with you today.

149
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,430
Come on.

150
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,600
Get off the bed.

151
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Show me what you can do.

152
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,160
Childish boys.

153
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,240
Stand there.

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:05,830
What shall we compete?

155
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,480
Arm wrestling.

156
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,750
-Come on.
-Come on.

157
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,190
Wait.

158
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,870
Finished?

159
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,120
We’re worried about you.

160
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,160
Jingxi, have a good rest
and get well soon.

161
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,680
We can’t do without you.

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,270
Yes, yes.

163
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,660
It’s okay. It’s okay.

164
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,720
-Are you alright now?
-Yes.

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,310
Drink more hot water.

166
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,750
Why is he standing already?

167
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,160
I’m going back tomorrow.

168
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,600
-So early? Don’t be in a hurry.
-Not early.

169
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,950
All right, you two.

170
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,600
Let him have some rest.

171
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,480
We should leave now.

172
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,390
-You’re right.
-Yes.

173
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,310
Be quick. Have some rest.

174
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,310
Lie down in bed.

175
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,040
Have some rest.

176
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Be gentle. Be gentle.

177
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,240
Don’t catch a cold again.

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,750
-You finally get better.
-Tuck the quilt.

179
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,430
Remember to drink more hot water.

180
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
Get your face in, too.

181
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,480
-We’ll wait for you.
-Bye-bye.

182
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,510
-Have some good rest.
-He knows. Don’t worry.

183
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,000
I haven’t finished yet.

184
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,160
Bye-bye, Yuan.

185
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,120
Looks like Ms. Hua worries
for a right reason.

186
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,630
We should consider the consequence.

187
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,240
Yeah.

188
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,920
Let’s get back home first.

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,310
Li He,

190
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,680
what’s bothering your little mind?

191
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,430
I’m thinking that

192
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,510
Ms. Hua made a sense today.

193
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,870
Ye Jingxi is nearly of our age,

194
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,750
but he has to bear so much.

195
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,720
Come on.

196
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,430
Whose little mind do you mean?

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,830
Ye Jingxi is nearly of our age,

198
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,160
but he’s decided his future long ago.

199
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,270
When he does what he wants,

200
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,430
he has to bear a lot.

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,480
You’re right.

202
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,950
What about you?

203
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,750
Do your parents know

204
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,160
you like programming?

205
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,600
Even if they do, they won’t support me.

206
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,000
What’re you going to do, then?

207
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,390
No idea.

208
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,270
If only I could do what I want

209
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,870
like you and Ye Jingxi do!

210
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,720
If someone were as smart as you,
he could do everything.

211
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,830
But I’m confused.

212
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,000
Why do your parents force you

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
to be a lawyer?

214
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,480
Thanks for the compliment, Li He.

215
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,240
My parents always want me

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
to live my life as they have planned.

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,040
No deviation is allowed.

218
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,950
Don’t bother about me.
Let’s talk about you.

219
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,680
Running is good.
What’s your plan for the future?

220
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,430
I made a deal

221
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
with Lin Chuan and other teammates that

222
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
we’ll keep running

223
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,630
in Haiwen Sport University.

224
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,360
Haiwen Sport University?

225
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:35,960
Yep.

226
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,870
You’re doing better in study now.

227
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,750
You can have better choices, can’t you?

228
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
I don’t care
which university I’ll study in

229
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,510
as long as I can keep running.

230
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,080
You should at least
have a plan for running.

231
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,550
Don’t you want to study
in a better university?

232
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,630
Come on.

233
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,120
Do all good students like you
talk like that?

234
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,550
Monitor said something similar.

235
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,910
Maybe she and I think alike.

236
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
No way.

237
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,270
She cares about me.
It’s none of your business.

238
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,870
Then you should think
more carefully about it.

239
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,440
Don’t let her down.

240
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,080
Don’t worry.
I’ll think carefully about it.

241
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,600
You’d better care more about yourself.

242
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,600
Why are you coming back so late?

243
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh.

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,550
I’m back late for some reason.

245
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,720
Mom, what’re you doing in my room?

246
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,910
I’m folding your clothes.

247
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,240
Were you going through my stuff?

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
I wasn’t.

249
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,960
I had planned to clean your desk.

250
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
What are you talking about?

251
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,720
By the way,

252
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
today is Sunday.

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,030
Where have you been,

254
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,870
instead of studying at home?

255
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,000
I...

256
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,150
I was with friends.

257
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,790
Friends?

258
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Why are you wasting your time with friends
at such a critical moment?

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,440
Are you getting close to Li He lately?

260
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,840
He’s a PE student.

261
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,600
It’s okay
if he doesn’t do well in study.

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,200
But you’re different.

263
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
It’s not true.

264
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,120
He’s studying very hard, too.

265
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,200
How dare you talk back!

266
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,390
This is a very critical moment for you.

267
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,030
You can’t even waste one single second.

268
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,840
But you keep playing around every day.

269
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,240
Can you bear with the consequence?

270
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,200
I can.

271
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,630
I take responsibility for myself.

272
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,270
You!

273
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
How can you take responsibility?

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,200
How can you do that as a student?

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,720
Do you know what you’re talking about?

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,790
I do.

277
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,150
Zeyu, don’t always
get close to PE students

278
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,200
in case they mislead you.
Do you hear me?

279
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
What a boy!

You’re looking at the notice

and the application form.

288
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,550
Discuss with your families

289
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,720
about how to fill the form,

290
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,870
though it’s only for reference.

291
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,120
You can take the chance

292
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,670
to talk with your parents

293
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,550
about your development
after graduation.

294
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,000

296
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,270
Yuan,

297
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,720
how I envy you!

298
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,630
You’re good enough to be admitted
to Beikai University, right?

299
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,910
Don’t make fun of me.

300
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,240
What about you?
Which university do you want to go?

301
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,870
In fact,

302
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,910
I want to go to Zhongzhen.

303
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,630
Zhongzhen?

304
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,480
Zhongzhen University?

305
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,440
Yes.

306
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,360
Its Chinese Department is newly founded,

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,600
with new teachers
and teaching philosophies.

308
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,390
Mostly importantly,

309
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,120
it has the Creative Writing Course.

310
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,910
I really want to go.

311
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,630
It suits you.

312
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,080
You’re going to Zhongzhen?

313
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,960
That’s too far.

314
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,150
I’m not even going to leave Haiwen.

315
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,080
Chief,

316
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:49,960
what about you?

317
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,750
We made a deal

318
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
to go to Haiwen Sport University, right?

319
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,600
I’ve filled my form.

320
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,030
Chief?

321
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,630
Chief?

322
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,510
What?

323
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,910
Haiwen Sport University.

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,870
Oh, Haiwen Sport University.

325
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,390
Chief,

326
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,200
don’t tell me you changed your mind?

327
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,480
We made a deal three years ago.

328
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,000
We planned to go there
as early as we were in Grade 10.

329
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,320
You’ll be disloyal
if you change your mind now.

330
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,840
No. You’re thinking too much.

331
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,270
I was just lost in thought. Be seated.

332
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,910
I’ll fill the form.
Something’s just on my mind.

333
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,740
(Application Form for Universities)

334
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,320
The air is so fresh.

335
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,840
What?

336
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,480
Want to be taken photos of
without makeup?

337
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,030
Get in the car, Jingxi.

338
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,030
Get in the car, Ms. Hua.

339
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,720
Surprise!

340
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,600
Isn’t it a surprise, super star?

341
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,320
This isn’t a surprise, but a shock.

342
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,240
We knew you left hospital today.

343
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,960
Then we asked Bawan for the key.

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,600
We came earlier
to prepare a surprise for you.

345
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,670
You haven’t seen us these days.

346
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,200
We’ve been worrying about you.

347
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:52,910
You have?

348
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,360
Yes.

349
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,030
You worried about me?

350
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,480
I... I certainly did.

351
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,910
How do you feel now? Any better?

352
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,790
Are you alright now?

353
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,550
-Li He.
-Don’t. Don’t.

354
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,440
I’m very well.

355
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
But you’ll hurt me again.

356
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,720
You were away lately.
In case you fall behind in study,

357
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,000
I’ve sorted out the papers,

358
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,080
homework and note for you.

359
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,360
Aren’t you moved?

360
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,270
I’m so moved.

361
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,360
It’s really my honor

362
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,840
to have good friends like you.

363
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,120
You’re welcome.

364
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,320
And this.

365
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Miss Luo asked me to bring this to you.

366
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,440
You must hand it in next week.

367
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
Application form?

368
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,550
Yep.

369
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,600
Well,

370
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
you’ll go to Beijing Academy of Drama
or The Central Film Academy, right?

371
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to study music, in fact.

372
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,670
Music?

373
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,750
Which university?

374
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,270
I haven’t decided yet.

375
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,240
Yuan, which university
do you want to go?

376
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,910
The Finance Department
of Beikai University.

377
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,390
There’ll be no problem.

378
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,630
You have such good marks.
You’ll easily be admitted.

379
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,120
There’s no problem
with Beikai University.

380
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,080
But it’ll be hard

381
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,270
if I want to go to Huatsing University
or Yanbei University.

382
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,630
But Zeyu is different.

383
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,030
Zeyu, which one do you want to go?

384
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,320
I haven’t decided yet.

385
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
But either will do.

386
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,030
It depends on my feeling.

387
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,750
Your feeling?

388
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,480
You think you can pick a university
like picking vegetables?

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,080
It’s not very different to me.

390
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,550
You know, I have quite high scores.

391
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,120
All right.

392
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,960
Don’t bother about others.

393
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,200
You make people worry most.

394
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,120
Which university do you want to go?

395
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,480
Why do you worry about me?

396
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,550
I’m special in PE.

397
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,080
I’ve made stable progress in study.

398
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,960
I can go to many universities.

399
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,960
Which one do you like best?

400
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,670
I’ll think carefully about it.
Don’t worry, monitor.

401
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,270
It’s the afternoon.

402
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,120
The audition should have been finished.

403
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,160
Why hasn’t Ye Jingxi texted us yet?

404
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,750
Bear?

405
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,680
How was the audition going?

406
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,270
Smoothly.

407
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,350
The director said
I looked like a swimmer.

408
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,070
Casting directors
were also satisfied with me.

409
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,880
You mean you passed the audition?

410
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,440
No.

411
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
Don’t pull a long face.

412
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,270
That’s normal.

413
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,550
Many actors compete for one role.

414
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,240
But we worked hard for a long time.

415
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,880
Others worked hard, too.

416
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,000
Besides,

417
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,440
if I feel sad
every time I fail an audition,

418
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
how can I live my life?

419
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,270
It doesn’t matter.

420
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,270
That’s fine.

421
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,070
The final exam is coming.
Review your lessons carefully.

422
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,920
Yes.

423
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,960
I think so, too.

424
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,790
So,

425
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,310
Yuan.

426
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,720
Mm?

427
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,030
Keep helping me with my study, okay?

428
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,000
Me?

429
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,480
Yes.

430
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,640
I’ll help you, too.

431
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,070
So will I.

432
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,920
Yes.

433
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,400
We’ve made a deal.

434
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,510
Stand up. Let me talk to him.

435
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,680
We’ve set up a study group,

436
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
simply to study hard.

437
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,400
Mm.

438
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,880
Is that so?

439
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,790
-Yes.
-Yes.

440
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,000
Good.

441
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,310
Now you have a high awareness.

442
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,270
Jingxi, Ms. Hua is coming.

443
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
She’s very angry, I think.

444
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,790
Ms. Hua, coming to visit me so late?

445
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,240
I really appreciate that.

446
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,070
Ms. Hua,

447
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,550
shall I wait for you in the car?

448
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,400
Stay here.

449
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,920
You should also listen to

450
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,270
what I’m going to say.

451
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,680
Artist

452
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,640
is an occupation.

453
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
There’re rules for every occupation.

454
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,070
In the film audition,

455
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,240
you deliberately behaved bad

456
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,350
so that you disappointed
the casting directors.

457
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,920
Have you thought of

458
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,400
what consequences

459
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,550
may be?

460
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,590
Don’t stare at him.

461
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,720
You think I know no one

462
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,200
in the film company?

463
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,830
You don’t care if the audition video

464
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,030
will be exposed

465
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,480
or if your future will be influenced.

466
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
You neglected your duty

467
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,350
as an artist.

468
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,680
Do you know how senior actors

469
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,790
became successful?

470
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,070
They’re devoted to work,

471
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,640
and responsible.

472
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,240
What about you?

473
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,920
Ask yourself.

474
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,830
Have you fulfilled your duty?

475
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,070
I can’t fulfill that.

476
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,400
You always ask me to act in films.

477
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,110
I know you want to study
in a conservatory of music!

478
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,640
But have you studied hard?

479
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,350
Do you think you’re different
from ordinary students,

480
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,510
you have privilege

481
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,830
and you can pick any university,

482
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,070
because you’re a little famous in China

483
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:40,310
and everyone in the company
flatters you?

484
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,030
You’re young,

485
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,750
but impetuous!

486
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,640
A little reputation makes you arrogant!

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,070
You want to study music?

488
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,480
Okay.

489
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,920
But you should study hard first

490
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,640
and pass the entrance examination
with your own strength.

491
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,480
Now that you don’t want to be an actor,

492
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,510
you should make clear
what else you want to be

493
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,160
and how you can be it!

494
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,100
(Minimum Score for all majors
of Haixing Conservatory of Music)

495
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,000
(Ms. Hua)
Ms. Hua,

496
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,160
I understand what you said.

497
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,830
I was too childish.

498
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,550
Please get me
a professional music teacher.

499
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,030
I’ll study hard.

500
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Monitor,

501
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,310
collect the application forms
and send them to my office.

502
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,880
-All right.
-Class’s over.

503
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:46,920
Yuan,

504
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,200
I have something to tell you.

505
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,000
What?

506
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,750
Let’s talk out of the classroom.

507
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,590
All right.

508
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,920
You two.

509
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,160
Why do you always follow us around?

510
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,030
Don’t talk nonsense.

511
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,880
Why are you taking her out so seriously?

512
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,830
From tomorrow on,

513
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,960
I’ll ask for a two-week leave.

514
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,240
Two weeks?

515
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,160
So long? What are you going to do?

516
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,830
Yeah.

517
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,200
My company has arranged

518
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,110
professional music training for me.

519
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,400
I must go.

520
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
What did I say?
You’re not talented in acting!

521
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,830
You’d better work hard on music.

522
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,640
Just... just kidding.

523
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,070
Last night, Ms. Hua said a lot to me.

524
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,510
I have to admit that she’s right.

525
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,790
So,

526
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,350
I can no longer idle away my time.

527
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,160
I must chase my music dream carefully.

528
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,790
What about school work?
Have you asked for a leave?

529
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,000
Yes.

530
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,160
Go ahead.

531
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,350
Don’t worry about school work.

532
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,830
We’ll leave notes to you.

533
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,400
Thanks.

534
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,590
All right.

535
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,070
That’s all?

536
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,790
Let’s go for lunch.

537
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,200
Come on.

538
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,880
Study hard.

539
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,200
Bai.

540
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,160
What?

541
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,750
Come on.

542
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,240
Let me show you a photo of a girl.

543
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,550
What photo?

544
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,790
My family introduced her to me
last month.

545
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,750
Beautiful, isn’t she?

546
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,920
Looks good.

547
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,350
She has fair skin,

548
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,510
and big eyes.

549
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,790
And she’s tall.

550
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,240
She’s my cup of tea.

551
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,400
We make a perfect couple.

552
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,110
Shall I introduce you a girl, too?

553
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,590
-Me?
-Yes.

554
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,550
Don’t bother. I’m doing alright.

555
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,960
No.

556
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,200
You’re no longer young.
You need a girlfriend.

557
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,550
You should consider about that.

558
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,310
No. No, I don’t.

559
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,590
You know that.

560
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
It’s been long
since you last had a girlfriend.

561
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,480
If I didn’t know you,

562
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,680
I would think
you have problems with love.

563
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,160
Who has problems? Who?

564
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,680
-Kidding. Just kidding.
-I don’t need a girlfriend.

565
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
Come on.

566
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,310
This is my girlfriend’s best friend.

567
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,720
Beautiful, isn’t she?

568
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,680
Looks good.

569
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,750
How come?

570
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,350
Ridiculous!

571
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,110
-Ridiculous?
-Oops.

572
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,480
I said no, no, no!

573
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,680
Bai Fei!

574
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,590
Come over.

575
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,550
I said no, didn’t I?

576
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,160
Ridiculous, isn’t he?

577
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,590
What happened?

578
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:08,920
Li He,

579
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,790
do you really know how to fill the form?

580
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,830
I do. I’m not illiterate.

581
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
Be serious. Don’t try to fool me.

582
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,070
Ning Zeyu,

583
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,550
do you know how important
the application form is?

584
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,240
I do.

585
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,070
It’s a starting point.

586
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,590
After filling it,

587
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,830
we’ll work towards it

588
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,000
and study hard

589
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,880
so as to achieve our application.

590
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,720
All right.

591
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,440
Let me ask you again.

592
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,540
(Information Engineering,
Tiangong University of Science and Technology)

593
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,920
You filled this form

594
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,030
by yourself?

595
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,000
Yes.

596
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,790
I’m serious. I filled it carefully.

597
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,790
-So, you really want to...
-So, you really want to...

598
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,440
Tiangong.

599
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,030
Huatsing.

600
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,350
Zeyu,

601
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,020
I know

602
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,400
you’ve been an obedient boy.

603
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,350
But you have a mind of your own.

604
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,110
At your age,

605
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,000
you have the mind to rebel.
I can understand.

606
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,400
But you shouldn’t give vent on

607
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,350
by ruining your future.

608
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,960
I don’t want to rebel.

609
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,880
I really want to go to Tiangong University
of Science and Technology.

610
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,000
You chose that,
instead of Huatsing and Yanbei.

611
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
Do you families know?

612
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,110
Not yet.

613
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,030
But I will communicate with them.

614
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,070
-Zeyu.
-Miss Luo,

615
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,720
I really want to learn programming.

616
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,670
Tiangong University is
China’s best university

617
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,440
for programming.

618
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,030
In term of programming,

619
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,720
I think it’s as good
as Huatsing and Yanbei.

620
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,480
I also don’t think
following my parents’ decision

621
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,350
can be the only right choice.

622
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,000
You also said,

623
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,310
do what you have to do,
till you can do what you want to do.

624
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,440
This is my application form.

625
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,790
I hope I can apply personally.

626
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,070
Huatsing!

627
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,310
Huatsing!

628
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,440
Li He,

629
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,750
I know you’re always confident
for no reason.

630
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,070
There is a fine line

631
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,350
between confidence
and excessive confidence.

632
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,000
Bai, that sounds absurd.

633
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,200
Others look down on me.
You also do?

634
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,790
I don’t mean that.

635
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:17,790
I...

636
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,480
I just want to tell you that

637
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,510
it’s good to be ambitious.

638
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,590
But there’s a gap
between ambition and reality.

639
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,480
There’s only one term

640
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,270
before the college entrance examination.

641
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,030
How can you be admitted to Huatsing
with existing scores?

642
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,310
Why can’t I? I checked it.

643
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,440
I can be a high-level athlete
for Huatsing.

644
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,640
It’s hard to be admitted to Huatsing.

645
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,480
But a high-level athlete
doesn’t need a score

646
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,350
as high as academic students.

647
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,640
I can have a try.

648
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,030
It’s not that problem.

649
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,790
Yes.

650
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,790
Huatsing has preferential policies
for outstanding PE students.

651
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,830
But your score isn’t good enough.

652
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,510
Do you know

653
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,510
if you fill the application improperly,

654
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,590
you might be admitted to no university?

655
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,160
Bai,

656
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,270
don’t worry.

657
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,830
I’ll study hard

658
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,030
and I will succeed.

659
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,070
Why do you think so?

660
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,550
Monitor.

661
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,440
Enjoy the drumsticks.

662
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,590
I won’t. They’re poisonous.

663
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
Why are they?

664
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,590
I just bought them.

665
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,200
Ah.

666
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,920
What trick are you trying to use?

667
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,640
No trick.

668
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,680
Yuan,

669
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,400
could you be my private tutor again?

670
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,750
For what subjects?

671
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,830
Chinese, Math, English,
Physics and Chemistry.

672
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,960
Help me with whatever
I don’t do well in.

673
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,720
Anytime and anywhere.

674
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,030
Are you trying to make trouble again?

675
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,640
Listen. Let go of Mr. Ma.

676
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,550
It’s really hard for him.

677
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,830
I’m not trying to make trouble.

678
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,110
I’m serious.

679
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,350
I want to study hard.

680
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,160
Study hard?

681
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,590
That’s what you said last time.

682
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,400
What?

683
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,790
I want to go to Huatsing University.

684
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,830
Li He,

685
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,680
stop joking, all right?

686
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,000
It doesn’t sound funny at all.

687
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,550
I’m not joking.

688
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,830
I want to be a high-level athlete

689
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,480
and go to Huatsing University.

690
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,350
High-level athlete?

691
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,400
What’s that?

692
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,480
A high-level athlete is the best

693
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
among PE students.

694
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,480
He has to do well in sports,

695
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,880
but his score
for the college entrance examination

696
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,920
must also be above 65%
of the second batch.

697
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,270
A high-level athlete can be admitted
to a comprehensive university,

698
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,350
more than a sport university.

699
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,440
So,

700
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,160
to go to Huatsing University,

701
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,110
I must become a high-level athlete.

702
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,680
Do you understand?

703
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,750
Good, Li He.

704
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,960
World champion.

705
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,480
The future...

706
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,240
All right. The future world champion,

707
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,920
I’m waiting to get your autograph.

708
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,400
No problem.

709
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,310
How many seconds?

710
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,960
Good job.

711
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,640
You’ve made so much progress.

712
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,830
It’s no big deal.

713
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:19,550
Have some water.

714
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,110
Thank you, Chief.

715
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,590
Yun Xiang.

716
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,350
Well done.

717
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,400
Oh, Lin Chuan,

718
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,510
I don’t think
I’ll go to Haiwen Sport University.

719
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,590
What?

720
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,640
I want to apply for Huatsing University.

721
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,830
Are you serious?

722
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,510
I didn’t care
which university I would go

723
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,200
as long as we could run together.

724
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,070
But this time,

725
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,790
I want to see how far I can go.

726
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,270
All right.

727
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,030
It doesn’t matter.

728
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:15,920
It’s your own decision, anyway.

729
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,480
Don’t say that, Chuan.

730
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,750
I never forget what we promised.

731
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,400
We can apply for it together.

732
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,510
Let’s work hard
towards the biggest ambition.

733
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,830
Stop explaining.

734
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,920
If you can be admitted
to Huatsing University,

735
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,880
you’ll be the pride
of Sen Yong Sport Team.

736
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,880
I’ll be proud of you, too.

737
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,070
Chuan,

738
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,880
you can also apply for Huatsing.

739
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
You study the best

740
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,310
-among us four.
-I’m not going.

741
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,510
Why don’t you go?

742
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,830
You also do the best in sports.

743
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,880
I think you know
why I must go to Haiwen Sport University.

744
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,790
Wish you success!

745
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,350
Chief,

746
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,030
it’s a good thing
when you want to apply for Huatsing.

747
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,960
We all support you.

748
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,200
But,

749
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,400
you know what we can do.

750
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,720
We may not even pass the sports exam,

751
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,070
not to mention
the college entrance examination.

752
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,590
Chief, we’re not going to the tutorial.

753
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,480
See you at the training, Chief.

754
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:05,920
You’re back?

755
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,480
Mm.

756
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,000
I’ve got the material ready.

757
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,320
Mm.

758
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,590
You come back alone?

759
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,630
Yeah.

760
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,000
It doesn’t matter, monitor.
Let’s get started.

761
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,030
Can I not do math problems today?

762
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,190
All right.

763
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,030
Let’s start from Chinese first.

773
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,630
We’re not bickering.

774
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,510
No?

775
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,800
Then why are you here alone?

776
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,030
I thought PE students like you
are more open-minded.

777
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,190

How many of you?

786
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,030
Three.

787
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
How about that table?

788
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,360
But we always take this table.

789
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,440
It’s a table of six, you know.

790
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,590
But only three of you...

791
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,440
AC is over there.

792
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,030
Come on.

793
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,760
Make your order and then tell me.

794
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,030
Come on.

795
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,150
Here.

796
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,950
Be seated, please. I’ll be quick.

797
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,630
Sir.

798
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,710
Come on.

799
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,630
All right. Be right there.

800
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,510
When the dishes come, eat more.

801
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,230
What do you mean?

802
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,000
Just get to the point.

803
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,510
Don’t beat about the bush.

804
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:40,840
You don’t say it, huh?

805
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,000
Yun Xiang, you say it.

806
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,880
We just want you
to communicate with Chief.

807
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,190
Why must you bicker?

808
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,070
Who bickers with him?

809
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,550
What can I communicate?

810
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,480
If you don’t communicate,

811
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,960
Jiang Yuan and I
will be too embarrassed.

812
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,710
Yeah.

813
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,630
We can’t even have the big table
for barbecue.

814
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,480
Yeah. He’s right.

815
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,880
Go get a table.

816
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,000
I’ll go wash my hands first.

817
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,670
All right.

818
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,230
Go ahead.

819
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,710
Chief?

820
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,710
Chuan.

821
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,320
I’m full.

822
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,670
Are you not going to talk to me anymore?

823
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,150
I’m fully full.

824
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,710
I know changing my application
has upset you.

825
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
But it doesn’t mean
I don’t care about you.

826
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,840
I want us to be better.

827
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,880
All right.

828
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,190
I feel happy for you
when you have a higher goal.

829
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,480
I support you.

830
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,760
Isn’t that enough?

831
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,630
If you really supported me,
you wouldn’t behave like this.

832
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:16,400
I never mean to leave you alone.

833
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,800
We can go there together.

834
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,960
Why must I go with you?

835
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,400
Let alone whether I can be admitted
to Huatsing.

836
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,190
Even if I could,
it’s too far away from my home.

837
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,150
Can I really go?

838
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,590
Li He,

839
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,360
can you be better
simply because you want?

840
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,710
Sir, the bill, please!

841
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,480
Chief, I’ll go persuade him.

842
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,480
Lin Chuan?

843
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,480
Jiang Yuan.

844
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,670
See you later.

845
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,880
Take your seat.

846
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,550
Sir,

847
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:04,760
take the order, please.

848
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,710
What would you like to eat?

849
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,190
So, what did you quarrel for?

850
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,590
Nothing.

851
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,400
It’s boys’ problem.

852
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,550
Girls won’t understand.

853
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:27,110
You have serious sexual discrimination.

854
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,480
I don’t.

855
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,360
I mean...

856
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,800
I can’t understand before you explain.

857
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,070
I don’t understand the feelings
between you and your teammates, either.

858
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,710
I just want to listen to your worries.

859
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,320
We fell out because of the application.

860
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,630
I want to go to Huatsing.

861
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,070
I wonder if I’ve made a wrong decision.

862
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Huatsing is one of the best universities
throughout China.

863
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,320
When you told me about your application,

864
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,280
I felt surprised and incredible.

865
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,130
But when you want to go
to China’s best university,

866
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,030
you’ve done nothing wrong.

867
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,480
No.

868
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,880
I’m not worried because I may fail.

869
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,550
It’s not the problem
with Huatsing, either.

870
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,510
