18
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,920
That way.

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,480
Ye Jingxi, what’re you doing?

20
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,310
Why do you take me here?

21
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,190
What do you want to say?

22
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,840
Before answering your question,

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,870
let me ask you a question.

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,120
Do you remember

25
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,360
when you were a child, you soiled

26
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,080
a book with chocolate

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
in the library?

28
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,280
What’s the name of the new lady?

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,240
The other maid thought about it
before she said,

30
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,680
I don’t remember, either.

31
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,590
I remember it.

32
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,590
It’s Lady Sarah.

33
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,590
Yes. Sarah.

34
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,000
Where are you?

35
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,240
I know you are here.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,520
Come, come, come here.

37
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,360
Listen to me,

38
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,680
don’t eat chocolate again
while you’re reading.

39
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,750
You have to pay for the books
if you get them dirty.

40
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,400
Do you know?

41
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,120
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

42
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,710
All right. Put the book back.

43
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,000
Behave, huh?

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,630
Is it good?

45
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,430
Yeah.

46
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,190
I don’t buy it!

47
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Don’t tell me,

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,190
you,

49
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,150
the popular idol, is Bear

50
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,560
from my childhood?

51
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,040
Yuan,

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
has your childhood wish

53
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,720
come true?

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,920
I remember now.

55
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,680
Bear.

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,750
It’s you!

57
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,630
Yeah.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,630
So, after the incident,

59
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,870
your mom took you to another city.

60
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:57,800
Yeah.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,430
And after that,

62
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,040
I went abroad as a trainee.

63
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,120
I haven’t come back since then.

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
I went to your house,

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,920
but found you had moved.

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,510
My grandma passed away at that time

67
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,830
and left her old house to us.

68
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,070
We moved when I was at Grade 8.

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Anyway, I found you in the end.

70
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,360
I’ve looked all the high schools
in Haiwen.

71
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,000
At last, I found your name
on the straight A student list

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,070
on the website of your school.

73
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,920
You’re good.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,510
You become smarter than
when you were a child.

75
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,680
Of course.

76
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,240
I’ve been extremely clever
since I was a child.

77
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,950
Yeah, exactly.

78
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,560
But,

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
I’m really afraid that
you would forget me.

80
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,750
That’s possible.

81
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,430
After all, you were like that
when you were a child,

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,430
and you’re like this now.

83
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Yeah, you’re right.

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,120
But there’s one thing which
will never change.

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
As long as I see the whistle,

86
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
I’ll know it’s you.

87
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:07,540
(Post Weibo)

88
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,820
(I’m in the same class with a big star.)

89
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,270
Yuan Caixi.

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,360
-What’s the matter?
-Where did you go?

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
The library.

92
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,870
Where is he?

93
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,720
In the dean’s office.

94
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,310
No.

95
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,920
I was asking
what you were doing just now?

96
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
We were in the library to
hide from his fans.

97
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,000
Does he know you?
Why did he take you with him?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,950
I know him.

99
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,310
He was the best friend
from my childhood.

100
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,270
Best friend from your childhood?

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,190
Monitor.

102
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,950
Tell me how you knew each other.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,120
How can’t I be upset?

104
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,190
I was told he pulled our monitor

105
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,270
and ran across most of the campus.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,310
Then they spent much time together
in the library.

107
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,920
I wonder

108
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,720
how fast he could run?

109
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,950
Could he outrun me?

110
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,310
I, the chief of the track team…

111
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,390
No, he couldn’t.

112
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,390
But he could possibly

113
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
when he is with monitor.

114
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,240
Do you want a whipping?

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,190
I found it. I found it. I found it.

116
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,360
What did you find?

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,270
Netizen vote

118
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,120
for the most popular male idol
of the new generation.

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,190
Ye Jingxi ranks first.

120
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,000
He’s quite a dish.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
Look, he has a lot of fans.
Look at the girls.

122
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,140
(The Most Popular Male Idol
of the New Generation, Ye Jingxi)

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,040
They, they are just a group of
shallow girls.

124
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,270
Monitor is different.

125
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,160
She is devoted to study
and never goes after stars.

126
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
I must remind you, Chief.

127
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,950
Ye Jingxi and monitor

128
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,630
have known each other
since they were children.

129
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,270
Haven’t you heard that
playmates in childhood are always

130
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,750
attached to each other?

131
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,240
No, I have to see her.

132
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,070
Hey, hey.

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,430
Don’t go yet.

134
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Knowing yourself and your enemy

135
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,270
helps you to win a hundred battles.

136
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,510
I’ll show you.

137
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,160
What does he mean?

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,800
Do you know?

139
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,190
Jingxi.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,600
No, no. Ye Jingxi.

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,720
I’m a real, real fan of you.

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,560
Can I have your autograph?

143
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
Sure. Give it me.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,600
Thank you.

145
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,720
Sign here. Sign here.

146
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,270
Thanks. Thanks.

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,920
Anyone else?

148
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
I want, too. I want, too.

149
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,400
Handsome. He is so handsome.

150
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,040
I want one. I want, too.

151
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
Chill out. Chill out.

152
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,720
Everyone will have my autograph.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,440
Don’t get too worked up.
Don’t get too worked up.

154
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,270
What’re you doing?

155
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,750
Come out.

156
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,360
I, I’ll take a photo with you later.

157
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,060
So handsome.

158
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,030
-What makes you like Ye Jingxi so much?
-So handsome.

159
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,320
No.

160
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,840
I don’t like him.

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,790
I love him.

162
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,910
He is my faith.

163
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
You love him?

164
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,150
How well do you know him?

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,960
What if he doesn’t
want you to watch animation?

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,000
I’ll quit immediately.

167
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,440
What if he doesn’t want you to
write your novel?

168
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,270
I’ll quit without hesitation.

169
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,910
What if he doesn’t like horror movies?

170
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Anyway, I’ll do whatever

171
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,440
he asks me to do.

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,020
So handsome.

173
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,550
Han Yayi.

174
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,150
I hope you to think it over.

175
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,120
The way you go after a star

176
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,080
is without dignity.

177
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,440
What is dignity?

178
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
Do you have any moral integrity?

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,150
I don’t understand.

180
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,080
So handsome.

181
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,840
I don’t want to talk with you.

182
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,790
What did you want from me?

183
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,510
I forgot.

184
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,200
So handsome.

185
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,120
How was it going?

186
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,120
It wasn’t going well.

187
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,080
What exactly do you mean?

188
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,150
I had intended to ask Han Yayi.

189
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,240
But when I got to the classroom,

190
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
I saw she was one of Ye Jingxi’s

191
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,910
fanatical fans, too.

192
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,480
I was so frustrated
that I went straight away.

193
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,030
What a pity

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,480
it is!

195
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,360
I thought you would surely

196
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
tackle the problem,

197
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,200
not expecting your downfall
would be Han Yayi.

198
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,000
Chief.

199
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,510
Give me another chance.

200
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,390
This time,

201
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,080
I will surely tidy up my emotions

202
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,270
and get down to the business.

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,120
See, that’s what brothers are like.

204
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,240
Chief is worried about monitor.

205
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,240
Chuan is upset because of Han Yayi.

206
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:43,870
Do you think so?

207
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,320
I didn’t expect in this world,

208
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,480
there would be women who are
irresistible to Chief and Chuan.

209
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,200
What did you say?

210
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,080
Who did you say?

211
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,270
Chief.

212
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,550
I think there’s another person
you can turn to.

213
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,510
Who is it?

214
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,000
I’m afraid you don’t want to
cooperate with him.

215
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
Go ahead.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,750
Zeyu.

217
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,670
See you later.

218
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,840
Shall we prepare a copy of
the test papers and materials

219
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,320
for our new classmate?

220
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,870
Oh, I’ve got it prepared.

221
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,120
I’ll get it later

222
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,390
and make him a copy.

223
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,600
As the monitor, you take good care
of the new student.

224
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,480
That’s because Bear, oh no,

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Ye Jingxi, was my childhood friend.

226
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,320
Really?

227
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,670
Yeah.

228
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,120
You’ve never mentioned it.

229
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,030
But he moved when he was young.

230
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,910
We haven’t seen each other since then.

231
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
He’s so famous,
yet you didn’t recognize him?

232
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,840
That’s because he used to be a fat boy.

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,960
I didn’t expect he would become so thin,

234
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,440
and become a big star, too.

235
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,030
Though you haven’t seen each other
for a long time, you’re still close.

236
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,550
It may because we had been through
something together.

237
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,000
I think some friendship

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
will never change.

239
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,790
Why, do you have a past?

240
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,440
Why do you care about it?

241
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, just curious.

242
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,000
Zeyu.

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
I must go now.

244
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,910
And,

245
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,150
I have to leave these to you. Please.

246
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,240
Well, OK.

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,790
Thanks.

248
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,390
Don’t mention it.

249
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,720
You’re even trying to eat ice cream?

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,480
I’ll drink juice.

251
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,840
What’re you doing?

252
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,510
Be careful. Be careful.

253
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,780
Jingxi, take mine.

254
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,380
Take this.

255
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,000
Take this. You won’t put on weight.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh.

257
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,440
No, thanks. I can’t eat so much.

258
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,790
Err, put everything back.

259
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,840
All right. Thanks. Thanks.

260
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,820
Jingxi.

261
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,980
Don’t leave.

262
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,550
Don’t go.

263
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:13,960
Super star.

264
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,150
You may get hurt in the crowds.

265
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,720
Just a singer and dancer.

266
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,320
Get hurt?

267
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,270
That would be nice.

268
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,630
Maybe Jingxi will carry me
to the clinic.

269
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,120
(Post Weibo)
The big star is surely different.

270
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,630
He would have others buy him drinks.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,390
He puts on airs even at school.

272
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,270
What would you like to eat?

273
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,550
It’s OK. Let’s go.

274
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,560
So handsome.

275
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,540
Jingxi.

276
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,910
Look at his histrionics.

277
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,390
Does he think he’s
walking the red carpet?

278
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,060
So handsome.

279
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,480
Chief.

280
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,790
Why don’t you eat?

281
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,580
You’re so handsome.

282
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,270
Go back, everyone. Go to have your lunch

283
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,320
or take your class.

284
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,240
Will you?

285
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,080
Go ahead. Go ahead.

286
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,870
Bye-bye.

287
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,320
Bye-bye.

288
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,550
Thank you, guys.

289
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,240
Wait, wait for a minute.

290
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,360
I’ll pick up the food for you.

291
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,030
Yuan, have you brought your meal card?

292
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,360
I forgot.

293
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,390
Yeah. You forgot.

294
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,550
I didn’t. I’ll take care of it.
Let me get the food.

295
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,320
Hey,

296
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
I only eat white meat.

297
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,080
Just one fist-sized meat,
vegetables and eggs.

298
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,550
Yeah.

299
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
As the size of my fist, OK?

300
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,240
OK.

301
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,360
Yeah.

302
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,720
Histrionic.

303
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,720
Pretentious.

304
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,150
No starch.

305
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,200
Starch?

306
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,750
He means rice and noodles…

307
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,790
Forget it. I’ll go.

308
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,390
Yuan.

309
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,960
Yuan, Yuan, Yuan.

310
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,510
Why don’t you call her Fang?

311
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,670
It sounds like round and square.

312
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,000
Yuan, I’ll take care of it.

313
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,320
I’ll get the meals. Let me go.

314
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,360
He’s surely a poser.

315
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,750
I’m glad you’re here,

316
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:27,910
or

317
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,840
I won’t have a single acquaintance.

318
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,600
It doesn’t matter.

319
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,550
You’ll adapt to it.

320
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,320
Here you are.

321
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,390
This is without rice.

322
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,000
Good.

323
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,480
Hey, Yuan. Let me wipe your tableware.

324
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,360
Thanks.

325
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,240
Let me

326
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,870
wipe your hands, too.

327
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,600
Hands?

328
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,600
No, no, no.

329
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,910
I can, I can wipe my own hands.

330
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,750
Never mind. Let me help you.

331
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,510
Never mind.

332
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,150
Enough!

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,870
Don’t get excited. Don’t.

334
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,870
Let me do it myself.

335
00:15:59,390 --> 00:15:59,840
OK.

336
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,150
-Chief.
-I don’t want to eat.

337
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,120
Chief.

338
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,150
It seems

339
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,750
we could only seek for his help.

340
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,440
Haoxi.

341
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,790
I want to ask you some questions.

342
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,440
What do you want to know?

343
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,510
Have some meat.

344
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,000
You want to trade

345
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,080
my sister’s secrets with
just a drumstick?

346
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,200
You’re not sincere at all.

347
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,910
Well,

348
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,910
why don’t you ask my sister?

349
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,510
All the knowledge points
in the examination of Grade 10

350
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,510
are here.

351
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,440
No hurry.

352
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,390
Just answer me several questions.

353
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,150
Then you can have it and
take your time.

354
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,910
What do you want to know?
I’ll tell you everything.

355
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,790
Yeah.

356
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,310
I must tell you,

357
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,310
that’s all I know.

358
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,750
OK.

359
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,240
Thanks, Haoxi.

360
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,350
The notebook is yours.

361
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,200
I never take notes.

362
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,880
I only use my brain.

363
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
Liar.

364
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,790
Ning Zeyu.

365
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,270
Li He,

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,310
it’s you who wants something from me.

367
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,750
Why don’t you change your attitude?

368
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,550
I want nothing from you.

369
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,160
Fine.

370
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,920
See you later.

371
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,030
I thought

372
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,310
you would like to know the story of
monitor and Ye Jingxi.

373
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,680
It’s not a secret that
they were childhood friends.

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,030
I thought

375
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350
you knew something more.

376
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,920
Fine.

377
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,590
You must know

378
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,830
the big incident that happened

379
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,030
in their childhood.

380
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,350
In that case,

381
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,440
I don’t have to say much.

382
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,480
Hey.

383
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,110
Wait.

384
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,640
What incident?

385
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,880
Don’t you know?

386
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,440
Of course I know.

387
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,720
I just want to make sure if you get

388
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,480
the right information.

389
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,790
Ah, fine.

390
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,880
Zeyu.

391
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,680
Oh.

392
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,110
Zeyu.

393
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Yeah.

394
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,550
Please tell me

395
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,830
what happened when

396
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,750
monitor and Ye Jingxi were kids?

397
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,240
That is,

398
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,400
monitor was bullied when she was young
because she was

399
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,270
from a single-parent family.

400
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,110
Ye Jingxi helped her.

401
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,310
When Ye Jingxi celebrated her birthday,

402
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,350
it caused a fire.

403
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,160
Yeah.

404
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,790
So, since Ye Jingxi moved when
he was in primary school,

405
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,070
have they never met again?

406
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,720
Yeah.

407
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,680
It was him who saved monitor
in the first place.

408
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,270
Where did you get all the details?

409
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,350
Did you ask monitor?

410
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,440
Sure enough, the IQ gap stops us

411
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
from being good friends.

412
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,270
Answer my question.

413
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,960
I asked her brother,

414
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,310
Yuan Haoxi.

415
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,240
I don’t think it’s a big problem.

416
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,310
Think about it.

417
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,350
Monitor and Ye were very close
when they were young.

418
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,270
But it has been years.

419
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,590
People change.

420
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,310
As long as monitor finds

421
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,480
there’re many men
who are better than Ye,

422
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,720
we always have the chance
to attract her.

423
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,750
Are there many men better than him?

424
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
I’m afraid in Class 2,

425
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,440
there’s only one.

426
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,550
I know.

427
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,880
I’m flattered.

428
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,310
Really.

429
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,000
Thanks.

430
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,100
(Class 2, Grade 3)

431
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,790
Is he pretty?

432
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,160
Huh?

433
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,880
Class.

434
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,960
I heard there were twice girls
as much as usual

435
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,240
eating at in the canteen today.

436
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Why?

437
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,310
Is Ye Jingxi delicious to

438
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,000
go with rice?

439
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,480
Stop smirking.

440
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Do you have the nerve to smirk?

441
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,920
Ye Jingxi, stand up.

442
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:14,440
You’re a student of Class 2 now.

443
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,030
You should behave like a student.

444
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,880
Not wearing school uniform,

445
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,400
you pulled a girl
running across the campus.

446
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,440
Who taught you that?

447
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Who did he pull?

448
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,590
Yuan Caixi.

449
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,920
Mr. Ma, I think you’re right.

450
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,110
Students

451
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,640
shouldn’t make loud noise
or chase one another

452
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,400
in the teaching building.

453
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,350
It’s common sense.

454
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,720
Surely.

455
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,880
Does he think the school is his home?

456
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,510
You’re at school.

457
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,830
You’re the students of Grade 3.

458
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,750
What the most important thing
is for you?

459
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,830
Focusing on study.

460
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
That’s right. Very good.

461
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,550
You’re a star outside the school.

462
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,510
But in the school,

463
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,960
you should set an example
for your classmates.

464
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,350
Bring them more positive energy.

465
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,070
Yes.

466
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,960
Do you know?

467
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,550
Yes.

468
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,000
I know.

469
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,440
Good.

470
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,270
Sit down.

471
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,400
Yuan Caixi.

472
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,270
Yes.

473
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,270
As a monitor, you have more reason

474
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,750
to set an example. Do you know?

475
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,920
Yeah. I know.

476
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,510
Mr. Ma, I was wrong.
I won’t do it again.

477
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:21,880
OK.

478
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,590
Just this once.

479
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,110
Yeah.

480
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,510
I hope you all

481
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,240
focus on study.

482
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,790
OK?

483
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

484
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,480
Speak loudly.

485
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,510
Yes.

486
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,790
The class is over.

487
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Shall we play a ball game later?

488
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,480
Yeah. What game?

489
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,160
Basketball?

490
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,960
Basketball, volleyball or Ping-pong.
Take your pick.

491
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,960
-You’re in good mood.
-You can’t beat me on basketball anyway.

492
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,280
-Come on.
-Come on.

493
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,070
Today, I invite you over here

494
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,550
to talk about cooperation.

495
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:13,750
Ning Zeyu,

496
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,160
let’s join hands.

497
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,240
Why would I join hands with you?

498
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,960
Are you going to watch monitor

499
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,400
falls a prey to the tiger?

500
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,920
Of course not.
But I don’t have to work with you.

501
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:26,960
Hey.

502
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,880
Haven’t you heard that

503
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,590
the enemy of my enemy is my friend?

504
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:31,680
Yes.

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
I’m willing to put aside
all our disagreements temporarily

506
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,310
to fight against the external enemies.

507
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,030
What do you say?

508
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,790
Not bad. He.

509
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,240
You start to use your brain now.

510
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,440
What a surprise!

511
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,790
Don’t talk nonsense.

512
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,640
Do you want to work together or not?

513
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,640
Fine.

514
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,030
But you must listen to me.

515
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,030
Go ahead. What have you got?

516
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,510
Have you finished your English homework?

517
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,920
If not, you can ask Yuan to help.

518
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,750
OK.

519
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,270
No problem. I…

520
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,160
You can ask Yuan to help you
with your math homework, too.

521
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,400
Li He and his team.

522
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,680
Chief.

523
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,460
-Chief. Have you sprained your ankle?
-I sprained my ankle.

524
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,520
Ankle sprained. Ankle sprained.

525
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,220
Ankle sprained.

526
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,590
Oh, what are you doing here?

527
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,880
-Come on. Hurry. Give him a hand.
-Ye Jingxi, hurry. Give him a hand.

528
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,310
We need one more player. Come on.

529
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,510
I don’t play basketball.

530
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,680
I don’t.

531
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,980
He is the new classmate.
Let’s play together.

532
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,240
-Let’s play together.
-Come on.

533
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,680
Go ahead, Bear!

534
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Come on.

535
00:25:53,480 --> 00:26:02,270
Come on.

536
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,840
Be careful. Sit down.

537
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Slowly.

538
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,830
You’re worn out already?

539
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Have a good rest.

540
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,200
We’ll play again tomorrow.

541
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,350
Tomorrow again?

542
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,200
Why?

543
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,880
Don’t you like it?

544
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
I don’t.

545
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,960
You were not playing basketball.

546
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,070
You were giving me a hard time.

547
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,270
Of course we were not.

548
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,350
It’s just because
your physical fitness is poor.

549
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,480
Look at your scrawny arms.

550
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,160
Chief.

551
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,070
I’m leaving.

552
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,750
Bye-bye.

553
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,640
Bear, shall we go?

554
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,400
Let’s go.

555
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,200
Ye Jingxi.

556
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,960
The teacher asked me to
print some test papers for him,

557
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,790
fearing that he would get left behind.

558
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:11,590
Thanks.

559
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,750
There are some knowledge points
you have to learn.

560
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,680
Now?

561
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,750
Yeah.

562
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,310
But school is over now.

563
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,960
Shall we

564
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,880
work on it tomorrow?

565
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,480
No.

566
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,030
We have new knowledge points tomorrow.

567
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,070
Bear.

568
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,110
You should stay.

569
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,480
Not everyone has the privilege
of listening to Zeyu’s lecture.

570
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,070
I’m leaving.

571
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,790
Yuan.

572
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,350
OK.

573
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,400
Bye-bye.

574
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:40,960
Be careful.

575
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,160
-Take care on the way.
-You can leave him to us.

576
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,070
Bye-bye.

577
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,030
Hey, you!

578
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,480
What are you guys going to do?

579
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,550
To teach you knowledge points.

580
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,680
To play basketball with you.

581
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,000
Go ahead.

582
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,640
Cheers.

583
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,510
Cheers.

584
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,680
Who would’ve thought one day

585
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,640
we would work so well together?

586
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,830
Thanks to my high IQ.

587
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
Thanks to my physical stamina, too.

588
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,440
Does it have anything to do
with your physical stamina?

589
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,510
Of course it does.

590
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,880
If I hadn’t beaten him on the court,

591
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,640
would he do the test papers tamely?

592
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,070
If I hadn’t seized the opportunity
to keep him,

593
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,440
he would’ve gone home
with monitor already.

594
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,790
Fine.

595
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,590
Neither of us can do it alone.

596
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,480
We must join hands.

597
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,030
Surely.

598
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,070
Have a good time working together.

599
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,550
Have a good time!

600
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,640
But I must warn you,

601
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
we’ve just won temporarily.

602
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,270
Don’t underestimate the enemy.

603
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,440
I can’t agree with you more.

604
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,270
But

605
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,680
I think you’ve changed a lot recently.

606
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,640
Why do you think so?

607
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
In the past,

608
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,400
I don’t think you care about anything.

609
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,790
This is the first time you take the
initiative to fight for something.

610
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,960
Since I was a child,

611
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,110
I’ve got the opinion that I could get
whatever I want without fighting for it.

612
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,240
But recently I feel

613
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,160
I would lose

614
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,750
something important
if I don’t fight for it.

615
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,110
Do you mean

616
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:30,960
you would lose monitor?

617
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,110
I don’t want to share my feelings
with such a fool like you.

618
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,640
Tell you what,

619
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,070
though you’ve known her longer than me,

620
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,160
I won’t give up easily.

621
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,240
We’re just working together for now.

622
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:47,880
You

623
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,310
are still my opponent.

624
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,000
So are you.

625
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,350
But you know what?

626
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,960
Ye Jingxi isn’t that silly.

627
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,270
I think

628
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,550
he has suspected something today.

629
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,070
Do you mean when he said

630
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,880
what the hell are you guys doing?

631
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:03,960
Yeah.

632
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,640
Even if he has guessed it,
what could he do?

633
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,030
We’ll watch him at school.

634
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,440
Hold on.

635
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,160
What’s wrong?

636
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,680
You said we would watch him at school.

637
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
After he leaves the school…

638
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,350
He’ll just go home.

639
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,720
Do you really think he would go to Yuan…

640
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,480
Surprise!

641
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,750
Bear! What are you doing here?

642
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,400
Is Auntie at home?

643
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,160
Yes.

644
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,550
I come to

645
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,640
visit Auntie

646
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,110
and scrounge a free meal.

647
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,070
Great. My mom will be so happy!

648
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,640
Mom.

649
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,350
Yeah.

650
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,030
Auntie.

651
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:45,920
Look who’s here.

652
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,440
Welcome.

653
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
You are…

654
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,400
I’m that, that…

655
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
-That, that…
-Bear!

656
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,510
Bear?

657
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,920
Auntie!

658
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,310
Are, are you really Bear?

659
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,960
-I am, Auntie.
-Wow.

660
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,920
Bear.

661
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,200
Auntie. I miss you so much.

662
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,960
You used to be chubby as a child.

663
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,720
How do you become so skinny now?

664
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,720
It’s not cute at all.

665
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,160
Auntie.

666
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,680
I’ve brought you some present.

667
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,270
You didn’t forget auntie.

668
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,160
Thanks.

669
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,960
Put it here.

670
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,680
Great. I’ll cook extra dishes for you.

671
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,590
Caixi, take Bear to wash his hands.

672
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,830
This way.

673
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,000
Here. This is soap.

674
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,880
This is hand cleanser.

675
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,350
By the way,

676
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,200
you played basketball with
Li He and his team today.

677
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
What do you think of them?

678
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:40,240
They’re fine.

679
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,920
Not bad.

680
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,070
Oh. Not bad.

681
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
That’s good.

682
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,200
You may think Li He

683
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,310
is annoying,

684
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,350
but he’s very warm-hearted.

685
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,160
Are you on good terms with him?

686
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
I wasn’t before.

687
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,350
But after getting along with him,

688
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,310
I find he is sweet.

689
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,830
Oh?

690
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,310
You just made me unhappy.

691
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,070
Is he as sweet as me?

692
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,400
Oh, God. Why are you jealous of him?

693
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,550
Your sweetness belongs to
your female fans all over the country.

694
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,830
I dare not compete with them.

695
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,110
I’ll call monitor. You call her brother.

696
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,720
Hey.

697
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,750
Why do you get to call her?
I want to call her, too.

698
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,680
You want to call her.
Do you have her number?

699
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,550
How do you call her?

700
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,790
I don’t have
her brother’s number, either.

701
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,200
What else can you do
except for running?

702
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,580
(Yu)

703
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,830
That guy,

704
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,240
Ning Zeyu,

705
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,110
is on good terms with you?

706
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,480
Honestly, he is.

707
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,110
We’ve been classmates for three years.

708
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,240
But our contact is limited to study.

709
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,440
I always regard him as my opponent.

710
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,110
Sooner or later, I’ll surpass him.

711
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,200
Will you wash?

712
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:58,750
Yeah.

713
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,270
That is to say,

714
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,830
Li He,

715
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,680
hasn’t known you for long.

716
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,960
You’ve just became friends.

717
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,110
Ning Zeyu,

718
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,790
is your

719
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
opponent.

720
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,480
Right?

721
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:12,880
Yeah.

722
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,880
Pretty much.

723
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,790
Good.

724
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,100
(Yu)

725
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,660
(Missed Calls)

726
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,400
Can’t you get through to her?

727
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,160
Yeah.

728
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,750
Shall I

729
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,030
go straight to her home?

730
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,440
How can you do that?

731
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,400
Why can’t I?

732
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,110
I’m going to ask her for help
with my homework.

733
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,350
Your homework?

734
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,680
Nobody will believe
your wretched excuse.

735
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,960
What should we do, then?

736
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,920
You can’t get through to her.

737
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,550
Oh, Mom.

738
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,030
He can’t eat so much.

739
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,030
He only eats one-fist-sized

740
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,590
meat, eggs and vegetables every day.

741
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,200
That’s not enough.

742
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,350
Your body needs to
attain nutrition to develop.

743
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,920
Yeah.

744
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,070
Besides, Bear,

745
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,270
you’re thin enough.

746
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,720
You should eat more and
put on some weight.

747
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,110
Yeah.

748
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,240
Mom.

749
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,790
Do you know why I’m so short?

750
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,590
-Boys usually develop late.
-Yuan, have some of these.

751
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,200
Don’t you see Bear is tall?

752
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,000
He had grabbed my food
since we were kids.

753
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,030
Of course he gets tall.

754
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,440
You’re not tall, but you’re fat.

755
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,320
Yeah. That’s true.

756
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,000
You’re right.

757
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,420
(Liar)

758
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,190
You should have more, too.

759
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:21,960
Hello.

760
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,630
You’re skinny, too.

761
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,550
-Who is it?
-As skinny as me.

762
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,480
Haoxi. It’s me. Ning Zeyu.

763
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,670
Ning Zeyu?

764
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,420
I don’t remember there’s

765
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,000
-a liar called Ning Zeyu.
-You eat.

766
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,440
My little friend, please be patient.

767
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,960
Look, what is this?

768
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,110
Is this review material for Grade 10?

769
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,420
(Ning Zeyu:
knowledge points for Grade 10. Zip)

770
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,420
(Summary of Concepts and Laws)

771
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,280
My sister is at home. Not just her,

772
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
there’s another one.

773
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,190
Another one?

774
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,710
Do you have a guest?

775
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
The food is amazing.

776
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:08,960
I must

777
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,630
come to see you often, Auntie.

778
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,920
Great. I’d like you to come
every day.

779
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,760
Thanks, Auntie.

780
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
My mom has invited you, but I haven’t.

781
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,480
You should. Thanks to him,
you have good food.

782
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,030
Haoxi, don’t talk on the phone
during dinner.

783
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,280
Do you hear me?

784
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,670
Gotta go. We’re having dinner.

785
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,510
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Hey.

786
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,000
It’s quite tasty.

787
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,440
Who called you?

788
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,590
Ning Zeyu.

789
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,030
Why did he call you?

790
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,840
To ask if you’re at home.

791
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,320
Why did he call you to ask
if I was at home?

792
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,510
Did you betray me again?

793
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,670
Listen carefully.

794
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
If they ask anything about me again,

795
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,070
don’t tell them.

796
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,630
You should talk to Ning Zeyu.

797
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Why would I talk to him?

798
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,670
I just want to talk to you.

799
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,000
Talk to you.

800
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,020
-Talk to you. Talk to you.
-I don’t want to say anything about you.

801
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh, enough.

802
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,920
We’re having dinner.

803
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,800
Eat your food while it’s warm.
Cold food is bad for your stomach.

804
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah.

805
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:00,960
Well, Mom?

806
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,440
Yeah.

807
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,360
Let’s take a picture together.

808
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,760
Yeah. Good idea.

809
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,230
Come on.

810
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,710
We hardly see Bear.

811
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,280
Yeah.

812
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,710
Three, two, one.

813
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,920
Yeah!

814
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,800
There’re another person.

815
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,280
Does the voice

816
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,070
sound like Ye Jingxi?

817
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,440
Did you hear the voice?

818
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,630
Who else would it be but him?

819
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,880
No, no, no.

820
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,070
We just heard a voice over the phone.

821
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,190
We didn’t see him actually.

822
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,280
We still have hope.

823
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,840
Hopes are shattered.

824
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,340
(Yuan Haoxi: casual visitor comes to
scrounge a free meal)

825
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,660
(Yuan Haoxi: casual visitor comes to
scrounge a free meal)

826
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,590
Mom, I’ll walk Bear out.

827
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,590
Auntie, bye-bye.

828
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,400
Have you had enough?

829
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,030
Of course I have.

830
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Yuan.

831
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,400
Yeah.

832
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,280
The dinner auntie cooked was great.

833
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,800
You must thank her for me.

834
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,000
Oh, come on, you’ve said that
again and again.

835
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
We’re good friends, aren’t we?

836
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,360
Actually, today,

837
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,920
I want to ask you a favor.

838
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,960
What is it?

839
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,110
My company

840
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,070
have got me a movie audition.

841
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:25,550
Yeah.

842
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,190
It’s a story about

843
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,710
a foreign swimmer.

844
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,070
You’re good, Bear. You’ve
marched into the international market.

845
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,630
Oh, thanks.

846
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,630
But you know

847
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,840
I’m not good at English.

848
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,280
I’m afraid I can’t remember
all the actor’s lines.

849
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,110
Don’t worry. I’ll help you.

850
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,110
-Really?
-Really.

851
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,630
You helped me a lot before.

852
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,190
Now it’s my turn to help you.

853
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,800
Well,

854
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,230
I have another presumptuous request.

855
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,710
I wonder if you would promise me.

856
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,630
The audition will take a long time.

857
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,110
I’m afraid I may
fall behind with my study.

858
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,000
So,

859
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,510
could you be my tutor?

860
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:04,760
Hey.

861
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
You mean except for English lines,

862
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,440
you also want me to help you
with your school work, don’t you?

863
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah.

864
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:09,880
OK.

865
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,920
-Really?
-Really.

866
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,510
Great.

867
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,150
Do you want

868
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,230
the three of us

869
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,960
to be Ye Jingxi’s tutors?

870
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,840
Exactly.

871
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,920
He has got an audition
for a foreign movie.

872
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,550
I think

873
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,630
he not only needs someone
to guide him in English,

874
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,150
but also has to
catch up with the study.

875
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,630
So I want Zeyu to do me a favor.

876
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,630
Oh.

877
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,880
What has it got to do with me?

878
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,480
He also needs help to
improve in physical agility.

879
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,960
Aren’t you an expert?

880
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,030
That’s true.

881
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,400
After all, my body fat rate is only 7%.

882
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,440
Yeah.

883
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,800
Even so, I won’t help him.

884
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,110
If you ask me,
you shouldn’t help him, either.

885
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,230
You’ve been helping him
since he transferred to our school.

886
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,550
It’s OK if you help him at school,

887
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,360
but not forcing us to spend
our weekends on helping him?

888
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,150
I’ve told you,

889
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,480
he is my best friend.

890
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
When he needs help,

891
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,840
I must help him.

892
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
He isn’t my friend.

893
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,760
Look at it this way.

894
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,840
While we are helping him,

895
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,280
we’re also improving ourselves.

896
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,670
You…

897
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,280
Just regard him
as your sparring partner.

898
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:14,510
Zeyu.

899
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
While you are tutoring him,

900
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
you also get a chance do your review.

901
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:18,800
It’s good.

902
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,190
I won’t help him.

903
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,280
I will.

904
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,190
He

905
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,000
will help him, too.

906
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,440
Are you out of your mind?

907
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,630
You can help him yourself.
Why do you drag me down?

908
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,190
If you don’t go, I don’t go,

909
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,030
do you want them to
spend time together alone?

910
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,230
-That guy has guessed our intention.
-Oh, I…

911
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,030
Besides, they’ve known each other
since childhood.

912
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,030
Do you still want them to develop
their childhood friendship?

913
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,320
I’m in.

914
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,630
Yeah.

915
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,710
Let’s help him together.

916
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,550
Oh.

917
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,960
Oh. If you don’t want to…

918
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,030
No, no, no. Monitor.

919
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,920
-I’ve been helpful since I was a child.
-Oh, no, no, no.

920
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,630
-It’s a great merit to help people.
-No, no, no.

921
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,880
Roses given to others,
fragrance left on your hand.

922
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
Rest assured. You can count on us.

923
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,710
Absolutely.

924
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,230
Really?

925
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:16,920
I

926
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,030
love to help people.

927
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,040
Oh?

928
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah.

929
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,670
OK.

930
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,110
Then, I…

931
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,280
Go.

932
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,550
I’m leaving.

933
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,670
No problem.

934
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,800
Let’s make an appointment later.

935
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,110
Oh, OK. Then, I’m leaving now.

936
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,510
