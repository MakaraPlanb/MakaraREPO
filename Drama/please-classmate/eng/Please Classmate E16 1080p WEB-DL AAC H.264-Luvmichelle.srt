How about steaming a fish?

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,040
Why do we steam a fish?

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,920
The adults are absent
and we should eat junk food.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,640
You don’t do exercises, right?

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,430
Don’t you know junk food is not good?

22
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,200
I don’t know.

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,350
What are you doing?

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
There’re my fans in front.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Fans? How’s that possible?

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Quiet down. They’d hear you.

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Ye Jingxi.

28
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,240
You’re not a big star here.
Nobody knows you.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,590
Just accept the reality, okay?

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,030
Let’s go.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Stop. Bear.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,590
You mustn’t eat this.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,840
You’ll regret it.

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,080
Why?

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,560
Because the spicy flavor is better.

36
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,150
I think so.

37
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,660
Hurry.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,750
-Hey.
-What?

39
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,910
Who’s that naughty kid?

40
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,910
I don’t know him.

41
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,630
And who’s the fool that

42
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,310
seems to have never visited
a supermarket?

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,030
Just a passerby.

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,030
Good one.

45
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,800
What’s wrong with you?

46
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,000
What’s wrong with you?

47
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,080
I’m buying meat.

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,520
This meat is too expensive.
Just pay for freshness.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,470
Don’t waste money.

50
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,150
This... This isn’t expensive, is it?

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,030
This is not expensive?
Check out the price.

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,850
Hurry up! My sister’s in trouble.

53
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,870
My sister will be driven mad soon.

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,250
Have a try.

55
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,640
This is imported.

56
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,150
Mine is delicious.

57
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,000
Have a taste of mine.

58
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,610
Try my product.

59
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,240
Yuan Caixi.

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
What are you doing?

61
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,510
Ah! Thanks, Aunt. No more, please.

62
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,560
Thanks, aunt. Bye.

63
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,750
Bye.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,590
Thanks, Aunt. Please, no more.

65
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,300
Thanks. Please don’t give me more.

66
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,390
Thank you, Aunt. Thanks.

67
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,080
-Have a try.
-Have one.

68
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,060
Try this. It’s imported from Australia.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
Wow. This is tasty.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Yuan Haoxi, close the gate.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,160
I can get hungry as well.

72
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,480
It’s fine. I’ll cook for you.

73
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,310
I’ll definitely fill you up.

74
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,950
Why it’s you who’ll cook for Yuan?

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,390
I can too.

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,070
Wow. That’s great.

77
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,870
You can cook together.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,800
We didn’t say we’d cook for you.

79
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,560
If my sister gets to eat,
then I should either.

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,950
Great. Then the two of us

81
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,800
can sit and wait for dinner?

82
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,190
Rest assured.

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,800
Take some rest.

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,680
-Okay.
-Let me.

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,750
Then, we’ll leave now.

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,240
Go. Yuan.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Trust me.

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,800
Caixi,

89
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,920
will they set the kitchen on fire?

90
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,560
Don’t burn the house down.

91
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,310
-No problem. Don’t worry.
-Don’t worry.

92
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,390
Two steaks.

93
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,870
Ye Jingxi,

94
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,630
since I have sportsmanship,

95
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,160
to ensure the fairness in competition,

96
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,240
I’m obligated to tell you that

97
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,360
my cooking skill

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,070
is inherited from my family.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,040
I also have the obligation to warn you

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,160
that I used to live abroad.

101
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,870
Those who have lived abroad have

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,160
cooking skills
that are rigorously tested

103
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,310
Besides,

104
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,120
though you may have cooking skills
inherited from the family,

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,480
I’m the one who knows Yuan

106
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,240
most thoroughly.

107
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,360
Do you know which food Yuan likes

108
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,430
and which she hates?

109
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,310
You don’t, right?

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,950
Is this a challenge?

111
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,830
Will you accept it?

112
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,830
Sure.

113
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,750
I think they’re in a competition now.

114
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,600
Let’s make a bet!

115
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,430
Tell me the conditions first.

116
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,750
Throwing trash for a week.

117
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,070
Plus doing dishes.

118
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,390
Throwing trash and doing dishes?

119
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:53,390
Are you scared?

120
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,750
I’m fearless.

121
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,040
That’s the deal, then.

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,750
Throwing trash plus doing dishes.

123
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,430
For a week.

124
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,680
Okay. Who will you bet on?

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
Definitely, Ye Jingxi.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
He lived abroad for so long.

127
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,430
How can he still not cook?

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,630
That’s a convincing reason.

129
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,560
But,

130
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,680
my bet is on Li He.

131
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,310
Yuan Caixi.

132
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,430
What is your favorite hand-cream flavor?

133
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
I guess

134
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,070
your hands will get coarse

135
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
in the next week.

136
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,630
Save the hand-cream to yourself.

137
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,000
You’re destined to lose, Yuan Caixi.

138
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,960
He’s so naive.

139
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,870
Where’s sugar?

140
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,390
It runs out.

141
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,870
Why don’t you tell me before
you use up all the sugar?

142
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,870
How could I know you need it?

143
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
Don’t you know that sugar

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,910
is a must-have ingredient in cooking?

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,630
I don’t.

146
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Why are you so angry?

147
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,510
It’s just sugar.

148
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,240
You can find a replacement.

149
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,750
Why don’t you use a replacement?

150
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,030
I’m making dessert.

151
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,270
I’m making braised chicken wings.

152
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,120
We just run out of sugar. So what?

153
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,480
Ye Jingxi, you’re so despicable.

154
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
You suggested the competition.

155
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,150
I competed fairly.
But you used all the sugar.

156
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,600
How can I compete with you?

157
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,120
We can both use sugar.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
I didn’t know you need it.

159
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,600
Besides,

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,790
you can make another dish.

161
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,480
You really think you’re a star, right?

162
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,910
You really think you’re a star?

163
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,360
What do you mean?

164
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,750
You don’t have privileges here.

165
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,270
-No privileges.
-I’ll teach you a lesson today.

166
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,240
Teach me?

167
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,840
Yes. I’ll teach you a lesson!

168
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,240
Come! Teach me then!

169
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,550
-Come!
-Come on!

170
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,720
-Come on.
-I’ll get you.

171
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,480
-Come on.
-Don’t move.

172
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,540
(Zeyu)

173
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,200
Zeyu, how’s your training?

174
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,150
I’m doing great. How about you?

175
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
We?

176
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,050
Come here.

177
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,920
Are you a man or not?

178
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,120
We’ll soon find out
if we can live to see tomorrow

179
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,360
without getting food poisoning
or having the house burnt down.

180
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
Dare you hit me again?

181
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,510
So what?

182
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,080
Ye Jingxi, you really
see yourself as a star, right?

183
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
Let’s fight till death!

184
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,910
Caixi. Caixi. Caixi.

185
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
They’re going to fight!

186
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,270
What?

187
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:32,960
Caixi.

188
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,270
Zeyu, I’ll have to go now.

189
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,750
Monitor.

190
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,910
-Caixi.
-Let go.

191
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,550
Caixi.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,480
What are you doing?

193
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,550
Li He, let go.

194
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,720
What’s going on?

195
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,840
Ask him. He used up all the sugar.

196
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,270
How many times I’ve told you?

197
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,080
I didn’t know you need sugar.

198
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,600
You didn’t know?

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,080
Wait a second.

200
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,360
So you mean

201
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
you used up

202
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the sugar he needs.

203
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,200
Yes.

204
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,200
So you can’t cook?

205
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,270
Yes.

206
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,510
Caixi.

207
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,440
What’s the flavor of
the hand-cream you like?

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,200
Can’t you grow up?

209
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,750
If you want to cook,
just behave and cook.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
Why are you tearing my house apart?

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,840
Well...

212
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,550
Well.

213
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,600
What will you do without sugar?

214
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,000
I’ll figure it out myself.

215
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,720
Are you sure?

216
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,320
What else can I do?

217
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,150
Before we eat,

218
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,390
my sister and I made a bet

219
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,480
to decide which of you cooks better.

220
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,440
Monitor.

221
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,480
Who’s your bet on?

222
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,550
That doesn’t matter.

223
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,240
What’s important is to see
who cooks better now.

224
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,790
Wait a second.

225
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,200
Why is Yuan the judge

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
of your bet?

227
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,390
That’s fine.

228
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
After all,

229
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,440
Yuan definitely favors me.

230
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,750
Cut out the nonsense.

231
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,510
Aren’t you stupid?

232
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,630
If we both are the judges,

233
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,120
we can’t get a result
until tomorrow morning.

234
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,870
So,

235
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,270
I chose the best way.

236
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,910
Yes.

237
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,320
A blind taste test.

238
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,550
A blind taste test.

239
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,390
Okay.

240
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,150
Okay, Caixi.

241
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,870
Have we finished?

242
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,000
How’s it?

243
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,840
It’s finished?

244
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,480
Yes.

245
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,750
Then I’ll announce
my favorite dish first.

246
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,270
Chicken wings.

247
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,080
And...?

248
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,790
The second favorite is

249
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,000
the steak.

250
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,270
The third one is

251
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,320
stir-fried eggs with tomato.

252
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,270
The fourth is the cupcake.

253
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,080
Because the cupcakes are too sweet.

254
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Oh.

255
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,150
Who made the steak?

256
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,200
I find it so familiar.

257
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,480
Bear.

258
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,030
You made it?

259
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,390
Yes.

260
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,000
Because you used to like the steakhouse
when you were a kid.

261
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,030
So, I made one

262
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,240
according to its taste.

263
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,670
Oh.

264
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,200
We haven’t been to
the restaurant for a while.

265
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,270
It’s fine.

266
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,510
From now on,
I can make it for you every day.

267
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,510
Ah!

268
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,960
I shouldn’t have said
that cupcakes are too sweet.

269
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,910
Are they?

270
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,630
But these were your favorites
when you were a kid.

271
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,840
When she was a kid?

272
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,270
Things are different now.

273
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,360
We like junk food when we were kids.

274
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,030
But junk food is bad.

275
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,960
But,

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
you cooked

277
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,840
these two dishes?

278
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,550
Yes.

279
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,480
Really?

280
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,960
Of course.

281
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,030
It’s the inherited cooking skills
of Li Family.

282
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,440
Wow.

283
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,510
How do you know that
my sister likes chicken wings

284
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,510
and stir-fried eggs with tomato?

285
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,670
Well.

286
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,550
Your sister has a small appetite.

287
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,480
Whenever the canteen
serves chicken wings,

288
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,720
she can eat more rice.

289
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,600
It’s the same with
stir-fried eggs with tomato.

290
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,080
She prefers home-style dishes.

291
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,150
She likes vegetables.

292
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,480
She likes baby cabbages.

293
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,440
She doesn’t eat eggplants,
green onions or peppers.

294
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,630
Right?

295
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,320
This is so scary.

296
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
Are you hiding in our house?

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
I hide under your bed.

298
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,750
Yuan.

299
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,550
Your food preference has changed a lot.

300
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,550
Well.

301
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
You...

302
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,870
How did you make this without sugar?

303
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
How dare you even bring that up?

304
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,960
I made it with this.

305
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,270
I planned on making
braised chicken wings.

306
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,440
But there was no sugar.

307
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,600
Luckily, there was a coke in the fridge.

308
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,550
So I made cola chicken wings with it.

309
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,750
Somehow, my cola chicken wings

310
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,390
are even better than
braised chicken wings.

311
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,270
Thank you.

312
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,910
It’s over. It’s over.

313
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,120
It’s over now.

314
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,510
This time,

315
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,390
Li He wins by huge margins.

316
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,390
It’s so good to have you, bro.

317
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,000
With you in my life,
everything’s so bright.

318
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,030
I’m winner in the race,

319
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,120
in the bicycle race,

320
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,360
and even in the cooking competition.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,750
I’m about to fall in love with myself.

322
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
Go away.

323
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,510
Bear.

324
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,670
I’m so disappointed in you.

325
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,120
Wait a second.

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,840
You mean you bet on me?

327
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,910
Yuan bet on him?

328
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,150
Of course.

329
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,630
For the first time in life,

330
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,320
I felt I was smarter than my sister.

331
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,120
No. Let’s compete again.

332
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,000
Forget it.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,840
This one doesn’t count.

334
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,550
Forget it!

335
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,630
Don’t waste our time.

336
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,840
Because of you,

337
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,320
I need to wash the dishes.

338
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,720
You have to do it with me later.

339
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,080
It’s really so delicious?
I don’t believe it.

340
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,700
Well.

341
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Hum.

342
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
I didn’t expect you to be a good cook.

343
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
In my family,

344
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,390
my mom is the most important person.

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,440
To please my mom,

346
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,600
my dad, who previously couldn’t
tell onion, garlic, and ginger apart,

347
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,320
put a lot of effort in learning to cook.

348
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,480
He cooked a variety of dishes for my mom

349
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
and he forced me to learn from him.

350
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,870
He said that

351
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,600
when he’s not home,

352
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,550
I can cook for mom.

353
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,550
It’s great to

354
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,630
have a dad.

355
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,030
I’m sorry.

356
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,960
Did I say something I shouldn’t say?

357
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,070
No. You don’t have to apologize to me.

358
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,310
You know it as well.

359
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,440
When I was a child,

360
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,310
my dad passed away.

361
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,550
My mom raised Yuan Haoxi and me
on her own.

362
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,400
She’s still single.

363
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,960
Though she never says so,

364
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,880
I know

365
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,510
she feels bitter inside.

366
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,590
She’s jealous about those kids
who have a father.

367
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
It’s fine, Yuan Caixi.

368
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,310
From now on, I’m your...

369
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,640
What?

370
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,590
I’m your personal cook.

371
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,830
I’ll cook whatever you want for you,

372
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,830
from Western styles to Chinese cuisines,
from sweet to salty.

373
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,240
I can cook for you

374
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,440
whatever you order.

375
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,830
Thanks.

376
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,030
Are you feeling cold?

377
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,270
I...

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,920
Yuan Caixi.

379
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:13,920
Yes.

380
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,270
Actually, I...

381
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:22,920
I li...

382
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
Caixi, come on.

383
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,480
The star will perform now.

384
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,110
Yes.

385
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,070
I’m coming.

386
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,260
Bye.

387
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,960
Bye-bye.

388
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,030
Come on. Hurry.

389
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,960
-Bye, Yuan.
-Bye-bye.

390
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,830
Hum. You made me wash the dishes.

391
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:54,960
See you tomorrow.

392
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,340
Thank you.

393
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,440
Let’s go. Let’s go.

394
00:20:58,790 --> 00:20:59,590
Bye, Yuan.

395
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,480
I didn’t expect that

396
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,440
you play the piano so well.

397
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,110
It seems that Yuan was fascinated by

398
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,960
the cola chicken wings you made.

399
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,550
How can I not show off a bit?

400
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,110
So, you did it on purpose.

401
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,960
So cunning.

402
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,160
I’ve never seen Yuan

403
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,830
so close to a guy.

404
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,680
But I can tell that

405
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
she’s really happy.

406
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,110
Maybe, that’s the reason

407
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,160
I was in a hurry to impress her.

408
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,110
Don’t worry, man.

409
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
There are many beauties in the world.

410
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,440
You

411
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
just focus on

412
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,920
study,

413
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,640
playing the piano.

414
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,160
Just let me care for

415
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,680
monitor.

416
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,200
Get over yourself!

417
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,480
I said this

418
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
not because I’d give up on Yuan.

419
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Don’t you find it weird that

420
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,960
we can still be friends

421
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,350
when we like the same girl?

422
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,440
No, I don’t.

423
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,680
Why?

424
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
Because you don’t have any friend.

425
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,270
I...

426
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,030
I’m just kidding.

427
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,960
When it comes to friends,

428
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
quality overcomes quantity.

429
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,310
You’ve got me.

430
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,550
You only need me.

431
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,440
You would be great as an actor.

432
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,790
Why?

433
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,440
You’re so shameless.

434
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,070
Ye Jingxi, listen.

435
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,400
If I have the opportunities you have,

436
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
I’ll be a more famous star than you’re.

437
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:46,580
Yep.

438
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,070
Did you hear me?

439
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,720
You? Just look at yourself.

440
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,350
-Well.
-Take a look at yourself.

441
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,110
Who are you? You can’t even act.

442
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,000
Can you run faster than me?

443
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,160
Is that you?

444
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,350
It’s so early in the morning.

445
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,270
Jingxi.

446
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,030
What’s going on?

447
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,960
Bad news.

448
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,000
What?

449
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,880
Bad news!

450
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,270
Does Ye Jingxi live here?

451
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,790
Is Ye Jingxi living with a girl?

452
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,750
Can you explain it?

453
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,120
Please explain it.

454
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,790
Caixi.

455
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,830
Caixi.

456
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,790
Caixi.

457
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,750
Stop it for now.

458
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,750
What’s your problem, Yuan Haoxi?

459
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,480
-Hurry. Come on.
-You.

460
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,110
What’s the problem, Yuan Haoxi?

461
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,830
What’s going on?

462
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,240
Caixi, can’t you see them?

463
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,240
What?

464
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,750
They scared me when I opened the door.

465
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,590
What did you do?

466
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,440
What’s the problem?

467
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,240
Caixi.

468
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,070
See it for yourself.

469
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,240
Well.

470
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,350
Where did they get these photos?

471
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,000
I live with Ye Jingxi?

472
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,590
What nonsense!

473
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,110
Caixi, I saw another one today.

474
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,960
Let me read it to you.

475
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,550
Since famous idol, Ye Jingxi,

476
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,680
returned to Sen Yong High School
for study,

477
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,590
he temporarily left the big screen.

478
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,550
ENT Xiaoba thought
he returned school for study,

479
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,440
but recently he was found

480
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,310
going in and out of a house
with a girl several times.

481
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,350
Caixi. This...

482
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,160
It’s talking about you.

483
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,110
I’ll talk to them.

484
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,350
No. Caixi, don’t go.

485
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,640
You mustn’t talk to them now.

486
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,310
Explanations only make things worse now.

487
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
Just stay here.

488
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,000
They will forget this thing soon.

489
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,680
How can I just stay here and do nothing?

490
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,550
They say Ye Jingxi and I
live together now.

491
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,000
That’s so exaggerated.

492
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
Ye Jingxi. Ye Jingxi. Ye Jingxi.

493
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,640
Sorry, we don’t take any interview.

494
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,400
We don’t do interview nor
answer questions.

495
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,070
Caixi.

496
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,270
Just listen to me. Don’t go.

497
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,200
Hello, Bear.

498
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,270
Don’t go online. Don’t go outside.
Do you hear me?

499
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,270
Let’s explain it immediately.

500
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,550
Just don’t go online or leave the house.
Wait for my words.

501
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,440
Hello?

502
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,720
Thankfully, Mom isn’t home.

503
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,400
We don’t do any interview. Thanks.

504
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,790
Make room. Excuse me. Thanks.

505
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,140
-Ye Jingxi.
-Don’t go, Ye Jingxi.

506
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,400
No way.

507
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,510
Reporters break in through the window?

508
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,880
-Li He.
-Li He.

509
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,640
Get down.

510
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,480
What are you doing there?
We won’t.

511
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,070
-Hurry up.
-There’s no one at the back.

512
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,400
There’s no one at the back.

513
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,720
Wait for me.

514
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,310
Slow down. Shut the door.

515
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,830
Let’s go.

516
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,070
Slow down.

517
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,790
-This way.
-This way.

518
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,270
That’s them. Hurry.

519
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,790
That’s them. That’s the girl.

520
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,640
Stop!

521
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,830
Don’t chase me.
Don’t take photos of me.

522
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,030
Don’t chase me.

523
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,000
No! Don’t!

524
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,260
No!

525
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,400
-Can we interview you?
-Don’t leave.

526
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,200
Ah! Caixi, wait for me.

527
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,030
News broke out this morning.

528
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,510
The whole internet is saying that
Ye Jingxi and my sister...

529
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,510
Live together.

530
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,720
Don’t mind me.

531
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,510
I’ve read the news hundreds of times.

532
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,680
Something new came up.

533
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,070
What is this?

534
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,680
(ENT Xiaoba)
Live together? Nonsense.

535
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,060
(Zeyu)

536
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,590
They’re cooking up rumors.

537
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,680
Hello, Zeyu.

538
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,830
Hello.

539
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,640
Where are you? Are you all right?

540
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
I just saw the news.

541
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,750
I’m fine. I’m at Li He’s place.

542
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,000
That’s great then.

543
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,720
I did some digging.

544
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,790
I found some evidence.

545
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,030
I’ll send it to you right now.
Take a look.

546
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,640
This photo is the culprit.

547
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,350
These rumors were started by it.

548
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,830
Isn’t this our house?

549
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,510
Yes.

550
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,510
I remember.

551
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,270
I posted this photo to my Qzone.

552
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,830
I saw it in your Qzone too.

553
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,480
(Yuan Haoxi)
But you and Aunt were also in it.

554
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,790
Yes.

555
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,240
My mom and I were also in the photo.

556
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,880
The photo was edited.

557
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,680
They did it to create misunderstandings.

558
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,510
They edited you and Aunt out of
the photo on purpose.

559
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:50,000
Who would do such a thing?

560
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,200
I don’t know who it is.

561
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,550
But it must be someone

562
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,350
who has access to your Qzone.

563
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,160
(Yu Xiaoba)

564
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,680
Since famous idol, Ye Jingxi,

565
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,750
returned to Sen Yong High School
for study,

566
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,230
he temporarily left the big screen.

567
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,750
What happened?

568
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,070
But a photo was found today
which led to heated discussions.

569
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,720
In the photo, Ye Jingxi stayed in
the same room with the girl

570
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,310
and had dinner with her.

571
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,750
-He was suspected for living with her.
-Ye Jingxi and his classmates.

572
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,600
Currently, Ye Jingxi and his agency

573
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,830
haven’t responded to the incident.

574
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,240
WeSee will continue to
bring you more updates.

575
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,510
Why isn’t it me?

576
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,550
Pan Hao, you’re here too.

577
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,400
Have you heard the news?

578
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,160
Pan Hao.

579
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,160
Hello?

580
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,790
So many people can read my Qzone.

581
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,000
-How can I know who it is?
-Let’s find him.

582
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,110
It doesn’t matter who he is now.

583
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,350
Maybe others appropriated the photo
and posted it to other social medias.

584
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,790
Even if we know who it is,

585
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,070
we can’t solve the problem.

586
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,720
So what?

587
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,590
Let’s post the original photo first.

588
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,240
Then everything will come to light.

589
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,030
I’ve already sent the photo
to Ye Jingxi.

590
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,400
His team will soon issue a statement

591
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,590
to explain it.

592
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,160
Ah! Jingxi.

593
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,310
This is the original photo.

594
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,270
Hurry and send it to Ms. Hua.

595
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,160
I know.

596
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,590
Ning Zeyu sent this to me.

597
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,160
Yuan said they’ll repost it
after I send it.

598
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,160
Okay.

599
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,440
Then send it to Ms. Hua.

600
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,790
Of course.

601
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,310
Ms. Hua is already working on a plan

602
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,160
with the publicity team.

603
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,550
But I have to participate the activity.

604
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,270
This is my work.

605
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,200
Okay.

606
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,200
How can one gossip have so much power?

607
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,110
Why don’t we just cancel it?

608
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,160
Why would I?

609
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,480
There are people here.

610
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,720
As long as there’s one supporter left,

611
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,590
I have to continue working hard.

612
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
Jingxi.

613
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,680
Keep the distance. Excuse me.

614
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,750
-Jingxi, we trust you.
-Excuse us.

615
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,260
(Jingxi, our beloved idol)

616
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,480
Thank you.

617
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,310
Thank you for coming.

618
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,920
Jingxi, we trust you.

619
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,480
Thanks.

620
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,790
Jingxi, go for it!

621
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,480
Jingxi, I trust you.

622
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,440
Thank you.

623
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

624
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,680
Thanks.

625
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,310
We’ll always support you.

626
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,400
(Jingxi, I like you.)
Jingxi,

627
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,270
have something sweet.
It can cheer you up.

628
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:26,400
Thanks.

629
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,440
Come on!

630
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,000
Cheer up!

631
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,200
Jingxi, we trust you.

632
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,400
Thank you for coming.

633
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,200
Jingxi, thank you for your work!
Go for it.

634
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,790
Thanks.

635
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
-Thank you.
-Bye.

636
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,110
-Thank you.
-Come on.

637
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,160
Thanks.

638
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,440
Bye.

639
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,480
Drink more warm water, Jingxi.

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,310
-Take care of yourself.
-Thanks.

641
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,750
Such ridiculous articles!

642
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,030
Can you find out who posted those?

643
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,110
Bawan, the publicity division
is looking for you.

644
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,920
Okay. Jingxi, I’ll go now.

645
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,310
We must take those articles down.

646
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,440
It’s mere nonsense.

647
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,880
How can Jingxi do such a thing?

648
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,400
Mr. Lin, don’t worry.

649
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,880
We’ve found the original photo.

650
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,720
We can fix this problem soon.

651
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,030
Yes. Mr. Lin, don’t worry.

652
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,270
Jingxi’s sponsorship won’t be affected.

653
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,720
We’ll take care of this problem.

654
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,440
Sit.

655
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,880
Before you returned to Sen Yong,
I’ve warmed you that

656
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,750
you get a different level of attention
because of your identity.

657
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,200
You’re a student on the campus.
You must be careful.

658
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,960
You thought things are simple.

659
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,830
That’s just your delusion.

660
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,070
You skipped Miss Rou’s class.

661
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,640
And you insisted on
letting your classmates tutor you.

662
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,550
I scolded you. But you ignored me.

663
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,920
When you had food poisoning,

664
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,720
I said this not only to you,
but also to your classmates.

665
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,920
You’d better keep your distance.

666
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,480
That’s the way to protect you both.

667
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,030
Have I said this to you or not?

668
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,920
Yes.

669
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:08,760
But what’s the outcome?

670
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,440
Look what has happened!

671
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,510
Ms. Hua.

672
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
Those were fabricated.

673
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,110
I just had a dinner
at Yuan Caixi’s place.

674
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
You saw that too.

675
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,710
Besides, I always tell you where I go,

676
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,550
whom I visit, and when I’ll come back

677
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,710
except that time I asked Yuan Caixi
to help me practice audition.

678
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,030
I’ve reported all the other events
to you.

679
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,440
Things have gone so far.

680
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,760
I also feel wronged.

681
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,320
But when we were together,

682
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,670
we always have at least
three people in a room.

683
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,070
We’ve never stayed in a room alone.

684
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,800
I’ve never expected this to happen.

685
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,880
Now, we’ve found the original photo.

686
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,320
Ms. Hua, tell me what to do.

687
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,760
I’ll do my best to cooperate.

688
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,440
Ms. Hua, publicity company’s statement

689
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,630
has got more and more reposts.

690
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,880
There are 80,000 reposts in total now.

691
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,840
Ask the publicity team to press ahead.

692
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,920
Okay.

693
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,180
(Ye Jingxi Studio’s statement)

694
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,510
Ye Jingxi’s team has issued
a publicity statement.

695
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,760
Well.

696
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,230
Log in your accounts,

697
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,480
repost it and comment below it

698
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,510
to give it better exposure.

699
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,590
Ah. Okay.

700
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Just as what I told you,

701
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,480
you don’t need to explain, right?

702
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,840
Thankfully, you said nothing.

703
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,550
If you show up,

704
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,880
the whole world will know your presence.

705
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,320
Don’t be mad.

706
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,320
Have some water.

707
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,630
I just don’t get it.

708
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,440
Why would someone cook up
such rumors so maliciously?

709
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,510
Why do you have so many questions?

710
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,550
We’re not taking a test or anything.

711
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,800
We athletes know that

712
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,230
sportsmanship means
being just, fair, and open.

713
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,510
But people still take dopes,

714
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,880
do match fixing.

715
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,400
People even harm others on purpose
in the field.

716
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,480
Sometimes, people are willing to

717
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,800
break every rule

718
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,960
to obtain what they want.

719
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,800
So,

720
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,630
that’s just the reality.

721
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,840
It’s no use trying to figure out why.

722
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,510
If you’re right,

723
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,150
we really can’t hold that person
accountable?

724
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,280
That’s not entirely true.

725
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,710
Think about it.

726
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,510
That person did this

727
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,960
because he wants to make Ye Jingxi sad

728
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,230
and make you unhappy.

729
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,630
If you’re really affected
by this incident,

730
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,280
then you’re giving him what he wants.

731
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,070
We can’t control others.

732
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,710
But we can adjust ourselves.

733
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
This is not our fault.

734
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,280
Why should we punish ourselves?

735
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,590
So, monitor,

736
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,030
cheer up.

737
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,670
Be happy.

738
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,760
Let’s catch this person together

739
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,320
and hold him accountable
for what he did.

740
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,760
Okay?

741
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Yes.

742
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,710
Caixi.

743
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,590
Come over here.

744
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,550
