00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,500
Good morning, teacher.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,790
Hi. Hello. Morning.

19
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,350
-Good morning, teacher.
-Good morning.

20
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,840
-Good morning, teacher.
-Good morning, teacher.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,870
Be careful on riding.

22
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,790
Morning, Mr. Ma.

24
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,200
Hi, morning.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,710
Morning.

26
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,840
The first day of school.

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,230
During the crucial time,

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,640
all of you may take a step back.

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,280
You will be classmates

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,630
with the PE students.

31
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,190
As representatives of academic students,

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,000
you should set an example.

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,190
Don’t be misled by Li He.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,870
You know?

35
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,120
Yes, Mr. Ma. Got it.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
OK. Go get in.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,180
Hi, Mr. Ma.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,630
Watch out. Watch out!

39
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,280
-OK. OK.
-Go ahead.

40
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,910
What are you doing? Jiang Yuan, come on.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
No, it’s not my problem.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A bit back. Come back.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,470
Wait. Wait a second.

44
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,360
Long, Long is missing. Jiang Yuan.

45
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,750
Let it be. Leave him alone.

46
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,150
Come here first. Come on.

47
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,310
OK. I’m coming.

48
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,080
Which one?

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,280
Math.

50
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,560
Zeyu.

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,960
Yuan, rescue the life.

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,470
I’ve rescued you for over 100 times.

53
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,280
Thank you.

54
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,400
Don’t leave after the class.
I will comment the paper for you.

55
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,190
OK.

56
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,870
Good morning.

57
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,150
Stand up.

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,560
Good morning, teacher.

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,430
Please sit down.

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,560
It’s the first day of the school.

61
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,280
All of you, cheer up and listen to me.

62
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,400
Let’s review the past tense
and the past participle.

63
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,150
Lie, it means telling a lie.

64
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,360
This is its room form.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,190
The past tense is lied.
It’s very simple.

66
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,840
The past participle is also lied.

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
How do we use lie to make a sentence?

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,240
He lied to me that
he had completed the homework.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,030
Lay.

70
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,560
Laid is its past tense.
Currently, laying.

71
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,680
Who set an example last class?

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
For example,

73
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,680
he laid the baby

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,560
on the bed.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,800
The other word,

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,870
we often use it.

77
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,600
Rise.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,720
Its past tense is rose.

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,120
A flower.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,430
The past tense of rise is rose.

81
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,920
What is it? It’s a kind of flower?

82
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,680
Jiang Yuan.

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,240
A. A. C. B. D. D.

84
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
This thing is innovative.

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,390
Did you learn it from Mr. Bai?

86
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
Ah, no.

87
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,800
I’m sorry, teacher.

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,310
If you dare to sleep in class again,

89
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,070
you’ll be punished
with no training for two days.

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
I will correct at once.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Why didn’t you call me?

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,390
I did, but you didn’t hear me.

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
OK. Class is over.

94
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,680
Monitor.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,950
Go to my office to get the paper.

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,630
OK.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,190
It’s a bit heavy.

98
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,120
I’ll ask a PE student. Li He.

99
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,800
Will you come?

100
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,270
I don’t want to.

101
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,830
I will go with you.

102
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,310
I will go. I will go with you.

103
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,160
Sit!

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,190
Monitor.

105
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,070
The paper won’t run away.
Why are you so anxious?

106
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:51,870
Monitor.

107
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,720
There’s only one year left
for high school.

108
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,510
I advise us to be together in peace.

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,070
Otherwise, time will be hard for you.

110
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
I won’t offend you without a reason.

111
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,070
But if you insist on offending me,

112
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,510
I won’t let you off easily.

113
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,240
I’m offending you.

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,630
What can you do?

115
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,430
Hey, Zeyu.

116
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,120
Zeyu.

117
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,390
Thank you.

118
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,630
I’d have fallen off if it weren’t you.

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,510
My pleasure.

120
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,160
Actually, I get much exercise

121
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,630
and have a good sense of balance.

122
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,510
But today, I don’t know why

123
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,000
I’m a bit nervous on seeing you.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,750
Nervous?

125
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,040
My heart beat becomes faster.

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,870
It may be because of lacking of sleep.

127
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,040
You can have an early rest later on.

128
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,240
Doing so

129
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
can ensure clear mind.

130
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,840
Is it funny?

131
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
I feel this is funny.

132
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,790
What are you laughing at?

133
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,910
Why? Can’t I?

134
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,550
You know nothing. Why laughing?

135
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,550
I’m curious.

136
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,600
What’s wrong?

137
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,120
I even can’t laugh here?

138
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,510
Smelly Sneakers.

139
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,150
What did you say?

140
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,360
Who are you talking about?

141
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,600
You guys.

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,510
Smelly Sneakers.

143
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,390
Hey, why?

144
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,440
Make it clear.

145
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,910
Smelly Sneakers. I mean both of you.

146
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,870
What are you doing?

147
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,360
-Hey.
-Hey, what?

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,910
What’s wrong?

149
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,480
Hey.

150
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,750
Why did you throw away my sneakers?

151
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,750
I don’t need you.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,510
You are almost losing your breath.

153
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,510
I don’t need you even so. Give it to me.

154
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,630
Don’t flaunt your superiority.

155
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,440
A boy should help a girl.

156
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,670
This is what I should do.

157
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,480
You weren’t so gentleman before.

158
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,870
It’s not because of you.

159
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,390
That’s for negligence.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let’s forget it.

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,440
What’s going on?

162
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,480
What’s wrong?

163
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,390
Your sneakers?

164
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,270
Who throw them away?

165
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,960
Nobody else.

166
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,080
You did?

167
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,670
Just a pair of sneakers.

168
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,910
They’re smelly and ratty.

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,630
What’s more,
can you put them in the classroom?

170
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,910
So what if they were thrown away?

171
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,000
They’re smelly and ratty.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,240
But they’re ours.

173
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Think more of others.

174
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,080
Can we throw away your books, pen bag,

175
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,240
or school bag without your consent?

176
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,270
Is it comparable?

177
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,480
Did I ask you?

178
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,360
Then shut up!

179
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,750
Who did it? Stand out!

180
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
It’s me.

181
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,750
Get them back.

182
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,360
Don’t go too far.

183
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,320
They’re rubbish.

184
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,240
So they should be at the right place.

185
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,150
Say it again.

186
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,750
Li He.

187
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,240
-Calm down.
-Li He.

188
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,360
A fight would be a big deal.

189
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,080
Huang Yuan.

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,390
Pick them up first.

191
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,120
Attend the class now.

192
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,270
No way.

193
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,320
Pick them.

194
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,550
Are they yours?

195
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,840
-Keep them well.
-Thank you.

196
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,910
You really want to make it big?

197
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,720
It’s not your style.

198
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Go back to your seat.

199
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,790
Class begins.

200
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,960
Apologize.

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,600
Are you done?

202
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,360
I ask her to apologize.

203
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,870
Huang Yuan.

204
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,270
Make an apology.

205
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,510
You did do it wrong.

206
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,550
Sorry.

207
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,910
Go.

208
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,030
It’s your turn.

209
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,360
What?

210
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,390
Apologize.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,550
Why?

212
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,120
You know why.

213
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,960
You kicked trash can like that.

214
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
Sorry.

215
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Remember.

216
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,840
Don’t let such things happen again.

217
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,750
You’d better give the sneakers to me.

218
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,120
I will keep them well for you.

219
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,670
We come in and go out.

220
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,720
It’s no good if it hits someone

221
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,630
or others make your sneakers dirty.

222
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,750
Stand up!

223
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,480
Good morning, teacher.

224
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,360
Sit down please.

225
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,720
Please turn to page nine.

226
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,080
Yun Xiang, put them in.

227
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
-Yun Xiang.
-Clean them after school.

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,670
Only you.

229
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
Come on, guys.
Time for running exercise.

230
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,670
It’s just the first day.

231
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,390
But things happened like that.

232
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,550
But

233
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,750
Huang Yuan really did wrong.

234
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,390
Pan Hao’s words are too harsh.

235
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,630
I really don’t know what is in his mind.

236
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,320
Pan Hao?

237
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,440
Li He.

238
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,080
What?

239
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,510
Look at him,

240
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,790
stubborn and harsh.

241
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,510
It’s just the beginning of school.

242
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,360
They may fight often.

243
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,510
Yuan.

244
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,480
What’s wrong with you?

245
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
-I just…
-What?

246
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,870
It’s the first day of my period.

247
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,200
Why didn’t you ask for leave?

248
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,320
It’s improper.

249
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:42,870
Yuan.

250
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,400
What?

251
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,510
Luckily, I have prepared it.

252
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
-Go ahead.
-No, thanks.

253
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,480
Yuan Caixi.

254
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,390
Yes?

255
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,510
Are you OK?

256
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,080
It’s a long way. Do you need to rest?

257
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,870
I’m fine.

258
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,600
I’m alright.

259
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,270
You don’t need to hold out.

260
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,360
You may take a rest.

261
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,080
I can insist.

262
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,120
Are you serious, monitor?

263
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,750
You even want to win for this?

264
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:03,670
OK, I give up.

265
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,820
Ah.

266
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,630
It suddenly comes to my mind

267
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,320
we have a math test the next class.

268
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,080
If you don’t feel comfortable,

269
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,000
will it affect your score?

270
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,630
I got full marks
for three times consecutively.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Han Yayi.

272
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,910
Please ask for leave for me.

273
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,910
OK. You can count on me.

274
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
One. Two. One.

275
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,320
One. Two. One.

276
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,720
One. Two. Three. Four.

277
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
One. Two. Three. Four.

278
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,790
Ow.

279
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,750
The new sneakers hurt me.

280
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,960
I have to change them.

281
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,720
Oh no.

282
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,200
Why is the case missing?

283
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:56,910
Chief.

284
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,790
Chief.

285
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,000
The case for our sneakers is missing.

286
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,510
Monitor.

287
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Where are our sneakers?

288
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,750
I put them on the cabinet.

289
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,150
Can you see them?

290
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,390
I put them here.

291
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,150
You kept them.

292
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:22,390
You went back in advance.

293
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,910
You’ve been in the classroom alone.

294
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,480
Stop.

295
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,630
What do you mean?

296
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,030
I put the sneakers here.

297
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,390
But why did they disappear now.

298
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,360
I don’t know why, either.

299
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,030
It’s better for you

300
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,150
to go find them.

301
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
We trusted you, so we let you

302
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
keep our precious sneakers.

303
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,960
But now the sneakers disappeared.

304
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,200
You just said you don’t know.

305
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,550
Or you don’t like us,

306
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,960
so you did that in the name

307
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,000
of helping us, didn’t you?

308
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,320
I really didn’t throw away
your sneakers.

309
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,320
I didn’t do it against you.

310
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,200
If I want to,

311
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,550
I won’t use such a stupid way.

312
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,550
Ah.

313
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,670
People don’t like you.

314
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,270
Don’t you know it?

315
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,390
That’s true.

316
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,320
Trash should be in the trash can.

317
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,910
What did you say?

318
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,480
You, again!

319
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,270
Come on.

320
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,720
Say it again.

321
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,030
Why?

322
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,310
Listen.

323
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,440
It’s the school.

324
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,510
It’s class two, grade three
in the north campus.

325
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,590
It’s not in your south campus.

326
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,160
Beat me if you dare.

327
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,640
President and Director will handle it.

328
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,240
Chief.

329
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,590
Refuse storage area.

330
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,160
Mindless.

331
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,550
Monitor.

332
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,350
Where are the sneakers?

333
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:50,960
I don’t know.

334
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Let me ask you again.

335
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,640
Monitor.

336
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
Why are you caring about them so much?

337
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,110
When combining the class,

338
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,640
you were the first one opposing it.

339
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,350
Comparing with that,

340
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,070
I hate making a sneak attack more.

341
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,160
I…

342
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
How did you know
where he hid the sneakers?

343
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,480
According to Pan Hao’s words,

344
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,550
trash should be in the trash can.

345
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,310
They thought it’s
refuse storage area.

346
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,440
But they were wrong.

347
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,310
Yes.

348
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,750
Pan Hao meant

349
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
they don’t belong to the north campus.

350
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,440
So they should be back

351
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
-South campus of PE students.
-South campus of PE students.

352
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,110
Did you find them?

353
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,160
-No.
-No.

354
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,960
Come on. Let’s go back.

355
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,030
Be careful. Are you alright?

356
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,550
I’m OK. Keep looking for it.

357
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,590
Not this.

358
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,070
Where are the sneakers?

359
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,240
I don’t know.

360
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,550
Cut the crap. Answer it.

361
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,070
Pan Hao.

362
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,750
It’s not late to tell us now.

363
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,550
You don’t want to make it big, do you?

364
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I didn’t do it.

365
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,830
I’ve told you I don’t know.

366
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,920
Go find them out yourself.

367
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,720
Just once, where are the sneakers?

368
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,720
They’re here.

369
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,240
No missing. Take a look.

370
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Where did you find them?

371
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
Your original classroom.

372
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
Our original classroom?

373
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,590
The whole thing has
nothing to do with monitor.

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
Pan Hao put them back

375
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,070
to your original classroom
when we were running.

376
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,160
He said

377
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,200
PE students’ things

378
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,640
should be at the place of them.

379
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,510
If we didn’t find them out,

380
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,200
the sneakers may

381
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,750
disappear together with south campus.

382
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,480
I know

383
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,790
you think I’m making a fuss.

384
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,750
It’s just several pairs of sneakers.

385
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,790
We shouldn’t care about them so much?

386
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,020
OK.

387
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,590
I will tell you about it.

388
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,790
This pair,

389
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,750
I wore them in senior one

390
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,110
in Haiwen Championships in Athletics.

391
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,510
I got the second place.

392
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,030
Mr. Bai said,

393
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,880
it doesn’t matter,

394
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,750
win it next time.

395
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,240
I wore them and won the first
the next year.

396
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,960
Also I set a new record.

397
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,960
Jiang Yuan’s in fluorescent green.

398
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,310
He wore them and won the first
long-distance running champion.

399
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,720
Lin Chuan.

400
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,590
That’s his lucky shoes.

401
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,960
Only when he took them

402
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,440
with him in each competition,

403
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
he could release his ability.

404
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,310
The pair in white

405
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,400
belongs to Yun Xiang.

406
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,400
His grandma bought it before her death

407
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,920
after he won the first match.

408
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,790
They’re precious to him.

409
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,400
We never touched them.

410
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,680
You know what?

411
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,240
The sneakers are like medals for us.

412
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,350
They are more valuable than the cups.

413
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,830
Besides,

414
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,550
thank you.

415
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,750
Sorry.

416
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:39,750
I misunderstood you.

417
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,720
Also thank you

418
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,310
for finding the sneakers for us.

419
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,200
I should say sorry to you.

420
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,510
I didn’t throw away the sneakers.

421
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,640
But I did keep them.

422
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,750
I didn’t do my duty.

423
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,720
Sorry.

424
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,000
I think someone should apologize

425
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,750
even more.

426
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,400
Chief.

427
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,030
Seems monitor is nice.

428
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,720
Not just nice.

429
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,070
We all misunderstood her.

430
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,550
But she kept helping us.

431
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,720
So what?

432
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,480
You also think she’s nice?

433
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,000
How about

434
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,960
changing a female chief for you?

435
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,750
No.

436
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,920
Actually,

437
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,480
academic students are not so bad,

438
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,350
except Pan Hao.

439
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,750
Oh, right.

440
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:34,750
Chief.

441
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,830
Will Pan Hao really wash our sneakers?

442
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
Monitor said

443
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,200
she will report it to the teacher

444
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,440
if anything wrong happens again.

445
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,000
I don’t think he dares.

446
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,160
Zeyu warned him too.

447
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Zeyu?

448
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,070
Yun Xiang.

449
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,880
I feel you want to change side.

450
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,830
No, it’s just a name.

451
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,070
Anyway,

452
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,510
the matter shows that

453
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,720
monitor

454
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,790
is generous.

455
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,070
What did you say just now?

456
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,750
You think monitor is nice, too?

457
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,790
He said so?

458
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,480
You think…

459
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,200
What are you saying?

460
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,440
Eating even cannot stop you?

461
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,070
Eat more.

462
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,680
Excuse me.

463
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,480
I don’t think it’s simple.

464
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,880
Oh!

465
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,030
The super model student…

466
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,960
Something is wrong.

467
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:57,830
Right?

468
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
You think so?

469
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,110
Yes, I also think so.

470
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,640
What?

471
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,030
Just so so.

472
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,880
Don’t eat too much ice cream.

473
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,350
Chief.

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,750
Why did you leave for so long?

475
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,350
Is it hard for you?

476
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,160
There were too many people waiting.

477
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,400
Just eat.

478
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,000
Wait for me. Why are you riding so fast?

479
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,200
Take it.

480
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,200
Yes.

481
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,590
-OK.
-Thank you.

482
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,070
Oh my goodness!

483
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,240
Thank you.

484
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,030
That guy is a mack daddy.

485
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,270
No.

486
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,440
He has monitor, isn’t he?

487
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,680
Yuan Haoxi.

488
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,960
Please take my letter.

489
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,060
Uh.

490
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,680
This is…

491
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,030
It’s my sincerity.

492
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,350
No matter whether you will accept it,

493
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,960
please finish reading it.

494
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,000
I’ve received your sincerity.

495
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,880
That guy is something.

496
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,400
Not just one, right?

497
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
Seems monitor doesn’t know this.

498
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,030
She’s so stupid.

499
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,310
You are a really excellent girl.

500
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,070
But

501
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,350
we are still young.

502
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,960
We’d focus on study.

503
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,480
Only if we become excellent enough,

504
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,000
we can be responsible for our future.

505
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:21,790
So,

506
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,640
for the letter,

507
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,920
take it back now.

508
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,550
OK.

509
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Hope you can understand my words.

510
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,350
-OK.
-Bye-bye.

511
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,480
Bye-bye.

512
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,960
What’s wrong?

513
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,550
What’s up?

514
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:34,920
Yuan Caixi.

515
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,240
You are a student now.

516
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,640
What should a student do?

517
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,110
It’s studying.

518
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,590
It’s never too late to mend.

519
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,070
You can’t take it lightly.

520
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,960
What’s more,

521
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,480
even if you want to find one,

522
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,590
you’d better see who the one is.

523
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:51,920
Otherwise,

524
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,720
you will give your sincerity in vain.

525
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,830
You are poor in seeing people.

526
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
He must be nuts.

527
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:09,510
Eat this.

528
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,310
It’s very delicious.

529
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,830
Try it.

530
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,720
-Yuan. It’s too hard.
-Try harder.

531
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,550
No.

532
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,960
My period is not over. I can’t do it.

533
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,680
You can’t do it like that.

534
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,350
-Come on. Let me do it.
-Hmm.

535
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,000
Try to take a deep breath.

536
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,750
Muscle will relax on expiration.

537
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,160
Come on. Take a deep breath.

538
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,680
Inhale.

539
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,210
Go.

540
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,510

00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,960
and hypoglycemia.

572
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,550
So she fell in a faint after running.

573
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,270
She’ll be fine after some rest.

574
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,030
OK.

575
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,550
Thank you.

576
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,640
-Alright. I’ll go first.
-OK. Go ahead.

577
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,540
(Takeout of Milky Tea)
Let the kids handle it themselves.

578
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,970
I’m waiting for you in the office.

579
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,790
(To Takeout of Milky Tea)
Face to face.

580
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,550
You may go now.

581
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
You are the one to go.

582
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
If it hadn’t been for you,

583
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,550
she wouldn’t have fallen in a faint.

584
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,030
So before she’s awake,

585
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,920
I won’t go anywhere.

586
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,350
Don’t make troubles, OK?

587
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,680
If she sees you later,

588
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,590
she will be angry.

589
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,400
I’m not making any trouble.

590
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,110
I have something very important
to tell her.

591
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,350
You can tell me as well.

592
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
I will tell her for you.

593
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
It’s not a matter I can tell you.

594
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,720
Maybe I should go.

595
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:47,960
You are awake?

596
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,830
You were waking me up.

597
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,480
Take more rest.

598
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,510
I’ve asked for leave for you.

599
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,240
Don’t worry about the lessons.

600
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,750
I helped you file the notes.

601
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,680
OK.

602
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,780
(Mom)

603
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,640
I’d answer the phone.

604
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,590
Don’t flaunt your superiority.

605
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,960
Go home if you don’t feel well.

606
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,270
Yes.

607
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,680
Don’t stay here and affect her.

608
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:23,790
I see.

609
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,550
Stop being garrulous.

610
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,030
I will get some water for you.

611
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,440
Look.

612
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,030
Is this OK?

613
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,310
You even know this?

614
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,510
When my mom doesn’t feel well,

615
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,270
my dad gets brown sugar water for her.

616
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,720
Just drink it. It’ll cool down.

617
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,160
Oh.

618
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,360
The bandage has no viscosity.

619
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,110
I will change it for you.

620
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,840
No, Li He. I can do it myself.

621
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,510
Give me your hand.

622
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,630
Come on.

623
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,320
No, I will…

624
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,000
If your arm gets hurt,

625
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,630
don’t blame me.

626
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,440
OK.

627
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,030
Thank you.

628
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,550
Uh…

629
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,360
Sorry.

630
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,670
Sorry?

631
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,070
What for?

632
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
Making me fall in a faint?

633
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,550
There was a reason.

634
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,150
You…

635
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,360
What?

636
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,710
What’s that?

637
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,670
You didn’t pay any attention

638
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,840
to study, did you?

639
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,920
What?

640
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,840
Don’t pretend not to know.

641
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,840
I saw it.

642
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,960
You’d pay attention to the occasion.

643
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,280
As your classmate,

644
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,840
I need to remind you

645
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,000
that you are cheated by the bad guy.

646
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,150
I’m

647
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
cheated by a bad guy?

648
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
You went to school together
this morning.

649
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,550
After parting,

650
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,510
the guy

651
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,590
got breakfast from another girl.

652
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,440
Also there was a letter.

653
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,400
-Li He.
-Monitor.

654
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,070
I know it’s hard for you to accept it.

655
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,440
But I think you are a good girl.

656
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,800
I don’t want a kind girl to be cheated.

657
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,230
Stop being stubborn.

658
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,060
Don’t worry.

659
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,670
If you can’t accept it,

660
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,840
I will help you.

661
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,510
Just tell me where he is,

662
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,320
and what his name is.
I’ll teach him a lesson right now.

663
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,360
-I will let him know what…
-Sister, are you OK?

664
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,480
Leg? Hand?

665
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,630
Say something. Sister.

666
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,590
Caixi?

667
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,110
Let me introduce.

668
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,550
He’s the bad guy you just mentioned.

669
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,070
Yuan Haoxi.

670
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,960
My little brother.

671
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,800
Who is the bad guy?

672
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
You are sister and brother?

673
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,440
Not that relationship?

674
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,710
Oh. Why didn’t you say it earlier?

675
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,400
No wonder you look like her.

676
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,510
You don’t look like a bad guy.

677
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,360
You are not handsome. No.

678
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,590
-You don’t look handsome but not bad.
-Who are you talking about?

679
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,100
No.

680
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,800
Who are you talking about?

681
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,510
Ah, I misunderstood.

682
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,070
I’m praising you.

683
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,550
Caixi.

684
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,550
No, Yuan Haoxi. I will do it myself.

685
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,670
Let me do it.

686
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,280
Li He, no, thanks.

687
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,920
Look.

688
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,360
Make it contractive.

689
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,480
Fill it in.

690
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,230
Come on. Take a look.

691
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,150
Tight it like this.

692
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,400
Fill it.

693
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,630
You often did that, right?

694
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,030
My dad often did that for me.

695
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,840
OK.

696
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:18,630
Thank you.

697
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,030
I’m a good girl. I’m stubborn.

698
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,030
You are a good girl.

699
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,190
Normal guy won’t like her.

700
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,550
So you are abnormal, right?

701
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,230
You don’t go home for a rest?

702
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,000
I’m fine.

703
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,030
Listen.

704
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,590
Don’t tell this to mom.

705
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,800
Don’t tell her?

706
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,000
I can keep it a secret.

707
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,760
But you should keep a secret for me too.

708
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,480
What is it?

709
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,440
You know nothing about it.

710
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,070
Your brother

711
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,800
asked a classmate to see a movie.

712
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,510
-Show me the time.
-See you.

713
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,960
-Boy or girl, Yuan Haoxi?
-Caixi, don’t tell mom. Bye-bye.

714
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,400
Your brother is handsome.

715
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,030
You didn’t say so just now.

716
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
That’s different time.

717
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,670
Monitor.

718
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,030
As a girl,

719
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,070
you are really nice.

720
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,400
Girl?

721
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,320
What’s wrong with girl?

722
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,030
I don’t like your words.

723
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,030
I’m praising you.

724
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,070
I think you are nice.
It has nothing to do with gender.

725
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,030
Look.

726
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,760
You are loyal to friends, and cool.

727
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,880
Also you do well in the exam.

728
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,880
But your physical quality isn’t good.

729
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,510
Also you look normal.

730
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,440
You are nice in general.

731
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:37,960
Let’s shake hands, monitor.

732
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,110
-Why?
-I don’t want to.

733
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,440
Monitor,

734
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,110
please tell me your QQ.

735
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,880
What? Stop kidding.

736
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,030
Well. Enough.

737
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,030
It’s OK. Chief.

738
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,760
Eat an egg.

739
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,190
Here are the notes for you.

740
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,150
Just give it back to me tomorrow.

741
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,150
No hurry.

742
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,320
Oh, thank you.

743
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,000
The book store got new reference books.

744
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,670
45 Tianxing Gold Paper.

745
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,710
Complete national English questions.

746
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,190
How about taking a look tomorrow?

747
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,230
Isn’t it too late?

748
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,360
Will it be sold out?

749
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,590
Of course not.

750
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:27,880
Hillbilly.

751
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,360
Nobody will date a girl in a book store.

752
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,510
OK.

753
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,110
See you tomorrow.

754
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,280
Han Yayi. Let’s go.

755
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,320
Go to the library with me.

756
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,670
I have to fill the notes.

757
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,320
Water. Water.

758
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,000
Why you asked her for QQ?

759
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,480
For study.

760
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,110
I doubt something happened
between you and monitor.

761
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,110
What would it be?

762
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,550
Why did you buy such a big egg?

763
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,880
Darling, don’t.

764
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,760
It’ll be broken.

765
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,510
Why are you always so violent?

766
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,960
How can I keep gentle?

767
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
How can I be in good temper?

768
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,840
After your students joined in my class,

769
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,110
the life is like a drama.

770
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,760
You can’t say so.

771
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,510
Right?

772
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,360
My students

773
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,190
like freedom.

774
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,070
But you restrict them.

775
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,630
They lost their freedom,

776
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,710
so they feel unaccustomed.

777
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,110
You know how to make
unfounded countercharges now.

778
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:49,800
No.

779
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,030
It’s all my fault.

780
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,230
The guys

781
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,000
are your students now.

782
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,190
Can you commutate

783
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,550
the punishment?

784
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,510
I will punish them.

785
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,480
But it’s not their fault.

786
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,510
It’s yours.

787
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,670
Me again?

788
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,150
Miss Luo.

789
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,960
Carrot and stick are useless.

790
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,360
Even if Mr. Ma asks for this,

791
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,230
I will say so.

792
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,760
It has nothing to do with me.

793
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,840
Your student is in poor health.

794
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,920
It’s no big deal.

795
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,320
The student was sent to the clinic.

796
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,280
How could you say so?

797
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,550
She

798
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,110
is the teacher
in charge of academic class.

799
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,760
She didn’t urge them to exercise.

800
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,480
Now her student fell
in a faint after running.

801
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:40,840
It’s absurd.

802
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,510
Right?

803
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,150
Hey.

804
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,630
Don’t leave.

805
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,400
Make it clear, Bai Fei.

806
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,000
Calm down, please.

807
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,440
Don’t act like Bai.

808
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,280
Sit down.

809
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,320
He teaches sports.

810
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,840
He’s a careless person.

811
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,000
Don’t mind, OK?

812
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,190
Calm down.

813
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,840
He’s that kind of person.

814
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,480
We all know that.

815
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,000
He’s careless.

816
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Yes, don’t mind.

817
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,980
(Takeout of Milky Tea)

818
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,760
