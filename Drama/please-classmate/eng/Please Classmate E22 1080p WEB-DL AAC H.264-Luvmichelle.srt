17
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,120
Caixi,

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,040
have you taken enough rest?

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,870
Mom told you that

20
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,510
you should sleep before 11PM
every night from now on.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,070
I’m still very worried about mom.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
She’s fine.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,480
She said she’s fine.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
He knows it too?

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,680
It was an accident.

26
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,750
Good morning.

27
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,630
-Good morning, Zeyu.
-Good morning.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,960
So, aunt’s reaction was different from

29
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
what you’ve expected when you told her.

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,710
She was so calm that
she wasn’t even like my mom.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,150
It’s great.

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,770
If you both cried,

33
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,310
I don’t know what I could do.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,960
Now, only Li He and
the others don’t know.

35
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,590
Caixi,

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,800
I have a suggestion.

37
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Don’t tell them anything.

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Look. You’re so healthy and energized.

39
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,680
What are you doing?

40
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,710
Chief, are you taking off the gauze?

41
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,560
The wound isn’t that severe.
Wrapping it cuts off ventilation.

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,120
So I thought...

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
Chief, are you worried that
others might find out

44
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,000
so you tried to take it off?

45
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,000
No.

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
How’s that possible?

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,310
Come on, Chief.

48
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,520
You just don’t want Yuan Caixi to know

49
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
that you’re injured.

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,750
The doctor said so.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
The wound needs to breathe.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
What does it have to do with her?

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,750
It’s fine that you always
think about Yuan Caixi.

54
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,590
But the race will come soon.

55
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,680
You’re giving up on your sportsmanship.

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,840
Mr. Ma, good morning.

57
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,800
Mr. Ma, good morning.

58
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,260
Hello, Mr. Ma.

59
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,840
Hello, Mr. Ma.

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,150
Keep your spirits.

61
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,150
-Mr. Ma, good morning.
-Mr. Ma, good morning.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,190
Ning Zeyu. Yuan Caixi.

63
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,220
When you study hard,

64
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,800
you should also take enough rest.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,080
You should balance study and rest.

66
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,150
Mr. Ma, good morning.

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,080
Why was he so rude?

68
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,630
-Are you all right?
-I’m fine.

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,240
We’ll go now, Mr. Ma.

70
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,000
-Mr. Ma, good morning.
-Mr. Ma, good morning.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
What happened to your legs?

72
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,400
I was injured during the training.

73
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,600
Be careful.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,310
Good morning, monitor.

75
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,510
Good morning.

76
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,950
Chief.

77
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,650
Take a mouthful.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,190
Eat more. Eat more.

79
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,720
Yes.

80
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,800
Mom said she’d watch you eat.

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,630
Yes.

82
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,270
Is it enough?

83
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,870
It’s for your own good.

84
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,190
Caixi, I have other matters.
I’ll go now.

85
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,430
See you at the next meal.

86
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Since when did Yuan Haoxi become
so concerned about you?

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,510
Don’t mind him. It’s fine.

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,000
Yuan,

89
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,750
have you heard about
what happened to Li He?

90
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,680
What is it?

91
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,680
He was injured.

92
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,480
Injured?

93
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,040
Chief.

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,360
His knee?

95
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,560
Lin Chuan told me that
he accidentally fell down

96
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,750
yesterday during training.

97
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,070
His knee was injured and it bled a lot.

98
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,920
What?

99
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,000
Sit down.

100
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,950
Let me tell you the details. Sit down.

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,950
Actually Li He doesn’t want you to know.

102
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,630
It’s Lin Chuan who told me that.

103
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,600
Yuan,

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,630
what happened to you recently?

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,040
If there’s something on your mind,
you can just tell me.

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,430
Nothing.

107
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,750
Yuan,

108
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,360
Lin Chuan told me that

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,680
he wishes you can
go to watch Li He’s race.

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,240
After all, it’s very important to him.

111
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,070
Besides, he is injured

112
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,040
and his morale is down.

113
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
He’ll feel better if you watch the race.

114
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,000
I can’t go.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,830
Ah! Why?

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,630
I can’t go because I have to study.

117
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,040
I’ll go now.

118
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh!

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,510
Please do me a favor. Tell Li He

120
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,390
to be more careful during running.

121
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,600
I was off guard for one second,

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,070
and you already did this to yourself.

123
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,600
If you want to practice,
you can tell me.

124
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,360
If I were there,
you would’ve got injured.

125
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,680
It’s no big deal, I can still run.

126
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,870
Nonsense.

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
Go home and rest.

128
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,240
Go.

129
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,310
You bought so many medicines?

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,160
Go home and rest.

131
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,190
Li He.

132
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,750
Slow down. Where are you going?

133
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,480
Yuan Caixi.

134
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,150
Yuan Caixi.

135
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,910
Yuan Caixi.

136
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
Why are you leaving?

137
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,750
You left the medicines there?

138
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,790
Why do you leave
when you’re already here?

139
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,550
Wait for me. I’ll walk you home.

140
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,630
Li He,

141
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,910
College Entrance Exam is coming close.

142
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,630
I have to put my heart into study.

143
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,320
You should do the same.

144
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,270
You need to focus on training.

145
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,790
Stop thinking about unimportant matters.

146
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
I’m not lagging behind on
College Entrance Exam nor training.

147
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,360
But why are you hiding from me?

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,720
Fine.

149
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,150
I won’t force you if
you don’t want to tell me.

150
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,360
But, Yuan Caixi...

151
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,150
Li He.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,080
It’s too late. I need to go home.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,790
Let me walk you home.

154
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,120
No need.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
Be careful with training

156
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,550
from now on.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,720
Goodbye.

158
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,790
Come to watch my race.

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,320
Does it hurt?

160
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,200
A little bit.

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,480
It hurts?

162
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,510
A little.

163
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,200
There’s one more here.

164
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,320
Don’t worry for now.

165
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
Maybe it’s just anemia.

166
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,720
Do a blood test first.

167
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,240
I’ll look into the result then.

168
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:17,910
Go.

169
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,670
Thank you, doctor.

170
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,960
Monitor asked for a leave today.

171
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,870
Yuan seldom asks for leaves.

172
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,360
What happened to Yuan recently?

173
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,910
I saw Yuan Haoxi
came to school this morning.

174
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,870
Yuan asked for a leave, not her brother.

175
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,750
Of course,
Yuan Haoxi will come to school.

176
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,850
We can take this opportunity

177
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,320
and ask her brother.

178
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,360
You’re one smart hamster.

179
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Han Yayi.

180
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,750
My sister treats you well,

181
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,870
so does my mom.

182
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,480
I...

183
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,510
Yuan Haoxi,

184
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,600
just tell us.

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,270
Lin Chuan won’t hurt you.

186
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,750
Okay.

187
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,840
Let’s be serious.

188
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
What happened to your sister?

189
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,030
Tell us.

190
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,910
My sister? She...

191
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,720
Think before you speak.

192
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,150
I want nothing but the truth.

193
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,200
Mr. Luo. That’s really Mr. Luo.

194
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,240
Yuan Haoxi,

195
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,390
you really won’t talk
unless we get rough, right?

196
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,320
What are you doing?

197
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,120
What am I doing?

198
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
What am I doing?

199
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,390
Will you say it or not?

200
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,790
-Say it.
-Will you?

201
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
But, I...

202
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,270
But, I...

203
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,270
My sister forbids me
from telling others.

204
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,000
Yuan Haoxi,

205
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,790
we’re really worried about Yuan.

206
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,030
She has been acting
really strange recently.

207
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,910
She used to be a lone wolf,

208
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,320
but she’s different recently.

209
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,360
Just tell us what happened to her.

210
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,720
Ah! Okay. Okay.

211
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
My sister.

212
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,030
She...

213
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,390
is in the hospital right now.

214
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,480
Hospital?

215
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,700
(Qi Bangwei, Hematology Department,
Wanhe Hospital, Haiwen)

216
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,030
She has low red blood cell counts.

217
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,000
And her white cell counts and
hemoglobin level were also abnormal.

218
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,750
Of course,
there might be various causes.

219
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,270
But to be sure,

220
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,600
I suggest a bone marrow biopsy.

221
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,140
The hospital happens to
have less patients today.

222
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,910
You can do it today.

223
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:24,480
Mom.

224
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,120
Ay.

225
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,270
It’s fine.

226
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,870
It’s just a checkup.

227
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,510
-Don’t worry.
-Come on.

228
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,840
Dr. Qi,

229
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,120
you know about my family’s situation.

230
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,550
Because you know about

231
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,270
Caixi’s dad.

232
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,670
So I’m a bit concerned.

233
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,120
First,

234
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,550
her current symptoms

235
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,150
might be caused by leukemia.

236
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,510
These kids are young and
have strong immune systems.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,630
Even if she has
the same illness as her father did,

238
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,510
if she receives treatments early…

239
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,350
The leukemia’s fatality

240
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,750
has dropped a lot nowadays.

241
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,270
Do you hear the doctor?

242
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,240
Mmm.

243
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
Let’s do the test first.

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,750
Don’t worry.

245
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,550
Leukemia?

246
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,270
Yes.

247
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,390
Yuan has such a severe illness.

248
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,550
How can you come to school
like nothing happened?

249
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,960
Are you heartless?

250
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,480
Nonsense. It’s not
a confirmed diagnosis yet.

251
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,270
Besides, why am I heartless?

252
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,200
What else can I do?

253
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,910
My dad’s dead. My sister might be ill.

254
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
My mom is having a hard time already.

255
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,270
If I pull a sad face like you do,

256
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,080
I’ll only increase their burden.

257
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,870
Wait. Yuan is fighting with
this severe illness on her own.

258
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,480
I’m just sitting next to her
as if everything is normal.

259
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,270
No wonder she often faints.

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,480
I just can’t help her.

261
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,120
Yuan is so poor.

262
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,960
Hey.

263
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,670
My sister’s not diagnosed yet.

264
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,550
Okay.

265
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,510
Any news from Yuan?

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Talk to me.

267
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,080
Doctor asked my sister

268
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,750
to do a bone marrow biopsy to verify it.

269
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,820
(Class 2, Grade 3)

270
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,030
Let’s not tell Chief for now.

271
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,200
He’s got race tomorrow.

272
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,630
Chuan.

273
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,270
Hum?

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,750
Take a leak with me.

275
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,390
Come on.

276
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,240
Zeyu.

277
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,150
Chuan.

278
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,750
Yes?

279
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,670
Why do I feel even Han Yayi

280
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,840
is suddenly so close to Ning Zeyu?

281
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,910
Ah!

282
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,480
What else can it be?
She’s asking him about study.

283
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,750
Really?

284
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Of course.

285
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,440
Monitor isn’t here.
Who else can she ask besides Ning Zeyu?

286
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,670
That’s right.

287
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,240
Chief, worry about yourself first.

288
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,910
How can you run tomorrow
with your legs like this?

289
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Your overall score has to

290
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,790
be in top three in this competition.

291
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,550
Otherwise,
you can’t make into the final.

292
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,910
If you can’t make into the final,

293
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,310
you won’t be qualified as
national second-level athlete.

294
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,310
If you can’t get qualified,

295
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,750
you can’t apply for
the test of high level athlete.

296
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,590
Even you’re pessimistic about me?

297
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,750
Just because of the wound on my leg,

298
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,350
I can’t even make into the top three

299
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,720
with my capability?

300
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,680
No, that’s not what I mean.

301
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,960
Come on.

302
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,830
It’s not a big deal.

303
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,960
Thank you for taking care of Yuan.

304
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,880
You know it?

305
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,750
Lin Chuan and I just went to Yuan Haoxi.

306
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,790
She should be doing the checkup today.

307
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,160
Has the result come out?

308
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,160
Doctor said that

309
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,750
she needs a bone marrow biopsy.

310
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,000
It’s not confirmed yet.

311
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,790
We need to be optimistic.

312
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,400
Optimistic.

313
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,720
Just stop there. Thank you, Sir.

314
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,550
Slow down.

315
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,640
Caixi, be careful.

316
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,270
Thank you, Sir.

317
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,070
Are you okay?
Your waist wasn’t hurt just now?

318
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,830
No.

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,920
Mom.

320
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,550
Caixi.

321
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,830
Are you all right?

322
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,310
Let me perform a biopsy on you.

323
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,880
You still have the energy for jokes.

324
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,360
Mom, I’ll go upstairs now.

325
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,310
I want to take some rest.

326
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,680
Be careful. Do you hear me?

327
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,720
Ah. Okay.

328
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,480
Mom.

329
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,310
What did the doctor say?

330
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,240
The blood test result wasn’t ideal.

331
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,960
She has low red blood cell counts.

332
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,750
And her white cell counts and
hemoglobin level were also abnormal.

333
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,240
Your sister
did bone marrow biopsy today.

334
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,480
We’ll know when the result comes out.

335
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,510
Mom. It’ll be fine. Don’t worry.

336
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
The result will be all right.

337
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,590
Haoxi.

338
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,200
Yes?

339
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,270
You have to promise mom one thing now.

340
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,160
Mom, what is it?

341
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
No matter what happens in the future,

342
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,880
you have to tell me immediately.

343
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,820
Don’t hide things from me

344
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,510
like your sister did.

345
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,000
Ah! Mom, don’t worry.
I’m not as strong as my sister is.

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,750
I can’t keep secrets even if I want to.

347
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,750
It’s fine. Don’t worry.

348
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,550
My battery has died.

349
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,270
(Han Yayi)
Yuan, are you all right?

350
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,770
Lin Chuan and I went to
see Yuan Haoxi today.

351
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,680
He told us everything.

352
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,750
He just can’t keep secrets.

353
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,540
I’ll tell you everything
tomorrow at school.

354
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,750
Don’t tell Li He!

355
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,310
(Ning Zeyu)
You did bone marrow biopsy today?

356
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,830
It must hurt a lot.

357
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,200
I’ve organized today’s notes for you.

358
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,980
(Li He
Track and Field Event)

359
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,790
Hello, monitor?

360
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,510
You’re home? Are you all right?

361
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,030
I’m fine. The spot where I did
bone marrow biopsy hurts a little.

362
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,510
Lie down and rest.

363
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Oh! Zeyu,

364
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,350
Han Yayi just told me

365
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,440
that Lin Chuan knew it.

366
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,310
Yes, but they won’t tell Li He soon.

367
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,400
After all, tomorrow is his race.

368
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,200
Great.

369
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,160
You...

370
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
Will you tell him

371
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,270
after tomorrow’s race?

372
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,680
No.

373
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
I’ll wait for the test result.

374
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,590
If it’s good, then it’s fine.

375
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,590
If the result is bad,

376
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,590
maybe my being mean to him now

377
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,750
is a good thing after all.

378
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,480
Will you go to watch his race tomorrow?

379
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,480
I’ll think about that later.

380
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,790
Tomorrow, will you come
to see me... ?

381
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,030
Zeyu.

382
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,270
I need to talk to you.

383
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,300
I’ll go now.

your aunt’s place for dinner.

390
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,830
You can have a good conversation
with your cousin.

391
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,310
He was admitted with
a high score that year.

392

You can chat about things
other than study as well.

393

394
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,480
You’ve been really tired recently.

395
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,270
I was being too strict with you

396
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,200
a while ago.

397
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,880
Oh, mom, it’s fine.

398
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,350
I’m doing great. Don’t overthink.

399
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,550
I’ve arranged to go to school tomorrow

400
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,640
to do some research and tests.

401
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,160
I won’t go to aunt’s place
with you then.

402
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Say hi to them for me.

403
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,680
Fine. Make your own plans for tomorrow.

404
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,790
Don’t exhaust yourself.

405
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,000

Caixi,

416
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,960
I didn’t take good care of you.

417

I have to apologize to you.

418
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,310
No, mom.

419
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,000
You don’t have to be sorry.

420
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,830
You really don’t.

421
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
I paid no heed to the changes on you.

422
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,920

No, mom.

425
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,070
It’s my fault. I should have
told you earlier.

426

Dear guests, hello.

571
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,880
Welcome to the final of the annual

572
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,440
Haiwen Network Programming Contest.

573
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,800
After a winter vacation’s
intense training,

574
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,400
the contestants today...

575
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,630
Hello, is this Zeyu?

576
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,670
Hello, who is this?

577
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,110
I’m the doctor
at No.2 Experimental School.

578
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,230
A female student fainted here.

579
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,710
Hello. The girl you talked about

580
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,960
wears a ponytail?

581
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,000
Yes. I saw that you’re
her most recent contact.

582
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,060
So I called.

583
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,880
I wish to ask if you can
reach her parents.

584
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,040
You said she fainted?

585
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,070
Is she all right now?

586
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,150
She hasn’t woken up.

587
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,670
She’s still at our infirmary.

588
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,840
The infirmary of
No.2 Experimental School, right?

589
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,400
Yes.

590
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,050
I’m on my way now.

591
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,810
-Okay.
-Hello.

592
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,150
The contest will start soon.

593
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,190
Hello, what do you want?

594
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,080
I was told that my friend fainted

595
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,070
when I called here.

596
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,110
You’re Zeyu?

597
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,280
I don’t know the girl’s situation

598
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,710
for sure now.

599
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,740
Further inspection is needed

600
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,000
when she wakes up.

601
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,710
Okay.

602
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,030
This is her phone.

603
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,960
Take it for her.

604
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,440
Wait inside for a while.

605
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,320

Zeyu.

632
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,590
-Slow down.
-Why are you here?

633
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,510
How’s the result of Li He’s race?

634
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:09,590
How are you feeling now?

635
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:10,800
Are you feeling unwell?

636
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,760
I’m fine. Where’s Li He?

637
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,030
I don’t know that.

638
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,280
If I didn’t happen to call you,

639
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,230
you might have fainted
at No.2 Experimental School

640
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,760
without anyone knowing it. You know?

641
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,590
I didn’t mean to do it.

642
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,520
Of course, you didn’t.

643
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Who would faint on purpose?

644
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,800
So,

645
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,880
you didn’t tell Li He

646
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,800
that you would come?

647
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,030
So you came here on your own?

648
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,400
And you didn’t tell him?

649
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,840
You were being so impulsive.

650
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,150
Why didn’t you just tell him?

651
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,510
Why are you being a coward now?

652
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,550
Hello?

653
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,110
Hello, Caixi, have you
finished watching the race?

654
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,880
It’s time to come home.
Do you need me to pick you up?

655
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,320
Yuan Haoxi.

656
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,670
Haoxi, I’ll take her home.

657
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,480
Don’t worry.

658
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,960
My sister went to watch Li He’s race,

659
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,760
and Ning Zeyu would send her home?

660
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,920
What’s going on?

661
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,710
Come on. Let me take you home.

662
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,230
The race ended earlier.

663
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,320
He must have left already.

664
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,630
Okay.

665
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,590
I’d better not see him

666
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,800
before the test result comes out.

667
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,480
Okay.

668
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,360
Let’s go.

669
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,920
No need. I can do it myself.

670
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,760
Hello.

671
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,420
Hello.

672
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,960
Is this Ning Zeyu’s mother?

673
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,760
Yes, I am.

674
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,630
Who is this?

675
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,090
I’m a professor from
the department of network programming

676
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,670
at Tiangong University
of Science and Technology.

677
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,000
My name is He Yanjing.
Sorry to disturb you.

678
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,480
Professor from Tiangong University
of Science and Technology.

679
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:43,590
Why are you looking for my son?

680
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,010
Ning Zeyu

681
00:43:45,010 --> 00:43:46,710
left the contest early.

682
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,110
According to the rules,
that constitutes a waiver.

683
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,880
I think he might
have a reason for doing it.

684
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,550
So I’m a bit concerned.

685
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,440
What?

686
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,030
Contest?

687
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,960
Mmm.

688
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,190
Have some water.

689
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,110
Stop it. Have some water.

690
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,070
You’re in my way.

691
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,280
Have some water.

692
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,380
Stay out of my way. I’m watching it.

693
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,020
-You practiced for an afternoon.
-You’re so annoying.

694
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,630
Here’s our champion. Applaud.

695
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,240
Come on.

696
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
Show me your trophy cup.

697
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,780
Or your medal.

698
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,400
At least a certificate of honor.

699
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,070
The host can’t be more miserly.

700
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,260
I’m so tired today.

701
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,030
Mom, dad, I’ll take some rest.

702
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:42,360
Wait. Li He.

703
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,480
Tell me.

704
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,480
Li He didn’t do well this time?

705
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,280
Yes.

706
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,070
Don’t be nervous.

707
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,030
Chief is training really hard

708
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:02,230
at school.

709
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,280
And his performance is really good too.

710
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,030
He’s just in a bad state this time.

711
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,000
So,

712
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,710
if he can adjust his state,

713
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,800
I believe he can do better next time.

714
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,230
Yes. It’s fine.

715
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,960
It’s just the way competitions are.

716
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,000
He’ll win and he will lose.

717
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,880
He can’t always win, right?

718
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,550
He’s young. He’s not afraid of defeats.

719
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,380
Besides, I think Chief can

720
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,280
demonstrate his best capability

721
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,190
next time.

722
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,280
And he’ll be the champion again.

723
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,360
Yes.

724
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:32,550
I’m just concerned and scared
that he can’t take this.

725
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,510
There’s nothing he can’t take.

726
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,840
Chuan, stay for dinner.

727
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,440
Have a try of your uncle’s cooking.

728
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,450
Thank you, aunt and uncle.

729
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,960
But I need to go home earlier and

730
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:44,970
help my mom organize merchandises.

731
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,110
I’ll go now.

732
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,630
I’ll come by another day.

733
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,630
Aunt, uncle, bye.

734
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,880
Chief, I’ll go now. Bye.

735
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,510
Don’t say he’s adopted recently.

736
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,840
Otherwise, he’ll be upset again.

737
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,030
It’s nothing.

738
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,800
Be a man!

739
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,000
