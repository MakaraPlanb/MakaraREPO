Han Yayi.

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,000
I really don’t need to come to
the clinic.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I just got a cramp.
I’ll be fine in a minute.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,070
Miss Luo told me to take you here.

21
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,200
The doctor will massage me
and I don’t want that.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Caixi.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,430
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,950
Huang Yuan.

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
You’ve been hiding in here?

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,590
Do you know? Because of
your sudden disappearance,

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,470
Caixi ran for you.

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
We’ve lost.

29
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,310
Actually, I got a cramp in my leg.

30
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,680
If I hadn’t got a cramp,

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,840
we would have won.

32
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,710
We would have won?

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
It’s all because of her.

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,470
I’m sorry.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,590
I was really nervous before.

36
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,190
I got a cramp in my leg too
and I threw up.

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,430
Huang Yuan.

38
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,400
Take the stomach medicine
to stop vomiting.

39
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
But Huang Yuan,

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,750
even if you weren’t feeling well before,

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,800
you had to tell us.

42
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,960
We were all looking for you.

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,840
We were worried about you.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,750
I’m sorry.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,240
I was so scared that I panicked.

46
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,750
In fact,
you don’t have to say sorry to us,

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
because after all,

48
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
it’s not me, Yuan Caixi,

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,910
or you, Huang Yuan, who lost,

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,240
but our class.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,310
I think

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,870
you still need to say sorry to everyone.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,580
(Class 2, Grade 3)

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,240
I’m sorry.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,960
I was so nervous.

56
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,680
I was afraid I couldn’t run well

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,030
and lose the competition.

58
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,750
I didn’t expect to cause you
so much trouble.

59
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,190
I’m sorry.

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,150
I’m sorry.

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,630
It’s okay.

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,360
Sports competition can be intimidating.

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,430
But we are a team.

64
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,240
We win or lose together.

65
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,630
If you have difficulties,

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
we will help you.

67
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,940
In the future,

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,910
don’t run away.

69
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,510
(Class 2, Grade 3 (36))
This is the best sports ranking

70
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,190
(Wang Jingjing)
our class has ever got.

71
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,360
(Song Dabao)
Li He’s arrangement was a success.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,950
(Pan Hao)
It’s not that.

73
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,210
It’s because we ran fast.

74
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,090
(Wang Xiaoyu)
Hey, look.

75
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,360
I took a picture of Caixi and Li He.

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,430
(Yun Xiang)
They make a good match.

77
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,510
(Meimei)
Straight-A student and champion.

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,800
(Yuan Caixi)
Please make me disappear from the photo.

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,100
Oh.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,630
So embarrassing.

81
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,160
We do make a good match.

82
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,640
What happened?

83
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,640
Wait for me!

84
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,190
What happened?

85
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:11,950
I don’t know.

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,240
It looks like Li He and others
are all there.

87
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,070
Let’s have a look.

88
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,750
-Let’s go.
-Wait.

89
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,360
Slow down.

90
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,310
Where’s our turtle?

91
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,870
He’s taking too long.

92
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,860
He’s still in there.

93
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,040
Hey.

94
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,360
Are you done yet?

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,630
We’re waiting for you.

96
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,240
Hey, he’s coming out!

97
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,410
-Hey, he’s coming out!
-Come on!

98
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,000
Li He.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,560
You are the most handsome turtle
in the world.

100
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,160
Li He.

101
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,680
You are the most handsome turtle
in the world.

102
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,120
The most handsome turtle in the world.

103
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,070
Turtle.

104
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,480
He’s coming out!

105
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,920
He’s coming out!

106
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,040
He’s coming out!

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,600
Li He.

108
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,310
I asked you to dress up as a turtle.

109
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,870
But you are as slow as a turtle.

110
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
I wonder

111
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,720
if you’ll run

112
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,630
like a turtle.

113
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,800
Li He. Look at the camera.

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,390
Give me a finger heart.

115
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,950
Hey, look,

116
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,480
the turtle suit

117
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,750
fits him well.

118
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,830
Smile.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, smile.

120
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,510
Where are your friends?

121
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,320
They are usually very affectionate
to you,

122
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,320
but now,

123
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
they are all gone.

124
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,200
You’re not popular with people.

125
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,030
So sad.

126
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,630
Why don’t you be my friend?

127
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,600
So I can protect you.

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
That’s enough.

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,790
I didn’t bully him.
We agreed on that before.

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Stop.

131
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,120
We agreed.

132
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,000
It’s rare for him to dress like this.

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,790
Of course I have to take a photo.

134
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,600
Chief, we’re here.

135
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
Chief, we’re here.

136
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,910
Chief, we’re here for you.

137
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,720
Chief, we’re not gonna leave you alone.

138
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,910
What happened?

139
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,720
We’re brothers no matter good or bad.

140
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,750
Why did you come here all by yourself?

141
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,670
You should’ve told us.

142
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,790
That’s not cool.

143
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,910
Look at the camera.

144
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,670
You want to shoot this?

145
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,870
Go ahead.

146
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:34,840
Shoot.

147
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,600
Come on.

148
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,360
Let’s do that together.

149
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,270
Yuan.

150
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,480
What are you doing here?

151
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,840
Don’t you know who you are?

152
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,270
Are you here to study or play?

153
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,270
What are you wearing?

154
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
Do you know what discipline is

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,510
and what the school rules are?

156
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,480
Sorry, Mr. Bai.

157
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,870
Why are you still standing here?

158
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,000
Change your clothes.

159
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,600
Don’t you have classes?

160
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,080
They went too far.

161
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,390
When did we ever have to suffer
like this?

162
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,000
Enough.

163
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,510
It’s better than bringing him food

164
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,750
in these clothes.

165
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,030
After today,

166
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,840
a lot of fans would dislike us.

167
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,150
I think no one will ask for my QQ

168
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,670
when I’m playing basketball.

169
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Chuan.

170
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,600
Jiang Yuan.

171
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,630
Xiang.

172
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,600
You’ll

173
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,390
be my good friends forever.

174
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,960
We will always be this close.

175
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,840
Yes, we will.

176
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,120
But in the future,

177
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,870
will you stop betting with others?

178
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,480
We can’t lose our faces like this again.

179
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay.

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,670
I’ll never do that.

181
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,870
Even if I want to bet…

182
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,270
-Li He. Go with me.
-What?

183
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,750
-Hey!
-What’s wrong?

184
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,600
What’s wrong?

185
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,270
Get in and you’ll know.

186
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,120
Hurry.

187
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,440
The food is ready.

188
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,440
We’re waiting for you.

189
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,910
Why would I do that?

190
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,630
It has nothing to do with me.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,320
You want me to bring food for Zhang Ye?

192
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,910
What happened to our friendship?

193
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,550
We’re in the same class.

194
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,870
We win and lose together.

195
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,480
I know that,

196
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,480
but I didn’t bet with Zhang Ye.

197
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,390
Li He lost a bet,

198
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,000
but why should we do that?

199
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,360
Monitor,

200
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,080
if you want to avenge Li He,

201
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,390
you can go yourself.

202
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Why should we do that for him?

203
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,720
Am I right?

204
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
You didn’t take part in the competition,

205
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,600
but you went around bragging
that our class got second place.

206
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,630
It’s not about revenge,

207
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,000
but class honor.

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,120
You don’t want to go.

209
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,240
I won’t force you.

210
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,910
Huang Yuan, what about you?

211
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,200
You’re not going, either?

212
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,790
Li He would never have lost

213
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,120
if it hadn’t been for us.

214
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,870
But he would rather lose

215
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,840
than give us up.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,390
So

217
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,670
you’re really not going?

218
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you.

219
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,120
She’s just feeling pity for you.

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,150
After all, pictures of you
dressed up as a turtle

221
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,440
have been all over the school.

222
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
Thank you, anyway.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
Whoever saw you

224
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,720
would want to

225
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
look after you.

226
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,480
Let’s go.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,790
After you.

228
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,870
I understand this time.

229
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,750

Not only did you wear weird clothes
at school,

250
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,840
but now you start wasting food.

251
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,270
Are you going to raise a rumpus?

252
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,670
If I don’t punish you today,

253
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,240
you’ll never learn the lesson.

254
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,840
I can overlook your usual
mischievous behaviors,

255
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,960
but it’s a matter of principle,

256
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,000
and I can’t stand that.

257
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,910
Today I’ll teach you not to waste food

258
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,790
until you take it to heart.

259
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,030
I need to punish you guys.

260
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,770
You know?

261
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,320
So that you’ll learn.

262
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,910
Hurry up.

263
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,510
Jump.

264
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,720
Are they still discussing
in the WeChat group of our class?

265
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,320
Not only the WeChat group of our class,

266
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
but also the WeChat group of our school.

267
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,960
Yuan.

268
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,030
Our school has never had

269
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,080
such explosive news.

270
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,360
Yuan.

271
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,320
Come on. Don’t play with your phone
when you walk.

272
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,440
Caixi.

273
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,120
Caixi.

274
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,120
Yuan Caixi.

275
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,630
Yuan.

276
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,480
-Yuan Caixi.
-Yes?

277
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,680
What’s wrong? Can I help you?

278
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,310
Let’s go together.

279
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,400
I’ll walk you home.

280
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,720
Oh.

281
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,240
Let’s go.

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,910
Aren’t you going to walk me home?

283
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,960
What are we doing here?

284
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,790
You helped me out today.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,830
I want to buy you dinner.

286
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,920
No need.

287
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,750
It’s okay.

288
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,000
Is your foot okay now?

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,300
-Yeah, it’s fine now.
-Please have a seat.

290
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,110
Excuse me?

291
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,000
-Yes?
-We’d like to order.

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,590
Here.

293
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,240
Thank you.

294
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,550
So what would you like to eat?

295
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,480
I haven’t been here before.
You can just order for me.

296
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,270
Okay, I’ll order some food for you.

297
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,680
Caixi.

298
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,960
Can you eat spicy food?

299
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,030
How spicy can you eat?

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,790
Do you prefer meat or vegetables?

301
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,160
I like meat.

302
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,110
I don’t know what you like to eat, so…

303
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,030
Caixi.

304
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,070
Let me walk you home.

305
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,030
Why are you smiling at me?

306
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,350
Are you planning something?

307
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,400
No. I’m a serious person.

308
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,270
And a bullfrog.

309
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,200
Bullfrog.

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,160
You’re smiling.

311
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,400
I’m not.

312
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,240
Then what were you doing?

313
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Look. Look. Look.

314
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,510
Alright, fine. I’m sorry.

315
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,310
I was just thinking

316
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:24,440
that you looked cute

317
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,240
in your turtle suit today.

318
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,550
I’m warning you,

319
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,440
don’t bring up the turtle suit again,

320
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,350
or I’ll…

321
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,960
Huh?

322
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,160
Or I can do nothing to you.

323
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,310
Caixi.

324
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,880
What?

325
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,000
So can you be on my team in the future?

326
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
Okay, but

327
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,240
you probably don’t want me now.

328
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,750
You’re right.

329
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,640
Think about it.

330
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,880
I saved you twice already.

331
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,160
Caixi.

332
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,640
You’re the one with the biggest problem.

333
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,920
But don’t worry,

334
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,790
I’m a generous person

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,830
who doesn’t bear grudges.

336
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,510
Caixi.

337
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,830
How about I protect you

338
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,110
from now on?

339
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:14,590
Let’s be honest,

340
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,270
no one can do that.

341
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,960
I notice that you and Yuan Haoxi
are alike.

342
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
You’re both thick-skinned.

343
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,070
Even so,

344
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,160
I still saved you.

345
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,790
Seriously,

346
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,750
you could have left me alone

347
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,880
if you had to wear a turtle suit
when you lost.

348
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,030
No way.

349
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,350
How could I do that?

350
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,680
Besides,

351
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,000
it was just a bet

352
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,750
and we’re teammates.

353
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,480
We’re in the same class,

354
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,720
and that makes me your teammate.

355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,030
So I won’t give up on you

356
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:38,920
no matter what.

357
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,200
Besides,

358
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,750
you’re more important

359
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,510
than wearing a turtle suit.

360
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,350
Don’t you order? Just order food.

361
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,030
Let’s finish dinner and go home.

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,110
We have to take a monthly exam tomorrow.

363
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,920
I’m telling you, if you don’t do well
on the exam tomorrow,

364
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,240
you’ll be a dead man,
do you understand?

365
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,590
Quiz or monthly exam?

366
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,030
Quiz.

367
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,750
Quiz.

368
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,830
Okay.

369
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,160
In that case, let’s order pig’s brain

370
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,790
to nourish our brains.

371
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,920
And a bowl of wontons.

372
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,750
That’s enough to eat.

373
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,550
And two glasses of coke.

374
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,740
(Class 2, Grade 3)

375
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,270
A pack of wolves
is now a flock of sheep.

376
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,590
They are not running.

377
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,400
Instead, they are sacrificing
their time to study here.

378
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,160
Sacrifice…

379
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
Do you know what sacrifice is?

380
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,750
They are in their senior year.

381
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,720
It is a sacrifice

382
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,640
for academic students to spend time

383
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,240
on tutoring PE students.

384
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,590
You can’t say that.

385
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,480
Is it not pleasant to learn with a
constant perseverance and application?

386
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,640
Besides,

387
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,640
helping PE students study

388
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
is also helping themselves.

389
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,920
Right?

390
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,110
Where did you learn to say that?

391
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,110
You make me sound like
an uneducated person.

392
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,480
Mr. Ma’s latest guiding spirit.

393
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,310
Let me have a look.

394
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,350
If that’s the case,

395
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,880
I must also carry out

396
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Mr. Ma’s guiding spirit.

397
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,960
What are you going to do?

398
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
Nothing.

399
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,440
I just want to provide
some learning materials

400
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,590
for PE students.

401
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,750
Caixi.

402
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,310
What are our scores?

403
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,510
Look for yourself.

404
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,270
I’m embarrassed to say it out loud.

405
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
(Grade 3 Joint Quality Test
of Haiwen City Math 58)

406
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,350
What’s your score?

407
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,790
Same as yours.

408
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,590
Don’t look at it.

409
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,340
(Grade 3 Joint Quality Test
of Haiwen City Math 92)

410
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,830
92!

411
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,960
It’s a lot.

412
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,030
How did you get this score?

413
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,160
Just do the basics.

414
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,110
It’s not that hard to pass.

415
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,030
What’s wrong?

416
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,750
I’m thinking

417
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,480
that my parents will be very happy

418
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,790
if I pass the exam once.

419
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,240
I think your parents

420
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,160
don’t have high requirements
for your score.

421
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,750
That being said,

422
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,530
I

423
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,880
still want to pass the exam.

424
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,440
If I pass the exam,

425
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
my parents will be very happy.

426
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,590
Why don’t you take my test paper back

427
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
and change our names?

428
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,070
Okay?

429
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,000
Is that okay?

430
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,790
Of course. We all do that.

431
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,000
Only you don’t know.

432
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,750
Thanks.

433
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,270
But I’ll pass.

434
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,000
I’ll give the test paper to them

435
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,350
next time

436
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,400
I pass the exam myself.

437
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,750
Okay, Chief.

438
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,030
I have faith in you.

439
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,590
Do well next time.

440
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,240
Don’t worry.

441
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,790
Let’s go.

442
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,160
It’s okay. Do well next time.

443
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,270
Do some exercises after you go back.

444
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
It’s not that difficult.

445
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,640
Dad. Mom. I’m back.

446
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,310
Oh.

447
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,480
Dad.

448
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,640
Is the food ready?

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,790
-Hey, you! Don’t throw your schoolbag.
-Almost done.

450
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,640
Smells so good!

451
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,720
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

452
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,000
When can we eat, Dad?

453
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,030
I can do it faster
if you don’t talk to me.

454
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,830
Wow!

455
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,240
Oh my god! Honey!

456
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,160
-What?
-Come here! Look!

457
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,840
What’s wrong?

458
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,350
Our son passed the exam!

459
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,160
He got 92!

460
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,830
-Son, I’m so proud of you!
-No, Dad.

461
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,400
-I’m so happy!
-It’s not mine.

462
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,000
Where’s yours?

463
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
This is Chuan’s.

464
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,440
Where’s his?

465
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,590
Li He.

466
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,790
58.

467
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,070
58.

468
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,310
Calm down, calm down.

469
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,240
False alarm.

470
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,790
It means that our son’s scores

471
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,880
are very consistent.

472
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,310
But Li He,

473
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,900
why can’t you

474
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,880
pass the exam for once

475
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,510
and show it to me?

476
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,750
Mom.

477
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,720
I’m a PE student.

478
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
Besides,

479
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,750
Chuan is the best student among us.

480
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,440
What can I do?

481
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,960
It’s okay.

482
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,720
It’s just that I

483
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,030
haven’t seen a test paper
with a high score.

484
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
So I got excited.

485
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,790
I think

486
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,350
you should stop dreaming that.

487
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,680
-What?
-Hey!

488
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,510
How about we have a second child?

489
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,960
He has no hope now.

490
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,000
But we can put our hope
in our second child.

491
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,440
What are you saying?

492
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,200
So annoying.

493
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,750
I’m going back to my room.

494
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,400
Hey, son.

495
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,590
Son.

496
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,070
Don’t listen to your dad.

497
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,240
Hey!

498
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,030
He’s angry. Why did you say that?

499
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,720
(To Chief)
Chief, you got the wrong test paper?

500
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,200
Was Auntie upset when she saw my score

501
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,550
and then saw your score?

502
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,920
Right.

503
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,960
No comparison, no harm.

504
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
You have no idea

505
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,680
how happy they were when they thought

506
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,030
I passed the exam at first.

507
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,550
I want to make them feel happy once.

508
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,480
Aright, as your friend,

509
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,110
I can’t just stand by and do nothing.

510
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,400
Do you have an idea?

511
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
The normal way should not work.

512
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,620
(Sen Yong High School)

513
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,830
First,

514
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,240
cheating

515
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,310
is about the time, place and people.

516
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,110
The time has been set.

517
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,110
And we

518
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,640
need to work on the place.

519
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,510
First, we have to figure out

520
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,640
the seat assignment.

521
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,200
Yun Xiang will sit against the wall.

522
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,920
Generally speaking,
one side against the wall

523
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,110
is a safe place.

524
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,160
Wear light clothes

525
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,350
under your school uniform tomorrow.

526
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,680
And after taking off
your school uniform

527
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,000
in the exam room,

528
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,310
I believe you can blend in
with the wall.

529
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,240
Jiang Yuan will sit in the corner.

530
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
The monitoring blind spot.

531
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,240
It should be all right.

532
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,350
The only problem is Chief.

533
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,480
So Chief

534
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,070
needs to make changes

535
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,000
according to the habits
of each invigilator.

536
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,680
If it’s Miss Luo,

537
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,400
we have to do the diversionary maneuver.

538
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,640
Ouch!

539
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:11,270
What’s wrong?

540
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,640
I have a stomachache.

541
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,070
I ate something wrong.

542
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,200
-Stomachache?
-Wait!

543
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,590
The list of invigilators
has not yet come out.

544
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,440
What if it’s not Miss Luo?

545
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,590
If it’s Mr. Tianci…

546
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,720
Because he always bows his head
to do experiment,

547
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:34,960
his cervical vertebra is not good.

548
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
He likes to look at the sky
at a 45 degree

549
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
when he is resting.

550
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,750
At that time,

551
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,640
we need to do it in a low position.

552
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,640
What if it’s Mr. Ma?

553
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,640
That can’t be.

554
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,680
We won’t be so unlucky.

555
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,350
What?

556
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,550
What do you mean?

557
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,160
Give them to me.

558
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,440
What?

559
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,200
The cheat sheets.

560
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,790
And?

561
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,920
I have none.

562
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,000
It’s the last one.

563
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,680
I’m telling the truth.

564
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,350
Are you sure?

565
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,830
I’ll use force then.

566
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,720
Try to fool me?

567
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,550
You think I’ve been the monitor
for two years for nothing?

568
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,550
Caixi.

569
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,590
I don’t want to cheat.

570
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,480
I just want to pass the exam.

571
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
But it’s only a few days
before the monthly exam.

572
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,000
No matter how hard I try,
it doesn’t work.

573
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,590
Didn’t you ever care about your score?

574
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,030
I want to improve.

575
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,510
It’s humiliating

576
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
to fail all the time.

577
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,240
Now you feel humiliating?

578
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,000
Caixi.

579
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,310
Do you

580
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,030
have any quick learning tips

581
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,200
to improve my score significantly?

582
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,960
Yes, I have.

583
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,480
What is that?

584
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,110
Be a genius. Like Ning Zeyu.

585
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
That’s useless.

586
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,110
Are you serious?

587
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,510
Do you really want to pass the exam?

588
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,350
Yes.

589
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,400
My parents don’t scold me for my score,

590
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,160
but that doesn’t mean they don’t care.

591
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,920
I just want to pass the exam for once

592
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,030
to make them happy.

593
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,240
That’s all.

594
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,140
Okay.

595
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,000
I know now.

596
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,110
We have four days left.

597
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,310
Leave it to me.

598
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,030
I wonder if there are any new books
in the library.

599
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,350
I really want to see
the Ship of Theseus.

600
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,110
Let me ask you a question.

601
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:00,610
Okay.

602
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,510
How is your cousin doing at school?

603
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,550
It’s fine.

604
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,640
Not too good or not too bad.

605
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,240
What do you think can help people

606
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,310
improve their scores in a short time?

607
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,310
If there were a way,

608
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
we would all get in Tsinghua
or Peking University.

609
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
You’re right.

610
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,550
But I really want

611
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,480
to help Li He

612
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,640
and PE students this time.

613
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,920
Right.

614
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,200
They did help us

615
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,680
with the relay race.

616
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,720
This monthly exam is very important.

617
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,110
But they can’t pass every subject

618
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,880
in such a short period of time.

619
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,200
Right.

620
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,240
Why are you sighing

621
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
on such a beautiful day?

622
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,030
Zeyu.

623
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,830
There’s something

624
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,070
we don’t know what to do.

625
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,070
What?

626
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,000
Is it related to study?

627
00:32:59,270 --> 00:32:59,960
Yes.

628
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,920
Then I can help you.

629
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,200
But I want to go
to the dessert shop now.

630
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,000
Do you want to join me?

631
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,640
You don’t like mango cake?

632
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,030
Mango is cold-natured.

633
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,000
But mangoes will be soon out of season,

634
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,680
and blueberries are all year round.

635
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,510
The maple sugar waffle

636
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,240
is the best seller.

637
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,240
Maple sugar flew in from Canada

638
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,160
tastes different.

639
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,590
Is maple sugar waffle good?

640
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:36,030
I can only say that it is better
than other shops.

641
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,270
Excuse me, your mango cake.

642
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,200
Okay. Thank you.

643
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,070
Take your time.

644
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,960
The turtle is so cute.

645
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,070
How can you play with it?

646
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,960
My fingers itch.

647
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,110
But the turtle is miserable.

648
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,830
Han Yayi doesn’t know

649
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,720
what to choose.

650
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,590
How about you eat first?

651
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,550
Zeyu.

652
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,070
Yes?

653
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,360
It’s great to be a genius.

654
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,550
Better luck in genetics. That’s all.

655
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,760
I’ve heard that eating sweets
makes people feel better,

656
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,150
but I don’t know if it’s true.

657
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,320
Why don’t you try it for me?

658
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:45,920
How is it?

659
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,030
Hmm…

660
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,880
The world seems to become
a little more beautiful.

661
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,070
Who are you going to help?

662
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,070
Li He and other PE students.

663
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,280
I want to help them pass the exams.

664
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,960
That’s all?

665
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,880
Of course.

666
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,670
Li He said he wanted to pass the exam

667
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,150
to make his parents happy,

668
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,110
so I wanted to help him.

669
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,110
Okay, I’ll help you.

670
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,150
Really?

671
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,480
We only have four days left.

672
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,360
You must have thought

673
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,590
to help them pass all subjects, right?

674
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,760
Let me tell you,

675
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,260
if they can pass

676
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,440
the main subjects

677
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,000
or even half of the subjects,

678
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,110
it is considered a success.

679
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,070
You’re right.

680
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,630
I was thinking

681
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,440
how they could pass all the subjects,

682
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,590
but I couldn’t figure it out.

683
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,110
That’s why you need me.

684
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,030
Don’t worry. I’ll help you.

685
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,060
Okay?

686
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
Thank you.

687
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,150
You’re welcome.

688
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,110
Han Yayi.

689
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,320
Hurry up.

690
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay.

691
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,960
Listen to me.

692
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,630
Everybody’s in a good condition today.

693
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,510
Keep it that way.

694
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,190
Okay?

695
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,960
Now dismissed. Stretch your muscles.

696
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,280
He.

697
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,880
You’re in good condition today.

698
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,920
Keep it that way.
There is hope of breaking the record.

699
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,280
Thank you. I’ll try my best.

700
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,360
Mr. Bai.

701
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,670
How’s my condition?

702
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,000
You?

703
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,510
Stop being lazy.

704
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Or I’ll punish you.

705
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,800
Did you hear me?

706
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,920
Stretch your muscles.

707
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,550
Oh.

708
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,760
Someone is really a person
with a narrow view.

709
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,760
Break records?

710
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,480
Don’t make me laugh.

711
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,630
Just say what you want to say.

712
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,320
Stop being so surly.

713
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,920
Li He.

714
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,110
I admit that you are good,

715
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,550
but there are people better than you.

716
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
With your performance,

717
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,880
you’re nobody

718
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,440
in No. 2 Experimental Middle School.

719
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,230
I competed

720
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,000
and I won.

721
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:04,960
So?

722
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,510
That was in the past.

723
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,000
Now their track and field team

724
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,670
has hired a retired national coach

725
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,880
and upgraded all training programs.

726
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,030
Will you beat that?

727
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,550
Is he insane?

728
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,440
Yes, he is.

729
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,070
They have hired
a retired national coach?

730
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,110
I’ve heard that, too.

731
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,480
But it seems that it is not
a long-term training,

732
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,550
but a short-term special training.

733
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,070
I don’t know if they are good or not.

734
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,360
We’ll know after we see them.

735
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,400
When do they train?

736
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,110
I hear they have

737
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,000
a practice game tonight.

738
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,440
Error Correction Book. Chemistry.

739
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,550
(You have a new message.)

740
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,070
Hey.

741
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,110
Come to see me before the evening study.

742
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,110
I have something to tell you.

743
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,280
I’m coming.
See you at the evening study.

744
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,920
Our clothes are so much different
from theirs.

745
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,550
I’m afraid we can’t get through
the main entrance.

746
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,510
Right.

747
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,590
We can’t get in.

748
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Maybe we should go back.

749
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,110
No way. We are already here.

750
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,190
I’ll think of a way.

751
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,110
Let’s go.

752
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,070
-Here.
-Go.

753
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,400
Let’s climb.

754
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,400
So many notes.

755
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:18,320
These should be all you have.

756
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,230
You’ve come at the right time.

757
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,070
Please help me

758
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,960
paste the summary
of the knowledge points

759
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,070
behind each unit with this.

760
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,400
Then we’ll make a few copies.

761
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,590
They can follow the summary

762
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,630
of the knowledge points directly
to review.

763
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,590
Good idea.

764
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,030
The knowledge base points
and difficult points are all in here.

765
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,590
Let’s start from Chinese,
Math and English.

766
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,150
Okay.

767
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,590
We won’t be called truant, will we?

768
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,510
We were training at night before.

769
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,230
We can let Mr. Bai help us.

770
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,400
Anyway,

771
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,760
we have to go back
before the second class.

772
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,510
Do you hear me?

773
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,110
Okay.

774
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,150
