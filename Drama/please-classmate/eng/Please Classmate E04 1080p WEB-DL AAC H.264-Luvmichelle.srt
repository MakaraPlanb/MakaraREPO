Hi. Can I add you to my friends in QQ?

56
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,080
You are cool in playing basketball.

57
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,000
OK.

58
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,710
Thank you.

59
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,710
What’s wrong?

60
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,590
Why is it so easy for you
to ask others to befriend you on QQ?

61
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,360
You are wrong.
She asked me for my QQ ID.

62
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,000
Yuan, can you do me a favor?

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,940
(Beiyang’s Night Walk)

64
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,040
Yes, that’s it.

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,630
Yuan, I want to read it for long.

66
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,720
How did you find it?

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,310
Yuan is really great.

68
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,390
I don’t know

69
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,310
there’re horror fictions in the library.

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
It’s not horrifying.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,070
Just wonders in Peking. Very amazing.

72
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,190
I asked Yuan Caixi for QQ ID.

73
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,240
She refused me.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,360
Ning Zeyu asked her to go
to book store.

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,430
She accepted it.

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,510
What does that mean?

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,920
What else could it be?

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,040
You have low EQ.

79
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,160
Do you remember how you treated her

80
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,430
when a junior gave you water

81
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,720
in your 2nd year in senior high school?

82
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,630
Senior.

83
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,870
Training is tiring, right?

84
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,600
This drink is for you. It’s icy.

85
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,680
Hey, you did this on purpose, right?

86
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,480
A bottle of water
contains 43 kilocalorie,

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,870
and 53 grams of sugar.

88
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,270
After drinking it, we PE students
need to run another ten circles.

89
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,190
It’s so hot today.
I just finished exercise.

90
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,560
Drinking icy water

91
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,190
will upset the stomach.

92
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,240
Maybe it will cause loose bowels.

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,430
What do you mean?

94
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,800
Who sent you here?

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,560
She suddenly rushed to me
and gave me an icy drink

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,190
with high sugar content.

97
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,270
Also she spoke with hesitation.

98
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,800
I didn’t know what she’d do.

99
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,040
Anyway,

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
you are so straight.

101
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,920
Why did you ask for a girl’s QQ ID
all of a sudden?

102
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,000
I didn’t do that.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,630
I just thought we are classmates.

104
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,430
We could help each other.

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,830
Don’t hide it if you’re a man.

106
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,950
I didn’t hide it.

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,390
Chief.

108
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,920
You like Yuan Caixi, do you?

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Are you nuts?

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,680
Is it really so nice?

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,310
Have a try?

112
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,800
No, thanks. I’m fine.

113
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,600
Right.

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,720
You don’t have time
for leisure reading now.

115
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,920
You must be busy with chatting.

116
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,430
Don’t cut around the bushes. Say it.

117
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,830
Nothing. I’m just asking.

118
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,480
Why did Li He ask for your QQ ID?

119
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,510
How should I know?

120
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,800
We are classmates. Why not?

121
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,600
He made a big fuss for my QQ.

122
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
It’s hard for him to not be the focus.

123
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,680
Asking for QQ ID is not like stealing.

124
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
Why should we do it stealthily?

125
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,480
There is still one year.

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,800
It will affect my study.

127
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,510
Yes, she gets good grades.

128
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,800
But I’m good in sports, too.

129
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,070
We can help each other.

130
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,630
I thought
PE students are simple-minded.

131
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,510
But I didn’t expect that
he’s always messing around with me.

132
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,190
I didn’t mean to provoke her.

133
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,870
It’s for uniting the classmates.

134
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Am I wrong?

135
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,430
This is big trouble.

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,750
I will avoid him.

137
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,070
The more she tries to avoid me,
the more I will prove it to her

138
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,310
that we PE students
are excellent too.

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,480
This is the grouping list
of chemistry class.

140
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,240
The leader will come to investigate.
You’d better be prepared for it.

141
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
Don’t cause any trouble.

142
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,390
Chuan. Chuan.

143
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:50,950
What’s wrong?

144
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,950
Look.

145
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Oh!

146
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:00,950
What?

147
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,720
Just take a look.
I don’t mean anything.

148
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,560
How about this?

149
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,830
You don’t mean anything.

150
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,390
I will help you to create it.

151
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,190
What do you mean?

152
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,720
I’m good at collecting information.

153
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,920
I will help you.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,800
You should cater to her pleasure.

155
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,680
That’ll build good relationship fast.

156
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,870
Excuse me. I didn’t finish the notes.

157
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,200
Can I borrow yours?

158
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,080
No.

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,550
If you want Yuan’s QQ ID,

160
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,840
I won’t give it to you.

161
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,960
Li He already asked for it.

162
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,870
How do you know

163
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,910
I’m here for another girl?

164
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,670
Every time he came close to me,

165
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,140
I could smell the perfume.

166
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,840
Stop reading.

167
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,440
I will leave if there is nothing else.

168
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey.

169
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,120
Are you hungry or not?
I will invite you to eat.

170
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,790
Do you know what you’re like now?

171
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,200
A little hamster.

172
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,440
Seems you are afraid of me.

173
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
Yes.

174
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,000
You even dare to beat the teacher.

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,720
What?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,150
You even trust the rumor.

177
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,550
Isn’t it true?

178
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,030
Mr. Zhang who quitted last year

179
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,480
was hit by you because

180
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,750
he criticized you for sleeping in class.

181
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,270
The truth is Mr. Zhang suffered from

182
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,030
a sudden heart attack

183
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,750
when he just got in the classroom.

184
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,750
We did cardiac resuscitation on him

185
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,080
and sent him to the hospital in time.

186
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Then we rescued him.

187
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,870
It’s his old sickness.

188
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,030
He couldn’t teach.

189
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,790
So he quitted.

190
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,030
He even came to thank us before he left.

191
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,360
Hmm.

192
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
So you got it now?

193
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,150
Never trust or spread the rumor.

194
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,030
Understand?

195
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Yes.

196
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,240
I see.

197
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,080
But I’m curious.

198
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,720
What?

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
How did you

200
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,750
become the friend of Yuan Caixi?

201
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,720
You’re so different in characters.

202
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,200
Yuan and I are different.

203
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
We are even poles apart.

204
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,630
I dared not to talk to her at first.

205
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:52,270
What happened then?

206
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,320
Then…

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,000
Then I found that

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
she often forgets or loses stuff.

209
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,360
I happen to sit beside her.

210
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,550
So she often borrows pens

211
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,870
or some other things from me.
Then we became friends.

212
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,600
Is that so?

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,960
She looks serious at ordinary times.

214
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,440
She’s like a smaller-sized devil.

215
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,870
I can’t believe she is forgetful.

216
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,600
Yuan often looks cold.

217
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,550
It’s because

218
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,960
she is different from us.

219
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,870
Yuan is the best girl
I’ve ever met.

220
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,840
She’s studied hard

221
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,390
for China’s best university of finance.

222
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,480
Yuan likes collecting
reference books of all subjects.

223
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,550
Yuan…

224
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,080
Yuan…

225
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,510
Yuan…

226
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,910
Great!

227
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,030
What’s wrong?

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,790
You are good at

229
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,870
seeing your friends’ merits.

230
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,630
So I think you are also the best.

231
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,790
No, I’m not. Not a bit.

232
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,670
I like many things in various aspects.

233
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,510
Also I have many hobbies.

234
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:08,390
Moreover, I like to read things
of horror genre.

235
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Others always think
I have a mental disorder

236
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
and I’m weird.

237
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Only Yuan.

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,510
We can chat together.

239
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,960
Does she like horror films, too?

240
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,720
Ah, no, she can’t.

241
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,320
Every time I talk about
horrifying things,

242
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,630
she’ll recite periodic table
of elements.

243
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,480
What a coincidence!

244
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,550
Our chief is also like this.

245
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,390
Ah?

246
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,080
Some time ago,

247
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,270
I watched a horror film with him.

248
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,670
He was so scared that
he could only fall asleep

249
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,360
with the light on for a month.

250
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,550
He could only feel relieved

251
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,270
when the space under the bed

252
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,320
is filled with all kinds of things.

253
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,150
It is no exaggeration.

254
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,720
I can’t believe Li He fears these.

255
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Yes.

256
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,910
Oh, right.

257
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,080
I remember I have some new

258
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,360
horror films of high ratings.

259
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,200
Maybe we can watch together.

260
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,360
OK. OK.

261
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,360
We can watch together with them.

262
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,910
OK. OK.

263
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,120
It’s delicious.

264
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,550
Yes.

265
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,420
(Old Big Head)

266
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,620
(Chuan)

267
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,200
Hello.

268
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,440
Chief.

269
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,550
You’ve heard our dialogue, right?

270
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,670
Nonsense.

271
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,720
Hey, who is a coward?

272
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,510
It’s not important.

273
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,360
The important thing is that

274
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,600
I got the information for you.

275
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,320
I will spare you today.

276
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,080
I finally understand why monitor

277
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,390
didn’t give me the QQ ID

278
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,870
but agreed to go
to the book store with Ning Zeyu.

279
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,550
Is she a quirky collector

280
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,200
of reference book?

281
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,390
Why are you laughing?

282
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,790
It’s just catering to her pleasure.
I can do that.

283
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,790
Monitor will go out

284
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,750
for the reference book

285
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,720
of Tianxing… tomorrow, right?

286
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,840
I will give her one.

287
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,020
(You have four new messages.)

288
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
(You have nine new messages.)

289
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
(You have thirteen new messages.)

290
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,910
-Aren’t you just annoying?
-No.

291
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
She insisted on adding me.

292
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,270
It’s all because I’m too attractive.

293
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,910
You can refuse, can’t you?

294
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,790
We are classmates.
It’ll be embarrassing.

295
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,270
Please be high-principled, okay?

296
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,030
Hey.

297
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,480
Can you show some love
to your classmates, sister?

298
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,550
It’s just because of this,

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,630
you only have one friend for two years.

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,870
So lonely.

301
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,630
Hey, Yuan Caixi.

302
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,360
Mom.

303
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,870
Yuan Haoxi skipped class last night
to watch movie with classmate.

304
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,200
Haoxi.

305
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,670
Mom.

306
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,720
I’m doing homework.

307
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,510
Chief.

308
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,390
Won’t we go play basketball?
Why the book store?

309
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
No question. Just shut up.

310
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,700
(SiSYPHE)

311
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,670
You are the owner?

312
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,390
Yes.

313
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Buy any books?

314
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,240
I want to ask you something.

315
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,320
What’s it?

316
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,080
Hey, sir.

317
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,510
Buy any books? Please enjoy.

318
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,390
I ordered the 45 Tianxing Gold Paper.

319
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,910
Where is it now?

320
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,030
You ordered it?

321
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,630
Yes. I was afraid it might be sold out,

322
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,550
so I ordered in advance.

323
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,150
The, the book…

324
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,910
is sold out.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,670
Sold out?

326
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
What do you mean?

327
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,360
We haven’t received it.

328
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,270
OK. It doesn’t matter.

329
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,630
We will figure out another way.

330
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,910
OK. OK.

331
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Ah, the book is great.

332
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,750
The latest question bank
of Tianxing Gold Paper.

333
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,590
It’s compiled by Du Jiang,
a national special-class teacher.

334
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,960
Its prediction is accurate.

335
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,880
Really a valuable book
for college entrance examination.

336
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,440
It’s for you.

337
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
This is the one Zeyu ordered, right?

338
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,550
Is it so?

339
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,590
The owner said pre-order isn’t set up
unless the deposit is paid.

340
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,400
This is the last one. I got it first.

341
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
No, we will buy it online.

342
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,400
Hey.

343
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,270
All have been sold out.

344
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,030
The next batch will be dispatched
15 days later.

345
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,550
It’s prepared specially for you.

346
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,070
Add me as your QQ friend, okay?

347
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,880
OK, uncle Du Jiang.

348
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
I will send you the address. Thank you.

349
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,310
Mr. Du Jiang agreed

350
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,880
to send two sets later.

351
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,350
Also there is a bookmark
with his autograph.

352
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,480
Since you like this book so much,

353
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,640
finish all the tests in it.

354
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,960
It’s returned to its rightful owner.

355
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,550
Oh, Li He.

356
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,310
The book is really nice.

357
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,270
You can pick the simple ones.

358
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,400
Make the best use of it.

359
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,480
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

360
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,400
Excuse me. Please make way.

361
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,640
Uh.

362
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,960
Can I sell them now?

363
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,640
No.

364
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
Thank you.
I’ve transferred the money to you.

365
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,000
No need.

366
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,590
You can buy me milk tea next time.

367
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,400
Your hair is longer now.

368
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,590
It was at the neck before.

369
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,750
Really? Seems it’s a bit longer.

370
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,720
It’s OK. Good to keep long hair.

371
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,750
Don’t cut it.

372
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
Maybe it’s better to cut it.

373
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,720
Or it is too troublesome.

374
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,720
Do you remember your first words to me

375
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,070
when you just entered the school?

376
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,440
What did I say?

377
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,880
We are at the same class.

378
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,110
Kind of classmates.

379
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,830
But I was the first
every year in junior high.

380
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
So from today on,

381
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
we are kind of rivals.

382
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,640
You walked down from the platform.

383
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,550
Did I say such childish words?

384
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,310
I must be too silly at that time.

385
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,160
Don’t mind it.

386
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,110
So are you wise now?

387
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,160
Of course, I’ve made great progress.

388
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,480
I’m no longer bookish at all.

389
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,200
So do you still see me as a rival?

390
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Half.

391
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,480
One half of rival
and the other of classmate.

392
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,680
You are still a bookish.

393
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
What?

394
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,660
(Miss Luo: Come to my office.)

395
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,000
Miss Luo wants me. I have to go now.

396
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,030
Report.

397
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,830
Come in.

398
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,160
Good morning, teacher.

399
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,440
Good morning, teacher.

400
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,880
Morning.

401
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,680
Miss Luo, you’re looking for me?

402
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,790
Here is the thing.

403
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,070
The leaders will come to investigate on

404
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,440
the status
after our two classes are merged.

405
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,160
Our class is responsible
for chemistry experiment open class.

406
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,420
I’ve discussed it with Mr. Zhang.

407
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:19,830
Yes.

408
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,510
You will be paired in groups of two

409
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,700
for the chemistry experiment. OK?

410
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,220
OK.

411
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,480
This is

412
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,550
the list of grouping.

413
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,880
Take it and let others read it.

414
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,070
OK.

415
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,140
(Group List)

416
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,260
(Group members: Yuan Caixi, Li He)

417
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,030
Miss Luo, can you change one for me?

418
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,960
Why?

419
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,550
I don’t want to be with Li He.

420
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,590
Here is the thing.

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,350
The survey

422
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,790
is to check the status

423
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,400
of class combining.

424
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,830
There must be a representative
from PE students.

425
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,680
I know

426
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
they have poor basis.

427
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,070
But you are the monitor.

428
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,110
You always have good grades.

429
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,270
So I hope you can help them

430
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,400
to make progress.

431
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,440
OK.

432
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,550
Go ahead.

433
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,160
Bye-bye, Miss Luo.

434
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,030
Hmm.

435
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,110
Good morning, Mr. Bai.

436
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,880
Morning.

437
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,590
What’s wrong with the girl?

438
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,510
She looks downhearted.

439
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,750
The leaders will come to survey.

440
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,830
We are in charge of chemistry class.

441
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,000
She isn’t happy for being

442
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,590
in the same group with Li He.

443
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,270
Hmm.

444
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,880
Oh.

445
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,160
It doesn’t matter.

446
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,310
Come on.

447
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,110
Yuan Haoxi, watch out.

448
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,000
OK. Fine.

449
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,920
I will make it higher.

450
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,160
Come on. Watch it.

451
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,510
Ah.

452
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,750
Look.

453
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,400
I don’t have time for him now.

454
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,590
Do you know the grouping
for chemistry class?

455
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,400
I don’t know.

456
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,440
Do you know who I saw yesterday?

457
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,310
Ye Jingxi?

458
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,590
If I can see him in real life,

459
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,550
I will be sent to hospital for rescue.

460
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Who is it then?

461
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,680
Lin Chuan, the first henchman of Li He.

462
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Lin Chuan?

463
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,350
Why?

464
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,110
After school yesterday,

465
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,960
he appeared in front of me suddenly

466
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
and invited me for a cake.

467
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,310
I didn’t think it’s simple.

468
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,070
He did so only for spying on you.

469
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,240
I didn’t say anything,

470
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,070
except some polite formula.

471
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,790
Hmm.

472
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,350
But I got some information for you.

473
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,960
Li He is timid.

474
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,030
Hey.

475
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:03,310
Li He asked for your QQ ID first.

476
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,400
Then

477
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,640
they asked for information about you.

478
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,880
They are not kind.

479
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,920
Kind ones don’t come.

480
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:10,960
Look.

481
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,000
Grouping list for chemistry experiment.

482
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,270
You and Li He are in one group?

483
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,640
-I talked to Miss Luo to see
-Yes.

484
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
if I could not be in the same group
with him.

485
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,680
But Miss Luo said

486
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
it’s for helping classmates.

487
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,830
I…

488
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,680
If… If Li He

489
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,590
tells Mr. Luo himself...

490
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,550
Both of you

491
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,480
said so,

492
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,550
to ensure a smooth class,

493
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,720
I believe

494
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,270
Miss Luo won’t force you
to be in the same group.

495
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,480
So you mean

496
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,830
we can let Li He put forward it.

497
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,680
Good for me.

498
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,160
Good for you.

499
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,750
Hmm.

500
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,480
But Yuan.

501
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:58,960
What?

502
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,550
I always can’t understand one thing.

503
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,000
What’s it?

504
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,350
Why are there so many girls
around your brother?

505
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,510
Don’t try to guess girls’ mind.

506
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,030
This cursed charm.

507
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,180
(Chemistry Lab)

508
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,590
Good morning, teacher.

509
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,550
Morning.

510
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,000
What a coincidence, monitor!

511
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,440
We are in the same group again.

512
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,510
What a coincidence, Li He!

513
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,720
What will we do today?

514
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Burn the dry kelp.

515
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,200
Is it produced by burning?

516
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,640
I will add some green onion.

517
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,830
No.

518
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,310
We can’t eat in class.

519
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,750
Li He.

520
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,640
We are performing

521
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,830
separating and verifying
tests of iodine.

522
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,440
It doesn’t mean real burning.

523
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,590
You don’t even take your book.

524
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,590
What? I totally can’t understand.

525
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,510
Learn earnestly if you can’t understand.

526
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,030
Don’t be a burden when you
don’t have enough intelligence.

527
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,790
I didn’t provoke you.

528
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,070
Are you in our group?

529
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,750
Sorry, I’m in charge of the scene.

530
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,860
(Competent Person)

531
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,590
Ah.

532
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,100
(Competent Person)

533
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,110
I’m the competent person anyhow.

534
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,830
Got it. Got it.

535
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,310
Come on.

536
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
Let’s begin.

537
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,510
Ning Zeyu.

538
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,510
Please stand up.

539
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,550
Now,

540
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,160
please tell us

541
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,070
the experimental principle

542
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,680
of separating iodine from kelp

543
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,240
and it’s verification.

544
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,110
Iodine in kelp

545
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,590
mainly exists in form of iodide ions.

546
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,070
Take kelp as the material,
and a bit iodine water,

547
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,310
oxidize iodide ions with

548
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,550
oxidizing agent and hydrogen peroxide,

549
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,000
then verify the existence
of iodine elemental

550
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,160
and separate it.

551
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
The ionic equation related
to the reaction

552
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
is on the board.

553
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,160
Is it OK?

554
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,550
Very good.

555
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,200
It’s just burning kelp.
Not that extraordinary.

556
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Next…

557
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,160
Recite the principle if you can.

558
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Of course.

559
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
Burning kelp is…

560
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,110
H2…

561
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,880
Uh, then…

562
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,830
Add some…

563
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,240
Iodine…

564
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,480
Enough.

565
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,550
Give up if it’s so hard for you.

566
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,160
Right?

567
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,920
If you give it up,

568
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,880
you don’t need to be
in the same group with me.

569
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,590
Then you don’t have to

570
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,310
answer the questions.

571
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,070
Give up?

572
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,750
The most important thing for a sportsman
is perseverance.

573
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,880
How could I give up?

574
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,480
It’s just burning kelp.

575
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,000
I will recite the equation

576
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,720
immediately.

577
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,680
Which page?

578
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,640
Ah!

579
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,880
Turn two pages.

580
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,400
It’s different from my imagination.

581
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,640
Be cautious when you are igniting it.

582
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
OK.

583
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,640
Hmm.

584
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,640
Can you remember it?

585
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,920
Give it up if you can’t remember.

586
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,590
When I make up my mind,

587
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,480
I will never give up.

588
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,070
OK.

589
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,310
Good.

590
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,310
You have good first experience

591
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,510
in the lab.

592
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,640
OK. Take a break.

593
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:41,590
I will answer a call of nature, Chief.

594
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,400
Hey, monitor Yuan.

595
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
-Yes?
-Monitor Yuan, come here.

596
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,270
We don’t have enough kelp.

597
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,000
Help me to take some from the warehouse.

598
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,640
OK.

599
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,590
Here. Thank you.

600
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,160
OK.

601
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,510
I have to remember this.

602
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,270
Li He.

603
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,000
Come with me

604
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,200
to get the dried kelp.

605
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,000
Huh?

606
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,790
Help me.

607
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,640
What’s it?

608
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
Hey.

609
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,240
Be slow.

610
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,510
What’s wrong?

611
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,830
Nobody’s come here for a long time.

612
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
What if it’s dangerous?

613
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,510
You’re not scared, are you?

614
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,550
How could I be?

615
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Hmm.

616
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,000
How about…?

617
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,000
Lady first.

618
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,920
Hey.

619
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,000
-Wait for me.
-Come on.

620
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,030
It should be on the shelf in the front.

621
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,640
Dry.

622
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,480
There is laughter. Did you hear it?

623
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,640
You must be wrong. I didn’t hear it.

624
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,000
Monitor.

625
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,830
Yes.

626
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,270
There seems to be something
on my back.

627
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,880
Where? Let me check.

628
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,590
This?

629
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,270
Don’t use your hand. It’s poisonous.

630
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,680
God! I’ll be poisoned first if it is.

631
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,310
What’s more, I will protect you.

632
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,720
I got it.

633
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,070
Who are you?

634
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,680
It’s fine.

635
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,590
God!

636
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,270
It has a real spider.

637
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,590
Spider. Spider.

638
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,920
Han Yayi.

639
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,030
Why are you here?

640
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,440
You did this on purpose?

641
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,160
Hey.

642
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,200
Aren’t you childish?

643
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,640
Is it interesting to scare a man
during the day?

644
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,240
Well, we did it on purpose.

645
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,030
Why?

646
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,030
For the chemistry class.

647
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,590
It’s very important to me.

648
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,590
And I’m the subject representative.

649
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,510
No mistake is allowed.

650
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,960
But you have very poor basis.

651
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,720
You will surely make mistakes.

652
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,350
That’s it.

653
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,640
You are looking down on me.

654
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,400
Don’t worry.

655
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,070
I won’t make any mistake

656
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,030
in this chemistry class.

657
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,110
I will show you the real perfection.

658
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,400
Wait and see.

659
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,790
Yuan.

660
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,550
We failed this time.

661
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,200
What should we do next?

662
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,030
There isn’t a next step.

663
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,200
I give up.

664
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,550
You give up just like this?

665
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,720
What can I do?

666
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,830
He made a promise.

667
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,270
Are you sure?

668
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,480
Look,

669
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,440
he remembered the equation,

670
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,920
copied the test steps.

671
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
We even scared him today.

672
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,160
We can’t go too far, right?

673
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,480
What’s more,

674
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,480
he is trying hard.

675
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,240
Let’s go.

676
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,000
Mr. Zhang, we are back.

677
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,880
Thank you, Yuan.

678
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,380
OK.

679
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,340
Here is the key.

680
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,550
OK. Thank you.

681
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,720
Go back to your seat.

682
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,920
Come on, students.

683
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,160
Let’s do the next step.

684
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,350
Come on.

685
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,160
Let’s begin.

686
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,440
Hmm.

687
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,150
Learn how to use the stirring rod first.

688
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,440
Hmm.

689
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,000
Stir it lightly against the cup wall.

690
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,800
Too strong. Be lighter.

691
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,880
OK.

692
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,150
-Li He.
-What?

693
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,030
Is it the first time
you perform a chemistry experiment?

694
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,360
Yes, I never entered any lab before.

695
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,920
The steps and principles

696
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
are all wrong.

697
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,760
You may add me as you QQ friend.

698
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,800
You can ask if you don’t know.

699
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
3512127122.

700
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,480
Wait.

701
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,710
3512127122.

702
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,000
What’s it? 35.

703
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,630
3512, 3…

704
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,150
…5…

705
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:50,670
Stop disrupting me.
I’m remembering the number.

706
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,230
3512127122.

707
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,920
How do you know it?

708
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I remembered it just now.

709
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,030
Say it again.

710
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,030
Say it again.

711
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,000
351…

712
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,760
Call me dad.

713
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,710
Call me dad. Then I will tell you.

714
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,230
Dad?

715
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,320
Lin Chuan.

716
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,840
Are you proud?

717
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,630
Stop.

718
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,400
Yuan. Look.

719
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,840
Jing is really handsome. The angle…

720
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,280
How could he be so handsome?

721
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,670
He’s not as handsome as
what you said.

722
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Yuan, you don’t understand it.

723
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,510
Me…?

724
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,070
Who?

725
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,660
It won’t be others.
He even didn’t write the name.

726
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,440
(Friend Request: Me)
Li He.

727
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,360
Yuan, you gave your ID to Li He?

728
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,880
Yes.

729
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,590
Yuan.

730
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,190
Am I listening wrongly?
You gave your QQ ID to Li He?

731
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,480
What’s wrong?

732
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,480
Yuan, you are changing.

733
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,760
You are really different.

734
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,440
It’s because of the chemistry class.

735
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,230
What if he can’t do anything
and causes troubles.

736
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,670
You are arguing.

737
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,000
Han Yayi.

738
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
If you can pay such attention to study,

739
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,070
it won’t be like this.

740
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,000
See you.

741
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,110
You are really different.

742
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,000
We just add as friends.

743
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,110
I’d say hello first

744
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,920
to show my politeness.

745
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,020
(He/she has added you as a friend.)

746
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,150
Hi, monitor.

747
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,710
Can you do me a favor?

748
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,070
Why should I send her a message?

749
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,190
Hi.

750
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Calm down.

751
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,000
Be restrained.

752
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,070
Hi.

753
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,400
(Yuan Caixi)
Zeyu, excuse me.

754
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,440
Do you remember the book
about chemical elements?

755
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,960
It’s vivid with pictures and stories.

756
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,070
What’s the title?

757
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,420
You mean this one?

758
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,360
Yes, that's it.

759
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,710
Thank you, Zeyu.

760
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,280
(Ning Zeyu)
God, you accepted the enemy’s help.

761
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,420
Use prop milky tea

762
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,180
to reduce your enemy’s intelligence.

763
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,540
Use it or not.

764
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,620
(Yuan Caixi)

765
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:28,220
(Yuan Caixi)

766
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,880
Use it for 10086 times.

767
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,400
I will do my homework.

768
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,480
Happy birthday, Yuan.

769
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,360
Make a wish.

770
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,000
I hope I can be the first
in all exams.

771
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,230
I will appear once you blow the whistle.

772
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,280
Like a superman.

773
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,920
Bear.

774
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,400
Where are you now?

775
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,150
What do you look like?

776
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,840
OK. Families, time for dinner.

777
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,840
I’m so hungry.

778
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,630
He, time for dinner.

779
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,320
Yo.

780
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,800
It’s a fancy dinner.

781
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,320
Wow, braised pork chops.

782
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,710
Yes, come on.

783
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,400
It’s all yours.

784
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,110
Slow down.

785
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,440
Leave some for your mom.

786
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,360
Dad.

787
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,760
Can’t you pretend that you love me?

788
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:24,960
Delicious.

789
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,030
Son.

790
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,030
Are you alright?

791
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,760
Don’t worry, mom. I’m fine.

792
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,550
Dinner is the most important thing.

793
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,980
(Yuan Caixi sent a message.)

794
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,760
-That is the most important thing.
-That is the most important thing.

795
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,150
Hope this book will be helpful.

796
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:02,480
Got it.

797
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,110
Thank you, monitor.

798
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,400
