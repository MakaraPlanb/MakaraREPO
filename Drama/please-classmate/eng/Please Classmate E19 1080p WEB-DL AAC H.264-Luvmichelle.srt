17
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,280
We finally meet again after a long time.

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,070
What a pity you have to leave so soon.

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,400
Oh, have you packed up your things?

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Don’t worry. Hua will go with Jingxi.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,790
She won’t come back
before he gets settled.

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,510
Yuan, if you don’t want me to leave,

23
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,470
I will stay.

24
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,430
No. No. No.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,960
I don’t want to occupy your time.

26
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
I’m leaving now.

27
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,750
Can’t I speak a few words with Yuan?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,910
OK. Say it.

29
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,150
Guys, don’t be downhearted.

30
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,680
I know you all love me
and don’t want me to leave.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,630
It doesn’t matter.
Separation is the beginning of reunion.

32
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,680
I will be back soon.

33
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,840
Because the one important to me is here.

34
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,280
Super star.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,310
You’d study and work hard abroad.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,240
Don’t think of other things.
You’d better not return.

37
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,520
Why are you so mean?

38
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,910
How can I be generous in this?

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,630
Yuan, call me if you miss me.

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,750
I will book you the flight.

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,710
I will be your bodyguard.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,190
Well, enough.

43
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,360
If you miss us,

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
call us, you know?

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,240
OK.

46
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,080
I didn’t expect
I could study with a superstar

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
in the last year
of my senior high school.

48
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,840
Nice to meet you, musician Ye Jingxi.

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,680
Nice to meet you too,
straight A student Ning Zeyu.

50
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,800
If Li He bullies Yuan, you’d tell me.

51
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,910
I will return soon
to teach him a lesson.

52
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,710
No problem.

53
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,840
I’m still here.
What are you talking about?

54
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,080
Jingxi.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,430
I will miss you.

56
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,240
-Have a pleasant trip.
-I will miss you, too.

57
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,630
-Learn hard.
-Study hard.

58
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,030
Let’s go. Good luck, superstar.

59
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,870
-Come back early.
-Don’t worry.

60
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,630
Keep in touch.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,560
One. Two. One.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,910
Halt.

63
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,120
OK. Stretch on the spot.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,970
Stretching time.

65
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,960
I can’t imagine we have to run

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,240
even at the review stage.

67
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,560
You can’t say so.

68
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
We need to build up strength
to take the exam.

69
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,600
By the way,

70
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,040
why is Lin Chuan leading the running?

71
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,270
I don’t know. He didn’t say.

72
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,800
He even didn’t tell you?

73
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
He’s keeping it a secret.

74
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,870
The campus life without Jingxi

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,680
is bleak.

76
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,000
Who can be my new idol
among those in the entertainment circle?

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Enough, you…

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,870
Yuan.

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,570
He’s only chatting with others.

80
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,560
Calm down. Don’t be angry.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
I’m fine. I’m not angry.

82
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,750
Yes, you are not angry.

83
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,800
By the way,

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,920
Li He is weird, too.

85
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,870
Three days have passed. He kept
letting Lin Chuan lead the running.

86
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,750
He is training alone.

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,510
Why?

88
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,800
Forget it.

89
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,190
Monitor, finished stretching?
Let’s go take the test paper.

90
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,560
OK. Let’s go.

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,360
-Yuan, what’s wrong with you?
-Are you OK?

92
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,220
What’s wrong, Yuan?

93
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,950
-Yuan.
-Yuan Caixi.

94
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,120
Take her to the clinic.

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,430
Yuan.

96
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,950
Yuan, you are finally awake.

97
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,310
How do you feel? Where does it hurt?

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,680
How did I come here?

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,870
Did you forget it?
Zeyu took you here in his arms.

100
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,430
Zeyu?

101
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,040
Yes. Do you think I can hold you alone?

102
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,160
You are finally awake. How do you feel?

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,600
Oh, I’m fine now.

104
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,830
-Fine?
-Yes.

105
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,950
The doctor said you’ve been too tired.

106
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,390
You didn’t take a good rest, did you?

107
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,160
So that’s why you didn’t
eat too much for lunch.

108
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,190
I’m really fine.

109
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,390
It must be because
I stood up violently.

110
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,270
OK. Let’s go back.

111
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,630
Quickly. Upper.

112
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,360
Hold on.

113
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,870
Upper. Upper. OK.

114
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,630
Take a break. Have some water.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,270
Li He.

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,270
Come with me.

117
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,600
Yuan Caixi.

118
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,390
-You are back.
-Why didn’t you tell me you fainted?

119
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,160
It’s no big deal,
so I didn’t trouble you.

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,950
Give me your phone.

121
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,830
My phone?

122
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,680
What do you want?

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
From now on,

124
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,270
the clock will ring every morning,
noon and evening.

125
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,910
You must eat when it rings.

126
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,600
Take pictures for me.

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,120
-Is it necessary?
-Of course it is.

128
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,600
Why?

129
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,830
Because I worry about you.

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
You’ve fainted many times,

131
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,920
falling down in walking,
spraining the ankle in running,

132
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,430
and accidents happened
even when you ate pizza.

133
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,680
How can I take it easy?

134
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,120
From now on,

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,190
you have to have meals on time.

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,830
Okay?

137
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,680
Oh, got it.

138
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,920
Oh, right, I prepared
the study materials for you.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,550
You’ve missed class for days.

140
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,600
Take it back.

141
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,630
Why are you staring at me?

142
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,510
That’s my job as your monitor.

143
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,870
Then as your classmate,

144
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,030
may I invite you for dinner

145
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,790
to show my thanks?

146
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
Monitor.

147
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,000
You are trying to hide it,
but you made it more conspicuous.

148
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,390
What do you mean?

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,960
Tell me the truth,
what Li He has been doing recently?

150
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,290
What I can say is only

151
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,790
that he will tell you

152
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,150
once he figures it out.

153
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,400
At least you’d tell me

154
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,960
who the girl is.

155
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,080
The girl?

156
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,870
What do you mean?

157
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,080
The girl who stayed with Li He
when we were running.

158
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,360
Mr. Bai was there, too.

159
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,240
What were they learning?

160
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,910
Do you mean the junior
from the track and field team?

161
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,440
You have a secret.

162
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,960
I don’t know if Li He has any secrets.

163
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,270
But I’m sure I have one.

164
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,390
What is it?

165
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,790
You may guess.

166
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
You will be rewarded
if you guess it right.

167
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
What’s the reward?

168
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,120
The reward is…

169
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,870
This.

170
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,240
You…

171
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,510
That’s it.

172
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,480
You know what?

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,510
Many girls want it.

174
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,670
I’m very popular.

175
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
Han Yayi.

176
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,390
(To Yuan Caixi)

177
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,750
Did you have supper?

178
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,360
Yes, I did.

179
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,360
Nothing’s left. Seems it’s delicious.

180
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,030
(To Chuan)

181
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,980
Chief, Han Yayi came to ask for it.

182
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,600
I’m afraid I can’t keep it for long.

183
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,960
OK.

184
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,000
Then as your classmate, may I invite you

185
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,270
for dinner to show my thanks?

186
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,670
Is it a date or not?

187
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
Yuan Haoxi.

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
Yuan Haoxi.

189
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,440
It’s so early. I’m just ready
for playing the guitar.

190
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,360
Come here. I have something to ask.

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
What’s it? Go ahead.

192
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,030
I’m very busy, OK?

193
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,390
I’m leaving if you don’t ask.

194
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,790
Fine, I will ask.

195
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,720
Hypothetically speaking,

196
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
I mean let’s say…

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,630
Yes.

198
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,550
If you invited a girl for dinner,

199
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,000
she didn’t accept nor refuse…

200
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,440
Do you think

201
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,030
I need to invite a girl for dating?

202
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,240
Yuan Haoxi!

203
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,150
She didn’t accept nor refuse.

204
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,750
And on the set date,

205
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,270
let’s say it’s today,

206
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,510
what will you do?

207
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,120
Li He asked you out?

208
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,030
No, I didn’t mean him, I mean if…

209
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,320
You didn’t accept nor refuse,

210
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,630
but now you feel regretful.

211
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,620
I didn’t mean him. I mean you.

212
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,550
What will you do?

213
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,510
If it were me,

214
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
if I really want to ask her out,

215
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,600
I will take it as she accepted.

216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,550
Yes.

217
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,000
But if

218
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,120
I didn’t mean that,

219
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,910
I…

220
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,600
What’s it?

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,910
Take it as she refused.

222
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,080
Is it because of pretest anxiety?

I’d ask her.

No, Mom.

Mom, I’m living with two girls.

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,750
Hey, Li He. Come to see my match
this Saturday.

373
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,640
Oh, right. Happy birthday.

374
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,680
Happy birthday.

375
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,200
This is a gift for you.

376
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,550
The invitation ticket for my match.

377
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,000
Li He, I’m here to inform you…

378
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,680
What’s it?

379
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,030
Oh, Aunt, I…

380
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,000
I’m here for He.

381
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,960
Is he home?

382
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
He went to school.

383
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,030
OK. Thank you, Aunt.

384
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,440
-Hey, darling.
-Yes?

385
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,510
Is it a special day today?

386
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,750
-Special day?
-Yes.

387
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,590
Oh.

388
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,000
It’s the Valentine’s Day.

389
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,510
No.

390
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,480
Isn’t it Valentine’s Day?

391
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,640
No.

392
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,720
The first kiss anniversary?

393
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,440
No.

394
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,110
Your birthday?

395
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,030
No.

396
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,590
The anniversary of our wedding day?

397
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,240
No.

398
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,960
Monitor.

399
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,830
Actually,

400
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,070
I have one thing to tell you.

401
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,510
What’s it?

402
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,000
Can you train with me?

403
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,590
Train?

404
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,200
Yes.

405
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,000
Be my coach.

406
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,480
Why me? I don’t understand it.

407
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,400
No reason.

408
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,440
I just want you to train with me.

409
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,270
You can have Mr. Bai do that.

410
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,000
Fine, steamed stuffed bun face, hurry.

411
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,070
Train with me after finishing it.

412
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,400
Bun face?

413
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,350
Yes.

414
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,200
No.

415
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,750
-Yes.
-No.

416
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,350
-Yes.
-No.

417
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,920
-Yes.
-No.

418
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,750
-Yes.
-No.

419
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,830
We’ve changed the clothes.

420
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,680
Tell me, how to do it?

421
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,440
There is something you don’t know?

422
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,510
I’m leaving if you don’t start.

423
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,590
Sure I will.

424
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,200
Do you know the spring run?

425
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,270
Spring run?

426
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,510
Yes.

427
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,880
You can take the chance
to exercise, too.

428
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,590
What?

429
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:32,750
Don’t.

430
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,480
Li He.

431
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,110
No.

432
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,400
Why did you put it on me?
You will get trained, right?

433
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,400
Monitor.

434
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,510
Mr. Bai should have told us

435
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,030
it’s not just for intelligence
in the senior year.

436
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,350
We also need physical strength.

437
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,830
You don’t want to lose to Ning Zeyu

438
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,160
in both intelligence
and physical strength,

439

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,710
-Hello.
-Report, Yuan.

547
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,920
Any news?

548
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,960
What’s it?

549
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,030
I asked Lin Chuan.

550
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,590
Lin Chuan?

551
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,070
For what?

552
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,400
Of course about Li He.

553
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,550
Oh, Li He.

554
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,920
Since you said Li He’s been hiding
something from you,

555
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,710
I’ve kept it in my mind.

556
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,230
Then we saw he was with another girl.

557
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,280
No, I have to figure it out for you.

558
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,670
What do you have?

559
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,230
Nothing.

560
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,800
No…

561
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,920
But Yuan, I’m now sure about
at least two things.

562
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,400
First, he has just chatted

563
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,320
with the junior.

564
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,630
Second, he does have something
hiding from you.

565
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,000
Yuan.

566
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,510
I think

567
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,440
we

568
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,360
should respect Li He.

569
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,510
But hiding it is really…

570
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,800
Fine, no joking.

571
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,710
Actually, I already knew it.

572
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,070
What?

573
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,280
I already knew the secret.

574
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,440
Li He told me that.

575
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,840
-What’s it?
-It’s…

576
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,280
I can’t tell you.

577
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,670
Why?

578
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,880
No, Yuan.

579
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,960
You’re hiding it
from me together with them.

580
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,800
Ah.

581
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,710
Han Yayi, that’s all you have?

582
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,150
It’s so bad that all others know it

583
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,360
but I know nothing about it.

584
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,440
Yuan, it feels too bad.

585
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,440
Anxious?

586
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,670
Yes.

587
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,250
Then keep it. I have to hang up.

588
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,230
Think it over.

589
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,440
Yuan. Yuan.

590
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,110
Li He. Li He.

591
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,880
I even kept it a secret from Han Yayi
for you.

592
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,760
My God!

593
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,030
It’s so dark.
Why the light is still off?

594
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,190
Dad, Mom.

595
00:37:52,670 --> 00:38:13,000
♪Happy birthday to you♪

596
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,880
Son, we wish you

597
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,840
a happy eighteenth birthday.

598
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Congratulations, you are an adult now.

599
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,280
Are you silly?
You even try to make it a surprise.

600
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,320
Are you surprised or not?

601
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,440
Your mother insisted.

602
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,360
But it’s not my birthday today.

603
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,230
What?

604
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,360
I told your mom it’s not a special day.

605
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,670
No, it’s not right.

606
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,030
Eighteen years ago,

607
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,710
I picked him back from the trash can.

608
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,880
It won’t be wrong.

609
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,860
No, it’s impossible.

610
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,320
It must be him...

611
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,440
I’m kidding.

612
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,760
It is my birthday.

613
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,070
You brat.

614
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,300
-Moms won’t forget their child’s birthday.
-Thank you, Dad and Mom.

615
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,580
(Happy Birthday)

616
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,230
-Cut the cake.
-Come on.

617
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,400
-I will help you.
-OK.

618
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
One, two, three.

619
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,510
Yo, be slow.

620
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,440
OK. Give the first one to your dad.

621
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,030
No, thanks. Give the first to your mom.

622
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,110
Give it to your dad.

623
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,920
Your mom.

624
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,630
Fine, I will decide it.

625
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,630
The first one is to my mom.

626
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,670
Lady first.

627
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,760
And my birthday is mom’s suffering day.

628
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,630
You’ve had a long day, Mom.

629
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,400
Good boy. My eyes are filled with tears.

630
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,280
The second is to my dad. He’s the head.

631
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,760
He has always suffered a lot.

632
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,840
Thank you, Dad.

633
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,190
Thank you.

634
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,070
The last one is mine.

635
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,320
Be slow. It’s fruit flavor.

636
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,880
Oh, right. Zeyu came today.

637
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,000
Ning Zeyu?

638
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Yes, it seems
he wanted to inform you something.

639
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,400
Inform me?

640
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes.

641
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,760
Take a piece of cake for him.

642
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,480
It’s a happy thing

643
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,630
that needs to be shared with friends.

644
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,280
No, thanks, Dad. It’ll be a waste.

645
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,710
He doesn’t eat sweet food.

646
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,760
Just take some.

647
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,280
We are neighbors. It’s for being polite.

648
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,400
Listen to your dad’s words.

649
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,710
OK. I will take him some.

650
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,760
-Ah.
-OK.

651
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:17,630
Coming.

652
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,710
Ning Zeyu.

653
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,590
Who is that?

654
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,960
It’s me.

655
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,480
What?

656
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,710
You went for me? Bro, what’s it?

657
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,190
I’m not your bro.

658
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,230
You accepted me as your bro last month.

659
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,280
But you deny it now?

660
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,400
You are changing your mind so quickly.

661
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,190
OK. I’m in good mood today.

662
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,230
So I won’t be so mean.

663
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,880
Tell me, what is it?

664
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,400
I forget it.

665
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
Forget?

666
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,110
How can you?

667
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,630
Think it over.

668
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,510
No. I don’t want to think of it anymore.

669
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,320
It’s no big deal.

670
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,510
OK. Today is my birthday.

671
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,030
I got a cake for you.

672
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,400
No, thanks.

673
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,360
You are going too far.

674
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,800
You came for me when I wasn’t home.

675
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,830
I came for you when I’m back now.

676
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,550
It’s my birthday today.

677
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,920
I also take you a piece of cake.

678
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,150
But you only have a bad attitude.

679
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,190
I don’t like sugar,

680
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,440
especially the one from others.

681
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,030
Did you go to the school for me today?

682
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,510
Would I see something

683
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,150
if I went to the school?

684
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,880
Well.

685
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,650
Happy birthday.

686
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,070
I originally intended to go

687
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,190
to give you wishes.

688
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,840
Now,

689
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,760
I’d wish you without any doubts.

690
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,030
I will prepare for the exam.

691
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,630
After all,
I’d take back the first place.

692
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,320
OK, good night.

693
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,710
Oh, no.

694
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,070
Ning Zeyu.

695
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,440
Class is over.

696
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,880
It’s Wednesday again.
This week has passed very soon.

697
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,150
Zeyu, there will be a lecture these days.
Will you go with me?

698
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,480
I’ve already listened to it.

699
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,400
Zeyu is so cool.

700
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,670
He almost listened to all lectures.

701
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,760
We haven’t had a barbecue for long.

702
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,960
Let’s go have some
after the evening classes.

703
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,920
You may go without me.

704
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,110
You’ve been tired of it?

705
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,230
How about we change one restaurant?

706
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,360
Dessert? Hotpot?

707
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,840
How about singing?

708
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,360
I have to leave now. See you.

709
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,480
What’s wrong?

710
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,800
Maybe Yuan is tired for the test.

711
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,590
Give her some time for a break.

712
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,110
What does she mean?

713
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,110
It’s not your fault.

714
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,590
You will know.

715
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,550
Tell me the details.

716
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,880
Ning Zeyu, do you know anything?

717
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,700
I’ve been her classmate for three years.

718
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,150
Do you think if I know it or not?

719
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,760
It’s weird.

720
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,510
Mom, we are back.

721
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,150
Mom.

722
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,230
