17
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,280
Son, who sent you the QQ message?

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,230
You looked nervous.

19
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,400
Nervous?

20
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,350
Did I look nervous?

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,510
I wasn’t nervous.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,640
Ah, then why did you rush to your room
on receiving the message?

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh.

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,080
The monitor sent me
some important exam questions.

25
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,190
I was afraid I would’ve missed those.

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,470
Important exam questions?

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,310
My God!

28
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,750
Our son starts to tell lies now!

29
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,710
What?

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,800
Shouldn’t I be concerned with
the exam questions?

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,630
Though we picked you up
in a trash can,

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,520
we both know you a little bit.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,030
Yeah.

34
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,630
You’re not one of those kids

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,590
who would care about exam questions.

36
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,000
Trash can?

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Didn’t you say I was a giveaway
for adding minutes?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,710
What’s with the trash can?

39
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,520
You must have faith in yourself.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,240
Because you were

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,630
picked up in a recyclable trash can.

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,430
Am I right?

43
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,590
-Ah.
-It’s kind of useful.

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,870
Slow down.

45
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,960
Oh,

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,280
what’s wrong with you?

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,430
What’s wrong?

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,150
I’m going back to my room.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Hey.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,150
He’s upset.

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,190
His pride is hurt.

52
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,150
Hey, how could I

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,870
have such a silly son?

54
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,750
He hasn’t inherited
my youthful charm at all.

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,560
Had you got any charm in your youth?

56
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,000
How do you have the nerve
to compare yourself to our son?

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,870
Hey, Zeyu.

58
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,080
-Hey, Uncle.
-What’re you doing here?

59
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,560
I was taking out the garbage.

60
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,400
Hey.

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,630
You’ve become more handsome.

62
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,870
Thanks.

63
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,910
Where’re your dad and mom?

64
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,470
Well, they won’t come home today.

65
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,630
Oh, I think being a lawyer

66
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,280
is very hard, isn’t it?

67
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,910
Always work overtime.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,680
Yeah.

69
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,960
It’s hard.

70
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,750
Well, what about your supper?

71
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Have you had it?

72
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,310
I…

73
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,240
Not yet.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Just in time.
We’ve cooked braised ribs.

75
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,520
Eat with us. Wait for a second.

76
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,000
Don’t just stand there.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,470
Come on. Let’s have dinner.

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,080
Come on.

79
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,960
How tall are you?

80
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,190
-Zeyu. Come on in.
-180 centimeters in height.

81
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,720
Good evening, Auntie.

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,120
The kid is 180 centimeters in height.

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Wow!

84
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,750
Come on. Have a seat.

85
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,400
Fortunately,
I’ve cooked more rice today.

86
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,150
-You must be hungry, huh?
-Oh.

87
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,630
Well, don’t stand on ceremony.

88
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,310
Help yourself.

89
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:12,840
Yeah.

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,400
Here.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,240
-Why do you come again?
-Thanks. Uncle.

92
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,000
You’re welcome.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,870
You come every time
my dad cooks ribs.

94
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,720
Have you been monitoring us?

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,950
Don’t be rude to our guest.

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,630
The more the merrier.

97
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,560
Right, Zeyu?

98
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,560
Besides, your uncle has cooked
a little too much ribs.

99
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Zeyu comes to do us a favor
to finish the ribs, right?

100
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,510
Yeah.

101
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,870
Mum. I was kidding.

102
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,040
I surely hope he eats more.

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,480
Here, Zeyu,

104
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,680
have more vegetables.

105
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Increase nutrition.

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,430
Have some more.

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,560
You should eat more vegetables, too.

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,120
Red and green vegetables
are both good for your health.

109
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,270
As good friends,

110
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,630
you should help each other like this.

111
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,720
It’s very good.

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Don’t smirk.

113
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,390
As for study,

114
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,190
you should ask Zeyu
if you have any problems.

115
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,950
Mom and dad don’t

116
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,920
ask too much about your scores.

117
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,680
At least, you should pass, right?

118
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,680
No problem, Uncle.

119
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,310
He won’t have

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,480
any problems.

121
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,870
I have something to ask you.

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,680
Take a look.

123
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,070
What’s the kind of this book?

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,430
Can I find one in the bookstore
at the entrance of our school?

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,660
(Miraculous Chemical Elements)
Did you hear me?

126
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,120
If no, I’ll buy one online.

127
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,120
Did

128
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,270
the monitor sent you this?

129
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,360
Yeah.

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,680
I don’t know why she sent me

131
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,070
a chemistry book.

132
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,950
Maybe it’s for the open class.

133
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,270
Maybe.

134
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,680
Hey, don’t just talk.

135
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
Eat. You can talk after supper.

136
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,160
Have some ribs, OK?

137
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,870
Yeah.

138
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,310
It’s a little spicy.

139
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeah.

140
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,830
It’s very delicious, Dad.

141
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,390
-Really.
-Good.

142
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,360
You should have more.

143
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Yeah.

144
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
Yummy.

145
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,800
Uncle, Auntie, I’m full.

146
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
I’m going home to do my homework.

147
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,630
Well,

148
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,040
you haven’t eaten much.

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,360
You barely ate.

150
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
No. I’m full.

151
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,800
What about the book?

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,190
Well, don’t worry.
You can buy one anywhere.

153
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,240
It’s not rare.

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,160
Walk him out. Go.

155
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,240
-Don’t bother.
-Walk him out.

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,270
-Uncle, Auntie, bye.
-Bye.

157
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,750
It’s unnecessary.

158
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,480
Bye-bye.

159
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,120
Bye-bye.

160
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,190
I’m full.

161
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,830
Hey. Hey.

162
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,070
Is he all right?

163
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,160
Let him be.

164
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Kids like to

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,190
pretend to be adult.

166
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,560
Try to understand him.

167
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,530
(Ning Zeyu: The prop, “milk tea”,)

168
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,430
(Ning Zeyu: will lower the intelligence)

169
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,780
(Ning Zeyu: of your enemy.
Use it or not?)

170
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,820
(Yuan Caixi: Use it 10,086 times.)

171
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,980
(Ning Zeyu: Game over. You’ve accepted
your enemy’s help.)

172
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,260
(Yuan Caixi: Yeah. That’s the book.
Thanks for your recommendation.)

173
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,220
(Ning Zeyu:
Miraculous Chemical Elements)

174
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,140
(Ning Zeyu: Are you talking about
this one?)

175
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,700
(Yuan Caixi: Do you remember)

176
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,700
(Yuan Caixi: there’s a book
about chemical elements? What’s it?)

177
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,660
(Mr. Wang)

178
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,830
Hello, Mr. Wang.

179
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,510
Yeah.

180
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,800
Should I go now?

181
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,040
OK. OK. I know.

182
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,480
Yeah. See you soon.

183
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,510
Zeyu. I have some business.

184
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,600
I gotta go now.

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,240
I may be home later tonight.

186
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,510
Mom, why don’t you
finish the dinner first?

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,480
No. It’s urgent.

188
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,830
-Come back early.
-Yeah.

189
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,600
-Caixi.
-Auntie.

190
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, you finally come.

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
Have you come from
the continuation class?

192
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,430
Oh, I’m sorry. Today,

193
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,190
my continuation class overran.

194
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
There’s a traffic jam at this time.
So I’m late.

195
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,800
It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.
I know you study very hard.

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,600
The school you’re going to go to,
Sen Yong, is a key high school.

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,630
Working so hard only helps you
to get the second place.

198
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,950
Oh, your competition pressure
is very intense.

199
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,480
You’re not like Xiao’ai.

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,360
She is in a private school.

201
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,720
So, there’s much less competition.

202
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,440
Don’t just talk. Eat. Eat.

203
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,030
Come, Haoxi. Eat.

204
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Caixi, you’re so pretty.

205
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,670
Just like your mom when she was young.

206
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,630
Well. You don’t know. At that time,

207
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,790
your mom had many admirers.

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,870
Sis.

209
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh, she was so popular.

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,960
I just didn’t know what she had seen

211
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,320
in your short-lived dad.

212
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,720
Sis.

213
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,270
Don’t say that again.

214
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,030
Let the bygones be bygones.

215
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,200
Don’t mention it again.

216
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,720
Why shouldn’t I mention it?

217
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,200
What should I say?

218
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,440
Except for an old guitar,
Yuan Qiu had nothing at that time.

219
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,870
You were simply charmed
by his love songs.

220
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,270
He didn’t even have an apartment
when you married.

221
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,360
Fortunately, you can live
in mom’s apartment.

222
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,720
Otherwise,

223
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,080
you had to rent apartments and
lead a wandering life with the kids.

224
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,870
I think it’s fine
to live in a rented apartment.

225
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,240
Our family have been
living happily together.

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,600
That’s what we want.

227
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,550
The thing everyone pursues is different.

228
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,510
It’s better than living lonely
in a villa.

229
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,240
Caixi.

230
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,440
You’re too young. You don’t understand.

231
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,510
What I said is for your own good.

232
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,790
A man who is dependable

233
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,790
must have money.

234
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,550
When you’re at our age,

235
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,910
you can enjoy yourself.

236
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,080
You can eat whatever you want

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,150
and buy whatever you like.

238
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,440
Men’s so-called talents

239
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,480
and dreams

240
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,000
are not reliable at all.

241
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,440
Just like your dad.

242
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,270
Oh, what had he left behind
when he died

243
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,510
except for the worthless piano and
the old guitar?

244
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,360
Haoxi. Eat. Eat.

245
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,660
-Yeah.
-Have some more.

246
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,000
It’s my treat today.

247
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,440
-Auntie.
-We can order more.

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,870
I think what you’ve said is quite right.

249
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,320
Come on.

250
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
-Right? Come on.
-Let me drink a toast to you.

251
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,510
Thanks, Auntie.

252
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,360
You’re welcome.

253
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,720
Actually,

254
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,630
I usually ask my mom,

255
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,270
you work from dawn till dark,
but to what end?

256
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,080
That’s true.

257
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,120
Why don’t you find us a rich stepfather?

258
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,200
With houses and cars, it doesn’t matter
whether he comes home or not.

259
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,840
Don’t you see what a comfortable life
my auntie is living?

260
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,550
Let Yuan Haoxi and I experience the

261
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,550
comfortable life without
making an effort.

Caixi, how can you say that?

264
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Was I wrong, Yuan Haoxi?

265
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Right. Caixi. You were right.

266

Yanan,

268
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,200
I take the kids out to have a good meal
with good intentions

269
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,750
in order to celebrate Caixi’s entrance
to the key high school.

270
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,150
Well, how did you educate them?

271
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,550
How could she say that?

272
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,390
Don’t be upset, Sis.

273
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,630
Today, it’s

274
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,030
my treat.

275
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,870
Oh, you must have some more, Auntie.

277
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,400
Yeah.

Oh, they’ve changed a lot.

367
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,030
Oh, really?

368
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,960
-Monitor.
-Yeah.

369
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,240
(Miraculous Chemical Elements)
The chemistry book you’ve recommended

370
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,510
is so interesting.

371
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,840
It’s like reading a novel.

372
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,360
It’s not bad, huh?

373
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,910
Actually, it goes from the easy
to the difficult.

374
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,600
It’s very helpful for chemistry class.

375
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,750
Had I known the chemistry class
was so interesting,

376
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,840
I wouldn’t get 30 marks every time.

377
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,630
You’d better thank Zeyu.

378
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,120
He told me the name

379
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
of the book last night.

380
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,000
Otherwise I would forget.

381
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,200
I’m glad it helps.

382
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,480
Wish you get 31 marks next time.

383
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,510
Thanks.

384
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,060
Don’t mention it.

385
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,080
Get ready. We’ll start soon.
Put it away.

386
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,720
Watch your step. Watch your step.

387
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,390
PE students and the academic students

388
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,200
studying in mixed classes is
the most important thing in our bureau.

389
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
So we’re worried about the issue.

390
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,910
-Really?
-Yeah.

391
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,440
They’re coming. They’re coming.

392
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,080
Class.

393
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,200
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

394
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,480
Let’s buck up.

395
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,200
Follow the operation procedure
on your textbook.

396
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,270
Start the experiments.

397
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:40,840
All right?

398
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,910
Put away your books.

399
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,510
Let’s begin.

400
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,560
-Hey, be careful when you light the fire.
-Are you ready?

401
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,670
-Yeah.
-Let’s begin.

402
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,240
Right. Right.

403
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,000
-Follow the procedure step by step.
-You start first.

404
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,060
-Let me handle this.
-Keep it steady.

405
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,480
Which is distilled water?

406
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,390
We don’t need distilled water.

407
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,360
We need anhydrous ethanol.

408
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,640
First, you should follow…

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,790
Hey, hold on!

410
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,110
Fire. Fire.

411
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,510
Yuan Caixi.

412
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,160
Get out of here.

413
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,960
Hey, everyone.

414
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,270
Calm down.

415
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,000
Don’t worry.

416
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,590
Put out the alcohol lamp
on your desks first.

417
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,110
Let’s line up

418
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:41,640
and get out of the lab one by one.

419
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,240
Come. Don’t worry.

420
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,070
Bend.

421
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,310
Cover your mouth and nose.

422
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,240
Yeah. Go through the door.

423
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,480
Slow down.

424
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,110
Take care. Take care.

425
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,070
Go out in order.

426
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,400
The girl over there, are you OK?

427
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,110
Hey, Ning Zeyu,

428
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
give her a hand.

429
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,440
Here. This way please.

430
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,640
Oh, why is there smoke?

431
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,310
Oh.

432
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,550
Look.

433
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,110
Everyone, catch up. Catch up.

434
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,200
Oh, no hurry. No hurry.

435
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,270
Catch up. Slow down.

436
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,400
Slow down.

437
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,830
Carry her on your back.

438
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,590
Carry her. Carry her.

439
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,590
Hurry.

440
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,070
Be careful.

441
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,140
Hurry.

442
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,550
Everyone, catch up.

443
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,510
Slow down.

444
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,110
Yuan Caixi.

445
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,270
Monitor.

446
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,070
Yuan Caixi.

447
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,750
Yuan Caixi.

448
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,720
Monitor. What’s the matter?

449
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,880
Yuan Caixi.

450
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,680
Go.

451
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,030
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

452
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,750
Stay safe.

453
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,510
Take care.

454
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,200
Are you OK?

455
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,820
-I’m fine.
-Are you all right?

456
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,590
I’m going back to help the others.

457
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,720
-Can you hang in there?
-Don’t mind me.

458
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,240
Huang Yuan, are you OK?

459
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,820
Go.

460
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,640
Go.

461
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,880
Yuan Caixi.

462
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,480
Yuan Caixi.

463
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,310
Is there anyone left?

464
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,590
Oh, how are you?

465
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
Yuan. Yuan.

466
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,790
Chief.

467
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,750
Yuan, are you all right?

468
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,920
Chief. Are you OK?

469
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,350
I’m fine. What about you?

470
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,830
You got injured.

471
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh.

472
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:27,720
Go.

473
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,680
Let me take you to the clinic.

474
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,400
Monitor, are you OK?

475
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,110
I’m OK.

476
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,680
Let me take you to
dress the wound first.

477
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,400
What’s wrong?

478
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
-What’s going on?
-Are you OK?

479
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Did you get injured?

480
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,000
-Mr. Ma. It doesn’t matter.
-Are you injured?

481
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,590
You’re not hurt, are you?

482
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,000
Is anyone hurt?

483
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,440
Are you hurt?

484
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,830
Oh, everyone, are you all right?

485
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,880
It’s OK.

486
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
Thanks.

487
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,940
Let me see.

488
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,440
Let me sterilize your wound first.

489
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,880
It’s OK. Monitor.

490
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
It’s just a minor injury.

491
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,110
No.

492
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,640
Minor injury must be processed, too.

493
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,880
It will be troublesome
if the wound is infected.

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,720
Sorry.

495
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,550
I failed to keep my word today.

496
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,200
I said I would behave.

497
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,270
I won’t be a millimeter
less than perfect.

498
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
But now…

499
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,440
Yeah.

500
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,880
You didn’t keep your word.

501
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,480
You’re not a millimeter

502
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,880
less than perfect.

503
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,400
You’re several centimeters less.

504
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,720
But your efforts

505
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,750
of helping our classmates today

506
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,310
make you several meters
more than perfect.

507
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,680
So, all in all,

508
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,400
you’re better than perfect.

509
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,110
Thanks, Monitor.

510
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,520
OK.

511
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,830
Keep your wound away from water.

512
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,680
I gotta go.

513
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,270
Hey.

514
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,070
Are you afraid of fire?

515
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,640
When there’s a fire,
people’s first reaction

516
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,350
is running away.

517
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,640
But instead of running,
you stood still.

518
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,550
Why?

519
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,440
It’s fine.
You don’t have to answer me.

520
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,680
I’m just curious.

521
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,400
Actually, I have nothing to hide.

522
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,350
I’d been through a fire
when I was a child.

523
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,880
It was a friend who saved me.

524
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,400
But today,

525
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,160
you’re the one who saved me.

526
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,920
Frankly speaking,

527
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
I had a bias against you before.

528
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,070
But I hope from today,

529
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,830
we can take a new acquaintance
of each other.

530
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,920
To tell the truth, I thought

531
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,720
you were a nerd before.

532
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,590
Now I think you…

533
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,350
-Oh.
-What did you think I was?

534
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,070
You, I think you’re nice.

535
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,960
Who was the one that saved you?

536
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,960
Do I know the person?

537
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,720
Boy or girl?
Is he or she as handsome as I am?

538
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
Aren’t we good friends? Tell me.

539
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
Oh. Zeyu.

540
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
How are you? Are you OK?

541
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,270
I’m fine.

542
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,030
-I come to get some Band-Aids.
-OK.

543
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,070
What about you?

544
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,830
What about your feet?

545
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,680
I’m OK. I’m going back now.

546
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
-Oh. OK.
-Yeah.

547
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,110
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

548
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,720
Hello. Are you injured?

549
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,720
Come.

550
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,070
-Oh.
-Let me see.

551
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,880
It doesn’t matter.
I just need a Band-Aid.

552
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,920
Are you OK?

553
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,790
I’m fine.

554
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
You’ve got it processed.

555
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,240
Oh, yeah.

556
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,160
-You can go back now.
-Thank you, Doctor.

557
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,920
Ms. Zhang.

558
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,240
I know what you want to say.

559
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,960
There will be a working group

560
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,310
to investigate the fire.

561
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,240
About the general situation,

562
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,350
the teacher has made it clear to me.

563
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,160
It was an accident caused by
a student’s improper operation.

564
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,110
Fortunately, it wasn’t
a serious accident.

565
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,880
From now on, you must
pay attention to safety inspection

566
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,070
and prevent such accidents
from happening again.

567
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,400
Though it was an accident,

568
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,070
the school must take its responsibility.

569
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,750
The students’ safety
is our top priority.

570
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,310
Since the PE class
and the academic class mixed,

571
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,200
we haven’t done our work well enough.

572
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,510
We’re sloppy.

573
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,720
I must be responsible.

574
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,590
You surely didn’t
do your work well enough.

575
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,880
This morning, at the square,

576
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,640
was there a conflict between
two groups of students?

577
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,640
Survey. Survey.

578
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,070
It doesn’t mean to
listen to whatever you say.

579
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,030
It means to see with my eyes.

580
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,440
I’ve seen the real case

581
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,510
of mixed classes.

582
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,720
I’ve also seen a group of students

583
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,880
who helped each other

584
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,960
instead of running out

585
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,750
on each other in the face of danger.

586
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,920
To be honest,

587
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,270
about the decision of mixing classes,

588
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,400
I’ve been worried all the time.

589
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,680
I was afraid the students

590
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
wouldn’t get along.

591
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,550
I didn’t expect they would help

592
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,510
and support each other.
I’m deeply moved.

593
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,830
The children have a mind as broad as
the ocean that accommodates all rivers.

594
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,070
They have a character of kindness
and being helpful.

595
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
Isn’t that our educational philosophy?

596
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,160
Sure. Sure.

597
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,440
So, from this view,

598
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,270
you’ve done

599
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,310
a good job.

600
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,510
-Carry on.
-Yeah.

601
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,400
It takes a hundred years
to educate the people.

602
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,790
-Miss Luo. I’m fine.
-Are you all right?

603
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,030
Are you hurt?

604
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,040
-Are you OK?
-I’m fine.

605
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,120
Are you OK?

606
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,720
Mr. Ma.

607
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,790
Mr. Ma.

608
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,960
About the accident
at the chemistry lab,

609
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,680
I have something to say.

610
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,550
Yuan Caixi.

611
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,830
I must apologize.

612
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,270
I think the accident

613
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,880
was caused by my improper operation.

614
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,510
So I want to say

615
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,400
I’m sorry.

616
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,720
Excuse me.

617
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,440
I’m the safety inspector of
the chemical experiment class.

618
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,550
I should make sure

619
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,160
if the chemicals are correctly placed.

620
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,000
If the school needs someone to

621
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,750
take responsibility,

622
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,550
it should be me.

623
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,200
Excuse me, Mr. Ma.

624
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,270
I spilled hydrogen peroxide.

625
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,270
I caused the accident.

626
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,880
It had nothing to do with them.

627
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,160
I’m the one to be punished.

628
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,160
I’m the safety inspector
who didn’t do his job.

629
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
It’s none of your business.

630
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
It’s none of your business.

631
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
I caused the accident. It was my fault.

632
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,680
Ignorance can be forgiven.

633
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,310
I don’t need you
to acknowledge my fault.

634
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:37,820
Enough.

635
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,750
All of you, sit down.

636
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,110
Sit down.

637
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Let me speak.

638
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,440
Through this accident,
I found two problems.

639
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,550
PE students

640
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,720
are lack of the basic knowledge
of experimental operation.

641
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,110
Academic students

642
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,200
are easily panic in case of trouble.

643
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,350
Your self-saving abilities and
physical capabilities are worrying.

644
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,200
These are the two problems
you need to improve.

645
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,270
You didn’t agree to mix classes before.

646
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,310
How about now?

647
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:17,920
Huh?

648
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
Tell me. How about now?

649
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,440
-Mr. Ma.
-Ah.

650
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,270
Mr. Ma.

651
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,830
After such a serious accident...

652
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,560
-Mr. Ma.
-Huh?

653
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,140
Tell me…

654
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,030
It was an accident.

655
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,400
The kids didn’t do it on purpose.

656
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,790
Can you let me finish?

657
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,070
While I’m looking at you,

658
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,160
how can’t I feel sorry?
How can’t I be worried?

659
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,680
How can’t I be angry?

660
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,200
However,

661
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,480
when I saw you

662
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,310
helped each other in trouble,

663
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,920
it made me relieved and gratified.

664
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,350
The principal asked the canteen
to serve you extra meals.

665
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,400
No matter what happened,

666
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,000
let’s talk after a good meal.

667
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,440
Thanks, Mr. Ma.

668
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,070
Be careful. Be careful.

669
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,590
Let me hold you.

670
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,270
Let’s sit over there.

671
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:40,880
Here we go.

672
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,240
Sit down. I’ll pick up your food.

673
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,780
Yeah.

674
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,110
-Waif for a minute.
-OK.

675
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,070
Went to the clinic twice in a week.

676
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,110
Don’t you think it’s a little too often?

677
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,000
Zeyu.

678
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,880
Where is the bruise?

679
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,310
-Let me see.
-What are you doing?

680
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,510
Let me see if it’s serious.

681
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,480
Does it hurt?

682
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,270
Don’t walk too much,

683
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,750
or the bruise will be more serious.

684
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,000
What did the school doctor say?

685
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,720
She told me to apply some medicine
after I get home in the evening.

686
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,640
Oh, why don’t you tell me
what to do

687
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,350
and I’ll do it myself.

688
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,240
Then don’t move.

689
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,680
Men and women should have boundaries.

690
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,400
It’s troublesome if you keep moving.

691
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,980
Yeah?

692
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,110
I can’t.

693
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,160
I can’t walk any more.

694
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,680
-Let’s wait here.
-Where is Yuan Haoxi?

695
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,640
He is unreliable.

696
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,240
Who knows where he’ll show up?

697
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
What takes you so long?

698
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,000
It’s you.

699
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,310
Remember to put some ice
on your ankle tonight.

700
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:06,070
Here’re some medicines used for
removing blood stasis.

701
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,960
Apply the medicine, have a good meal
and go to bed early tonight.

702
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,920
So,

703
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,400
good, good night.

704
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,400
Stay safe.

705
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,240
Caixi.

706
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Caixi.

707
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,790
Sorry to be late. Sorry to be late.

708
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,240
Yuan Haoxi.

709
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,160
What takes you so long?

710
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,310
Don’t you know I was hurt?

711
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,510
Hey.

712
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,480
Didn’t I visit you after class?

713
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,310
You seemed fine then.
Now why are you so hot tempered?

714
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,110
It got swollen at night.

715
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,350
Is it swollen,

716
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,160
or

717
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,480
something happened to Li He?

718
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,400
Yuan Haoxi.

719
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:36,940
Bye-bye.

720
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,960
Oh. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

721
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,830
I’m warning you.

722
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,030
Don’t tell mom about my ankle.
Do you hear me?

723
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
It’s OK if you don’t want me to tell.

724
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,110
But you must pay me for it.

725
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,240
Are you shameless?

726
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,920
How can you ask me to pay you?

727
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,480
Don’t you know I’m always shameless?

728
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,480
Mom.

729
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
Stop yelling.

730
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,750
Mom.

731
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,720
My sister…

732
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,790
Stop yelling.

733
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,070
What’s wrong? Why are you yelling?

734
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,830
Oh.

735
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,110
What’s wrong?

736
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,800
It’s nothing.

737
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,720
Nothing. Nothing.

738
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,750
What happened to your feet?

739
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,110
I just sprained my ankle.

740
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,790
Oh, really! Tell me about it.

741
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,160
Alas, I don’t know if you went to school

742
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,720
or went to practice martial arts.

743
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,400
Wait. I’ll get the medicine.

744
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,590
Mom. I saw the school doctor
this afternoon.

745
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,270
Caixi.

746
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,070
What’s this?

747
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,030
What goes on in Li He’s big head?

748
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
What does this mean?

749
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,310
Laugh at you

750
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,590
for being a single flower?

751
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:34,510
-Stop laughing.
-Caixi.

752
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,400
Give it to me.

753
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,640
Tablet for promoting blood circulation.

754
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,160
Wow, isn’t he sweet?

755
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,480
Caixi.

756
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,880
What’s this?

757
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,830
Sisyphe

00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,920
VVVIP Discount Card.

759
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,070
Really?

760
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,820
(Sisyphe VVVIP Discount Card)

761
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,100
(Sisyphe)

762
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,070
Sir. I come again.

763
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:27,880
Sir.

764
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,440
I’ll take all these books.

765
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,710
All these books?

766
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,400
You must have good grades.

767
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,320
Just so so.

768
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,030
It’s 168 yuan altogether.

769
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,840
So expensive?

770
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,190
Can you give me a little deal?

771
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,150
Sorry, I really can’t.

772
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,590
How about you

773
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,440
spend 200 yuan and it’ll automatically
qualify you for membership?

774
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,230
You’ll get a 5% off discount.

775
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,760
Do you have any

776
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,630
VVVIP Card?

777
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,400
Selling books makes a little money.

778
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,670
VVV

779
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,360
VIP Card only makes me lose money.

780
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,630
All right.

781
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,760
Hey.

782
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,660
Ah?

783
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,840
Why don’t you write one for me?

784
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,510
You write VVVVIP Card.

785
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,670
All books are 10% off.

786
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,710
The most important thing
is your signature.

787
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,480
It will be the only one in the world.

788
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,550
Ah?

789
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,510
Ah.

790
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,700
(Sisyphe VVVIP Discount Card)

791
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,000
Thanks, sir.

792
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,110
I’ll come back next time.

793
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
Don’t come back again.

794
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,580
(Sisyphe VVVIP Discount Card)

795
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,190
Caixi.

796
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,710
Though the skirt

797
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,360
is kind of horrible,

798
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,800
the card

799
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,150
is quite sweet.

800
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,440
I didn’t expect

801
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,030
Li He would have the brain.

802
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,110
Yeah.

803
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,710
Though

804
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,150
he looks like he has no brain,

805
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,110
he is actually reliable.

806
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,440
Today during the fire,

807
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,190
I stood there and wasn’t able to move.

808
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,550
I remembered what happened
in my childhood.

809
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,590
When he saw I sprained my ankle,

810
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,710
he rushed to help me.

811
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,000
He carried me out of the lab.

812
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,320
Oh, Caixi.

813
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,190
It’s a life-saving grace.

814
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,760
You must pay the debt of gratitude.

815
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,440
In my opinion,

816
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,710
you should at least

817
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,880
pledge to marry him.

818
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,590
Why don’t you pledge to marry him?

819
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,670
How can I do that?

820
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,670
How can I do that?

821
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,880
Frankly,

822
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,590
I had bias against them before

823
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,590
because I didn’t know

824
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,320
them well.

825
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,280
After I’ve got acquainted with them,
I find PE students

826
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,960
actually have many advantages.

827
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,480
Well, do they or does Li He
have many advantages?

828
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Move. Move.

829
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,840
Put it away.

830
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,150
Well, Mom.

831
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,280
Come.

832
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,800
-Let me see.
-Yeah.

833
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
Does it hurt?

834
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,480
No, it doesn’t.

835
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,840
Does it hurt?

836
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,110
A little.

837
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,510
Yuan, does your flesh taste good?

838
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,360
Cannibalism is against the law.

839
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,710
Yuan,

840
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,150
why do you come shopping for no reason?

841
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,710
Do you have anything to buy?

842
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:08,920
Hey.

843
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
Do you like this?

844
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,110
Don’t you think the color is tawdry?

845
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,880
You don’t have an eye for beauty.

846
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,070
Yuan.

847
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,400
Do you have any secrets recently?

848
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,670
Yeah?

849
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:30,710
Yuan.

850
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:32,480
Have you noticed that

851
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,190
you would laugh for no reason
these days?

852
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,590
Yeah?

853
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,190
Why, didn’t I laugh before?

854
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Of course not.

855
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,630
I just think you’ve changed recently.

856
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,280
You become

857
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,070
warmer.

858
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,840
Sisyphe

859
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,190
VVVIP Card.

860
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,280
Was the storekeeper stung by
conscience and gave you the card?

861
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,590
He didn’t give me the card.

862
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,070
Then, somebody else must do.

863
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,440
Is it…

864
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,880
15 yuan altogether.

865
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,440
OK.

866
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,920
Thanks for coming.

867
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,260
-Sorry, I don’t want this.
-How rare! Monitor, you come to

868
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,340
the accessory shop, too?

869
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,030
Is this a discount card?

870
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,030
Nothing. See you.

871
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,960
She’s stingy.

872
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,510
Take care. Take care.

873
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,550
Take care, kids.

874
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,280
Yeah.

875
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,480
Keep full of youthful spirit.

876
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,030
-Chuan.
-Yeah.

877
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,880
How should I write this Error Analysis?

878
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,480
Where?

879
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,190
Here.

880
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,670
I don’t know about that, either.

881
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,320
The data from your previous experiments
is too messy.

882
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,400
I’ll think about it.

883
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
It’s too difficult.

884
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,110
Have you finished the lab report?

885
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,360
No. Stop nagging me.

886
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,230
I’m working on that.

887
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,070
What are these?

888
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,480
I don’t understand at all.

889
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,880
You can ask me
if you have any questions.

890
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,190
I’ll just write something.
No need to ask you.

891
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,360
Monitor!

892
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,800
I do have questions.

893
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,920
I have many questions.

894
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,070
I’m the biggest question myself.

895
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,590
Help me to do the report, please.

896
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,480
Oh.

897
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,710
OK.

898
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,320
The format is wrong.

899
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,190
Look at mine.

900
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,150
This is to make organic matter decompose

901
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,320
into carbon dioxide and water

902
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,030
and leave inorganic salts.

903
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,400
According to the experimental steps,

904
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,440
we add hydrogen peroxide as oxidant,

905
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,710
which converts iodine ion into iodine.

906
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,960
The chemical equation is

907
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,630
two moles of iodine plus
two moles of hydrogen

908
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,800
plus hydrogen peroxide produce iodine.
