00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,400
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

18
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,200
Hello.

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
They...

20
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,400
Eat it before it gets cold.

21
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,870
Okay.

22
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,250
I don’t know either.

23
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
Chief.

24
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,800
Chief. There you are.

25
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,800
Chief.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,630
You bought breakfast?

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,360
You can all have one.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Ah. Okay.

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,470
It’s red bean paste flavor?

30
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,590
Throw it away if you don’t like it.

31
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,520
Do you want red bean paste flavor?

32
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,560
Do you?

33
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,870
Chief.

34
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,000
The bun is for monitor, right?

35
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,430
No.

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
You can fool the others.
But you can’t fool me.

37
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
No, I’m not fooling you.

38
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,680
You know that
we don’t eat red bean paste.

39
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,960
What are you trying to say?

40
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,080
Last night, you told me that

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,840
you’d trust monitor.

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,360
I still do.

43
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,310
I think

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,800
if you’ve decided to trust monitor,
you should really do then.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,430
If you really can’t trust her,
you can ask her about everything.

46
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,400
We all know monitor’s character.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,240
Why do you leave
this misunderstanding to each other?

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,600
Yuan Caixi.

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,430
Come with me.

50
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,680
Can you wait for a second?
I’m...

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,950
Now.

52
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,480
What are you looking at, Zeyu?

53
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,000
Monitor has something to say to Chief.

54
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,270
I might be overthinking.

55
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,430
But I think monitor and Zeyu
are really close recently.

56
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Chief isn’t too happy.

57
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,560
You’re not overthinking.
I feel the same.

58
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
They walked in the classroom
together this morning.

59
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,330
But I walked in the classroom

60
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,920
together with Huang Yuan this morning.

61
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,750
That doesn’t count.

62
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,850
I mean,

63
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,680
I met her by the door this morning.

64
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,720
I happened to meet her by the door.

65
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,510
So I walked in with her.

66
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,830
Why do you want me?

67
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
I went to pick you up at
your house this morning.

68
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,720
I... I came here with Zeyu.

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,000
I left early this morning.

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,190
I met him, so

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,720
I came to school with him.

72
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
And?

73
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,720
And,

74
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,750
he bought the breakfast.

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,310
Why did you leave early?

76
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,680
Haven’t we made the deal that
I’d come and pick you up?

77
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,830
Li He.

78
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,360
I don’t want to lie to you.

79
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,680
There’s a reason
why I didn’t wait for you.

80
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,310
Does Ning Zeyu know it?

81
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,480
He...

82
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,950
Fine.

83
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,310
It’s another thing that
he can know but I can’t.

84
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,120
Li He.

85
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,950
Do you remember what you told me?

86
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,630
You asked me to trust you.

87
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,800
Can you trust me

88
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,560
this time?

89
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,070
I trust you.

90
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
I’ll also work hard to
become a better person

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,270
who’s worthy of your trust.

92
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,720
What are you looking at?

93
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,360
I know I’m handsome.

94
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,000
Go. Go back to the classroom.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,680
Okay.

96
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,830
After you, monitor.

97
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,940
(Sent to Yuan Caixi)

98
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,860
(You have a new message)

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,160
(Han Yayi)
Yuan, what did Li He tell you?

100
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,830
Why are you blushing?

101
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,040
(Yuan Caixi)
Am I? Are you colorblind?

102
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:38,270
Is it about the fact that you and Zeyu
came to school together this morning?

103
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,120
You know that too.

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,870
Come on, I’m just colorblind.

105
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,960
I’m not totally blind.

106
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,240
Is Li He mad?

107
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,600
No.

108
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,850
He’s so forgiving?

109
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,240
That’s surprising.

110
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,550
Stand up.

111
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,200
Good morning, teacher.

112
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,750
The last paragraph, paragraph three

113
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,720
is the summary.
Festivals are important part of society

114
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,550
and festivals are becoming
more and more commercial.

115
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,480
Go home and review these.

116
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,630
These are important points.

117
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,320
In the next class, I’ll have a pop test.

118
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,360
Class dismissed.

119
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,720
Ah. Chief.

120
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,220
Yes.

121
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,390
Can you lead the workout later?

122
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,150
No, I can’t.
I need to do training with Bai.

123
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,720
Chuan, you can lead it.

124
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,150
-Let’s go.
-Fine.

125
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,390
Yuan.

126
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,000
What’s going on?

127
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,390
I’m having my period.

128
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,750
I’m feeling a bit unwell.

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,480
Let me stay in the classroom with you.

130
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,960
No. No.

131
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,550
Ask Mr. Bai for a leave.

132
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,320
Tell him I’m feeling unwell.

133
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
Okay. It’s on me.

134
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,790
Ask Mr. Bai for a sick leave.

135
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,870
I’m feeling a bit unwell.

136
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,550
Ah. Zeyu, are you feeling unwell?

137
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,790
Where?

138
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,910
Your stomach?
You ate something bad this morning?

139
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,790
No.

140
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,960
Ah! I think you might be too stressed.

141
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,440
I have this. It’s very good.

142
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,600
It’s particularly useful at
wakening you up and keeping you sober.

143
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,630
No need.

144
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,030
Just ask for a leave for me.

145
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,510
Thanks.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,510
Actually, you don’t have
to stay here for me.

147
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,510
I’m here not to accompany you.

148
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,510
I’m here because
I have something important to tell you.

149
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,440
Something important?

150
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,480
Yes.

151
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,720
Yuan Caixi.

152
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
I think

153
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,030
I might be sick.

154
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,630
I might

155
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,750
have acute leukemia

156
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,000
just like my dad did.

157
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,550
What are you doing?

158
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,910
Look. It’s just as simple as this.

159
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,240
It’s not so hard once you say it out.

160
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,000
You can just walk to Aunt

161
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,870
and tell her frankly.

162
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,080
Besides,
that’s just suspected right now.

163
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,150
It’s not confirmed.

164
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
If only it could really be that simple.

165
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,270
Monitor.

166
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,440
Yuan Caixi, head up.

167
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,200
Wait.

168
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,750
What are you doing? Cosplay?

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,750
I’m helping you practice.

170
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,910
Do you understand me?

171
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,390
I don’t need practice.

172
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,270
I can’t.

173
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,390
You’ll have to face it one day.

174
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,440
Rather than keeping it a secret,

175
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,510
you’d better just tell it.

176
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,030
Besides,

177
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,670
you don’t want to make Li He unhappy,
do you?

178
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,080
Right.

179
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,840
I have to face it sooner or later.

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,670
How about this?

181
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,720
Close your eyes.

182
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,750
Take a deep breath.

183
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,750
Imagine.

184
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,630
Aunt is sitting right before you.

185
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,080
Just tell her all your worries,

186
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,840
concerns, and unhappiness.

187
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,150
This is your mother.

She hasn’t come yet?

239
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,830
No.

240
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,070
Did you see her?

Monitor is resting in the classroom
because she feels unwell.

243
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,310
Zeyu is also taking a rest
in the classroom.

244
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,830
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

245
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,770
Straight-A students
are indeed different.

246
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,880

for study.

00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,070
Study? Are you stupid?

248
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,480
They came to school together and
asked for a leave together.

249
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,160
It can’t be a coincidence.

250
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,310
What are you doing?

251
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,240
Stretch carefully.

252
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,680
Chuan,

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,510
what do you think Zeyu and monitor

254
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,880
are doing in the classroom?

255
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,350
What does it have to do with you?

256
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,110
It’s none of your business.

257
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,750
I don’t care.

258
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,830
It is my business.

259
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,160

260
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:01,920

261

What should we do now?

262
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,590
What else can we do?
Catch up with them.

263
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,640
Considering his personality,
they’ll just argue nonstop.

264
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,880
-Lead the workout.
-Okay.

265
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,160
It’s fine.

266
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,030
You’ll be fine when you cry it out.

267
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Sort out your emotions.
Then you can tell Aunt.

268
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,070
Zeyu.

269
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,270
Thank you.

270
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,000
I’ve known you for a long time.

271
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,160
This is the first time I see you cry.

272
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,030
What are you doing?

273
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,680
Monitor,

274
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,400
why are you crying?

275
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,310
And you.

276
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,110
Were you just wiping monitor’s tear?

277
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,880
Chuan. Chuan. Chuan. Look!
I told you so.

278
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,480
There’s something going on between them.

279
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,790
Jiang Yuan, it’s not what you think.

280
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,750
Really? I’m not blind.

281
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,030
Ah! It might be just a misunderstanding.

282
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,720
Maybe it’s so windy that sand got into

283
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
monitor’s eyes.

284
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,830
Monitor.

285
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,880
There’s nothing to explain.

286
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,790
Monitor had a mental breakdown
because of excessive stress.

287
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,830
I was comforting her.

288
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,960
Does Chief know this?

289
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,350
What does this have to do with Li He?

290
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,510
Am I talking to you?

291
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,160
Does Chief know this?

292
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,200
I just have too much stress
because of College Entrance Exam.

293
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
I haven’t told him.

294
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Yuan Caixi.

295
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,880
Chief tells you everything.

296
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,400
Don’t you feel guilty for this?

297
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,350
I did nothing wrong.

298
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,790
Why should I be guilty?

299
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,970
You know in your heart

300
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,960
whether you did anything wrong or not.

301
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,830
Yuan.

302
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What’s wrong?

303
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,590
Why are your eyes so red?

304
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,400
I’m fine.

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,100
When I just came back,

306
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,070
Monitor was crying so sadly.

307
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,410
I have no idea

308
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,070
who was comforting her.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,210
We’re all classmates.

310
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,510
Why can’t Zeyu care for her?

311
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,790
Yuan, are you all right?

312
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,750
I’m fine.

313
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,240
Maybe it’s because of
the upcoming College Entrance Exam,

314
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
I have too much stress.

315
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,350
-Go.
-Okay.

316
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
Why were you so harsh on Yuan Caixi?

317
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,400
Chief, we did it for you.

318
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Ning Zeyu comforted monitor
when she was crying.

319
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,310
And he wiped her tears.

320
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,240
Right, Yun Xiang?

321
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,310
So what?

322
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,880
Yuan Caixi was crying.

323
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:56,750
Chief.

324
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,920
Ning Zeyu should just ignore that
and not comfort her?

325
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,510
Chief.

326
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,070
You really don’t have feeling for this?

327
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,680
I know you choose to trust monitor.

328
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,440
But there must be a reason

329
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,070
why she’s suddenly so close to Zeyu.

330
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,110
Aren’t you curious?

331
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,960
Besides,

332
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,880
you’ve been through a lot together.

333
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,240
Why can’t you just talk it out?

334
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,590
Right. Chief.

335
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,400
Monitor must be hiding something
from you.

336
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,310
I have no other intentions.

337
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,590
I just wish to figure it out.

338
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,200
You’ll just keep pretending
that you don’t care?

339
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,400
I asked her.

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,070
Ah!

341
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,160
What did she say?

342
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,510
She said she couldn’t tell me
for certain reasons.

343
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,200
She asked me to trust her.

344
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,790
I trust her.

345
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,920
I’m a man of my word.

346
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:19,920
Mom.

347
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
Ah, you’re back.

348
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,350
We’ll have dinner soon. Wash your hands.

349
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,550
Wait for a while.

350
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,590
I have something I’d like to tell you.

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,920
What is it?

352
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,200
Come and sit down.

353
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,400
Sit.

354
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,000
Yuan Haoxi, come here too.

355
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Caixi, I’m occupied.

356
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,190
Come here.

357
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,350
Your sister has something to say.

358
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,510
Caixi, what is it?

359
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
Mom.

360
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,750
Haoxi.

361
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,640
I have an important thing

362
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,790
to tell you.

363
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,790
So...

364
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,310
I might have the same illness
as my dad did.

365
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,880
But don’t worry.

366
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,960
I’ve made a reservation to do a check-up
at the doctor’s.

367
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,550
Let’s wait for

368
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,000
the check-up result.

369
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,480
I’ve been holding it back for so long.
I finally said it.

370
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,070
It feels great.

371
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,590
Caixi.

372
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,270
Is it serious?

373
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,640
I’ll know when the result comes out.

374
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Caixi.

375
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,920
You’ll be fine, right?

376
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,070
Show me.

377
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,290
Where are the bruises?

378
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,720
Show me now.

379
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,720
Two on my arms.

380
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,440
And one is on my ankle.

381
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,830
Which hospital and
which doctor will you visit?

382
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,880
Dr. Tong, from Hematology Department,
at the municipal hospital.

383
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,310
Cancel the reservation.

384
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,680
I’ll take you to a doctor I know.

385
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,030
Ah! Mom.

386
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Are you all right?

387
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,480
I’m suddenly a bit tired.

388
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,510
I’ll go take some rest upstairs.

389
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
Caixi.

390
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,920
Caixi.

391
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,400
I’ll never make you angry again.

392
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,110
I’ll never mess with your alarms.

393
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,440
I’ll throw trash and
do the dishes for you.

394
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,000
I’ll give you whatever you want to eat.

395
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,680
I’m really grateful I can

396
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,640
be your brother.

397
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,030
Hey, I’m not dead yet.

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,510
I’m a bit worried about mom.

399
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,000
You saw the way she was.

400
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,510
I think she was being too calm.

401
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,830
Caixi.

402
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:49,550
Yes?

403
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,000
I see.

404
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
What?

405
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,920
You’re not mom’s birth child.

406
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,790
It’s just like the novels.

407
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,750
The heroine had leukemia.
To do treatments,

408
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,210
she found that her birth mother
wasn’t really her mother.

409
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,240
Mr. Wang who lived next door
turned out to be her real dad.

410
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,350
Or her longtime boyfriend

411
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,590
turned out to be her brother.

412
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
Caixi, you’re so tragic.

413
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,440
Yuan Haoxi, you’d better
drop out of school

414
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,750
and become a playwright,
Playwright Yuan.

415
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,440
What did I do?

416
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,590
Why was she so mean?

417
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,640
What? You’re waiting for me?

418
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I have something to talk to you.

419
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,160
Say it.

420
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,350
Didn’t you promise to wish me good luck?

421
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,110
If I’m not mistaken,

422
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,590
on birthday,
you said you’d wish me luck.

423
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,270
And you’d put your mind on
College Entrance Exam.

424
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,830
This is the way you wish me good luck?

425
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,680
Or do I remember it wrong?

426
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,110
Your memory and understanding is right.

427
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,750
Then why do you pick up
Yuan Caixi every day?

428
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,160
I can’t do anything if monitor
doesn’t talk about this herself.

429
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,680
Again?

430
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,480
Don’t you find it annoying
for saying this?

431
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,720
But that’s the fact.

432
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,790
How can there be so many secrets?

433
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,350
You should ask monitor herself.

434
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,030
I have no say in this.

435
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,480
I can only talk about this
when monitor does.

436
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,000
Otherwise, I can’t do anything.

437
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,920
Oh, right.

438
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
I suggest you act like
a grownup man recently.

439
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,270
Don’t look for trouble.

440
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,960
Dad.

441
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,160
Let’s fight.

442
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,070
Are you out of your mind?

443
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,960
Let’s fight. I mean it. Teach me.

444
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,270
Stay away.

445
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
Don’t think I dare not punch you.

446
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,270
Come on. Hit me.

447
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,160
Show me what you’ve got.

448
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,550
I think you’re too old.

449
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,560
You’re too old.

450
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,040
Too old.

451
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:46,590
Our family is so harmonious.

452
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,220
Are you sorry or not?

453
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,270
I can’t hear you.

454
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,550
Dad, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

455
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,070
I can’t hear you.

456
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,020
Dad, I’m sorry. Dad.

457
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,590
(Sent to Yuan Caixi)
Will you come to my race this Saturday?

458
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,320
I’m sorry. I can’t be there.

459
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,680
Go all out in the race.

460
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,200
I suggest you act like
a grownup man recently.

461
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
Don’t look for trouble.

462
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,590
Do you remember what you told me?

463
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,200
You asked me to trust you.

464
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,400
Can you trust me

465
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,480
this time?

466
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,030
Caixi. Haoxi. Come down for breakfast.

467
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,960
Coming.

468
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,310
Mom.

469
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,740
You made so many dishes.

470
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,200
Stop it. We can’t finish these.

471
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,910
Wait a second. There’s one more dish.

472
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,680
Eat first.

473
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,920
Mom.

474
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
You made three days’ meals.

475
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,830
Come on.

476
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,350
Eat it.

477
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,510
We can bring leftovers with us tomorrow.

478
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,030
But Caixi, you mustn’t have leftovers.

479
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,590
Moreover,

480
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,160
the most important thing is that
you mustn’t eat cold things

481
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,030
right out of the fridge
like what you used to do.

482
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,110
Okay.

483
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,200
This is a protracted battle.

484
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,550
You need strength.

485
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,510
Mom,

486
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,350
you’re treating us so differently.

487
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,830
If I knew so, I...

488
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,880
I... I... I’ll eat more.

489
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,310
-Have some soup.
-Okay.

490
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,480
Mom,

491
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,830
you don’t have to worry about me.

492
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,400
I haven’t been diagnosed yet.

493
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
I might not have the same illness
as my dad did.

494
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,110
I’m not saying that you’re sick.

495
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,160
It’s a protracted battle because
you need to improve your health.

496
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,350
Look at yourself. You faint easily

497
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,440
and get bruises frequently.
These are signs of anemia.

498
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,110
Okay.

499
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,920
Have some soup.

500
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,550
Okay.

501
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Mom.

502
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,510
Where is my soup?

503
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,310
I’m pouring it for you.

504
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,030
How long has Chief been running?

505
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,750
It has been almost an hour now.

506
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,790
He channels his anger into power.

507
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
I’m not right?

508
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,680
What’s going on with monitor?

509
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,880
She suddenly changed.

510
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,440
She went to movies and
claw cranes with Chief.

511
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,750
And all of a sudden,

512
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,240
she won’t even go to his race.

513
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,030
Don’t you find it odd?

514
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,440
She wasn’t like this before.

515
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,440
I don’t think this is that simple.

516
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,030
Chuan.

517
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,750
Why don’t you ask Han Yayi?

518
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,400
Fine.

519
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,750
I think,

520
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,550
Monitor cares only about her scores.

521
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,590
She used to find athletic students
interesting.

522
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,190
That’s why she was close to Chief.

523
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,230
Now, she just wants to
get back to her old self.

524
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,800
Don’t forget!

525
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,320
We were falsely accused of cheating.

526
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,000
But she never doubted us.

527
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,320
You said yourself that
you trust her character.

528
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,150
That was history now.
College Entrance Exam is close.

529
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,360
Maybe,

530
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,800
she doesn’t want to
waste her study time on the race.

531
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,550
I don’t think that’s who monitor is.

532
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,400
Actually...

533
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
You’ve finished, Chief?

534
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,030
Chuan.

535
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,280
Time it for me. I’ll do another lapse.

536
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:45,280
Chief, will you still run?
You’ll break your body.

537
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,110
No, I won’t. Time it.

538
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,760
Ready.

539
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,000
Go.

I left early this morning.

548
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,630
I met him, so

549
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,150
I came to school with him.

Hello, excuse me.

567
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,190
I want to book Hematology Department,
Dr. Qi’s appointment.

568
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,000
He’s fully booked today.

569
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,710
Really?

570
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Ah, can you please check to see

571
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,760
when’s the earliest date that
I can make a reservation with him?

572
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,630
Let me take a look for you.

573
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,360
Well.

574
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,230
It’ll take at least over a month.

575
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,030
Over a month?

576
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,110
Yes.

577
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,030
Thank you.

578
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,840
Hello.

579
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,110
This is Yanan.

580
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,110
Is it convenient to talk with you now?

581
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,840
Yanan.

582
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,110
You haven’t reached out
to me for a while.

583
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,590
Why do you suddenly think of me?

584
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,000
Well.

585
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,320
I need to ask you for a favor.

586
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,190
What is it? Just tell me.

587
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,110
Are you still in contact with

588
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,480
Dr. Qi at Wanhe Hospital?

589
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,710
Dr. Qi?

590
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,800
Why are you looking for Dr. Qi again?

591
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,630
I have a friend.
She needs a definite diagnosis.

592
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,000
Ah! Why do you always meet people

593
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,880
who have this illness?

594
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,280
Oh, gosh.

595
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,960
She knows about my situation. So...

596
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,320
So she came to me asking for a favor.

597
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,230
Medical treatments are so advanced now.

598
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,710
Leukemia is no longer incurable now.

599
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,280
It’s curable if it’s discovered in time.

600
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,230
Don’t worry too much.

601
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,840
Dr. Qi didn’t reply to my text
last night.

602
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,590
He also didn’t answer my call.

603
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,630
I really don’t know what to do.

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,190
Please,

605
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,880
can you help me?

606
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,480
Fine. I’ll ask my friend.

607
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,920
He happens to be doing a show
in the hospital.

608
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,000
I can ask him for you.

609
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,840
Thank you.

610
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,800
I’ll wait for the good news then.

611
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
Don’t tell Yuan Caixi about this.

612
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,670
Tell her what?

613
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,230
I already forgot it.

614
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,510
What I mean is that

615
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,400
you shouldn’t tell Han Yayi as well.

616
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
I know.

617
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,510
I’m not as stupid as Jiang Yuan.

618
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,320
That’s too mean.

619
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,230
You’re not mean?

620
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,590
I can’t even say bad things about you?

621
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,070
Why are you so depressed?

622
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,400
What happened to you?

623
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,190
Han Yayi.

624
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,030
Hum?

625
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,280
In my heart,

626
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,550
there are three most important people.

627
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,510
Li He. Li He. Li He.

628
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,190
The first must be my mom.

629
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,110
Then it’s Chief.

630
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,360
Just because Chief is so important.

631
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,400
So I have something to ask you.

632
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,550
I don’t know what got into Yuan as well.

633
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,150
I know she has been
acting strange recently.

634
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,590
I don’t know what’s wrong with her.

635
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,760
Besides, I asked her.
But she said nothing.

636
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
You know her personality.

637
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,000
If she’s determined to keep it a secret,

638
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,150
she will never tell.

639
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,510
She can’t even tell why
she won’t go to see Chief’s race?

640
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,510
See it for yourself.
I’ve sent her so many

641
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,190
texts, messages, and videos.

642
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,590
She replied none of those.

643
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,470
If you keep asking me,

644
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,190
I’ll have to knock her doors.

645
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,880
You have to.

646
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,230
Of course I can’t.

647
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,450
If I really do,

648
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,920
she’ll be more reluctant to tell me.

649
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,070
That’s right.

650
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,960
But, Chief...

651
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,440
What?

652
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,280
I promised him not to tell.

653
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,840
But, now I have no other options.

654
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,440
He fell down this morning
during training.

655
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:34,960
What?

656
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,810
His knees were wounded,

657
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,630
and bled a lot.

658
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,880
It’s that serious?

659
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,030
Is he all right?

660
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:44,030
He’s fine.

661
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,000
But...

662
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,480
It will definitely affect the race.

663
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,190
So, I wish you could ask monitor.

664
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,580
Did Chief make any mistake

665
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,710
that’s against her principle?

666
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,800
If not,

667
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,230
can she come to the race?

668
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,070
Because this race is
so important to Chief.

669
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,440
I see. I’ll find the chance to tell her.

670
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,550
I’m counting on you now.

671
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,230
Okay.

672
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,230
Ah! What should I do?

673
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,840
Ah!

674
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,190
Well, you just said that
you have three important people.

675
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,960
Your mom. Chief. And who?

676
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,590
Who else can it be?

677
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,320
Eat this.

678
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,550
It’s pretty tasty. It’s so sweet.

679
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,550
Haoxi.

680
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,840
Hey, Mom.

681
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,230
Why are you up so early?

682
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,070
I can’t sleep anyway.
So I got up and bought breakfast.

683
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,510
Haoxi.

684
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,510
Don’t worry.

685
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,000
Mom, I’m a grownup man.
I won’t be worried.

686
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,960
It’s not confirmed yet.

687
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,030
Don’t be scared.

688
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,920
No, I’m not.

689
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,440
I’m the man in this house.
I need to take care of you.

690
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,400
I’m really not scared.

691
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,630
Actually, I’m concerned and scared.

692
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,400
But we don’t have
a confirmed diagnosis yet.

693
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,070
We can’t be defeated.

694
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,000
Do you get it?

695
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,360
I got it.

696
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,230
Mom,

697
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,230
we won’t be so miserable, right?

698
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:00,360
It won’t be so unfortunate that

699
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
the same illness

700
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,630
killed my father

701
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,880
and will kill my sister. Right?

702
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,280
No, it won’t.

703
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,280
It definitely won’t.

704
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,670
My silly son.

705
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,510
So, we have to be optimistic.

706
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,550
No matter what happens,
we must be tough.

707
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,400
