00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,200
Sir.

19
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,400
Can we order?

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Here.

21
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,350
What do you want?

22
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,840
So what really happened between you?

23
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,230
It’s fine.

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,040
It’s just a boys’ problem.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,200
You girls don’t get it.

26
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,760
You’re being extremely sexist.

27
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,120
No, I’m not.

28
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,000
I...

29
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,430
How can I understand
if you don’t tell me?

30
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,710
I don’t understand the brotherhood
between you and Lin Chuan.

31
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,360
I just want to listen
to my friend’s concerns.

32
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,960
We had a fall-out because
of university application.

33
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,280
I want to go to Huatsing University.

34
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,710
I don’t know if I’ve made a mistake.

35
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,430
Huatsing University is one
of the best universities in China.

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,960
Though I felt a bit surprised

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,910
when you told me that.

38
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,660
But how could
aspiring to go to a top university

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,680
be a mistake?

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,120
No.

41
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
I’m not worried about failing to get in.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,190
Nor do I think Huatsing University
isn’t good enough.

43
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,150
It’s because I broke a promise.

44
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,960
We made a promise of going to

45
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,120
Haiwen Sport University together.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,590
But I broke that promise.

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,680
On your positions.

48
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,240
Ready.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,910
Go.

50
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,310
Have you finished the race?

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,360
Not yet.

52
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Then what are you waiting for?
Get in the line.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,470
Coach, I...

54
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,400
I can lend you my shoes.

55
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,470
You can’t run barefoot.

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,800
Come.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,680
See if we have the same size.

58
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,750
Can I?

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,910
Why not?

60
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,470
How are they?

61
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,190
Just right.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,430
Thank you for your shoes.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,310
Go.

64
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,280
On your positions.

65
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,710
Ready.

66
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,590
Go.

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,310
On your positions.

68
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,480
Ready.

69
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,430
Go.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
-Jiang Yuan.
-Yes.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,040
-Mo Xiaoding.
-Yes.

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,480
-Lin Chuan.
-Yes.

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,360
-Gao Jie.
-Yes.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,680
-Yun Xiang.
-Yes.

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,240
-Li He.
-Yes.

76
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,040
The students whose names were called

77
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
should come to the field
at 7AM tomorrow for training.

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,870
Dismissed.

79
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,240
Thank you for the shoes.

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Congratulations.

81
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,190
You’re welcome.

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
I just saw you run.

83
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,190
You did so well.

84
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,070
You too.

85
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,430
Let’s compete
when we get the chance.

86
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,070
Sure.

87
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,160
I’ll wait for you.

88
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,600
It’s fine, Chuan.

89
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
You were so handsome just now.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,190
There were a bunch of girls
secretly taking photos of you.

91
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,630
So what?

92
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
I just lost.

93
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,040
There are only two outcomes
of a competition.

94
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,190
Winning or losing.

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,870
Being defeated is fine.
You can try next time.

96
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes.

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,510
It’s fine.

98
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,920
Okay.

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,600
It’s your turn.

100
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,160
Chief.

101
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,070
Don’t worry.

102
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,870
With this pair of shoes you gave me,

103
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,750
I’ll definitely be the champion.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,270
-Come on.
-Come on.

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Bye.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,830
Don’t come back unless you’re No.1.

107
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,240
Come on.

108
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,270
-Go for it, Li He.
-Come on, Li He.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,270
Ready.

110
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,740
-Go for it, Li He.
-Come on, Li He.

111
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,120
-Come on! Go for it!
-Hurry! Hurry!

112
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
Come on.

113
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,560
-Come on.
-Go for it.

114
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,070
-Li He. Li He.
-Li He. Li He.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
I told you he’s got talent.

116
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,630
-Awesome.
-Li He.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,680
Thank you, mister.

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,870
Take some photos with this medal too.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
No. No.

120
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,920
I won’t wear a medal that’s not mine.

121
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,270
Fine.

122
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,800
When you get a medal in the future,

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,630
we can take photos together.

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,950
That’s a deal.

125
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,750
Of course.

126
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Let’s toast.

127
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,190
This is mineral water, not wine.

128
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,830
It’s our sponsor.

129
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,870
Chief.

130
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,600
Yes.

131
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,720
Which university do you want to
go to after high school?

132
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,870
I’ve never thought about it.

133
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,120
How about you?

134
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
I want to go to
Haiwen Sport University.

135
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:31,870
Fine.

136
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,950
Let’s go there together.

137
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,190
Really?

138
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,430
Yes.

139
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,800
But why do you choose
Haiwen Sport University?

140
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,360
Because it’s close to my home,

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,160
and I can receive scholarship.

142
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,270
In that case, my mom
will have less financial strains.

143
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,920
Okay.

144
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,500
After all, we’re brothers

145
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,920
who have shared
the same pair of sneakers.

146
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,000
Anywhere is all right
as long as we’re together.

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,390
You’re a true brother, Li He.

148
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,920
From then on,

149
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,560
they called me Chief

150
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,800
because I won that year’s first
championship of Sen Yong High School.

151
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,240
Every time we talk about universities,

152
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,040
we see Haiwen Sport University
as the goal.

153
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,430
No wonder.

154
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,920
I’ve never seen you so depressed.

155
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
I can’t get used to that.

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,870
I feel sorry for what I did to them.

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,430
And I wish we can do better.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Because choosing a university
is such an important decision.

159
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,390
It’s very helpful
to our future life path.

160
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,150
So I want them to do it with me.

161
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,960
So, you think Lin Chuan is mad

162
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,270
because you broke the promise?

163
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,320
Isn’t he?

164
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,240
Is Huatsing University what you want?

165
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,120
But have you thought about
what he wants?

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Every person’s choices and
aspirations are different.

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,670
Take me as an example,

168
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
I want to go to Beikai University’s
department of finance.

169
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,440
But they think my studying every day

170
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,320
must be extremely boring.

171
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,510
But I’m willing to do that.

172
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,670
I want to provide my family
with a better life.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,320
You? You have a higher aspiration now.

174
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,510
But Lin Chuan might be different.

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,480
You’ve been close buddies for years.

176
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,960
He definitely won’t be mad at you

177
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,910
for wanting bigger dreams.

178
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,120
But have you thought about

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,120
what he wants exactly?

180
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:59,580
(Chuan)

181
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,940
(Sent to Chuan)

182
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,790
Lin Chuan.

183
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,840
Can’t you act like a man?

184
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,790
Stop making me guess!

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,600
Just say it. What do you want?

186
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,300
(Li He)

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,870
Lin Chuan.

188
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,270
Can’t you act like a man?

189
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,480
Stop making me guess!

190
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,200
Just say it.

191
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,720
Why are you speaking like a girl?

192
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,630
Mom, I said I’d do this.

193
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,030
Ah. It’s fine.

194
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,750
-Okay, Son.
-Go get some rest.

195
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,030
Okay.

196
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,620
(ASP Program Design Basics)

197
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,790
Mom.

198
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,910
Answer me.

199
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,600
What are these?

200
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,870
You searched my room?

201
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,320
I did this for you.

202
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,120
I’m glad I did.

203
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,750
If I hadn’t searched your room,

204
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,360
I wouldn’t have known that

205
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,910
you’re still reading these books.

206
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,270
How many times have I told you?

207
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,960
I don’t mind you reading these books
in the 10th or 11th grade.

208
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,670
But now you’re in the 12th grade.

209
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,440
You’re still reading these books.

210
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,120
Game programming?

211
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,720
This is such a waste of time.

212
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,510
This isn’t a waste of time.

213
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,630
I’m always the No.1 in class.
This hasn’t affected my scores.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,080
No.1? So what?

215
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,720
You have to understand.

216
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,840
Your competitors are people

217
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,720
who’re as smart as you
from across the country.

218
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,630
Being No.1 in Sen Yong High School

219
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,120
can’t secure your success.

220
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,270
Zeyu.

221
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,150
If you can get into law school,

222
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,630
your dad and I have planned out

223
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,120
your future.

224
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,960
You’ll have brighter futures
Than your mom and dad.

225
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
I don’t like to study law.

226
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,720
I like writing codes.
I like designing programs.

227
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,270
I want to do things
that are challenging.

228
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Kid,

229
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,960
you’re so naive.

230
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,550
Do you think you can do

231
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,840
whatever you what
in a society like this?

232
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,120
(Li He)
Bring me two meat buns tomorrow.

233
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,240
Mom.

234
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,790
You and Li He are so close.

235
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,390
You’ll even waste your time
to buy buns for him.

236
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,910
I’ll say this one more time.

237
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,960
He’s an athletic student.

238
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,440
He has tons of time to waste.

239
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
But you’re different.

240
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,030
You’ll be a lawyer one day.

241
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,720
Mom, I get it.

242
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,360
I’ll get back to study.

243
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,720
You might hate me now.

244
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,240
In the future,

245
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
you’ll be grateful to me.

246
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,840
Ning Zeyu.

247
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,320
Ah.

248
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,120
What are you doing?

249
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,200
Look. Are these your books?

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,900
(Internet Program Design)

251
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,960
I knew something was wrong
when you didn’t text me back yesterday.

252
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,630
When I went to throw trash later,

253
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I saw these books.

254
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,080
Did your mom throw these away?

255
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,510
It’s fine.

256
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,200
I can keep these for you for now.

257
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,670
Tell me when you want to read these.

258
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,870
You can come to my house.
Or I can take these to school for you.

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,240
Okay.

260
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
Don’t be sad anymore.

261
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,080
After all, we’re in Grade 12.

262
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,480
Parents tend to be stricter.

263
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,480
It’s fine.

264
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,080
Have you changed your
major choice to programming secretly?

265
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,030
Yes.

266
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,630
I applied for Tiangong University
of Science and Technology.

267
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,960
Not bad. You’re so ambitious.

268
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,390
Well.

269
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,510
Which university did you apply?

270
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,550
Huatsing University.

271
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,960
Good for you.
You’re even more ambitious.

272
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,790
Well, bro.

273
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,600
It’s not too late to ask for
my autograph now.

274
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,150
Buy me one meal.
I can give you ten autographs.

275
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,480
When did I become your brother?

276
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,670
Fine. We are fake brothers.

277
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Fine. Fake brother. Wish you
can pass all your exams soon.

278
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,550
Thanks.

279
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,120
You’re welcome.

280
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,360
Lin Chuan.

281
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,320
What?

282
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,480
If Chief asked you to come,
you can leave now.

283
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,870
Why do you think I’m here
because of another boy?

284
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,440
Come.

285
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:10,960
I’ll buy you a meal.

286
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,150
Hurry up. Eat.

287
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,870
Why barbecue again?

288
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,790
Because I don’t have enough fund.

289
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,720
My mom didn’t give me much allowance.

290
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,030
Tell me.

291
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,670
What did Li He want you to tell me?

292
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,630
No.

293
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,630
I didn’t come

294
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,270
because Li He asked me to this time.

295
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,200
But, he’s indeed

296
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,440
the reason

297
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,510
why I buy you this meal.

298
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,510
I’m not being unreasonable.

299
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,790
I want to be a high-level athlete.

300
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,480
I want to get to Huatsing University.

301
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,510
Well done. Li He.

302
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,510
The world champion.

303
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,030
That’s in the future.

304
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,790
Okay. Future world champion.

305
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,590
I’ll ask you for autographs then.

306
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,110
Sure.

307
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,350
Can I have

308
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
another request?

309
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,070
Can you...?

310
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,270
No.

311
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,110
You two.

312
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,510
Can you

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,920
also teach

314
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,000
Chuan,

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,790
Jiang Yuan, Yun Xiang,
particularly Chuan?

316
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,440
Sure.

317
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,790
Of course.

318
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,480
Yes.

319
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,680
I can take that into consideration.

320
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,310
But, Li He.

321
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,960
So we buy one, get three free.

322
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
We come in a bundle.

323
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,030
In Gintama,

324
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,960
Shimura always gives
Gintoki cold shoulders.

325
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,640
But at critical moments,

326
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,790
Shimura is always by his side.

327
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,110
Even though he’s weak,

328
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,110
he will fight with Gintoki without fear.

329
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Shimura is so fearless

330
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,790
because he trusts Gintoki.

331
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,030
No matter what happens,

332
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,720
he believes that

333
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,590
Gintoki will never leave
a friend behind.

334
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,270
Li He never thought about

335
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,240
abandoning the dream you all share.

336
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,440
He just wishes to

337
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,160
pursue higher goals

338
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,350
and achieve higher scores with you.

339
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,920
Chuan.

340
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,640
I’ve made up my mind.

341
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,640
I want to apply for Huatsing University.

342
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,350
I can’t keep our promise to apply for
Haiwen Sport University.

343
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,160
I’m so sorry.

344
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,790
But,

345
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,790
can I invite you to apply for
Huatsing University with me?

346
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,200
How can I?

347
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,980
My mom runs that little shop

348
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,590
all on her own.

349
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,960
How can I go to such a faraway place?

350
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,270
Are you dumb?

351
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,880
What does your mom work so hard for?

352
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,480
So you can study at a nearby university?

353
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,640
So you can go back and
run that small shop?

354
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,200
She saves every penny

355
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,270
because she wants you to
go to a good university

356
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,350
and have a bright future.

357
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,790
Chuan,

358
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,750
if she knows that you give up
Huatsing University

359
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,750
because of her.

360
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,070
She’ll feel sorry for
the rest of her life.

361
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,590
Do you really want that?

362
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,590
Besides,

363
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,750
is it worthwhile to make such sacrifice?

364
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,240
You’re capable of going to
a better university.

365
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,200
You’re able to provide her
with a better life.

366
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,720
Why don’t you do that?

367
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,960
I think you’re out of your mind.

368
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,400
What?

369
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,880
Why do you smell like barbeque?

370
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,960
Well done. Kid.

371
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,590
I’ve been looking for you all day.
You sneaked out for barbeque.

372
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,960
With whom? Han Yayi?

373
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,590
I...

374
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,110
What?

375
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,640
What excuses do you have?

376
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,440
I knew it. Girls come before friends.

377
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,350
You’re so heartless.

378
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,000
No way.

379
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,310
Girls come before friends?

380
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,110
I can accept the other allegations.

381
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,400
But this one?
I’d better give it back to you.

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,640
Me?

383
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,830
When did I ever
put girls before friends?

384
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,270
Dare you say that Yuan Caixi
isn’t part of the reason

385
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,720
you apply for Huatsing University?

386
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,750
No.

387
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,720
She applies for Beikai University,
not Huatsing University.

388
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,790
-Bei...
-What are you looking at?

389
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,240
Go.

390
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,960
Go back to study.

391
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,640
She’s really applying
for Beikai University.

392
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,350
Yes.

393
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,880
I thought you’d apply for
the same university.

394
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,750
-Chief.
-You’re back.

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,790
Chuan.

396
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:12,750
Chuan.

397
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,790
Boss.

398
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,110
Sit.

399
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,270
Listen, if you don’t come soon,

400
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,110
I’ll have higher scores
than you do in exams.

401
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,440
Keep dreaming.

402
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,000
-Come.
-I want it too.

403
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,720
Yes.

404
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,480
Thank you, monitor.

405
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,200
Just write like this.

406
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,750
Oh.

407
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
I’m back.

408
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,590
Brother.

409
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,790
You’re back.

410
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,790
Bear?

411
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,030
Two weeks flew by so quickly.

412
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
I came back

413
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,750
so I can study with you.

414
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,440
What?

415
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,310
Do you miss me?

416
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,480
Do you?

417
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,030
Sure.

418
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,510
Why are you still so annoying?

419
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,160
You came back right on time.
You can study with us.

420
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
You and Li He, two problematic students,

421
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,790
can stay in the same group.

422
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
What?

423
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,110
How can you compare Li He to me?

424
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,110
Do you think I want to
be compared to you?

425
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,480
Go ahead.

426
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,480
Do this test first.

427
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,830
You can teach me
if I don’t know the answer.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,270
I have to do it myself?

429
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,440
Don’t tell me you can’t do any of these.

430
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,030
I can. I just...

431
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,030
Han Yayi.

432
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,640

Why are you here?

458
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,400
Who knows. I told them that

459
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,830
Li He would take you home.

460
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,590
Then, they insisted on waiting here.

461
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,030
Yuan.

462
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,030
You must be really tired.

463
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,880
Go home with Haoxi first.

464
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,400
We have something

465
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,880
we want to talk to Li He.

466
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,960
What?

467
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,160
Nothing special.

468
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,550
We made a deal.

469
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,510
Yes.

470
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,790
It’s all right. Go home.

471
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,510
Okay.

472
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,440
Let’s go. Come.

473
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
-Bye.
-Bye.

474
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,480
What’s this face, Yuan Haoxi?

475
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,240
What?

476
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,160
What?

477
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,590
We agreed to compete fairly.

478
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,550
But you accompanied monitor home

479
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,070
secretly without our notice.

480
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,510
Don’t you know that

481
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,110
your action violated our rules?

482
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,200
What?

483
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,880
Any problem?

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,640
If so, let’s have a match.

485
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,750
-Fine.
-Come on.

486
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,640
How about this?

487
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,350
I’ll give you a five-second head start.

488
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
On the count of three.

489
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
Whoever makes it
to that dessert shop first

490
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,200
is the winner.

491
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,510
What’s the prize for the winner?

492
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,720
We can decide later.

493
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,270
Anyway, the loser must

494
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,440
buy drinks.

495
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,640
The winner can accompany
monitor home tomorrow.

496
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,640
Okay.

497
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,110
Come on.

498
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,310
Let’s do it.

499
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,030
Three.

500
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,440
-Two.
-Two.

501
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,270
-One.
-One.

502
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,240
Let’s go.

503
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:22,820
(Zeyu)

504
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,480
I’m coming.

505
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,590
Wow.

506
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,270
Mrs. Ning.

507
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,270
Hi. Why are you here?
Come inside.

508
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,070
No, thanks.

509
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,720
Is Zeyu at your place?

510
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:47,590
No.

511
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,790
Li He hasn’t come home either?

512
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,350
No.

513
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,960
Do you want to confirm it inside?

514
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,000
No. I’m just asking.

515
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,750
Mrs. Ning.

516
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,960
I guess these kids

517
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,920
are studying together.

518
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,310
Don’t worry too much.

519
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,550
They’ve grown up now.

520
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,350
Mrs. Li.

521
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,920
I don’t think Zeyu’s scores
are good enough

522
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
to help others.

523
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,640
He’ll become a lawyer one day.

524
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
He’s different from Li He.

525
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,720
Mrs. Ning, listen to yourself.

526
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,830
You think our Li He is not good enough?

527
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,400
Listen up.

528
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,110
The other day, school had a conversation
about university applications.

529
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,750
Our Li He will take the test to be

530
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,590
a high-level college athlete.

531
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,880
Well, it’s uncertain

532
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,110
who’ll get to a better college
in the future,

533
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,070
right?

534
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,720
You had the conversation
about university applications?

535
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,830
Yes.

536
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,720
You don’t know?

537
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,640
Have I said something
I’m not supposed to?

538
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,740
(Parents’ letter of confirmation)

539
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,300
(Ning Zeyu English test paper)

540
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,020
(Physics tests for
College Entrance Exams)

541
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,980
(C primer Plus)

542
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,200
This bad kid.

543
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,790
Mom, I...

544
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,310
Who did you learn this from?

545
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,640
I’m asking you.
Who did you learn this from?

546
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,750
You lied to your teachers.

547
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,200
You cheated your parents.

548
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,110
And you forged my signature.

549
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,440
You even secretly filled in
college application.

550
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
Did you learn this from Li He?

551
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,310
What does this have to do
with Li He again?

552
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,680
Forging signature will give

553
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,680
you civil liabilities.

554
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,070
In worse cases,
this constitutes contract fraud.

555
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,160
This is very serious.

556
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,030
Mom.

557
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,440
I’m your son, not your client.

558
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,400
Then this is even more unforgivable.

559
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,880
Your test results came.

560
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,550
You’re still No.1.

561
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,400
But your scores dropped.

562
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,440
To keep me from knowing,

563
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,720
you even forged my signature.

564
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:44,110
If I hadn’t asked Li He’s mom,

565
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,200
I wouldn’t have known anything about
the interview with parents.

566
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,750
You even kept that a secret from me.

567
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,790
And you hide programming books.

568
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,720
What on earth do you want?

569
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,160
You went to Li He’s home?

570
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,400
You think this is embarrassing?

571
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,790
Now, you feel embarrassed?

572
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,350
Do I really want to?

573
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,160
You help others study every day.

574
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,590
Your own scores dropped because of that.

575
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,110
If I hadn’t searched your stuff,

576
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,640
I wouldn’t have known that you
kept so many things hidden from me.

577
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,550
Give me your phone.

578
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,200
What?

579
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:23,960
From now on,

580
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,110
all of your activities after class
are suspended.

581
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,110
Don’t even think about
helping others to study.

582
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,350
You can forget about school’s
self-study sessions as well.

583
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,030
Tomorrow, I’ll call your head teacher.

584
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,200
I’ll tell her.

585
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,310
From today till the day
of college entrance exam,

586
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,000
Ning Zeyu will come home
immediately after class.

587
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,400
Stay home.

588
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,790
Study at home.

589
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,110
I don’t want to.

590
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,510
You must even if you don’t want to.

591
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,550
Give me your phone.

592
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,680
I’ll repeat it again.

593
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,830
Give it to me.

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,590
Ning Zeyu.

595
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,240
What’s the situation?

596
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,720
He must have a rough time
because of his mom.

597
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,350
Oops.

598
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
I must have said too much.

599
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,550
It’s all my fault.

600
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,590
That’s not true.

601
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,880
If you didn’t told her,

602
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
she wouldn’t find out?

603
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,640
She will find out sooner or later.

604
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,400
He.

605
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,270
Call Zeyu. Ask him what’s going on.

606
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,640
I will.

607
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,200
How’s it?

608
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,790
No answer.

609
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,680
Well. It’s late in the night.

610
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,510
Where can he go?

611
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,590
Ning Zeyu.

612
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,070
Excuse me.

613
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,790
Can you take me in for a night?

614
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,880
Oh.

615
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,550
Come in. Hurry.

616
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
What’s going on?

617
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,440
So,

618
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,440
you ran away from home?

619
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,480
What a surprise!

620
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,960
The straight-A student is so rebellious.

621
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,790
I’m not being rebellious.

622
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,070
I really don’t know
how to explain to my mom.

623
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,110
I don’t want to go to law school at all.

624
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,510
My mom and dad just don’t get me.

625
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,920
This is the only thing I can do.

626
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,240
I didn’t expect this.

627
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,590
The straight-A student
has come to this dilemma.

628
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,400
This is unexpected to me too.

629
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,830
You take pleasure in my misery.
But don’t show it.

630
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,830
Let me show you something.

631
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,440
I found it

632
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,260
unbelievable

633
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,500
that someone would

634
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,640
refuse to...

635
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,200
Isn’t this... ?

636
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,200
Your audition?

637
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,200
I remember that you were well-prepared.

638
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,790
I found it unbelievable that
someone would refuse to swim.

639
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,580
Being in water,

640
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,640
we’re close to the heart of the ocean.

641
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,920
It’s the most amazing feeling
I’ve ever felt.

642
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,240
You memorized it pretty well.

643
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,400
-I did it on purpose.
-Why?

644
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,030
At that time, why did you... ?

645
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,920
I don’t want to go.

646
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,360
So I did this.

647
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,760
I just want to sing and produce music.

648
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,150
But my agency got
this opportunity for me.

649
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,190
It’s a good one.

650
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,920
I had to go.

651
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,070
Then, later,

652
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,630
I came up with this lame idea.

653
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,880
If you’re truly passionate
about programming,

654
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,710
then stick to it.

655
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,000
At start, my parents were against
me entering the music industry.

656
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,960
Because we have a family business.

657
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
But I told my mom that

658
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,070
I’m willing to inherit
the family business.

659
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,070
But if I do so,

660
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,880
I can never be happy in my life.

661
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,480
Then,

662
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,880
my mom agreed.

663
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,030
No matter what,

664
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,590
just tell your family you’re safe.

665
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,030
We got school tomorrow.

666
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,280
Take some rest.

667
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,420
(Missed call, from Mom)

668
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,590
Li He.

669
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,030
Aunt,

670
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,030
I’m just here to tell you this.

671
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,800
Zeyu is staying at

672
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,110
our classmate’s place.

673
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,000
Don’t worry about him.

674
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,710
Which classmate?

675
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,320
A boy or a girl?

676
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
I’m just here to tell you this.

677
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,800
I don’t know the rest.

678
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,150
It’s late. Go to rest early.

679
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,550
Isn’t this Zeyu who ran away from home?

680
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,710
How do you feel?

681
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,510
Tomorrow is the final.

682
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,480
Don’t let this affect your performance.

683
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,320
If I under-perform in the exam

684
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,320
and you get the first place,

685
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,880
will you be happy or sad?

686
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,590
What do you mean?

687
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,670
Nothing. It’s just a joke.

688
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,760
(Class 2, Grade 3)

689
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,840
I want everyone to take a look at
the names of these minority groups.

690
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,230
Can someone tell me the similarities
between these groups?

691
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,230
Ning Zeyu.

692
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,400
Answer this question.

693
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,440
Zeyu.

694
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280
Zeyu.

695
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,150
Ning Zeyu.

696
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,190
Zeyu.

697
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,760
Oh.

698
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,440
Is there an answer outside the window?

699
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,230
Sorry.

700
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,630
They share the same Asian culture
full of kindness and bravery.

701
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,880
That’s about right.

702
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,000
Sit down.

703
00:37:56,110 --> 00:38:00,420
So we all know that
China’s vast geography and population

704
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,840
is composed of a diverse variety
of minority groups.

705
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,740
But apart from the few listed

706
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,920
on this board behind me,

707
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,800
I want someone to come up

708
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,400
and write down some of
the other minority groups.

709
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,590
Yuan, eat more meat.

710
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,070
-Don’t eat his.
-I can’t have more.

711
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,190
This is used.

712
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,320
-Just eat your food.
-How can she eat yours?

713
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,550
-You have such a huge appetite.
-Well.

714
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,880
I’m different.

715
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,840
I think Zeyu’s problem

716
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,880
isn’t just his argument with his mom.

717
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,030
I’ll talk to him
when we get home tonight.

718
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,760
And he was absent-minded
throughout the class today.

719
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,400
Yes.

720
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,920
Look.

721
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,150
Look what I found in

722
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
the entry list.

723
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,020
(Entry List for Haiwen Internet
Programming Preliminary Competition)

724
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,510
So, he’s worried about the competition.

725
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,590
I don’t know when he became

726
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,030
interested in programming.

727
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,920
It’s beyond mere interest.

728
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,030
The time he spent studying programming

729
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,000
has already exceeded

730
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,070
the overall time I spent on study
at high school.

731
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,110
Moreover, he didn’t even want to

732
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,510
go to Beikai University
or Huatsing University.

733
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,070
Huh.

734
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,550
The school he chose
on his application is…

735
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,280
-Tiangong Uni of Science and Technology.
-Tiangong Uni of Science and Technology.

736
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,190
Tiangong University of
Science and Technology.

737
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,920
-Yes.
-Yeah.

738
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,030
Yes.

739
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,880
Why?

740
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,000
I’ll tell you the details later.

741
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,590
The competition is
scheduled on tomorrow.

742
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Tomorrow?

743
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Yes.

744
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,360
Isn’t tomorrow the day of our final?

745
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,440
No wonder he’s so stressed out.

746
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,590
He has to prepare for the exam

747
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,030
and the competition at the same time.

748
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,110
But based on my knowledge

749
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,320
of Zeyu,

750
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,550
he shouldn’t act like this.

751
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,630
The final is just

752
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,710
a piece of cake for him.

753
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,710
Anyway,

754
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,760
having to choose between

755
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,960
his dream and his parents’ dream

756
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,400
must be difficult.

757
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,670
Mrs. Ning.

758
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,030
You’re looking for me?

759
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:20,880
I’m looking for your son.

760
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,960
Oh. Come inside.

761
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,190
Come in, please.

762
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,440
Please tell Zeyu.

763
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,320
I’ll transfer him to another school

764
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,510
after tomorrow’s final.

765
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:37,800
Ah!

766
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:39,800
-Wait.
-Mrs. Ning.

767
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Zeyu is in the 12th grade now.

768
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,480
You’re transferring him
to another school?

769
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,840
Aren’t you afraid that
this will affect his study?

770
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,510
His study will be affected
if I don’t transfer him.

771
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,230
After all,

772
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,440
he’s surrounded by people
who affect his study.

773
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,840
Mrs. Ning, your words
have other meanings, right?

774
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:00,800
Li He and Zeyu are
classmates and best friends.

775
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,710
We live opposite to each other.

776
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,360
When you were too busy with work

777
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
and couldn’t take care of Zeyu,

778
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,710
we helped you out.

779
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,670
We are neighbors.

780
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,670
That’s what we should do.

781
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,550
Well.

782
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,920
Li He’s scores aren’t as good as Zeyu’s.

783
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,400
But he is working hard.

784
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,840
We all witnessed that.

785
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,110
Right, Li He?

786
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,710
Wow! Mrs. Ning.

787
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,440
You must be too worried recently.

788
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,480
You even got a pimple on your lips.

789
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,840
Was it because you were
too angry at Zeyu?

790
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,070
Listen up! My Li He has one merit.

791
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,960
He never makes me mad.

792
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:33,630
We’re like close friends.
We tell each other everything.

793
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,630
Right?

794
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,760
The boys are in their puberty.

795
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,280
They might throw little tantrums.

796
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,710
They might be a bit rebellious.
That’s normal.

797
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,630
If you transfer him to another school
because of such trivial matters,

798
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,320
it might influence his future.

799
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,480
Anyway, please tell him.

800
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,670
Goodbye.

801
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,150
Look at her.

802
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:03,190
-She was being so mean.
-Mom.

803
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,000
Thank you for speaking up for me.

804
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,670
My stupid son.

805
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,190
It’s true. My son is so good.

806
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,710
How can I let her say bad things
about you, right?

807
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,630
But Zeyu is about to be transferred.

808
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,230
Don’t worry.

809
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,000
Call him later.

810
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,320
Try to convince him

811
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,360
to apologize to his mom.

812
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,150
He’ll be in great trouble if his mom
really transfers him to another school.

813
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,880
Okay.

814
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,800
