Whoops.

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,040
Your facial mask is so horrible.

19
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,200
Don’t mind the pattern.
Just as long as it works.

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
What’s up? Hurry up.

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
Don’t waste my time.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,230
Where is Ning Zeyu?

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,840
Upstairs.

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,360
Well.

25
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,630
Lower down your voice.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,310
Don’t let him know.

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,360
You know what?

28
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,910
Things are getting worse.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Ning Zeyu’s mother is planning
to transfer him to another school.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,240
Lower down your voice!

31
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,630
Don’t let him know.

32
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,000
Aunt is so abrasive.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
She transfers him to another school now?

34
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,680
And in such a critical moment
in Grade 3.

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,470
Yes.

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,400
What should we do?

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,470
She asked me to tell him.

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,240
How can I do it?

39
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,560
In my opinion,

40
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,430
Ning Zeyu is capable to

41
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,520
prepare the competition
and final exam at the same time.

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,630
But his mother doesn’t think so.

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,240
So,

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,520
we have to let her know.

45
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,590
Monitor,

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
we share the idea.

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,470
As his friends,

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
we should help him.

49
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,280
How?

50
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,150
Two heads are better than one.

51
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,150
Well…

52
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:04,800
What?

53
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,400
It sounds unreliable.

54
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Well, this is the only way.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,190
OK. Get it.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you doing?

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,370
Me?

58
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
Well,

59
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,750
I’m sharing ideas

60
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,910
about skin care with Yuan Caixi.

61
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,630
Tomorrow is the exam, have a good rest.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,790
OK.

63
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,310
Skin care?

64
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,120
You’re so stupid, Ye Jingxi.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
What’s your idea? Can you make it?

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,470
You tell him the transferring.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,310
OK. Let’s stop here.

68
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,710
I’ll hang up.

69
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,870
This is not bad.

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Hello.

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,560
Hello.

72
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,750
How to get to
the teaching affair office?

73
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,270
This way, please.

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,180
Thank you.

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,830
Check your answers.

76
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,160
And write your name properly.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,600
I hope Ning Zeyu’s mother won’t come

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,360
so that this issue can be settled.

79
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,870
It sounds impossible.

80
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,600
Is that her?

81
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,310
Oh!

82
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,630
She is coming.

83
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,870
So quickly.

84
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,920
-What should we do?
-Where is Ning Zeyu?

85
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,040
No idea. Probably in the classroom.

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,240
It’s bad.

87
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,560
You hold up his mother,

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,360
and I’m coming to look for Ning Zeyu.

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,870
OK.

90
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,720
I saw Ning Zeyu’s mother come to school.

91
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
For this issue?

92
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,160
What?

93
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,480
Where has she headed for?

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,430
You didn’t act so quickly.

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,480
-Aunt!
-Aunt!

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,390
You’re Ning Zeyu’s mother, right?

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,920
I’m Ye Jingxi.

98
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,750
I think you’ve known me.

99
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,480
No.

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,430
Aunt! Aunt!

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,950
I heard from Ning Zeyu

102
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,190
that you’re a professional lawyer.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,240
Well.

104
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,360
I’m an actor.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,390
So…

106
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,680
An actor?

107
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,830
The entertainment circle?

108
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,510
Yes.

109
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
Why are his classmates

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,830
PE students or actors?

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
How can he study hard?

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,830
It’s none of my business.

113
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,120
Let’s just find him.

114
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,310
Ning Zeyu.

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,100
Get on.

116
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,720
Why are you here?

117
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,340
Hurry up!

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,950
Mrs. Ning!

119
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,240
Mrs. Ning!

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,360
Listen to me.

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,430
I don’t think it’s a good idea
to transfer Zeyu to another school now.

122
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,310
It will not only affect his study,

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,950
but also impose pressure on him.

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,270
Miss Luo.

125
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,830
Of course you don’t want Ning Zeyu
to leave.

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,000
If he’s gone,

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,920
the graduation rates will be
greatly affected.

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,000
Mrs. Ning.

129
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,630
My classes

130
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,680
are always the top 3 of school.

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,560
The rate of first-tier university
is over 70%.

132
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,160
My suggestions are totally

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,430
out of profession and experience.

134
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,310
You should trust me.

135
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
I should trust you.

136
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,630
But what’s the result?

137
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,950
Ning Zeyu is wasting time
in programming.

138
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,070
And he started to lie,

139
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,270
forged a signature,

140
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,430
and ran away from home.

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,190
This is how you taught him.

142
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,160
Right.

143
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
These are big mistakes.

144
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,510
I’m to be blame.

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,190
But,

146
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,360
Ning Zeyu is now at a rebellious stage.

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,310
If he has been restricted all the time,

148
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,480
he’ll be overwhelmed.

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,190
He will break out sooner or later.

150
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,630
Transferring to another school
at this time

151
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,680
doesn’t help, right?

152
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,040
How can you be sure
that it doesn’t help?

153
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,120
Miss Luo.

154
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,270
I don’t want to talk
to subjective person.

155
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,920
Please make way for me.

156
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,940
Aunt.

157
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,430
Transferring school is a big issue.

158
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,830
Don’t you gonna tell Ning Zeyu?

159
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,630
Aunt.

160
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,800
May I have the last words?

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,310
I think you should listen to

162
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,430
and know

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
your son’s opinions.

164
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,310
He loves programming so much.

165
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,750
And now there’s a competition.

166
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,510
Are you not going to watch it?

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,680
Who are you?

168
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
I’m the monitor of Class 2.

169
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,000
Yuan Caixi.

170
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,480
Have Ye Jingxi and monitor known this?

171
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,430
They’re trying to hold up
your mom at school.

172
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,000
Unexpectedly,

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
you saved me at the critical moment.

174
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:30,830
Never mind.

175
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,510
But, is this competition so important?

176
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,320
Must you come?

177
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,960
The judges are professors from Tiangong
University of Science and Technology.

178
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,790
I’ve been concerning
about this competition for a long time.

179
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,840
Once I’m admitted,

180
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,120
I can join the winter holiday training

181
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,440
and meet the professors.

182
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,510
I have to come anyway.

183
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,250
OK.

184
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,200
Get it.

185
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,120
Be careful.

186
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,750
Hello, audiences at present
and on the internet.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,120
Welcome to the preliminary contest of
programming competition in Haiwen.

188
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,390
In recent year,
internet has been developed

189
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,240
(Haiwen Preliminary of the 6th Programming Match)
into one of the most important technologies in China.

190
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,550
We set up the programming competition
in Haiwen

191
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,750
to encourage more young people
to join in this area.

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,030
The winners will be awarded
with rich bonus,

193
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,120
and will have the chance to communicate
with the top experts.

194
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,670
-Now it’s the preliminary for high school.
-Li He.

195
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,570
-There’re all together five items.
-Aunt.

196
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,080
-They are all questionable codes.
-Have a seat.

197
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,510
The competitors should

198
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,320
address the problems in limited time.

199
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,480
Faster and cleaner, the better.

200
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,510
The fastest at present is No.3,
Ning Zeyu.

201
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,600
He is also the youngest competitor.

202
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,550
The heroes are usually young.

203
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,600
Let’s expect

204
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,270
the results of the competition.

205
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,390
Aunt.

206
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,240
See, Ning Zeyu is so cool
when he’s programming.

207
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
What programming?

208
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,750
It’s a waste of time.

209
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,120
Your father and I have already
decided your future.

210
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,480
You’ll be a lawyer.

211
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,390
You’re so naive.

212
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,840
Do you think it’s possible
to just do what you want

213
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,390
in today’s society?

214
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
The leading No.3 Ning Zeyu

215
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,120
made a mistake.

216
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,840
Time is limited.

217
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,080
Can he debug

218
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,000
and turn the situation?

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,870
What does it mean?

220
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,390
No idea.

221
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,120
What’s wrong?

222
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,240
Why does it turn red?

223
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,150
It’s a mistake.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,870
You’re Grade 3 after all.

225
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,320
Of course that your parents are strict.

226
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,360
It will be alright when you pass it.

227
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,320
Just stick to it

228
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,720
if you really like programming.

229
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,510
I just want to do what I like,

230
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,390
or I’ll regret.

Congratulations! You passed
the preliminary contest.

244
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,790
It’s just a preliminary contest.

245
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,630
It’s not hard.

246
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,440
I’ve watched the competition.

247
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,600
You’re amazing.

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,720
Your winter holiday training

249
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,270
will be achieved.

250
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,150
You can learn from the professors later.

251
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,320
It’s uncertain. I have to wait for

252
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,150
the notification to the training.

253
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,720
Oh. By the way,

254
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,080
did my mom…?

255
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,480
As your mother,

256
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,390
you need to talk to her
after coming back.

257
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,150
Yes.

258
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
I’ve planned to talk to her.

259
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,320
Don’t think too much. Just go.

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,630
Let’s go.

261
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:43,870
Let me see you out.

262
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,270
Mom.

263
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,080
You don’t have to say anything.

264
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,910
I know you like programming.

265
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
But you’re in Grade 3.
You can’t waste your time.

266
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,270
The competition is over.

267
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,030
I won’t blame you for this time.

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,910
If you don’t change your mind

269
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,110
and do this again,

270
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,320
I’ll transfer you to another school.

271
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,440
The scores of final exam have come out.

272
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,390
You can check it online.

273
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,120
This winter holiday is the last holiday

274
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,390
before the college entrance examination.

275
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,870
I have to remind you,

276
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,910
don’t spend all you time on having fun
during the Spring Festival,

277
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,240
make use of your time to study.

278
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,630
OK.

279
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,720
Pack up your stuffs and go home.

280
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,390
Ning Zeyu.

281
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
Come to my office.

282
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,670
The class is over. Miss Luo.

283
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:19,870
Miss Luo.

284
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,550
Have a seat.

285
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,750
Ning Zeyu.

286
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,440
I ask you here

287
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,030
to have a talk.

288
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,440
See.

289
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,870
Here.

290
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,630
The score has come out.

291
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,510
(Notification of Final Exam Score)
Your score has dropped nearly 30 points.

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,270
And your grade rank
has dropped to No.2.

293
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,000
I don’t know the exact cause of

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,390
your severe retrogress

295
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,750
in such a short time.

296
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
But I believe

297
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,630
there’s a reason.

298
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,910
I have talked to your mother.

299
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,080
She agreed not to transfer you
to another school presently.

300
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,790
But there’re less than 180 days

301
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,790
to the college entrance examination.

302
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,030
I hope you can focus on
the important issue.

303
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,270
Of course.

304
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,030
I know the dream is important.

305
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,360
So,

306
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:20,390
if your reach the final contest,

307
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,480
you can take the holiday

308
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,910
to prepare for it.

309
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,150
But after that you have
to focus on study.

310
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,390
After all the college
entrance examination

311
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,840
is the most important thing
for you presently.

312
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,630
I hope you

313
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,030
can prepare for it

314
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,270
with a perfect state.

315
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,270
Understand?

316
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,120
Understood. Miss Luo.

317
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,120
OK.

318
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,790
Well, study hard

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,870
and have a good rest.

320
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,630
OK.

321
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,550
Thank you, Miss Luo.

322
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,780
(Ning Zeyu. Total Score: 689.
Grade Ranking: 2)

323
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,360
What’s wrong with Ning Zeyu?

324
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
Is his mother here?

325
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,120
No idea.

326
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,030
It may be the matter about score.

327
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,030
No way.

328
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,240
How can he have problems with score?

329
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,790
Yes.

330
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,320
Why are you still here?

331
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,080
We’re waiting for you.

332
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,720
I’m waiting for Yuan Caixi.

333
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,600
Are you alright?

334
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,550
Nothing.

335
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,120
It’s just that I got No.2.

336
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,840
But on the other hand,
congratulations, you’re No.1.

337
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,360

Monitor ranks before Ning Zeyu?

340
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,200
Amazing.

341
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,320
You deserve it.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,790
-You won over Ning Zeyu.
-Yes.

343
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,480
Ning Zeyu.

344
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
You must be distracted
by the programming competition.

345
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,960
I hope you are not deliberate
to lose to me.

346
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,200
I wasn’t deliberate.

347
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,150
Monitor.

348
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,030
Are you questioning your ability?

349
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,790
Besides,

350
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,840
this is not
the college entrance examination.

351
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,320
Do you think

352
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,630
you can win over me next time?

353
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,720
OK. All right.

354
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,030
Stop talking about the exam.

355
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,720
I don’t want to hear about it.

356
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,920
The winter holiday is coming,

357
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,720
let’s hang out and have fun.

358
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,030
I agree with you.

359
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,270
You three go.

360
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,880
I failed my exam. I don’t want to go.

361
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,070
Ning Zeyu.

362
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,680
Appropriate relaxation
can help ease the stress.

363
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,790
It can release dopamine
that makes you happy.

364
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,960
-So…
-Monitor.

365
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,550
Do you have any other new words?

366

Ning Zeyu.

367
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,200
Stop mourning.

368
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,550
Think about it.

369
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,880
If I and Li He always

370
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,200
worry about our scores,

371
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,440
we can’t

372
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,680
continue our life at all.

373
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
Don’t include me in

374
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
when you talk about yourself. Thanks.

375
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:38,700
OK.

376
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,350

You like this?

00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,000
Last time I saw it but when I came
to find it, it was gone.

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,960
I see it here today.

431
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,400
Yes. You have received the bonus.

432
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,550
It’s destined
that you should buy it for Aunt.

433
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,640
Hello.

434
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,830
Excuse me. What are the sizes for this?

435
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,750
Where are they?

436
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,240
Here they are.

437
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,510
Here.

438
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,240
Monitor.

439
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,350
Why are you here?

440
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,310
We’ve been looking for you.

441
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,830
Where’re the others?

442
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,200
They are in the stores.

443
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,960
Yes.

444
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
I think I have been recognized.

445
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,310
Let’s go to somewhere less crowded.

446
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,030
Don’t overreact.

447
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,920
No one recognized you.

448
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,070
I mean it.

449
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,750
Let go to somewhere less crowded.

450
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,110
Let’s go to eat.

451
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh! There’s a dessert shop in front.
Let’s come here.

452
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,240
-Let’s go.
-Go.

453
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,790
Chief. Spoon. Spoon.

454
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,180
Give me one.

455
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:48,630
That. That.

456
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,890
This is mine. This is mine.

457
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,110
How about adding something.

458
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,310
OK.

459
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:56,920
OK.

460
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,510
How about this?

461
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,750
Today is the first time
we hang out to eat.

462
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,440
So,

463
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,400
it’s my treat. Order anything you want.

464
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,830
-Just order.
-Your treat.

465
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,480
Let’s have something delicious.

466
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,610
-I want two milk custards.
-It’s OK. Just order what you want.

467
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,140
OK.

468
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,030
-I want an ormosia milk custard.
-OK.

469
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,510
An ormosia milk custard, please.

470
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Monitor.

471
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,590
-Yes?
-I have something to say to you.

472
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,400
Go on.

473
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,880
I got the notification of final contest.

474
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,510
I can go to the winter holiday training
very soon.

475
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,510
Congratulations!

476
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,790
I’m waiting for the schedule.
I’ll go soon.

477
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,640
Then you can meet

478
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,830
a group of interesting people, right?

479
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,440
Can I ask for a present for

480
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,920
reaching the final contest from you?

481
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,270
Come on. It should be
after you win champion anyway.

482
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,640
You know I’ll win.

483
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,160
OK.

484
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,830
Well.

485
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,200
It’s my honor to prepare a present
for the champion.

486
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,240
What do you want?

487
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,200
It’s a secret now.

488
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,790
I’ll tell you in proper timing.

489
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,200
So mysterious.

490
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,110
OK.

491
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,400
But it should be within my ability.

492
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,480
Are you saying yes?

493
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,030
Right.

494
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:08,860
Hello.

495
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:12,070
A durian cake

496
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,350
for each of us, please.

497
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,070
OK.

498
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,790
Thanks.

499
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,000
Let’s go.

500
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,310
I want sweeten red bean paste
and lotus seeds. Have you ordered it?

501
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,030
Yes. And I add two mild custards,

502
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,960
and a durian cake for each one.

503
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
She just come to order.
And you still follow her.

504
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,830
I come to order for you
in case you’re hungry.

505
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,620
No need.

506
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,640
I like everything monitor orders for me.

507
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,640
You don’t eat what I order, right?

508
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,510
It must be monitor who ordered it.

509
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,270
Alright. Alright.

510
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,000
Well, let’s take a photo.

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
OK. OK.

512
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,590
Three.

513
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,480
Two.

514
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,350
One.

515
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,720
(Old Dreams)
Daily check. Look at the libeler.

516
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,840
(Secrets in Mind)
You must be an ugly and unpopular

517
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,830
miserable guy in school.

518
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,590
(A Lonely Shadow)
You slander him because you envy him.

519
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,740
(Flashing Time)
I’m warning to delete photos.

520
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,550
Don’t start rumors,

521
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,550
or I’ll sue you.

522
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,680
You’re such a nut. Don’t slander others.

523
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,790
(Message, ENT Xiaoba)
Hello.

524
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:28,400
Do you have any personal photos
of Ye Jingxi?

525
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,920
We’d like to buy them.

526
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,480
We want to reveal his true personality
to the public

527
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,270
and disclose his guise.

528
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,480
You don’t have to worry
about the curses,

529
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,440
right?

530
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:46,000
Can I stay here today, monitor?

531
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,310
He is so handsome in the camera.

532
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,030
And he’s so nice in life.

533
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,200
I like him so much.

534
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,830
Han Yayi.

535
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,240
When I saw him,

536
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,110
I feel like in a dream.

537
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,790
-Han Yayi.
-What?

538
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,550
I haven’t noticed
that you’re so sentimental.

539
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,480
How am I sentimental?

540
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,960
Never mind.

541
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,160
Yuan.

542
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:22,750
When do you plan to give
the cheongsam to Aunt?

543
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,030
Before she leaves.

544
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,310
She must be beautiful in this cheongsam.

545
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,270
A cheongsam requires
a good temperament.

546
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,480
The most important is
that she will like it.

547
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,750
You know what?

548
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,110
The cheongsam is similar to the one

549
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,200
my dad gave to her before.

550
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,000
Yuan.

551
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Let’s play a game.

552
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,310
What game?

553
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,920
I say someone’s name,

554
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,680
and you speak out your first impression
on this person immediately.

555
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,400
It’s not fun.

556
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,790
You haven’t played it.

557
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,480
Have a try. Just once.

558
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,160
Have a try. Just once.

559
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,510
OK. OK. Let’s try.

560
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,480
-I’ll start.
-OK.

561
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,000
Huang Yuan.

562
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,270
A fair lady.

563
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,420
Lin Chuan.

564
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,270
A good-for-nothing adviser.

565
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,310
A good-for-nothing adviser.

566
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:15,960
This is great.

567
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,750
Well. Yun Xiang.

568
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,000
Little angel.

569
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,960
Ye Jingxi.

570
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,790
Brother Bear.

571
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,750
Ning Zeyu.

572
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,030
A rebellious guy.

573
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,110
Rebellious.

574
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,030
-Ning Zeyu?
-Yes.

575
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,720
Think about it.

576
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,750
Though he looks quiet and docile,

577
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,590
he learnt programming secretly,

578
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,750
and ran away from home.

579
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,680
What a rebellious guy.

580
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,510
Well,

581
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,350
Li He.

582
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,960
A lovely huskie.

583
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,400
By lovely I mean

584
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,200
the diligent and clumsy sports students

585
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,920
look so cute and inspiring.

586
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,480
Inspiring.

587
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,680
Especially when they come
across difficult questions.

588
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,430
Right?

589
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,200
And that time when he put on
turtle costume, he was so cute.

590
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,310
Cute.

591
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,960
Yuan, you’re right.

592
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,310
But I think your perspective

593
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,880
is different from mine.

594
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,550
-And the details…
-Do I?

595
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,960
Yuan, you’re…

596
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
Han Yayi.

597
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,270
It’s your turn now.

598
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,750
I have only one question.

599
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,070
-Yuan. I was wrong.
-I have only one question.

600
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,240
-What do you think of Lin Chuan?
-Let me go. I was wrong.

601
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,850
What do you think of Lin Chuan?

602
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,440
Little hamster.

603
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,680
I want my mom.

604
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,110
Get up, superstar!

605
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,480
Get up, superstar!

606
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,790
Get up, superstar!

607
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,110
-Get up, superstar!
-I’m late.

608
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,350
Get up, superstar!

609
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
It’s winter holiday.

610
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,000
(Bawan)
A phone call, superstar!

611
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,440
A phone call, superstar!

612
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,880
A phone call, superstar!

613
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,400
A phone call, superstar!

614
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,830
A phone call, superstar!

615
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,160
Hello.

616
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,240
What’s up?

617
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,830
Well, Ms. Hua asked me to tell you,

618
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,920
pay attention to the admission information
of Haixing Conservatory of Music.

619
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,590
It’s so early. You…!

620
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,590
And,

621
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,920
Ms. Hua asked me to tell you…

622
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,240
He hung off?

623
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,640
Let me go check it.

624
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,150
OK.

625
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,160
Coming.

626
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,720
Bear. Why are you here?

627
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,830
I come to have a free meal.

628
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,110
You come at the right time.

629
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,070
Han Yayi.

630
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,110
Jingxi.

631
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,070
Sit here.

632
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,720
-Hello.
-Jingxi.

633
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,690
OK.

634
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,690
Hello.

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
The breakfast in your house is always
so sumptuous.

636
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,350
I’ll start.

637
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,160
OK.

638
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,920
Jingxi.

639
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,000
You don’t take carbohydrate, do you?

640
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,720
It’s breakfast.

641
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,440
It can be sumptuous.

642
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,350
This is delicious.

643
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,880
Well, Bear.

644
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,590
Are you coming for extra tutoring?

645
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,310
Yes.

646
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,400
The deadline of Haixing Conservatory
of Music is November.

647
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,160
I still have a period of time.

648
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,000
So,

649
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,270
I can prepare for the college
entrance examination and pro exam.

650
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,670
Yuan Caixi.

651
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,440
I’m wondering,

652
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,440
could you please…?

653
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,510
OK. OK.

654
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,510
My sister is

655
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,240
almost like

656
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,640
a professional tutor.

657
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,750
When can you tutor

658
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,830
your blood younger brother?

659
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,030
No problem.

660
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,240
You deserve it.

661
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,880
Caixi.

662
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
Well, don’t be

663
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,030
so cruel to your blood brother.

664
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,920
I know it’s not easy for Yuan Caixi.

665
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,830
But I just

666
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
want to study here.

667
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,720
Or I’ll idle the days away

668
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,440
at home by myself.

669
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,830
I’ll just study here.

670
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,720
No problem. Yuan.

671
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,000
I’m OK with it.

672
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
But how to deal with Ms. Hua.

673
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,420
Have you told her?

674
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,060
No problem.

675
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,350
She will agree with it.

676
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,590
Yuan Haoxi.

677
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,720
Why did you kick me?

678
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,510
Hurry up.

679
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,110
Last ten meters.

680
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,030
OK.

681
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,510
For pairs and stretch up.

682
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,960
You’ll have to run 400 meters.

683
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,590
400 meters!

684
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
Hurry up!

685
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,720
Put your phone away.

686
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,550
Tell Han Yayi,

687
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,680
the class will be over in half an hour.

688
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,640
Don’t worry.

689
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,160
Han Yayi said she won’t come.

690
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,510
What’s up?

691
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,400
Are you sad?

692
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,830
I’m fine.

693
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,240
I’m worrying about you.

694
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,510
(Send to Han Yayi)
Ye Jingxi is studying in Yuan’s house.

695
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,720
I won’t come to meet you.

696
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,720
It’s OK.

697
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,830
It will be over in half an hour.

698
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,480
Don’t worry.

699
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,550
Mr. Bai. I’ll go first.

700
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,830
Where are you going, Li He?

701
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,240
An emergency.

702
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,920
You guys,

703
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,310
50 leapfrogs for each one.

704
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,000
Leap high!

705
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,550
I’m going.

706
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,030
Bear.

707
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,680
Hello, Aunt.

708
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
You’re here.

709
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,590
Yes. Hello, Aunt. Hello, Aunt.

710
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,090
Have the breakfast.

711
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,160
I’m having it.

712
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,270
You packed up so quickly.

713
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,310
-Yes.
-Hold on for a second.

714
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,960
OK.

715
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,590
I’m going to attend the homecoming,

716
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,720
and have to take the train.

717
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,270
Be good at home.

718
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,310
OK.

719
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,240
Mom.

720
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,350
What’s this?

721
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,070
Just check it.

722
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,480
Is it for me?

723
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:45,980
Yes.

724
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,920
Do you remember

725
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,680
I talked about the bonus before?

726
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,720
I wanted to buy this cheongsam

727
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,750
with it.

728
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,790
See.

729
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,400
Is it similar to the one Dad gave you?

730
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,550
It’s almost the same.

731
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,960
Am I look beautiful?

732
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,070
Yes. Mom.

733
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
If you go to homecoming in it,

734
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,110
you classmates will believe
that you’ve travelled through time.

735
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,830
You haven’t changed in over a decade.

736
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,200
Mrs. Liu Yanan,
did you eat corrosion remover?

737
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,030
You’re so sweet.

738
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,240
Caixi.

739
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,790
Yes?

740
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,240
I do like it.

741
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,350
Thanks, my sweetheart.

742
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,790
Thanks.

743
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,310
I’ll go to the homecoming

744
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,440
in my new dress.

745
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,240
I fold it for you.

746
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,880
OK.

747
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,620
OK.

748
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,510
I’m going.

749
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,110
OK.

750
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,070
-Mom, let me see you out.
-Be good at home.

751
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,240
Yuan, let me see Aunt out.

752
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,350
Let’s go.

753
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,310
You’re also going?

754
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,590
Yes. Let me take it for you.

755
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,110
OK.

756
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,880
-We’re going. Bye-bye.
-Be good at home.

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,200
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye, Aunt.

758
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,920
See, how funny he is.

759
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,030
It’s so amusing.

760
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,400
He’s like our son.

761
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,000
He’s like me.

762
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,590
What’s wrong with you?

763
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,880
Sorry.

764
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,210
Come back.

765
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,480
Change your shoes.

766
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Change your shoes.

767
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,480
He. Have you finished training?

768
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,880
Dad, Mom, don’t wait for me
for dinner.

769
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,830
I’m going to study
in my classmate’s home.

770
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,680
What?

771
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,240
Where are you going?

772
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Have you finished training?

773
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,960
I go out to eat something.

774
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,240
-Oh.
-And you?

775
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,110
The training?

776
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,030
Yes.

777
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,240
Well,

778
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,350
Aunt…

779
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,200
Winter camp.

780
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,240
This is the only way.

781
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:44,750
Besides,

782
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,720
it’s not exactly a lie.

783
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,750
Training is one type of winter camp.

784
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,240
Don’t worry. It won’t affect my study.

785
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,000
But in my opinion,

786
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,160
Aunt will know it

787
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,350
sooner or later.

788
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,680
Think about it.

789
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,310
According to my experience,

790
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,680
Your dad and mom know it.

791
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,880
They’re just waiting
for you to tell them.

792
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,640
You’re not going out to eat, right?

793
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,550
How do you know?

794
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,320
It’s winter holiday.

795
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,710
Who would go to eat with a schoolbag?

796
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,510
I’ll go to monitor’s home.

797
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,880
I know it.

798
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,320
You’re easy to be seen through.

799
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,360
Come on.

800
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,230
Hope you can win the champion

801
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,550
after the training.

802
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,190
Don’t be so perky.

803
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,550
Though I’m not here,

804
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,070
I’ll chat with her every day.

805
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,840
If chatting works,

806
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,630
I’ll leave my running champion to you.

807
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,590
Anyway,

808
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,480
mind that guy.

809
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,440
Of course I know it.

810
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,840
What do you think I’m rushing for?

811
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,360
OK. Don’t worry too much.

812
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,030
Focus on your training.

813
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,110
We’re waiting for you to come back.

814
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,030
OK.

815
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,030
Happy holiday, everyone.

816
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,760
How’s it going? Do you miss me?

817
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,840
Why do you come here?

818
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,710
This is my question.
Why did you come here?

819
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,800
I came here to study.

820
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,760
I’m preparing for the examination
to Haixing Conservatory of Music.

821
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,110
I asked Yuan Caixi
to tutor me in holiday.

822
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,150
What a coincident.
I come here to study, too.

823
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,630
I’m preparing for the examination
for high-level athlete.

824
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,760
I also need tutoring.

825
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,480
You can just come to a tutoring class.

826
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,710
Why didn’t you come to a tutoring class?

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,070
You’re so annoying.

828
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,230
You’re annoying.

829
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,360
Both of you are annoying.

830
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,110
Have you asked me before?
You just come here for tutoring.

831
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,280
I have.

832
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,590
OK. Never.

833
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,590
I have, too.

834
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,670
When did you ask me?

835
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,920
Early before that.

836
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,920
When I treated you the drumsticks,

837
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,400
you promised to tutor me.

838
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,630
What?

839
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,280
Is your tutoring time-limited?

840
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,840
You don’t have to come to my house.

841
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,070
You’re so cheeky.

842
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,400
Cheeky or not doesn’t matter.

843
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,110
Monitor and exam matter.

844
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,360
Sorry. My phone is out of power.

845
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,800
Are you taking videos?

846
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,070
I’m telling you.
I have the portraiture right.

847
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:20,880
Give me your phone.

848
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,550
Taking photos secretly is immoral.

849
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,070
Give it to me.

850
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,710
Yuan Caixi. Yuan Caixi.
I’m your blood brother.

851
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,320
-Yuan Caixi.
-Give it to me.

852
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:26,920
What’s the password?

853
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,110
I forget it.

854
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,550
I give in.

855
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,510
My brain doesn’t work at all.

856
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,230
Those literary masters,

857
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,360
why didn’t they just go out
and enjoy lives?

858
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,760
Why did they write so many poems
and travel notes?

859
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,190
Wasn’t it tiring?

860
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,510
Don’t give up.

861
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,800
Just open up your test paper,

862
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:06,510
and do it.

863
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,150
Bear.

864
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,590
Are you mad?

865
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,550
What’s this?

866
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,190
Never mind. Have a sleep
and you’ll remember it.

867
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,550
I’m hungry.

868
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
So am I.

869
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Are you serious?

870
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,590
Writing test papers are
the easiest work in the world.

871
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,710
Why are you so exhausted?

872
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,550
Monitor.

873
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,880
Writing test papers is OK.

874
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,630
But don’t starve us.

875
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:51,840
Yes.

876
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,030
Look at the refrigerator,

877
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,670
it’s so empty.

878
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,110
Well. Are you using hands or mouth
to write test papers?

879
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,960
Brain activity requires physical power.

880
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,760
We have to eat something anyway.

881
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,360
Yuan Haoxi. Where’re you going?

882
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,760
Go to see a movie with my classmates.

883
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,960
You watch movies every day.

884
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,150
Don’t come. Stay at home and study.

885
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,190
Why?

886
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,920
Cuz I’m your elder sister.

887
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,760
And Mom asked me
to supervise your study.

888
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,440
Tell your classmates you won’t come

889
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,920
or you’ll lose your allowance.

890
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,670
For how much?

891
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,510
50.

892
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:31,800
100.

893
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:34,800
Caixi.

894
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,440
What’s your order?

895
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,440
What’s your order?

896
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,760
OK. OK.

897
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,400
I have a proposal.

898
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,630
Let’s cook something to eat.

899
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,590
I agree.

900
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,440
The refrigerator is empty.
What do we eat?

901
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,510
It’s easy.

902
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,880
Go buy something in the supermarket.

903
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,400
OK.

904
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,670
OK.

905
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,920
How about steaming a fish?

906
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,510
Why do we steam a fish?

907
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,480
The adults are absent
and we should eat junk food.

908
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,320
You don’t do exercises, right?

909
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,880
Don’t you know junk food is not good?

910
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,760
I don’t know.

911
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,920
What are you doing?

912
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,710
