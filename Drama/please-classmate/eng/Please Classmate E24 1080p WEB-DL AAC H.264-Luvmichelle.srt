00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,310
Hmm?

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:49,870
Give me your phone.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,590
My phone?

21
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,760
Yes.

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,150
I’ll download an app for you.

23
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,870
I developed it myself.

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,790
If you have something to tell me,

25
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,590
you can reach out to me on the app.

26
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,920
No. No need.

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
I can use QQ.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,430
No.

29
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,040
Done.

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,710
Impressive.

31
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,120
Zeyu, you’re indeed a genius.

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Well done.

33
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,910
That’s flattering.

34
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,840
There’s nothing special about this.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,310
It’s just a chat app.

36
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,750
The app’s name is my student number
when I was in grade 1 in senior high.

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,960
Thank you.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,590
You still remember that.

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,710
Of course, I do.

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,680
You’re forever No. 2.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,470
Yuan Caixi,

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,910
if you need to talk to me,

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
you can message me on this app.

44
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,150
When you message me,

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,360
I’ll definitely reply.

46
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,150
Moreover,

47
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,910
I wish you to be
the first user of this app.

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,070
Okay.

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,280
I accept it,

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,430
but as your classmate.

51
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,840
Can you

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,870
understand it?

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,750
Yes, I do.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,870
Go back.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,000
I’ll go now.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,630
I’ll go too.

57
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,300
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

58
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,470
We’ll do the transfer procedures
the day after tomorrow.

59
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,470
Don’t blame me.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It’s for your own good.

61
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,590
Yes, I know.

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,150
Zeyu,

63
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,960
if you don’t want to get transferred,

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,710
just tell mom and dad.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,910
It’s fine.

66
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,590
I have no objection.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,150
Zeyu, may I come in?

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,630
Come in, dad.

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,950
Have some water.

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,680
Thanks.

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Dad, what’s the matter?

72
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,870
Oh. Sit down.

73
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,070
Zeyu,

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,310
you can just tell us

75
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,040
what’s on your mind.

76
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,190
Dad knows that

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,720
our family’s education

78
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
is a bit too stern.

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,270
Dad, you usually talk
when we’re having dinner.

80
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,680
I can’t

81
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,390
eat a meal properly.

82
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Now, you suddenly came to my room.

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,480
I’m not used to this.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,270
Are you

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,040
mad at me?

86
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,390
I know you want what’s the best for me.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,720
Thanks, dad.

88
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
I’ll report to the new school
the day after tomorrow.

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,510
I want to go to bed now.

90
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,240
Oh.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,070
Then...

92
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,800
Fine.

93
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,140
(Qi Bangwei, Hematology Department,
Wanhe Hospital, Haiwen)

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,240
Caixi’s

95
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,390
hemoglobin concentration

96
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,600
is 65 grams per liter.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,510
She has

98
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,190
moderate anemia.

99
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,560
The average size of
her red blood cell is small

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,510
and her hemoglobin level

101
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,040
is low.

102
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,800
What does that mean?

103
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
It means that

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,270
your sister,

105
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,630
Caixi,

106
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,360
has iron deficiency anemia,

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
not leukemia.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Caixi.

109
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,800
You’re not ill.

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,190
-Thank you, Dr. Qi.
-I’m not...

111
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,120
No, I’m a little ill.

112
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,160
It’s not leukemia.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
Yuan Haoxi, it’s iron deficiency anemia.

114
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,070
-I was so scared.
-I was so freaked out.

115

Yuan Caixi.

116
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,630
I’m warning you.

117
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,680
From now on, when you feel sick,

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
you must tell me.

119
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,390
Bear it in mind, okay?

120
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,270
Okay.

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,950
Thank the doctor.

122
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,000
Doctor Qi.

123
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

124
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,600
In this case,

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
you can rest assured.

126
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,070
Caixi,

127
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,390
although it’s a false alarm,

128
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,070
this is your body’s
warning sign for you.

129
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,510
I know College Entrance Exam is close.

130
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,120
But you have to take enough rest.

131
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,190
Take care of your health.

132
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,240
-Okay. I get it.
-Do you get it?

133
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,600
Thank you, Dr. Qi.

134
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,870
I guess we should be leaving.

135
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,630
Okay.

136
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,310
Thank you, Dr. Qi.

137
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:12,800
Thank you.

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
-Take care.
-Bye, Dr. Qi.

139
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,780
Let’s go.

140
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,870
It’s time.

141
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,260
Something got into your eyes?

142
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,600
Listen! I’m so strong right now.

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,430
You’re so annoying.

144
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Look at this.

145
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,070
This looks just like you.

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,870
Like me?

147
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,390
Yuan!

148
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
Yuan, you’re back!

149
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,360
Han Yayi.

150
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,800
That’s enough. That’s enough.

151
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,950
I knew you’d be fine.

152
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,830
Monitor,

153
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,190
I misunderstood you before.

154
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,000
I’m sorry.

155
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
But it’s so good to see

156
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,430
that you’re all right.

157
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,700
That’s right.

158
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,950
Monitor, you’re so forgiving.

159
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,600
You won’t hold a grudge
against us, right?

160
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,070
Now, you’re fine.

161
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,160
Chief can stop worrying.

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
We can have a better time now.

163
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,360
Yes.

164
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,750
What?

165
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,160
You had a rough time before?

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,390
Maybe they did.

167
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,390
Li He.

168
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,800
Ay.

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,560
Caixi.

170
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Has the result come out?

171
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,310
How is it?

172
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,440
It’s such an important matter.

173
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,750
I was supposed to
tell the class teacher.

174
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,240
Miss Luo.

175
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,750
I’m sorry for

176
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,600
making you worry.

177
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,480
I’m fine.

178
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,510
It’s just average anemia.

179
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,790
It’s great that you’re fine.

180
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,320
Silly kid.

181
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Thank you, Miss Luo.

182
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,720
It’s great that you’re fine.

183
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,030
Han Yayi.

184
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,910
Wait.

185
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,790
Why is Zeyu absent?

186
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,030
He asked for a leave.

187
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,240
A leave?

188
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,030
He seems to have caught a cold.

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Or,

190
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,150
something happened in his family.

191
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,030
Brothers.

192
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,480
I’m in the race.

193
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,790
Someone got hurt and quit the game.

194
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,600
The one ranking behind him
will substitute for him.

195
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,870
So,

196
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,550
I can compete in the final next week.

197
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,630
Chief, I know you can do it.

198
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,720
Well done, Chief.

199
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,670
It’s time to take back

200
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,670
the trophy cup you lost.

201
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,550
I must take it back.

202
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,080
It’s good to be young.

203
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
Will you come next week?

204
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,440
Of course.

205
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,750
But this time,

206
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,910
you have no reason to lose.

207
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,630
The process of hard work
matters the most.

208
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,960
Don’t worry.

209
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,320
As long as you’re there,

210
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,000
I can definitely win.

211
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,840
It’s time for class.

212
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,000
Go back.

213
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,550
Shh.

214
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,740
(You have a new message)

215
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,100
(Yuan Caixi)

216
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,870
It was a false alarm.
It’s worth a celebration.

217
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,720
Let’s meet at the barbecue place
tonight at 6:30 PM.

218
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,000
As long as you’re fine.

219
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,940
(Transfer Application)

220
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,870
It’s so sweet.

221
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,480
Here’s Chief.

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,390
Here’s the meat I ordered for you.

223
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,150
Thank you, Yun Xiang.

224
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,270
Did anyone see Zeyu?

225
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,670
I saw him.

226
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,080
But he went elsewhere.

227
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,790
Elsewhere?

228
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,120
He didn’t come here with you?

229
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,000
No.

230
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
And seems that there’s
something on his mind.

231
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,820
(Zeyu
Where are you?)

232
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,750
I texted him.

233
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,630
But he didn’t reply.

234
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,910
Did he reply to you?

235
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,750
No.

236
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,320
What’s going on with him recently?

237
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,600
I don’t know.

238
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,060
(Ning Zeyu)

239
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,870
What is this app?

240
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,910
Zeyu installed it for me last time.

241
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,790
He said I could contact him on it.

242
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,550
Oh.

243
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,780

No one should miss out.

246
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,750
Seems that you need to get used to that.

247
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,870
My mom has already decided to
transfer me to another school.

248
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,480

with your dad.

00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Sort out your stuff

267
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,080
and come here fast.

268
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,200
Okay.

269
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,600
There won’t be

270
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,910
so many bad students in the new school.

271
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,240
You can focus on your study.

272
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,360
Come home early

273
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,550
after school.

274
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,720
If you have any questions,

275
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,000
you can turn to online courses.

276
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,960
Zeyu!

277
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,240
Zeyu, look here!

No one should miss out)

279
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,020
(Never say goodbye)

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,500

Miss Luo.

282
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,870
What’s going on?

283
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,360
You should ask monitor.

284
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Ah! Li He.

285
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,030
Transfer to another school?

286
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,480
Ning Zeyu’s mom will transfer him to

287
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
No. 2 Experimental
Middle School tomorrow.

288
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
Again?

289
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,000
This aunt is so tough-willed.

290
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,360
It’s inappropriate for Ning Zeyu

291
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,670
to transfer at this moment, Yuan?

292
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
No matter what, we need to stop him.

293
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,000
Let’s figure out a way.

294
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,270
Mmm.

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,320
So,

296
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,600
you made these overnight?

297
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Yes.

298
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,600
It’s Chuan’s idea.

299
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,510
Yesterday

300
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,030
you didn’t reply my message.

301
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,110
I thought

302
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,240
you guys didn’t care.

303
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,590
How’s that possible?

304
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,830
We were busy making plans.

305
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,550
You made such a big scene

306
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,110
over this trivial event.

307
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,310
It’s so embarrassing.

308
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:21,790
Zeyu,

309
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,830
let’s go back.

310
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,750
Let’s not transfer him.

311
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,270
How’s that possible?

312
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,200
We’ve made the decision.

313
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,000
Mrs. Ning.

314
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,270
I have to apologize to you.

315
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,240
As his class teacher,

316
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,590
I must have made a lot of mistakes,

317
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,000
which has made you dissatisfied

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,830
and worried.

319
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,790
But

320
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,440
even if you don’t trust me,

321
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,510
you should trust Zeyu.

322
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,590
Ever since I’m his class teacher,

323
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,160
he never lets me down.

324
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,160
That’s because

325
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
he has never lied to you.

326
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Which kid has never lied before?

327
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,790
Kids like them are in the age

328
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,000
when they’re the most confused.

329
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,960
They seem to have grown up.

330
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,680
But deep down,
they’re still overwhelmed.

331
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,830
The only thing we can do right now

332
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,000
is make them

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,790
more confident.

334
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,350
Make them understand that

335
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,310
their mistakes

336
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,240
can be forgiven.

337
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,790
He needs to pay for his mistakes.

338
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,310
I need to teach him

339
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,640
what accountability is.

340
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,400
-This is what I need to teach him.
-Yes.

341
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,110
When a kid lies,

342
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,400
the parents need to
take unshakable accountability too.

343
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
We should assume
the responsibility together.

344
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,400
Mrs. Ning.

345
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,880
I sincerely suggest you

346
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,640
not transfer Zeyu at this point.

347
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,790
Or it will do him no good.

348
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,240
Aunt.

349
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,000
You know that

350
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,270
Zeyu has always been the No. 1 student

351
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,480
in our grade.

352
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,590
He was the No. 1 in the past

353
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,510
and he will still be in the future.

354
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,920
I think you don’t have to worry about

355
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,640
other factors affecting his study.

356
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,400
Please let him stay.

357
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,000
You don’t make me worried, of course.

358
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,720
But some people

359
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,830
make me worried.

360
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,070
Aunt.

361
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,640
Do you really think

362
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,110
changing an environment

363
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,240
can enable Ning Zeyu

364
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
to study without any distraction?

365
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,920
I think it won’t work.

366
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,550
Let me give you an example.

367
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,790
Ning Zeyu and I have been neighbors

368
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,270
for 18 years.

369
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,680
I haven’t changed a bit.

370
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,310
Go. Go. Let’s go home.

371
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,270
Mom, I’m not going.

372
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,480
I was wrong for lying.

373
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,720
I apologize.

374
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
But I really want to learn programming.

375
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,030
Tiangong University of Science
and Technology is a good university.

376
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,920
Programming isn’t playing games
like you think it is.

377
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,510
Mom, can you support me this time?

378
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880

384
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,240

412
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,880

you were the worst students
I had ever taught.

-No need.
-What do you think?

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,480
What are you thinking about?

488
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,240
I was thinking

489
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
maybe it’s great not to
wake up from this dream.

490
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,000
No, that’s not good.

491

Has he received the message?

605
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,680
He should have received it,

606
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,310
right?

607
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It’s hard to tell.

608
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,400
Considering Li He’s personality,

609
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,440
I guess he might not know what it means
even if he has received it.

610
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,640
He’s not that foolish,

611
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,790
is he?

612
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,830
Here’s a message from Lin Chuan.

613
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,750
He said he’s with Li He.

614
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,640
They might be on their way
to solve the puzzle.

615
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,160
Can your Chuan

616
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,200
do it?

617
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,480
I guess not.

618
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,030
Is it really that hard?

619
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,830
It’s already so simple.

620
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,790
You find it simple,

621
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,030
but others might not.

622
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,920
But there’s one person

623
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,240
who can solve your puzzle.

624
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,550
Chief.

625
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,550
You called us here in a hurry

626
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,400
just to look at this envelop?

627
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,110
Monitor gave Chief this.

628
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,030
Open and take a look.

629
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,000
(Aunt has a waist pain on Saturday.
Aunt chats but doesn’t dance.)

630
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,920
Aunt has a waist pain on Saturday.

631
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,310
Aunt chats but doesn’t dance.

632
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,110
What does this mean?

633
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,400
Aunt has a waist pain on Saturday.

634
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,190
Aunt chats but doesn’t dance.

635
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,590
It’s the same thing even if
you read it a thousand times.

636
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,880
How can you know the answer?

637
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,920
Chief.

638
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,440
Hmm?

639
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,880
Monitor gave you a puzzle.

640
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,230
Yes.

641
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,440
But the point is I just don’t get it.

642
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,360
Besides the word Saturday.

643
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,840
Monitor is so cute.

644
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,480
What do you think of it?

645
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,550
I made some simple deduction.

646
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,590
I think the word “waist pain”

647
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,590
is homophonic to another word.

648
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,230
Waist pain.

649
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,960
One. Three.

650
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,280
13.

651
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,880
It should mean

652
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,400
1:00 PM.

653
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,510
How about the rest?

654
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,150
Aunt doesn’t dance…

655
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,440
I don’t know the meaning of that then.

656
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,590
Chief.

657
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,230
Hmm?

658
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,030
I think we should ask

659
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,840
Ning Zeyu about that.

660
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,480
Are you out of your mind?

661
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,670
No, I won’t.

662
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:09,840
Chief.

663
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,510
Is the puzzle more important

664
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,630
or your self-esteem?

665
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,280
That’s right.

666
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,800
That’s right, Chief.
Just make a compromise.

667
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
He has always been the smart one anyway.

668
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
No, I don’t care.

669
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,590
It can’t be him.

670
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,840
What are you doing?

671
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,630
Give it back to me.

672
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,920
You can’t solve such an easy puzzle?

673
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,030
I did this for you, Chief.

674
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,070
Who told you I can’t solve it?

675
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,150
Give it to me.

676
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,060
Fine.

677
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,800
You mean you don’t need me then.

678
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,920
Then, I’ll leave.

679
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,960
Wait, wait, wait.

680
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,880
You mean you’ve figured out

681
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,710
the answer to this puzzle?

682
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,840
Let’s say the answer together.

683
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,510
I’ll check if yours is correct.

684
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,510
How about this?

685
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,920
You just pretend
I don’t know the answer.

686
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,030
Chief.

687
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,280
Your self-esteem and monitor.
Which is more important?

688
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,400
Fine.

689
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,760
I don’t know the answer to the puzzle.

690
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,960
Tell me.

691
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:26,960
Call me dad.

692
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,590
What?

693
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,670
Call me dad.

694
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,920
Jiang Yuan.

695
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,960
Fine. Wait.

696
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,710
Listen!

697
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,480
Don’t be too pushy.

698
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,150
Hurry. Time is precious.

699
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,840
What on earth do you want?

700
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,440
How about this?

701
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,000
Call me

702
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,550
Zeyu Oppa.

703
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,550
That will do.

704
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,880
Zeyu Oppa.

705
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,800
Good boy.

706
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,020
Okay.

707
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,550
Let Zeyu Oppa tell you the answer.

708
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:40,960
One three.

709
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,510
The first half indeed means
1:00 PM, Saturday.

710
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,800
The key point is the meaning of
“Aunt chats but doesn’t dance.”

711
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,000
What does that mean?

712
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,280
Aunts like to dance in a square,
don’t they?

713
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,400
What else do they like besides dancing?

714
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,510
They like gossiping.

715
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,760
Their mouths are all like loudspeakers.

716
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,230
The radio station!

717
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,150
He really can’t solve it?

718
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,360
Hi.

719
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,550
There you are.

720
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,280
You figured out the answer?

721
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,440
Of course,

722
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,590
not.

723
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,760
Monitor,

724
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,110
don’t give me puzzles anymore.

725
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,800
It’s quite tiring.

726
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,300
Okay.

727
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,030
No more puzzles.

728
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,760
Why did you ask me to come here?

729
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,190
Don’t you think that

730
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,670
this place means a lot

731
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,710
to both of us?

732
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,840
Why should the brochures
for athletic students

733
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,190
be written by students
from the Northern Campus?

734
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,970
♪Achoo I sneezed♪

735
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,190
♪I’m not thinking of you secretly♪

736
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,260
♪Your insolence overwhelms my calmness♪

737
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,760
♪I don’t want to get close to you♪

738
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,480
I really didn’t expect that

739
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,630
we would get to be together

740
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,320
and we would
be through a lot afterwards.

741
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,000
First, the mergence of our classes.

742
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
Then the fire accident in the lab.

743
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,480
Then the relay race.

744
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,840
And you were wrongfully accused
of cheating.

745
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,440
Later,

746
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,320
I met Bear.

747
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,070
And

748
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,320
we were involved in that gossip.

749
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,320
