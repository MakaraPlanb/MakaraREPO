(Ye Jingxi’s idol love scandal)

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,070
Coming.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,950
Ah! Why are you here, Ms. Hua?

20
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,950
I’ve brought you fans’ letters.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
Let me get you some water.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
Look. So many letters.

23
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
So many letters?

24
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,840
The semester begins tomorrow.
Are you prepared?

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
Yes, I am.

26
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,080
Ms. Hua. Take a look at this letter.

27
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,000
This fan wrote,

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,150
dear Jingxi,

29
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,760
since fans call themselves watermelons,

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,030
whenever I eat watermelon,

31
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,000
I feel I’m eating another one
of your fans.

32
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,960
So to live up to their sacrifice,

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,190
I invented various ways to
eat watermelons.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,520
Watermelon sashimi. Watermelon broth.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,470
Watermelon salad.

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,030
These show my fans’ love for me.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,870
I need to reply to all of them.

38
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,520
Why don’t we host an event
to express your gratitude?

39
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,630
Don’t rush to disagree.

40
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,310
Look.

41
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,520
This incident changed

42
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,400
so many people’s views about you.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
At this point,

44
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,400
your attitude is important.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,840
Let’s host a return banquet to

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,080
show the fans that you care about them.

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
But isn’t it better if

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,400
I reply to their letters personally?

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,630
Besides,

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
throwing a return banquet now
may make people feel that

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
I’m taking advantage of the event

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,630
to gain attention and advertise myself.

53
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,520
I don’t like it.

54
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,400
Well.

55
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,000
You have good intentions,
while my eyes are on money.

56
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,310
All I want is to help you gain more fans

57
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,750
and get more popular.

58
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,430
Ms. Hua.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,560
I know you only want what’s good for me.

60
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,710
But after this incident,

61
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
I start to realize that

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,120
I’m not worthy of their affection.

63
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,680
My fans support me unreservedly.

64
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,590
I should work harder too.

65
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:40,800
Yuan.

66
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,030
Ning Zeyu.

67
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,750
Li He.

68
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,190
They are all pursuing their dreams.

69
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,030
So, I think...

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,710
Me.

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,590
The popular idol, Ye Jingxi

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
will study from today on.

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
I’ll prepare for College Entrance Exam.

74
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,000
And I’ll prepare for
the music major’s test.

75
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
I’ll get into
Haixing Conservatory of Music

76
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,870
and become a professional music producer

77
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,150
to repay their affection.

78
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
Actually,

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,430
you can consider

80
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,240
studying abroad.

81
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,360
Haixing Conservatory of Music
is a good school.

82
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,630
But its courses are more about
classic music theories.

83
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,510
I don’t think
that’s the right school for you.

84
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,120
Look.

85
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,120
This is the school I asked them
to investigate.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,510
Austria Lakeside Music School.

87
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,310
I think this is the right school for you
considering all the factors.

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,950
Ms. Hua.

89
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,000
I know.

90
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,120
You don’t want to part
with your friends.

91
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,430
But, Jingxi.

92
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,680
Like what you’ve just said,

93
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,120
your friends are all
fighting for their dreams.

94
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,870
They should be your source of power.

95
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,870
I wish you can make the decision

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,040
after you’ve thought about it carefully.

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,630
In this case, you won’t have regrets.

98
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,950
Fine.

99
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,430
Think about it first.

100
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,360
-Okay.
-I’ll go for now.

101
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,310
Let me walk you out.

102
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,070
Ms. Hua, bye.

103
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,270
Take care.

104
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,360
You wish to be a better self
for your friends and fans.

105
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,630
Then, you must aspire higher.

106
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,160
Find the career that’s suitable for you.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
Real friendships

108
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,830
won’t be defeated by time and distance.

109
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,560
Yuan.

110
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,070
You’ve already made the decision, right?

111
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,310
Caixi.

112
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,390
Soy milk and deep-fried dough,
or milk and bread?

113
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,600
This.

114
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,510
You always choose milk and bread, right?

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,830
I’ve had too much of it.
I want a change of flavor.

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,190
Women.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,560
You’re so capricious.

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,800
You need new spirits
in the new semester.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Boys, straighten up!

120
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,310
Lin Qiang.

121
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,190
You didn’t do well in chemistry
last semester.

122
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,120
You’re also responsibly for
my chemistry performance?

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,120
I’m in charge of all your subjects
before your graduation.

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
Okay, Mr. Ma.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,870
Hello.

126
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,430
Hello.

127
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,430
Hello.

128
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,160
Hello.

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,660
Hello.

130
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay. Great.

131
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,510
Come on.

132
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,480
Yuan Haoxi.

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
Have you finished your homework?
I made one copy for you.

134
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Really?

135
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,070
Thanks.

136
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,560
You’re such a nice girl.

137
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,360
Don’t you have hands yourself?

138
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,560
Miss.

139
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,070
Please let him do his own tests.

140
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,800
Go back to class.

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,560
What’s going on?

142
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,430
What are you doing?

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,430
Yuan Haoxi.

144
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,360
Are you free this weekend?
Let’s go for a movie.

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
-Of course.
-No. He’s not available.

146
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,560
It’s Grade 2 now.

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,630
Go back to class.

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,040
Okay.

149
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,040
What’s your problem?

150
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,950
Yuan Haoxi, what’s your problem?

151
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,950
You’re in Grade 2.
You’ll be in Grade 3 next year.

152
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,240
You don’t know it yourself?

153
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,750
No food in class.
Don’t play with your phones.

154
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,870
Listen to classes attentively!
Do you get it?

155
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,270
I’m not in Grade 3 yet.

156
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,040
That’s the same.

157
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,510
So odd.

158
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,040
Hello, Jingxi.

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,510
Hello.

160
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,680
It’s been a winter vocation.

161
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
But you’re still so handsome.

162
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,160
You still have so many fans.

163
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,120
No wonder he’s my idol.

164
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,870
Do you know that

165
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,800
I wrote an anonymous fan letter?

166
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,950
Anonymous?

167
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,480
Yes, I get to see Jingxi every day.

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,870
If he knows it’s me, it’ll be awkward.

169
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,870
Wow, Han Yayi,
does Lin Chuan know what you did?

170
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,830
-He can only know from you.
-Caixi.

171
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,870
-Good morning.
-Yuan.

172
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,870
Caixi, now’s the new semester.

173
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,040
I’ll be No.1 again.

174
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,070
I won’t let that happen.

175
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,830
Can we have a better chat
at the beginning of the semester?

176
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,720
Caixi, in this new semester,

177
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,600
I’ll protect you.

178
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Yuan.

179
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,750
Yes.

180
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,310
Nothing. It’s just great
to see you again.

181
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,430
We see each other every day.

182
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,870
Can you let me copy
your math homework?

183
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,840
I have English homework.
Do you want that?

184
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,030
Ah. Give me your English homework.

185
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,910
I can lend it to you.
But you have to promise me.

186
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,270
You’ll never copy my homework again.

187
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Chuan, you’re so mean.

188
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,550
I’ll tell Han Yayi that you like her.

189
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,720
Dare you threaten me!

190
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,910
Here. Take it.

191
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,000
Just my homework.

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,790
How dare you

193
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,120
tell Han Yayi!

194
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,150
You had a better one than me.
My mom hired a tutor for me.

195
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,000
I had five hours’ classes every day.

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
Where have you been
in the winter vocation?

197
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,480
My mom and dad took me to Heihujiang.

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,030
That’s the first time I saw snow.

199
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,840
Zeyu.

200
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,910
Have you done your English homework?

201
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,080
I want to check my answer with you.

202
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,750
I don’t have to do that.

203
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,000
Good morning.

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,670
Stand up.

205
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,510
-Good morning, teacher.
-Good morning, teacher.

206
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,550
Sit down please.

207
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,200
Today is the first day of this semester.

208
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,360
I have something to tell you.

209
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,870
Pan Hao has transferred
to another school.

210
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,910
I won’t elaborate on the reasons.

211
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,080
But I have to warn you.

212
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,200
There is less than half of a year left
before the college entrance exam.

213
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,480
Your future is a new start
that’s full of hope.

214
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,720
It’s also a start of hard work.

215
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,790
The next few months are very important.

216
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,080
So I wish you can put
aside the things that

217
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,240
aren’t related
to the college entrance exam.

218
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,870
These few months pass by so quickly.

219
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,720
Let’s all bite the bullet and work hard.

220
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,440
Okay?

221
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

222
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,790
Let’s open the book.

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,240
Page 49.

224
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,240
Read the poem with me.

225
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,380
(Class 2, Grade 3)

226
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
You’re looking for me?

227
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,840
Another gossip?

228
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
Someone tipped you off again?

229
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,150
They’re investigating my identity again?

230
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,240
No.

231
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,000
This incident is over now.

232
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,910
Stop thinking about all day.

233
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,550
It’s fine.

234
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,150
Why are you being so mysterious then?

235
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,790
Yuan.

236
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
I have a question for you.

237
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,030
Answer it truthfully.

238
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,440
Listen.

239
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,080
If you have the chance to go abroad now,

240
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,320
will you go?

241
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,440
Go abroad?

242
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,790
I’ve never thought about it.

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,910
Besides, I’ll have college entrance exam
next semester.

244
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,510
I don’t want to go.

245
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,960
If you can study abroad?

246
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,360
Study abroad?

247
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,870
That’s even less possible.

248
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,480
You know that my family situation
won’t allow that.

249
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,360
Besides, I’d be worried if I leave
my mom and brother behind.

250
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
If you can set those aside?

251
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,600
If you don’t have to think about others?

252
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,550
Just ask yourself.

253
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Do you want to go?

254
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,670
I’ve never thought about that.

255
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,840
Then think carefully.

256
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,240
Tell me when you’ve made the decision.

257
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,600
Wow.

258
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,750
Wait a second.

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,870
Why are you being so weird today?

260
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,550
If you don’t know where to go,
you can check on the European schools.

261
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
There are many good
finance colleges in Europe.

262
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,840
You can do some research.

263
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
Think about it.

264
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,870
Europe?

265
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,750
The fifteenth Haiwen
Junior Championships.

266
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,150
I don’t have to reiterate
the importance of this match, right?

267
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,440
This is city level competitions.

268
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,870
The preliminaries will be hosted
next week.

269
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,270
If you have good performance,

270
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,670
get into the final, and get into top 3,

271
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,720
you can apply for
national second level athlete.

272
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes.

273
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
If you become
national second level athlete,

274
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
you can apply for the test
of high level athletes.

275
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,320
Are you prepared?

276
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
Chief is surely ready!

277
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,030
He’s been in so many competitions.

278
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,240
This is just a piece of cake.

279
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,960
This will decide whether
Chief can be qualified as

280
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,080
national second level athlete.

281
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,150
This isn’t just an average test.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I’m asking you, Li He.

283
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,150
Are you confident?

284
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,840
I...

285
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,600
Who am I?

286
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,790
I’m Li He.

287
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,390
I’m the race champion of
the city-level competition.

288
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,670
I can do it.

289
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
This kid.

290
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,630
He’s even boasting himself
before we start to.

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,080
Don’t worry about him.

292
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
I’ll work hard.

293
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,910
If you have the chance to go abroad now,

294
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,870
will you go?

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,840
Go abroad?

296
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,550
Where?

297
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,510
Come down, Yuan Caixi.

298
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,790
Wait a second.

299
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,870
Slow down.
Li He, where are you taking me to?

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
Hurry!

301
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,840
I’m warning you.
If you keep on doing this,

302
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,870

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,200
Do you really think
I’m so strict with you?

372
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,240
I’m not that strict.

373
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,680
Caixi.

374
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,590
Mom.

375
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,480
You’re willing to come back?

376
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,350
Am I talking to you?

377
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,640
What are you looking at?

378
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,030
Mrs. Yuan is talking about

379
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,960
her sweet honeymoon story with Mr. Yuan.

380
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,310
Oh my god.

381
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
This photo must be over 20 years old.

382
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,830
This is from 18 years ago.

383
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,200
This is my favorite one.

384
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,750
We just got married at that time.

385
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,110
Now I look back on that time.

386
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,720
We were so poor back then.

387
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,550
I originally told him that

388
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,350
we could just have a trip in China.

389
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,750
But you dad just didn’t agree.

390
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,750
He insisted on taking me
to another country.

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,640
I was really so worried.

392
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
We really racked our brains.

393
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
Finally,

394
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
we decided to go to Thailand.

395
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,960
Why?

396
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,720
Well.

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,790
It was so cheap.

398
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,510
We spent five days in Thailand.

399
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,030
We spent too much time
in the swimming pool.

400
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
But we still didn’t wanna leave.

401
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,000
We just enjoyed food every day.

402
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,510
We had fun.

403
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,110
We wandered around.

404
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,200
It was such an amazing experience.

405
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,000
I was so happy.

406
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,200
Why didn’t we get married earlier?

407
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,270
Mom.

408
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,400
Do you want to visit Thailand again?

409
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,750
No.

410
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,920
Why?

411
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,790
Because I’ve already seen

412
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,270
the best views.

413
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,680
Jingxi.

414
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,750
Why are you here?

415
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,310
Are you working overtime?

416
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,960
Yes.

417
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,920
Thank you.

418
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,200
Jingxi,

419
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,400
you’re here just to give me
the midnight snacks?

420
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,640
Ms. Hua told me about
the return banquet for fans.

421
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,720
I know you refused it.

422
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,960
I’ve decided to host it.

423
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,200
Why do you suddenly change your opinion?

424
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,680
You’ll know when you see it.

425
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
I’ve made the decision.

426
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,750
I’ll take my chance.

427
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:34,960
Ah?

428
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,790
I’ll go now.

429
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
You’ll leave now?

430
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,480
Jingxi.

431
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,070
I don’t understand any of it.

432
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,820
(File)

433
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,620
(Jingxi, our beloved idol)

434
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:54,940
(Jingxi, our beloved idol
Concert The Crazy Night)

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Ms. Hua found me
the best school in Europe.

436
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,750
I’ll study abroad soon.

437
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,590
Before I go,

438
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,000
I want to take the leap of faith
for myself.

439
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,000
I’ll host the return banquet.

440
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,030
And I’ll take this chance to tell Yuan

441
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,000
the words from the depth of my heart.

442
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,510
(Bawan)
Jingxi, I get it. But honestly,

443
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,960
I’m 99 percent sure that you’ll fail.

444
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,310
(Ye Jingxi)

445
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,400
There’s one percent chance then.

446
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,480
Jingxi,

447
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,750
why do you become a fool
when it’s about Yuan Caixi?

448
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,160
I was just comforting you when
I said you have one percent chance.

449
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,830
Jingxi, think it through.
Don’t cry by then.

450
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,510
Maybe,

451
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,440
I just want to give myself
a reason to give up.

452
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,960
Did you do the second question
of the test?

453
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,440
Han Yayi.

454
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,240
You’re playing on your phone already?

455
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,310
Take it. Finish it soon.

456
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,030
What’s it?

457
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,440
My idol, Jingxi will host
a return banquet soon.

458
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,680
I told you not to call him your idol.

459
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,720
Jingxi, our beloved idol.

460
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,070
Ye Jingxi 2020 concert.

461
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,000
Well done.

462
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,270
It looks so well-designed.

463
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,220
(Jingxi, our beloved idol
Concert 2020 The Crazy Night)

464
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,830
How’s it?

465
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,550
You’ve all received it?

466
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,880
Yes.

467
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
How could we miss it
when you’ve reminded us all?

468
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,550
But, Bear,

469
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,030
the first mock test will come soon.
Can we...?

470
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,680
No.

471
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,680
It must be now.

472
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,790
Why now?

473
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,270
Why can it be a week later?

474
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,270
Why in such a hurry?

475
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,480
Why?

476
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,070
Because my fans miss me.

477
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,000
If I keep them waiting any longer,

478
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,920
they’d go mad.

479
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,790
Your fans can’t wait?

480
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,830
Do your fans know that
you’re so conceited?

481
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,440
Yuan.

482
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,750
You must come.

483
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,640
But, Bear,

484
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,440
the time I spent before
the first mock test...

485
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,270
Yuan Caixi.

486
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,830
Promise me.

487
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,110
You must come.

488
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
Okay.

489
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
Since you’re calling me by my full name,

490
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,590
I must come then.

491
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,750
Yuan Caixi?

492
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,000
This isn’t right.

493
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,240
That’s not good enough.

494
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,750
Your performance is above average now.

495
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,960
But this can’t ensure your championship.

496
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,920
Don’t be upset.

497
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,270
If you outperform yourself,

498
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,160
you can be qualified as
second level athlete.

499
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,720
Then, I shall work harder.

500
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,440
Bai.

501
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,200
Should I...?

502
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,400
I must be qualified as

503
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,920
second level athlete.

504
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,790
From next week on,

505
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,510
no matter how tough the training is,

506
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,720
I can take it.

507
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,590
Good kid.

508
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,030
You didn’t let me down.

509
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Let me do another lapse.

510
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,110
Go.

511
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,960
Mom, you didn’t go out?

512
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,270
Ah.

513
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,240
The meeting was canceled.

514
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
I’ll go out.

515
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:42,200
Wait.

516
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
Where are you going?

517
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,790
I promise to go to a performance
with friends.

518
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
A performance?

519
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,380
Yes.

520
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,550
Who will go with you?

521
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,480
There are only three months left
before college entrance exam.

522
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,110
You’re still thinking about a concert?

523
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,270
Isn’t it about the star in your class?

524
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,640
I’ll come back in no time.

525
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
I’ll be home in less than three hours.

526
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,790
No.

527
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,880
Mom.

528
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:07,550
Everyone in the class will go.
And he’s my good friend.

529
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,830
You mustn’t go.

530
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,790
Go back to your room and study.

531
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,030
After your college entrance exam,

532
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,920
you can do whatever you want.
I won’t stop you.

533
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,310
(Sent to Class 2 Grade 3’s Group Chat)

534
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,160
Sorry. Something came up in my family.

535
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,680
I can’t go to the return banquet.

536
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Have fun.

537
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,350
Caixi, come on.

538
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,130
Hurry.

539
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,700
Hurry up!

540
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,750
Take a photo for me.

541
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,200
-Why? You get to see him every day.
-Hurry up.

542
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,270
Come on. One. Two. Three.

543
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
Take a look.

544
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,920
Yes. Here.

545
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,880
Take it vertically.

546
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,200
-Vertical.
-Yes.

547
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,720
Cool.

548
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,110
He’s indeed a star.

549
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,310
Where’s Li He?

550
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,880
He said he can’t come today.

551
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,480
Stop the chitchat. Hurry.

552
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,030
The performance is about to start.

553
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,550
Can you be less obsessed with him?

554
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,980
(Ye Jingxi)

555
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,400
My watermelons, do you miss me?

556
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,440
Yes.

557
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,160
First, I have to thank

558
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,790
my friends at Sen Yong,
Class 2, Grade 3.

559
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,790
Your accompany

560
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,240
gave me a joyful year in Grade 3.

561
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,920
And I spent the year
of my 19 years old happily.

562
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,920
Moreover,

563
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,240
I have some words

564
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,350
for a particular person.

565
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,160
When we were kids,

566
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,680
you thought I always protected you.

567
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,640
But actually,

568
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,790
when everyone thought

569
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,480
I was fat and silly and despised me,

570
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,590
you were the only one who was
there for me and encouraged me.

571
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,440
You made me confident.

572
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:21,510
You made me realize what I want.

573
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,160
You gave me courage

574
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,200
and confidence to pursue my dreams.

575
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,200
So,

576
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:36,550
please allow me to be willful
for the last time.

577
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,000
Let me fight for myself.

Chief! Bad news!

Ye Jingxi did something great this time.
Come to the return banquet now!

Where are you going?

637
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,480
I have to win her over.

638
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:10,220
(The secret we know)

639
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,880
You’re right.

640
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,110
I failed.

641
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,760
Let’s go, Jingxi.

642
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,400
She won’t come back.

643
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,630
Since I’ll say farewell,

644
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,670
I’ll definitely say it to her
face to face.

645
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,960
I listened to the song. It’s great.

646
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,800
But you’re not the Yuan
I used to know.

647
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,840
Yes.

648
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,960
I’ve grown up.

649
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,190
You’ve also become a super star, right?

650
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,880
Can we go back to the old time?

651
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,590
Go back?

652
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,630
Why should we?

653
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,030
We’re all heading
to the right direction.

654
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,960
Why should we go back?

655
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,590
But I miss

656
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,400
-I...
-Hear me out.

657
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,400
Ms. Hua

658
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,510
found me the best music school abroad.

659
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,110
I’m going abroad.

660
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,400
So, Yuan,

661
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,800
have you made up your mind?

662
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,190
Do you want to study abroad with me?

663
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,440
I know you’ll say no.

664
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,670
But I think

665
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,510
it’s worth trying.

666
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,800
There are many schools in Europe.

667
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,550
We can study together.
You don’t have to worry about tuition.

668
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,880
I can take care of that.
Besides, we can...

669
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,630
Bear.

670
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,280
Though I want to go
to a good university,

671
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,760
I want to earn more money,

672
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,840
I don’t want to leave my family.

673
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:54,880
Bear.

674
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,440
Let me tell you a story.

675
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,440
When my mom and dad got married,

676
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,670
they spent the honeymoon in Thailand.

677
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,550
So, a few days ago, I asked her

678
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,670
whether she wants to
visit Thailand again.

679
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,280
She said no.

680
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I asked her why.

681
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,320
She said it’s because

682
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,360
she’s already seen the best views.

683
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,960
So what’s important isn’t where.

684
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,760
Rather, it’s whom I’m with.

685
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,840
So,

686
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,190
I’m not the one

687
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,070
that you want to be with.

688
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,070
Bear, you have a bright future.

Why are you all looking at me like this?

741
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,710
Ye Jingxi confessed. I know.

742
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,480
Then? How about Yuan Caixi?

743
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,840
Just talk to me.

744
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,550
Chief.

745
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,840
You might be late.

746
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,670
Jingxi just played a song for Yuan
before everyone.

747
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,670
It’s a song specially written for her.

748
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,710
She can’t resist such romance.

749
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,030
He just played the piano.

750
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,030
How can she not resist it?

751
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,110
-Chief.
-Li He.

752
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:20,670
-Move.
-Li He.

753
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,960
Why are you so late?

754
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,510
Are you all right?

755
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,550
How can anything happen to me?

756
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:32,550
Is the song Ye Jingxi played
for you good?

757
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,030
It’s great.

758
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,320
I can play the piano as well.

759
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,000
No. I just had a conversation with Bear.

760
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,510
He’ll go abroad soon.

761
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,880
He’ll study music at Austria.

762
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,960
What? Jingxi will go abroad?

763
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,150
When?

764
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,760
He’ll leave soon.

765
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,760
So that’s what happened?

766
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,360
I was so scared.

767
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,440
Chief.

768
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,070
Look how nervous you were.

769
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,590
I didn’t even see you panic like this
in your first competition.

770
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,070
I’ll soon see my son married.

771
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,760
Do you want to get beaten?

772
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,440
-Do you?
-No. No.

773
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,550
Right!

774
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,110
When will I eat it?

775
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,840
Let’s go.

776
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,590
I just slipped on my way here.

777
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,590
You messed up my hair-do.

778
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,760
Stop being sad. Han Yayi.

779
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,840
I can’t take it.

780
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Yuan Caixi.

781
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,360
Yes?

782
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,590
Promise me one thing.

783
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,590
What is it?

784
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,840
Promise me first.

785
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,960
You have to tell me first.

786
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:22,110
From now on,

787
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,960
you mustn’t leave
without saying goodbye.

788
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,960
Even if you’ll leave,

789
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,710
you have to get my approval.

790
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,480
Okay. World Champion.

791
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:38,190
I won’t go anywhere.
I just want to go home and sleep.

792
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:39,880
Come on.

793
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,440
Yuan Caixi.

794
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:42,630
Yes?

795
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,840
You have to trust me.

796
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,710
Trust you?

797
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,960
What?

798
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,400
Trust me with everything.

799
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,360
You’re so bossy.

800
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,920
Yes, I am.

801
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,510
Fine. Go to bed.

802
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,320
I’ll leave now.

803
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,000
