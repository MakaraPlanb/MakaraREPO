Sen Yong High School has been
ranked among the top three

17
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,150
(North Campus South Campus)
key high schools in Haiwen.

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,070
It has two campuses.

19
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,560
The South Campus focuses on sports

20
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,840
and the North Campus focuses on
academic subjects.

21
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,320
Each campus has its own strengths.

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,070
(North Campus South Campus)

23
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,070
But...

24
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,800
Where are you sweeping it to?

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,680
There is too much rubbish
in the South Campus.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,520
There is more rubbish
in the North Campus.

27
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,630
You are quite uneducated.

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,750
-How dare you say that about me!
-I just did!

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,870
Say it again.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,120
The students in the North Campus
have good grades

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,590
and the admission rate is much higher.

32
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,960
The PE students
are physically strong

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,560
and they fight hard on the sports field.

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,630
One of the lions has to leave the den.

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,120
Therefore,

36
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,030
students in the North Campus

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,400
have always looked down on
those simple-minded PE students.

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,960
The PE students also regard
academic students as learning machines

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
and teacher’s puppets.

40
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,870
The two parties are at loggerheads.

41
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,280
It won’t be that serious, Han Yayi.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Caixi just went to get the handbooks
at the South Campus.

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,430
What can they do?

44
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,240
Huang Yuan, there is
something you don’t know.

45
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,710
She’d better pray not to meet

46
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,800
the monster and his sidekicks.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,700
-It’s said that a student in the South Campus,
-No.

48
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,520
Li He, is arrogant and domineering.

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
-Those who stood against him
-Really.

50
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,560
-never ended well.
-I really can’t.

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,430
But why is Li He so wild?

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,870
Although Li He

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,000
has been mischievous,

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,120
after he got enrolled,

55
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,710
the South Campus of Sen Yong
got rid of its shameful record.

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,630
He also brought glory to
the school many times.

57
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,150
The teachers can do nothing about him.

58
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,750
In the past few years,
Li He has won numerous awards.

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,910
He is having the time of his life.

60
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,240
He broke the situation of

61
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,190
the strong North and
the weak South by himself.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,430
Well, can Caixi

63
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,520

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,150
Where are you going?
The bell is about to ring.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,120
Don’t worry about him.

67
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,750
Even he misses the class,
the teacher won’t say anything.

68
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,750
He can score the highest
with his eyes closed.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,310
I’m here to collect
your Quality Handbooks.

Who is that?

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
I don’t know.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,750
There are twenty handbooks.

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,720
Twenty handbooks?

77
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,430
Aren’t there twenty-four
people in your class?

78
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,920
You should know
who these four people are.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,560

We are all waiting for you.

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,680

94
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
I really can’t.

95
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,360
You promised us.

96
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,750

Not good.

120
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,390
Someone from the North Campus
came to collect the handbooks.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,390
Aren’t the handbooks
in the radio room?

122
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, I have the key.

123
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,120
What?

124
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,750
Hold on.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,270
The point is that the girl
said she collected

126
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,000
twenty-four copies.

127
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,190
Ah?

128
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,240
If she takes the handbook back

129
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
and those guys from the North Campus
write something on it,

130
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,800
we will be screwed if Mr. Bai sees them.

131
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,390
Who came from the North Campus?

132
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,430
A girl. She looks quite familiar.

133
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,600

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,220
Yes.

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Don’t they have any man?
Why did they ask a girl to come?

136
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,430
It should be Class 2’s turn
to write comments this time.

137
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,430
If I guess right, it should be

138
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,310

139
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,510

She got the attendance bonus every year.

147
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,360
I heard

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,800
that she never participates in

149
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,630
anything else except study.

150
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,560
It’s impossible that she comes late
or leaves early.

151
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,600
She starts to do exercise as soon as
she enters the classroom.

152
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,600
I heard that she even

153
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,190
finished the math exercise

154
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,800
for the whole year in one week.

155
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,950
She is beautiful and clever.

156
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,040

157
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,200

185
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,200
You...!

186
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,960
How do you know we hid them here?

187
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,000
The bases of PE students

188
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,320
include the rostrum, the equipment room
and the radio room.

189
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,910
The equipment room is too crowded.

190
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,200
Many PE students have keys.

191
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,440
But the radio room is different.

192
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,120
You are the only one
who has the key to it.

193
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,480
Because you are the president
of the radio club.

194
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,240
My only way

195
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,600
is to make you believe
that I get the handbooks

196
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
and you would come here
to check it on your own.

197
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,660
(Handbook)

198
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,720
Thank you.

199
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,510
You are very nice.

200
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,910
Do you think you can come
and go as you please?

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
Do you think you are at your home?

202
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,510
I think I’m at school.

203
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,000
I’m going back to take my class.

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,910
Please step aside.

205
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
You can leave.

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
Just put down the handbooks.

207
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,600
What if I don’t?

208
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,670
Then tell me

209
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,670
why the North Campus guys
should write the handbooks

210
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,550
of PE students?

211
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,440
Yeah.

212
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,150
Do they remember who we are?

213
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,720
I think you guys

214
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,150
impressed them a lot.

215
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,150
What do you mean?

216
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,790
Do you know the person
standing in front of you

217
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,720
is the future champion of
World Championships in Athletics,

218
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,390
Li He?

219
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,270
Open your eyes wide.

220
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,120
Fine.

221
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,320
Let me tell you.

222
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,840
The person standing in front of you

223
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,480
is a student who is going to be late
for self-study.

224
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,150
I don’t have time to deal with you.

225
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,030
My agile skill

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,360
and vigorous pace.

227
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,510
Her eyes

228
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,440
are full of appreciation for me.

229
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,550
Oh, my troublesome charm.

230
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,480
Chief, why are you hugging together?

231
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,480
Shut up and don’t talk nonsense.

232
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,960
They are not hugging.

233
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,080
What are you so arrogant about?

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
That Ning Zeyu who ranks first

235
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,750
in your class means nothing to me.

236
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,750
Not to mention the eternal number two

237
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,670
who can never rank first.

238
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,790
What does my grade
have anything to do with you?

239
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,080
You are the future world champion?

240
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,720
Let me remind you.

241
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,630
If one day you win the prize,

242
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,750
remember to change your clothes.

243
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,270
Otherwise, others will think

244
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,440
you are the world idiot champion.

245
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,980
(Retarded)

246
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,150
Caixi.

247
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,630
Zeyu.

248
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
Why are you here?

249
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,910
I’m just walking around.

250
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,630
Are you all right?

251
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,510
I’m fine. What’s wrong?

252
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,840
Why did you go to the radio room?

253
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,120
Well, I...

254
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,080
How do you know
that I went to the radio room?

255
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
The broadcast was turned on
and everyone in the school heard it.

256
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,840
Everyone heard it?

257
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,150
Yeah, you struck back nicely.

258
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,630
Let’s go.

259
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,120
He called her the eternal number two.

260
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,200
I didn’t notice that before.

261
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,360
Caixi!

262
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,910
Yuan.

263
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,270
Are you all right?

264
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,150
I’m fine.

265
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,120
I’m good, very good.

266
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,720
That’s good.

267
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,200
Can you lend me a pencil...

268
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,550
between 1B and 3B?

269
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,750
Okay.

270
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,440
Thank you.

271
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,960
Why did you trip her?

272
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,720
Ah?

273
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,750
You start to bully girls now?

274
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,440
Chief.

275
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,150
I was just angry.

276
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,390
Look at the way

277
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,910
she doesn’t take us seriously.

278
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,270
Besides,

279
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,270
you saved her.

280
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,870
But she called you an idiot champion.

281
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,030
Aren’t you angry?

282
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,750
I am angry.

283
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,150
But we are men.

284
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,670
We should be generous.

285
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,480
Got it?

286
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,000
Got it.

287
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,360
How is it? Did you get it?

288
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,150
What does it mean?

289
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,080
It basically means

290
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,750
(Stupidity Retardation Fool)
mental retardation, which means an idiot.

291
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Why did you send it to me?

292
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,510
Chuan.

293
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
What’s your intention?

294
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,790
I’m wronged.

295
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,670
I don’t know where my mother
got the clothes.

296
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,550
It looks nice without

297
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,510
this word.

298
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,720
I wanted to keep it to myself.

299
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,270
Take it back then.
I want to see you wear it every day.

300
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,200
Damn, Chief.

301
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,840
Your conversation with
Yuan Caixi just now

302
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,870
was broadcast throughout the school.

303
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Now everyone is talking about it
at the school forum.

304
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,120
Look.

305
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,340
(Li He is useless.)

306
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,140
(He wants to challenge Ning Zeyu?
What a joke.)

307
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,940
(He can’t even handle Yuan Caixi.)

308
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,780
(Li He is useless.)

309
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,380
(He overestimates himself.)

310
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,390
That’s irritating.

311
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,200
The North Campus nerds

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,030
are mocking us.

313
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,750
They said

314
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,750
you can’t even handle a girl.

315
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,120
They also said

316
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,960
you are no match for
Ning Zeyu’s little finger.

317
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,200
Who is Ning Zeyu?

318
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,870
Does he run faster than our chief?

319
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Chief.

320
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,600
It’s okay, don’t take it personally.

321
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,240
Ning Zeyu

322
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,480
is just a straight-A student.

323
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,510
He is not worth mentioning.

324
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,200
Straight-A student?

325
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,120
Ning Zeyu is not just
a straight-A student.

326
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,270
He is a prodigy.

327
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,150
The difference between
a straight-A student and a prodigy

328
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,320
is the difference between 99 points

329
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,390
and 100 points.

330
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,120
Isn’t it just one point less?

331
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,030
Just one point less?

332
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,240
The straight-A student scores 99 points

333
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,550
because that’s

334
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,480
the best they can do.

335
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,630
The prodigy scores 100 points

336
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,510
because that’s the full marks

337
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,840
of the examination.

338
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,600
All right.

339
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,320
What straight-A student and prodigy?

340
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,080
Ning Zeyu is just
a normal high school student.

341
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,870
So does the eternal number two.

342
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,030
They are only better at
studying than us.

343
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,910
But we run faster than them.

344
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,240
Don’t be afraid. No big deal.

345
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,200
Xiaowu.

346
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,030
Pipi.

347
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Li Jiefei.

348
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,390
You come with me.

349
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,390
I also want to join your team.

350
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,200
Can you run fast?

351
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,320
Can you play well?

352
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,790
You’d better go back
and do your homework.

353
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,480
Let’s play football!

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,960
Li He! Li He! Li He!

355
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,100
(Award Ning Zeyu Number One)

356
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,100
(Award Ning Zeyu Number One)

357
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,550
Why are you so angry?

358
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,390
One is a prodigy.
The other is a straight-A student.

359
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,080
We are no match for them.

360
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,320
We’d better find a way
to make us look good.

361
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,200
What did I tell you?

362
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,030
They are just paper tigers.

363
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
They will show their true colors
when they are on the playground.

364
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,550
How to get them on the playground?

365
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,320
Are you stupid?

366
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,630
The physical exam is in the afternoon.

367
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,320
-Knock, knock.
-Yeah?

368
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
Yuan.

369
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,440
You’ve been staring at Ning Zeyu.

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,550
I’m just thinking

371
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,720
why he can always get the first place.

372
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,390
You two rank among the top two.

373
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,550
It looks the same to me.

374
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,510
How can it be the same?

375
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,200
Do you remember who was the second
person to land on the moon?

376
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,790
Buzz Aldrin.

377
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,830
Formerly Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr.

378
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,160
Born in Greenwich, New Jersey, USA

379
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,110
on January 20, 1930.

380
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,350
You asked it.

381
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,920
Anyway,

382
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,110
I must get the first place once

383
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,270
in my third year of high school

384
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,960
so as to get a scholarship.

385
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,640
Yuan, did I hear you right?

386
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,110
You’re not such a money-grubber.

387
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,070
No.

388
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,480
I am.

389
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,750
Yuan.

390
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,500
You...

391
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,550
Wait for me.

392
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Yuan.

393
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,350
Li He has been staring at you.

394
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,640
His eyes are fierce.

395
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,750
But he is retarded.

396
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,240
Yeah.

397
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,350
Chief, Yuan Caixi has been
staring at you.

398
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,510
Perhaps it’s because I’m handsome.

399
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,750
Chief.

400
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,350
Are we going to stick to our plan?

401
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,440
Yeah.

402
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,680
Be smart.

403
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,000
Today is the final physical exam
for sophomores.

404
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,240
I hope

405
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,200
academic students and PE students

406
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,960
can take this physical exam seriously.

407
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,510
Because your results

408
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,510
will be recorded in your handbooks

409
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,750
and directly affect
the physical education courses

410
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,880
for your next semester.

411
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,270
Do you understand?

412
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Yes.

413
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,310
Sir.

414
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,440
We want to

415
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,720
help academic students pass the test.

416
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,030
How?

417
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,030
We can help them stretch
before they take the test.

418
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,480
It’s not violating any rules.

419
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,400
Okay.

420
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,200
Try it.

421
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,680
Right now,

422
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,110
dismiss. Relax yourselves.

423
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,240
Limber up.

424
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,680
Dismiss!

425
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,310
What do you want to do?

426
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,300
It’s for the physical test.

427
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,240
Wait. Wait.

428
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,780
Easy.

429
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,830
What do you want to do? Listen.

430
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,790
I don’t need your help.

431
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,440
Yuan Caixi.

432
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,000
Can you pass the test without my help?

433
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,550
I can’t pass the test if you help me.

434
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,270
Go away.

435
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,030
What are you doing?

436
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,920
You did it on purpose!

437
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,550
Your name is Pan Hao, right?
Let me help you.

438
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,200
Hello.

439
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,790
Being distracted during exercise
can hurt yourself.

440
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,160
Are you ready?

441
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,070
Let’s do it!

442
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,400
Can you take it?

443
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,790
Don’t hold it back. Your face turns red.

444
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,750
You will faint.

445
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,640
No.

446
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,680
I can do it. I can do it.

447
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,550
It doesn’t hurt.

448
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,400
You are pretty soft.

449
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,110
Mr. Bai.

450
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,790
Obviously, they are revenging themselves
on us. Won’t you do something about it?

451
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,590
Revenge themselves?

452
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,480
For what?

453
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,400
Yeah, for what? Tell us.

454
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,400
Besides, we are helping you.

455
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,350
Can you pass the test without us?

456
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,880
Help us?

457
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,550
A bunch of retards.

458
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
How can you help us?

459
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,920
What did you say? What retards?

460
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
Can you understand if I say it again?

461
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,590
-I dare you to say it again.
-Stop it.

462
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,110
Get back and line yourself up!

463
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,110
Those who finish the trunk flexion test

464
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,030
will take sit-up test next.

465
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,160
Academic students. 30 sit-ups is
the passing score. 40 is excellent.

466
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,920
Understand?

467
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,270
Yes.

468
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,270
Mr. Bai.

469
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,360
Well...

470
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,070
Go back.

471
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,240
Start!

472
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,070
Mr. Bai!

473
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,000
The leaders have arrived.

474
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,510
One.

475
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,880
Mr. Ma asked you to come over.

476
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,480
Got it.

477
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,680
Two.

478
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,030
Li He!

479
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,000
Yeah.

480
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,480
Collect the test results later.

481
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,310
Okay.

482
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,640
Come on, number two.

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,920
Don’t worry, I’m professional.

484
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,110
Hurry up.

485
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,680
All right, I’m not afraid.

486
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,590
One.

487
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,000
Two.

488
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,030
Non-standard. Two.

489
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,750
Three.

490
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,920
Two.

491
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,880
Do it again. Two.

492
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,830
Two.

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,590
Well, I found that number two
are meant for you.

494
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,750
You are doing it on purpose.

495
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,790
I think you have special preference
to number two.

496
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,750
-Fine.
-Hurry up.

497
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,480
Keep counting.

498
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:58,790
Two.

499
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,920
Cheer up.

500
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,510
One, two.

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,110
Non-standard. Two.

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,960
Smile.

503
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,920
Go down.

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,030
Non-standard, do it again.

505
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,520
Two.

506
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,160
One.

507
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,400
Two. Non-standard. Two.

508
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,960
Two. Still two,

509
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,680
Two.

510
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
Still two.

511
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,160
Non-standard.

512
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,310
Cheer up.

513
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,590
-Two.
-Do you have something on your mind?

514
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,480
Non-standard. Do it again.

515
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,070
Come on. Get down.

516
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,510
Can you do it or not?

517
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:38,070
Use your abdominal muscles.

518
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,310
Do you know how to do sit-ups?

519
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,680
Get down.

520
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,750
Non-standard. Do it again.

521
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,320
Two.

522
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,070
What a wussy.

523
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,510
Who did you just call that?
Who is a wussy?

524
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,680
I’m calling you a wussy! What’s wrong?

525
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
You are a wussy.

526
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,030
I said you are a wussy. What can you do?

527
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,960
It’s fun to watch us
make a fool of ourselves, right?

528
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,440
No one wants to make a fool of you.

529
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,270
We are helping you.

530
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,000
We will record your score.

531
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,590
Well,

532
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,240
did we record less score for you?

533
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,640
Yeah, what’s more,

534
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,350
can you pass the test without our help?

535
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,960
You should thank us.

536
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,750
I dare you to say it again.

537
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,070
I can say it a hundred times.

538
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,350
You should thank us.

539
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,550
You are a wussy if you don’t say it.

540
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,960
Who are you calling that?

541
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,680
Let’s play a game if you dare.

542
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,000
You are a girl.

543
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,270
I’m not playing any game with you.

544
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,350
They will blame me for bullying a girl.

545
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,110
I’ll play with you.

546
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,030
Okay.

547
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,550
Play what?

548
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,880
Whatever you want.

549
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,720
Hello, everyone.

550
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Welcome to Sen Yong High School Cup’s

551
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,270
Academic and PE Dodge Ball.

552
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,720
Right now, academic students
and PE students

553
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,830
are lining up in two teams.

554
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,960
The game is about to start.

555
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,820
Players from both teams,

556
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,070
(Referee)
get ready!

557
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,830
Come on!

558
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,270
You are a girl. Don’t play it.

559
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,200
Ask a boy to play the game.

560
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,440
What’s wrong with being a girl?

561
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Can’t a girl do it?

562
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,790
You can.

563
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,240
Don’t accuse us of bullying you later.

564
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,000
Are you okay?

565
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,400
Okay, I can do it.

566
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,680
First of all.

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,240
Each team needs to send a player

568
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,350
to snatch the ball
in the center of the court.

569
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,920
The player who gets the ball

570
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,680
needs to pass it to the teammate behind.

571
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,240
The teammate who receives the ball

572
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,200
can attack the opponent immediately.

573
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,030
During the game,

574
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,640
anyone who is hit by the ball

575
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,790
will be eliminated immediately.

576
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,440
When all the members of one team
are eliminated,

577
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,030
the game is over.

you can’t win us.

paying attention, right?

and academic students

688
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,790
are like a family.

689
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,160

generalizing about people.

Mr. Bai.

709
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,510
It’s not our fault.

710
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,720
The academic students provoked us first.

711
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,960
How did they provoke you?

712
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,750
I’m the head teacher of Class 2,
Luo Xiyan.

713
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,880
Li He, please tell me

714
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
how my students provoked you.

715
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,110
They made fun of us in English.

716
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,310
We were too angry.

717
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,270
So we posed a difficult question.

718
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,920
Then somehow we started fighting.

719
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Is that so?

720
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,310
You started it?

721
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,200
No.

722
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,070
It was a fair competition.

723
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,110
Yeah.

724
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,400
I know my students the best.

725
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,550
Yuan Caixi and Ning Zeyu

726
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,350
are not provocative students.

727
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,030
Therefore, Li He.

728
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,270
You must have inadvertently

729
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,160
or deliberately

730
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,200
omitted something.

731
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,830
Anyway,

732
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,400
students make mistakes

733
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,680
because they are young and ignorant.

734
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,110
But it’s the negligence of the teacher

735
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,350
if he doesn’t teach his students well.

736
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,750
The negligent teacher,

737
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,960
don’t you have anything to say?

738
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,200
Instructor Bai.

739
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:26,880
Negligence?

740
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,110
Mr. Ma, I think

741
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,920
it’s not totally because of
my negligence.

742
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,640
After all, every student

743
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,240
can be naughty some time.

744
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,790
They are just...

745
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,400
All right.

746
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
Are you finished?

747
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,550
The three of you.

748
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,960
Go back and write
a review of 1,500 words.

749
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,590
Put it on my desk tomorrow morning.

750
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,440
-Review?
-Okay, Mr. Ma.

751
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,550
An apology should be enough.

752
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,550
Is it too little for you?

753
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,750
2000 words!

754
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,920
What are you still waiting for?
Go back and write it.

755
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,590
It’s too much.

756
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,480
All right, go back.

757
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,030
Goodbye, Mr. Ma.

758
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,590
Bai Fei.

759
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,440
Can you look out for what you say?

760
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,350
Think a little bit
before you say anything.

761
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,750
Okay?

762
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
I said it in too much of a hurry.

763
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,350
What did he say?

764
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,590
He almost told them about the merging.

765
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,440
However, Mr. Ma,

766
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,480
are we really going to
merge into one campus?

767
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,240
Yeah, Mr. Ma.

768
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,830
I don’t think it’s a good idea.

769
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,350
Academic students and PE students

770
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,590
are essentially different.

771
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,270
How can they take classes together?

772
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,830
If they study in the same classroom,

773
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,590
they will fight every day

774
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,070
just like today.

775
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,110
Whether they fight or not,

776
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,270
we are going to merge into one campus.
