17
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,680
We won’t be called truant, will we?

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,870
We were training at night before.

19
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,310
We can let Mr. Bai help us.

20
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,480
Anyway,

21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,070
we have to go back
before the second class.

22
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,590
Do you hear me?

23
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,200
Okay.

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,230
Let’s go.

25
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,190
I knew Zhang Ye was bragging.

26
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,120
How can their school hire a retired coach
of a national team?

27
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,000
Be quiet.

28
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,560
Ready.

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,800
Awesome!

30
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,030
Top muscle controls like this,

31
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,750
even Mr. Bai can’t do it, right?

32
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,750
Brats. What are you guys doing here?

33
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,120
You startled me.
Why are you here, Mr. Bai?

34
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,710
I come to watch their training.

35
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,710
-Hey. Hey.
-Come. Come.

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,840
It’s time for class.
Why haven’t they come back?

37
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,000
PE students have extra training.

38
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,280
They’ll be back soon. Just wait.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,910
Right.

40
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,960
Ready.

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,910
Why are some students still absent?

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Where are Li He and Lin Chuan?

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,910
Perhaps,

44
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,680
they skipped classes and went out.

45
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Boys said there’d be a match today.

46
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,150
Did they go for the match?

47
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,840
How bold they are.

48
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,800
They dare skip evening classes.

49
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,310
Monitor.

50
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Keep an eye on the class.

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,310
I’m going to deal with this.

52
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,120
OK. Sure.

53
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,180
(Bai Fei)

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,630
Mr. Bai.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,560
The national team coach
is really something.

56
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,600
It gets better
once the moves are adjusted.

57
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,560
He’s indeed awesome.

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,390
I’ll apply to the headmaster.

59
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,750
See if we can invite this coach

60
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,120
to give us special training
for some days.

61
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,310
Is it OK?

62
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,480
We can have a try.

63
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,310
At worst,
I’ll give up my bonus this month.

64
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,950
Wow, Mr. Bai. it’s so kind of you!

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,580
(Study for mentality,
sports for physical quality)

66
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
(Li He: Go back early at evening class.
I need to talk to you.)

67
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,660
(See you at evening class)

68
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,040
Hey, hold on.

69
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
What time is it now?

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,240
The first evening class is almost over.

71
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,480
Go back now.

72
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,190
Hey.

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,720
Are you skipping classes?

74
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,120
Well...

75
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,270
It’s not skipping classes with you here.

76
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,920
Yes.

77
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,160
Go back now. Go back.

78
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,750
Chief, why are you running so fast?

79
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,360
Hurry up.

80
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,310
I’m back.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,120
Hey, I’m back.

82
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
So be it. Why bother telling me?

83
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,510
Didn’t you say you’d tell me something
at the evening class?

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,430
Yes, but now it’s over.

85
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,000
It doesn’t matter.

86
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,750
What’s wrong with you?

87
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,240
Nothing. Don’t disturb me.

88
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,270
If you have any question on your study,

89
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,120
feel free to ask me.

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,750
Can you explain this question again?

91
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,000
I didn’t get it just now.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,070
Oh. OK.

93
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,360
This is a subjunctive.

94
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,460
Pay attention to the personal pronouns.

95
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,260
It’s hard, because you need to use

96
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,560
correct personal pronouns.

97
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,920
You’ll lose points
if you make a mistake.

98
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
So, You’d better not use it.

99
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,310
-I choose C.
-You choose C for this?

100
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,950
It should be B.

101
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
You should look...

102
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,070
Baby. Baby.

103
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,390
Hey, baby!

104
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,160
Miss! Miss! Miss!

105
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,310
Miss Luo!

106
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,360
Can you hear me out?

107
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,310
What else do you want to say?

108
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,190
Can you not go to Mr. Ma?

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,560
I...

110
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,800
They skipped the whole evening class.

111
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,160
Won’t Mr. Ma know it
if I don’t tell him?

112
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,160
How will he know if you don’t tell him?

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,830
Alright.

114
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,560
You take me as blind.

115
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,750
Are all the classmates blind?

116
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,160
Didn’t they see it?

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
If you tell Mr. Ma,

118
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,160
what should they do?

119
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,830
Think about it!

120
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
If I don’t report it to Mr. Ma

121
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
and he hears a word about this,

122
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,270
what should I do then?

123
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,630
Baby.

124
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,510
It... It’s all my fault. My bad.

125
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,750
I know you’re defending them.

126
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,560
But you shouldn’t indulge them

127
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,920
and let them have their way.

128
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
But look, baby.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,630
They didn’t go to play games.

130
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,800
They intended to improve their skills.

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,830
This is a good thing.

132
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,080
Alright.

133
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,960
Let me ask you something.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,390
For sportsmen,
apart from physical fitness,

135
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,600
what is more important?

136
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,150
Discipline.

137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I’m going to Mr. Ma then.

138
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,030
Let’s go.

139
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,910
I’ll stay for a moment.

140
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,790
You go first.

141
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,390
Keep my paper. I won’t use it today.

142
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,840
OK. I’ll return it tomorrow.

143
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,030
What’s this?

144
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,840
No need to return this.

145
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,550
See you tomorrow.

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,550
Monitor.

147
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,390
What’s wrong?

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey, you...! Hey!

149
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,510
What’s wrong with you today?

150
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,870
Where did you go at the evening class?

151
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,030
I went for the match.

152
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,360
I know our appointment,

153
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,720
so I came back early.

154
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,790
Should I say thanks to you?

155
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:50,510
No.

156
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,750
Just tell me what happened to you today.

157
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,270
Stop keeping me guessing. OK?

158
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,910
Yuan.

159
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,360
Shall we go?

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,870
Yes.

161
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,840
Yuan, are you angry with Li He?

162
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,960
Don’t ask, or my answer is no.

163
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,440
Why?

164
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,630
You prepared study materials for him,

165
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,910
yet he went to watch the match.

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
I’ve said I’m not angry.

167
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,840
He can go wherever he wants.

168
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,240
Alright. Alright. You are not angry.

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,200
Let’s go home.

170
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,480
Ning Zeyu.

171
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,600
Ning Zeyu.

172
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey.

173
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,150
I was greeting to you.
Why didn’t you answer?

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,510
I’ll answer if it’s anyone else.

175
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,630
But I don’t want to meet you.

176
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,670
Right.

177
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,150
You don’t want to meet me.

178
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,320
It will be different if it’s Monitor.
Right?

179
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,790
You two chatted happily
at the evening class.

180
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,030
Yes.

181
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,960
We have a lot in common,
and she’s intelligent.

182
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,870
Of course we were happy.

183
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,510
I have a question.

184
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,320
Is Yuan Caixi angry with me?

185
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

186
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,150
Why is she angry with me?

187
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,790
Why?

188
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,630
Why should I tell you?

189
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,390
Better use your brain.

190
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,120
If you still can’t figure out,

191
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,510
it means the monitor and you

192
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,630
are not the same kind.

193
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,240
I’m off.

194
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,200
Bye.

195
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,150
Can’t you be straightforward?

196
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,120
(Han Yayi)
I don’t know. I dare not say even if I do.

197
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,320
Please help me out of this.

198
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,480
I don’t want her unhappy all the time.

199
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:09,960
Caixi.

200
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,150
I’m coming in.

201
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,840
Hey.

202
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
Aren’t you doing homework?

203
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,030
I won’t eat.

204
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,910
Take it out.

205
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,510
Life is so amazing,

206
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,910
yet you’re so cranky.

207
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,320
You must need some vitamin.

208
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,080
Mom made these

209
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,630
specially for you.

210
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,630
Have some.

211
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,270
Let me guess.

212
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,360
Is it

213
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,480
because of Li He?

214
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,150
You’re idle.
Have you finished your homework?

215
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,030
You’re more important than homework, OK?

216
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,360
I seldom see you so angry.

217
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,670
Caixi.

218
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,790
What

219
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,270
did Li He do to you?

220
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,960
He made a deal with me that

221
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,150
he wanted to pass the monthly exam once

222
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,270
to show his parents

223
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,270
and make them happy.

224
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,630
I said that’d be great.

225
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Tonight I prepared him

226
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
all the review materials.

227
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,790
I told him to come back early
for evening class.

228
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,440
Turned out that bastard
didn’t come back.

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,360
He went to watch a match.

230
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,750
It’s so ungrateful of him.

231
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,030
This is called

232
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,030
“the more you love,

233
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
the more you hate”.

234
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
What did you say?
What are you talking about?

235
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,300
-What love and hatred?
-Caixi! Caixi!

236
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,440
-Your butt!
-Sorry! A slip of tongue!

237
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,630
A slip of tongue! A slip of tongue!

238
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,960
Caixi.

239
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,080
One last question for you.

240
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
Well.

241
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Are you angry

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
for he didn’t study hard

243
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,120
or

244
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,200
he didn’t take
your appointment seriously?

245
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,390
What’s wrong with you today?

246
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,200
Where did you go at the evening class?

247
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,440
Watch the match.

248
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,240
I knew our appointment,

249
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,790
so I come back early.

250
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,870
Should I say thanks to you?

251
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,630
No.

252
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,440
Hello, sir.

253
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,870
Hey, Monitor.

254
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,080
Monitor.

255
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,750
I can’t do this question.

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,320
Can you help me?

257
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,440
It’s my bad that I didn’t show up
on time yesterday.

258
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,080
I promise it will never happen again.

259
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,510
Don’t make any promise.

260
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,630
If you really want to pass the exam,

261
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,360
you wouldn’t have gone for the match.

262
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,080
The match?

263
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,440
What match?

264
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,440
Didn’t you skip class
for the match yesterday?

265
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
No.

266
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,270
I went to see the training in
No. 2 Experimental Middle School.

267
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,070
Now you know it. Right?

268
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,880
I didn’t skip class to have fun.

269
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,160
Why did you explain it to me?

270
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,720
I don’t care about where you went.

271
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
So, you were angry because you thought

272
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,160
I forgot our appointment

273
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:25,830
and went out for fun. Right?

274
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,750
Do you need my help or not?

275
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,110
Yes. Yes. Yes.

276
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,070
This one. This question. Here.

277
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,510
Which question?

278
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,920
This one.

279
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,550
As for this question,
you should find the stem first.

280
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,550
The stem is...

281
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,830
Li He.

282
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:42,920
What?

283
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Focus on your study.

284
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,000
Monitor.

285
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,680
I will never ever forget

286
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,070
our appointment again,

287
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,880
not even a second.

288
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,400
Are you pushing it?
Look at the question.

289
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
I’ll explain it only once.

290
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,240
As for this question,
you should solve the second one first.

291
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,640
Um.

292
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,960
Only when the second one is solved,
can you do the first one.

293
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,140
(Self-criticism)

294
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,830
What are you looking at?

295
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,110
I don’t know how to write.

296
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,000
Your pocket money will be deducted then.

297
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,070
Anyway, not much pocket money left
this month.

298
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,110
Hey.

299
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,830
Even Mr. Ma didn’t say anything.

300
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,200
Why are you punishing me?

301
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,640
Moreover,

302
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
I’m a grownup.

303
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,240
Writing a self-criticism

304
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
will be a shame to me.

305
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,240
Right?

306
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,030
Mr. Ma didn’t punish you,

307
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,350
because I told him
you had extra training.

308
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,590
That’s why PE students
have half-day classes less.

309
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,160
Um.

310
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,110
Be mature afterwards.

311
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,510
Don’t be like a kid, OK?

312
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,440
Yes.

313
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
I’m immature.

314
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
I’m not as mature as the date

315
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,750
your mother introduced to you,

316
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,070
a well-educated civil servant,

317
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,640
who has a car and a house. And,

318
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,750
he’s a local.

319
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,440
At the same age.
What a perfect match.

320
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,830
I’m a peasant.

321
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,400
How can I match a returnee like you?

322
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,200
Are you stepping on me?

323
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,960
Of course.

324
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
Why are you speaking ill of my mom?

325
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Just wait. Huh?

326
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,160
Let’s see if that civil servant

327
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,920
can put up with your temper.

328
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,510
Bai Fei.

329
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,030
What?

330
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,350
All what you just said

331
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,110
was right,

332
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,830
but not this.

333
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,550
I, a returnee,

334
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,720
really like stepping on you,

335
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,310
a peasant.

336
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,070
What are you looking at? Keep writing.

337
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,350
Mr. Ma didn’t punish you.

338
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,590
You just need to write a self-criticism.

339
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,160
Are you even perfunctory on this?

340
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,830
We are teachers.

341
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,510
We should be models for students.

342
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,510
Yes, right.

343
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,160
Bai.

344
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,070
What are you doing?

345
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,920
Are you bullying Luo again?

346
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,860
What are you doing? What are you doing?

347
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,550
I... I’m writing a self-criticism.

348
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,030
A school punishment?

349
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,480
What’s going on?

350
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:40,440
Nothing.

351
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,240
Do you need my help?

352
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,720
No. Go for your business.

353
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,790
These are the essence of the essence.

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,830
Hey, Yuan.

355
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,960
When you graduate,
you can sell all these

356
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,200
to juniors.

357
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,350
You will make a fortune.

358
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,270
OK. Let’s split it 50/50.

359
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,000
No. 40/60 will do.

360
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,310
Or 30/70.

361
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,160
After all, I’m just an assistant.

362
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,240
I can’t take too much.

363
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,550
Isn’t that too much?

364
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,030
Um.

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,270
But listen. You not only take too much,

366
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,440
but also talk too much.

367
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,880
What?

368
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,270
Don’t you know it?

369
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,070
Li He has been letting Lin Chuan ask you

370
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,030
about my recent things,

371
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,640
right?

372
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,880
Hey. Hey. Hey.

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,640
Alright. Alright.

374
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,270
I’m not blaming you.

375
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,480
So, help Lin Chuan with his homework

376
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,240
in a while.

377
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:50,960
Um.

378
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,070
I’m off.

379
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,240
Yuan is indeed awesome.

380
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,440
Devil.

381
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,110
Devil.

382
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,240
As for Chinese,
read the full text first.

383
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,440
Recite the paragraphs

384
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,160
based on the keywords.

385
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,550
Monitor.

386
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,750
It’s fine to recite.

387
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,110
But what about math?

388
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,720
These are the most basic questions

389
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,790
I summarized from weekly tests.

390
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,270
Get the easy points first.

391
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,070
Alright?

392
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,440
Hey. Wait. Wait. Wait.

393
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,200
We didn’t invite you here.

394
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,160
I know

395
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,960
what you are thinking very well.

396
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
We have Monitor here.

397
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,750
That’s enough.

398
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,790
Your foundation is so bad.

399
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,550
Do you want to tire her to death?

400
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,880
No way.

401
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:43,920
Monitor.

402
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,640
Li He seems unsatisfied

403
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,510
with the tutoring arrangement.

404
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Hey.

405
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,680
No. No. No.

406
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,750
We didn’t mean that.

407
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,510
No.

408
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,830
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

409
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,070
Monitor.

410
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,030
I’ve got it.

411
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,590
Study is like running.

412
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,240
We should start with the basics.

413
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,350
Come on.

414
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,070
Easy ones first.

415
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,070
Put the math back.

416
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,070
Take Chinese out.

417
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,270
Shall we?

418
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,400
♪The further we look up at the sun♪

419
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:55,040

00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,000

♪We only hear our pounding hearts♪

428
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,310
I’ll do a spot check.

429
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,680
-Stop reciting.
-Hey.

430
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,380

00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,750

♪Wind is no longer that fierce♪

433
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,070
Breath of the Wild is incredible.

434
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,000
I think of it every morning
when I wake up.

435
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,030
We can play together on weekends.

436
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,550
That’s a must.

437
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,550
Hey. Look. Aren’t they

438
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,920
Li He and his classmates?

439
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,750
Gosh.

440
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,920
Are these students

441
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,750
helping them with their study?

442
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
They are a bunch of bookworms.

443
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,440
They got Li He like this.

444
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,640
Exactly.

445
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,270
Monitor.

446
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,750
What’s the matter?

447
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,830
How was our performance today?

448
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,160
Quite good.

449
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,590
If it goes like this,

450
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,750
at least you’ll pass Chinese.

451
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,440
That’s great.

452
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,480
Thanks for your help.

453
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,480
Or else,

454
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Chuan and I would fail again.

455
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,400
Listen to me.

456
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,960
Don’t be cocky for what you achieved.
Understand?

457
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,640
Rest assured.

458
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,480
I won’t.

459
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,720
I just

460
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,070
want to thank you for your help.

461
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,240
Can I treat you to dinner?

462
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,200
Dinner?

463
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,160
Yes.

464
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,480
I’ve had a plan.

465
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,440
How about barbecue?

466
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,440
OK.

467
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:27,880
Let’s go.

468
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,270
But not tonight.

469
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,310
Why?

470
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,440
I can’t solve a question.

471
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,880
I’ll meet Zeyu at the bookstore.

472
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,440
Sorry. I just made an appointment
with him.

473
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,720
Because I don’t know.

474
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,960
It’s fine.

475
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
Study is the most important thing.

476
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,750
We can have dinner next time.

477
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,510
Can we take a rain check?

478
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,270
Sure. Anytime.

479
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,440
OK.

480
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,240
I’m off then.

481
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,480
-Bye.
-Bye.

482
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,440
-Bye.
-Bye.

483
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,790
Who will come later?

484
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,920
You ask too much.

485
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,110
Chief, we’ll take that table.

486
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,640
OK. Come and have a seat.

487
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,830
I’ll order food.

488
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,400
OK. Take your time.

489
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,270
Feel free to order if you need more.

490
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,240
Hello.

491
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,350
Have you bought it?

492
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,350
Come here quickly.

493
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,640
I’m waiting for the goods.
I’m on my way.

494
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,720
Um. Um. Um.

495
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,030
Sorry, Zeyu.

496
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,640
The class is over,
but I take up your time now.

497
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,000
It’s fine.
I don’t want to go home anyway.

498
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,680
I’m kidding. You’re so gullible.

499
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,400
Why don’t you

500
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
spend the time on these questions?

501
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,960
I’m in a hurry to go home.

502
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:46,680
Oh, right.

503
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,110
Take this.

504
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,420
(Strawberry milk)
Drink it when you are thirsty.

505
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,200
Ah?

506
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,350
Thanks.

507
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,590
This question.

508
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:01,400
How is it?

509
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,310
Is he coming?

510
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,400
He won’t come.

511
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,440
He won’t?

512
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,350
What’s going on?

513
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,640
He can’t come.

514
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,200
Where is Xiang?

515
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
I’m coming.

516
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,480
Strawberry milk.

517
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,680
Am I late?

518
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,200
Hey.

519
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,830
Don’t we have a guest?

520
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,240
She and I are not the same kind.

521
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,400
You’re right.

522
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,720
Don’t you contradict me?

523
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,160
It should be correct.

524
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,960
Take a look. Is it correct?

525
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,400
Let me see.

526
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,550
It’s correct.

527
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,920
Wow. Your method works so well.

528
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,680
Crap. Now that you’ve learnt my method,

529
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,920
what if you surpass me?

530
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,400
I’ll soon surpass you.

531
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,070
Don’t worry.

532
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,160
Hey.

533
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,510
Even your attitude changed

534
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,160
after you learnt it.

535
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,110
You bet.

536
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,750
But seriously,

537
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,880
I’ll definitely surpass you,

538
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,000
fair and square.

539
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,310
Fair and square

540
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,960
Um.

541
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,680
That said,

542
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,200
since you want to surpass me,

543
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,550
why do you help Li He with his review?

544
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,440
Actually, I can quite understand him.

545
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,030
For a PE student,

546
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,750
the study result isn’t that important.

547
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,440
But I can understand him that

548
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,880
he wants to do well once
to make his parents happy.

549
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,310
Because I was alike before.

550
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,200
So, I want to help him.

551
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,070
Is that the only reason?

552
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,110
Yes.

553
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,880
No, not exactly.

554
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,920
Actually,
it’s because they helped us once

555
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,350
at the relay race.

556
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,830
Now I returned his favor.

557
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,310
We are even now.

558
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,000
Well.

559
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,240
Are you free after the exam?

560
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:56,640
I suppose so.

561
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,070
There’ll be a lecture after the exam.
Would you join me?

562
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,510
We can decide by then.

563
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,270
If I don’t do well in the exam,

564
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,750
I won’t want to go to the lecture
with my rival.

565
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,070
Alright.

566
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
It’s your call. Let’s decide by then.

567
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,270
OK.

568
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,720
Just because you are not the same kind,

569
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,880
she has something you don’t,

570
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,720
while you have something she doesn’t.

571
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,640
So,

572
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,070
you should find out what you have
but she doesn’t.

573
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,160
This way,

574
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,550
you can get closer to her quickly.

575
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,590
You can complement each other.

576
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,680
More importantly,

577
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,480
don’t be too active.

578
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,480
You should play hard-to-get.

579
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,790
That makes sense.

580
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,440
I can’t believe it.

581
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,030
You’re an expert, huh?

582
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,750
Being smart

583
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,440
is too lonesome.

584
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,000
You just deserve some punches.

585
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,350
Just take my advice
and play hard-to-get.

586
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,750
Hey. Morning.

587
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,590
You come early today.

588
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,030
Um.

589
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,440
Do you have any questions
in your homework?

590
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,070
You can ask me.

591
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,920
Not bad. I don’t have many questions.

592
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,960
I didn’t mean it yesterday.

593
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,640
It’s fine.

594
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,310
By the way...

595
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,680
Yes?

596
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,070
What’s wrong?

597
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,000
What’s the matter?

598
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,550
Oh, forget it.

599
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,350
Nothing.

600
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,350
Jiang Yuan.

601
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,030
This question...

602
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,310
Are you still playing your phone
even now?

603
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,720
I’m not. I’m waiting for a message.

604
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,110
What message?

605
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,030
Some good news anyway

606
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,830
which can help Chief’s urgency.

607
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,200
Don’t make any trouble.

608
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,880
I’m not making any trouble.

609
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,200
Didn’t you see Chief was so worried
yesterday

610
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,240
for the exam?

611
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,550
I can help him out.

612
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,880
Wait and see.

613
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,790
Mr. Bai will be late for something.

614
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,680
I’ll lead you

615
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,790
to warm up first.

616
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,960
Attention, everyone.

617
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
Separate for a distance.

618
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,110
Align the lines and rows.

619
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,070
OK. Hands down.

620
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,240
Listen to my command.

621
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,680
Ready.

622
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:04,960
Go.

623
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,790
One, two, three, four,

624
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,960
five, six, seven, eight.

625
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,960
Two. Two. Three.

626
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,110
Yuan Caixi.

627
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:17,590
Yes?

628
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,830
What are you doing?

629
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,310
I didn’t catch up just now.

630
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,000
You know you didn’t?

631
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,000
Come on.

632
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,680
Do the chest expansion exercise.

633
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,030
-Aren’t you a genius?
-What’s wrong with you today?

634
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:30,830
What do you mean by that?

635
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,550
Why are you picking on Monitor?

636
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,240
What did I do to her?

637
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,830
I have high requirements

638
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,550
on every classmate.

639
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,720
Come on.

640
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,960
Do the chest expansion exercise.

641
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,480
You can give a demonstration.

642
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
Why me?

643
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
Ning Zeyu. Step forward.

644
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,270
Show us the chest expansion exercise.

645
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,440
Stop clapping!

646
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:56,270
Ready.

647
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,240
Go.

648
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,830
One, two, three, four,

649
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,310
five, six, seven, eight.

650
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,800
Two, two, three, four,

651
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,150
five, six, seven, eight.

652
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,400
Listen.

653
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,920
Had I learnt seriously,
I’d be a top student.

654
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,070
Lin Chuan.

655
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,590
Come here.

656
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Excuse me.

657
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,590
Go. Go. Go.

658
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,000
What’s the matter?

659
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,550
What’s the problem with Li He today?

660
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,280
He’s always been with a problem.

661
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,760
Li He was cold to Yuan today.

662
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,030
He even picked on her.

663
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,030
What on earth happened to him?

664
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,000
Are you asking this for Yuan?

665
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,710
How does she feel now?

666
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,510
How does she feel?

667
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,190
She feels great.

668
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,800
It’s very quiet.

669
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,110
No one is jabbering

670
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,070
around her.

671
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,920
Why do I feel she is kind of

672
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,480
absent-minded and anxious?

673
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,400
And she cares a lot about
Li He’s attitude to her.

674
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,280
You know little about Yuan.

675
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,220
There’s no one yet

676
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,000
who can make her dramatically emotional.

677
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,480
Is there anyone

678
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,550
who makes you feel affectionate?

679
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,000
I...

680
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,230
I mean emotional, not affectionate.

681
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,280
Don’t distort it.

682
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,000
I’m off.

683
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,280
Miss Han.

684
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
Please help me with my schoolwork.

685
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,630
I haven’t finished it yet.

686
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,510
Please help me with... With...

687
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,510
Please help me with English.

688
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,190
I can’t do English very well.

689
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,400
Miss Han.

690
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,880
Did Han Yayi really say that?

691
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,150
What she said doesn’t matter.

692
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,320
What matters is that she came to me.

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,110
It means Yuan Caixi has lost her poise.

694
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,550
She’s found out your attitude changes.

695
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,630
I keep ignoring her.

696
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,510
What if she’s really angry?

697
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,000
You got to the point.

698
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,070
Think about it.

699
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,440
If you keep ignoring her,

700
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,000
she’ll keep thinking why.

701
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,280
Then you can find a proper time

702
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,070
and appear suddenly,

703
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,230
showing your care to her.

704
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,630
Then

705
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,510
she’ll feel

706
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,760
upset but also sweet.

707
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, I see.

708
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
It’s called,

709
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,190
“play hard-to-get”.

710
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,070
“Play hard-to-get”?

711
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,280
According to my analysis,

712
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,030
this is their trick.

713
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,030
With the excuse
of your refusal to dinner,

714
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,440
they are playing hard-to-get

715
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
in order to gain your attention.

716
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,360
Once Li He gets enthusiastic about you,

717
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,190
you’ll fall for him immediately.

718
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,510
Fall for him?

719
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:55,480
Are they playing tricks?

720
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,000
What should we do then?

721
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,630
Play along.

722
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,670
Monitor.

723
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,800
I finished my homework.

724
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,280
Please help me check it.

725
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,400
Have you finished?

726
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,360
That’s good.

727
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,480
You haven’t checked it.

728
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,550
No need.

729
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,960
Well...

730
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,190
Well, what should I do next?

731
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,800
Do whatever you should.

732
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,960
What’s wrong, Li He?

733
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,800
Anything else?

734
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,110
No... Nothing.

735
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,150
Go back then.

736
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,630
Wait.

737
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,710
I’ll help the teacher
sort out materials.

738
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,920
Perhaps I can’t tutor you.

739
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,590
I’m off.

740
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,590
But... Monitor.

741
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,280
What should I do, Monitor?

742
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,190
-Monitor!
-You’ve got me

743
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,550
and these.

744
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
Is it necessary?

745
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,000
Yes, of course it is.

746
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,920
Chuan. Chuan.

747
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,440
I’m like you.

748
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,070
I also have high requirements
on classmates.

749
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,960
The same to you.

750
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,710
I’ll be strict with you as well.
