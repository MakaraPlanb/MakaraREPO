(Jiang Yuan)
What’s the fuss about?

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,640
(Rift Prodigals Academic Exchange Group)
We are going tutor that brat tomorrow.

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,510
I need to figure out a way
to stop monitor

20
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,790
paying too much attention on him.

21
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,040
(Yun Xiang)
She won’t.

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,560
Monitor has been rational and fair.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,200
She will. Think about it.

24
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,070
We won’t wear school uniforms tomorrow.

25
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,280
That brat must have prepared a lot.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,500
Ning Zeyu, the duplicitous jerk

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,360
might also plot something.

28
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,590
Why do you think so much?

29
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,800
Just train him hard.

30
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,910
When monitor knows your ability,

31
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,680
she will forget that wussy.

32
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,870
This is not what a real man would do.
Where is Chuan?

33
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,400
Chuan.

34
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,630
Chuan, stop what you are doing.

35
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,800
It’s very urgent.

36
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,630
Easy.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,430
Don’t dress like a torn sack.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,150
Tomorrow,

39
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,400
you can dress differently.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,750
How differently can I dress?

41
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,190
My clothes are all sports style.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,680
The couple dresses.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,630
Not the same clothes,
but the same color.

44
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,400
Just to declare your sovereignty.

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,620

47
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,630
Hello.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,460
I have no money for any loan, house

49
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,680
or membership.

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,960
It’s me, Li He.

51
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,960
How do you know my number?

52
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,520
Zeyu told you, right?

53
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,030
Just forget about that.

54
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,360
Do me a favor. It’s urgent.

55
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,960
What’s the benefit for me?

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,870
Zeyu gave me

57
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,870
a book of Grade 10
Comprehensive Science.

58
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,630
Are you tired of living?

59
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,800
Ask me for benefits?

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,750
Do you forget who I am?
I’m the boss of Sen Yong.

61
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,000
Don’t you want to see

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,910
the sun coming up on next Monday?

63
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,680
Yuan Caixi is my sister.

64
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,750
Fine.

65
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,000
I’ll buy you drumstick for one week.

66
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,520
No problem.

67
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,400
Go ahead. What’s the matter?

68
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,910
Take a look for me

69
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,190
what color your sister’s
dress is tomorrow.

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,840
That’s it?

71
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,390
No problem. I’ll tell you
the first time, okay?

72
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,560
I’ll hung up.

73
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,950
My sister is wearing a green jacket

74
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,480
and a pair of blue jeans.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,870
Remember the drumsticks next week.

76
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,510
What are you doing here again?

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,510
I just tidied your cabinet yesterday.

78
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,830
And you messed it up like a dump.

79
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,800
Listen.

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,190
Tidy it up well after you finish it.

81
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,360
Got it, Dad.

82
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,390
Your mom will kick my ass
when she sees the mess.

83
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,160
Remember it,

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,750
if your mom kicks my ass,
I’ll kick your ass.

85
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,430
Just leave me alone.

86
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,360
This one is not bad.

87
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,190
Ye Jingxi.

88
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,560
You are too well-shaped.

89
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,680
Handsome boy looks good in everything.

90
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,430
Right?

91
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,630
Coming.

92
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,870
Bear.

93
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,600
Look, not only me...

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,390
Monitor.

95
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,240
Don’t you realize

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,430
our clothes are in the same color today?

97
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,360
This is called a connection

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,480
and a special chemistry.

99
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,480
Why are you here?

100
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,240
Monitor asked us to help you.

101
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,920
Yeah.

102
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,480
Yuan.

103
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,870
What’s the situation?

104
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,800
Why are they here?

105
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,950
Didn’t you tell me

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,240
that you have a problem with
the schoolwork

107
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,480
and the movie lines?

108
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
I think that you also need training
for your physical fitness

109
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,070
and it’s too much for me
to do it on my own.

110
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,510
So I asked them to help.

111
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,560
Is that okay?

112
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,870
But I’m a celebrity.

113
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,360
What if they leak my address

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,870
and take photos of me secretly?

115
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,600
Who will take photos of you?

116
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
-Why would we want your photos?
-Why would we want your photos?

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,630
Yeah.

118
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,800
Don’t waste time. Let’s get started.

119
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,480
I’m hungry.

120
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,430
Chang your shoes.

121
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,600
Chang your shoes, Li He.

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,240
It’s quite big here.

123
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,720
Chang your shoes.

124
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
There is also a yard here.

125
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,240
-Your house is not bad.
-Don’t go out.

126
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,480
Don’t come in then.

127
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,040
What are you doing?

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Just stay outside.

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,190
Open the door.

130
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,270
I’ll count three.

131
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,560
Three, two, one.

132
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,680
Come on, Yuan.

133
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,120
Have some apples. It’s very sweet.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,800
I’ll eat it later.

135
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,430
It’s not for you.

136
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,480
It’s not that sweet,

137
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,750
but pretty dry.

138
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
The water is quite sweet.

139
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,040
Really?

140
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,510
Yeah.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,950
I don’t need you two to be my coaches.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,120
You don’t need coaches like us?

143
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,040
Are you sure?

144
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah.

145
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,270
You want to be an actor?

146
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,070
Yeah.

147
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,310
Look how

148
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,360
skinny you are.

149
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,160
How does that look good in the camera?

150
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,000
You will look thin and weak when you
stand beside other people.

151
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,390
All right.

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,950
By the way, have you

153
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,870
remembered

154
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,160
the movie lines?

155
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,830
The lines...

156
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,800
Oh.

157
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,600
I find it unbelievable
that someone would refuse to swim.

158
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,920
Getting in water, being closed to
the heart of the ocean

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,120
is the most amazing feeling
I’ve ever felt.

160
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,950
Well?

161
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,310
It’s on the first page
of your movie lines.

162
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,950
Oh, right.

163
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,600
I remember it.

164
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,480
Look at this.

165
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,390
We still have one month

166
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,680
before your audition.

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,270
So I made this, Ye Jingxi’s
Short-term Improvement Plan.

168
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,120
That’s right.

169
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,070
We will come here

170
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,160
to tutor you every weekend.

171
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,830
When we are not here,

172
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,950
you can review by yourself

173
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,720
according to the Plan.

174
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,750
Let’s try to get this audition.

175
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,560
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

176
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,630
If you can make it.

177
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,080
Yeah.

178
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,030
I will try.

179
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,000
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,200
It’s a good thing
that you are aware of it.

181
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,320
Come on.

182
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,510
It’s very hard to be trained by us.

183
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,550
It requires both your physical strength
and your brain power.

184
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,390
Ye Jingxi, come on.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,240
Keep smiling.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,960
Come on, let’s get started.

187
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,540
(Monday)

188
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,980
(Tuesday)

189
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,140
(Wednesday)

190
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,540
(Thursday)

191
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,740
(Friday)

192
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,510
Why are you here again?

193
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you dress like this at home?

194
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,150
Never judge a book by its cover.

195
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,670
This is who he is.

196
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,630
This is my house.

197
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,000
I can wear whatever I want.

198
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,750
What’s more,

199
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,960
can’t you see

200
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,910
that you are not welcomed at all?

201
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,150
Fine, let’s go, monitor.

202
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,960
-Let’s go.
-Ah?

203
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,670
Don’t go.

204
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,440
Why? We should leave.

205
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
Didn’t you ask us to leave?

206
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,080
Yeah.

207
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,240
I was kidding.

208
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,750
Ah?

209
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,670
-Really?
-Please come in, come in.

210
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,630
-Yeah.
-Can we come in?

211
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,320
You can.

212
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,840
I haven’t changed my shoes.

213
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
No need.

214
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,630
Yeah, you should take off
your shoes, Li He.

215
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,270
Don’t bother. Feel free to come in.

216
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,670
-I’ll come in with my shoes.
-Go ahead.

217
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
Come in. Come in.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,670
It feels good.

219
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,960
Have a try.

220
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,200
This carpet is quite soft.

221
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,030
Get us some dry apples like last time.

222
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,960
-We don’t want to tire him out.
-Yeah, we don’t want to tire him out.

223
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,080
-Go ahead. Hurry up.
-Hurry up.

224
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
He really takes himself as a celebrity?

225
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,550
Do some exercise.

226
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,030
-I can’t.
-Can you do it or not?

227
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,670
It’s easy for you to talk.

228
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:11,790
You do it.

229
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,030
Pull-up

230
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,600
is a multi-joint exercise

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
that is great for upper body

232
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
and waist strength.

233
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,510
That’s why I asked you to do it.

234
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,270
Look at me.

235
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,240
How is it going?

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Do you need some rest?

237
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
Yuan, go back.

238
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,270
Don’t go, look at me, monitor.

239
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,550
-We are okay. You can go back.
-Don’t you want some water?

240
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,670
-Monitor.
-It’s okay.

241
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,750
One.

242
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,120
Come on, keep your waist straight. Two.

243
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,720
Come on.

244
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,910
I find it unbelievable
that someone would refuse to...

245
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,120
To swim.

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
In water... of the ocean...

247
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,750
Go on.

248
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,000
You guys work well together.

249
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,390
Don’t know what you are
talking about. English, please.

250
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,630
Fine.

251
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,200
I find it...

252
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,390
That someone would...

253
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,440
In water...

254
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
Close to the heart...

255
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,860
(Monday)

256
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,780
(Tuesday)

257
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,540
(Wednesday)

258
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,380
(Thursday)

259
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,740
(Friday)

260
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,580
(Monday)

261
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,700
(Tuesday)

262
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,300
(Wednesday)

263
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,380
(Thursday)

264
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,540
(Friday)

265
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,480
(Jingxi’s Short-term Improvement Plan)
After three weeks of training,

266
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,200
I think his physical fitness
is up to standard.

267
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,390
The next step is...

268
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,790
Next, his English pronunciation

269
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,120
needs to be corrected.

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,440
There are some problems with
his grammar and pronunciation.

271
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,030
Yuan, come here.

272
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,790
What?

273
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
-What’s the matter, Bear?
-What do you want to do?

274
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,600
I need Yuan to help me with the lines.

275
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
What do you mean?

276
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,240
No, wait!

277
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,030
-What’s the matter?
-Why do you close the door?

278
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,760
-Open it.
-Open the door.

279
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,790
-Ye Jingxi, what are you doing?
-Hold on. I need to rehearse my lines.

280
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,750
It won’t take long.

281
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,750
-Three, two, one.
-Just ten minutes.

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,790
-Stop it!
-You guys have some food first.

283
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,440
-Don’t throw yourself against the door.
-It won’t work even you do that.

284
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,870
-Open the door!
-For the last time.

285
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,440
Open the door!

286
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Hurry up.

287
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,000
Li He!

288
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,390
A pair of four.

289
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Bomb.

290
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,030
Do you know how to play?
Don’t play if you can’t.

291
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,480
How do you know that I can’t play?

292
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,750
I love to use bomb.
I have a lot of them.

293
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,390
Do you have a problem with it?

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,390
Counter bomb.

295
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,000
Counter again.

296
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,840
Bro, we are both farmers.

297
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,270
Why do you use bomb against me?

298
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,550
Is there any problem?

299
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,480
No problem.

300
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,120
We will keep blowing you up

301
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
if you keep rehearsing lines
with monitor.

302
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,720
Can you please relax?

303
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,030
We were only rehearsing my lines.

304
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,270
Do you need to lock the door

305
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,150
to rehearse your lines?

306
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,910
Yeah, you can ask me
to rehearse your lines.

307
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,030
I can act as an animal.

308
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,870
You only wore a turtle suit.

309
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,320
You little bastard, who told you that

310
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,390
I wore turtle suit?

311
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,630
Don’t you lay a hand on me?

312
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,480
I just did. So what?

313
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,030
What do you want to do?

314
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,550
That’s what I want to ask you.

315
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,720
You are such a smug at school.

316
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,120
Do you really take yourself
as a big star?

317
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,080
Am I not a big star? I am.

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,360
You...

319
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,480
But there is a huge difference between

320
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,030
your image in public and private.

321
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,360
None of your business.

322
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,320
Listen,

323
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,670
just go home if you can take a hint.

324
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
You’ve got some nerve.

325
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Are you driving us away?

326
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:20,670
Yeah.

327
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,720
Look,

328
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,080
I’ll kick your ass
even with monitor being here!

329
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,600
Mm-hmm.

330
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,510
Come on!

331
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,840
-I’ll teach you a lesson.
-No, come on.

332
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
-What do you two want to do?
-I’ll see if you can keep being a smug.

333
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,630
What do you two want to do?

334
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,960
You three, stop it!

335
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
Get off me!

336
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,910
What are you wearing on your head?

337
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,910
You’ve played long enough.

338
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,790
I’ll answer the phone.

339
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,320
We’ll fight after I come back.
Wait for me.

340
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,270
Wait for me.

341
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,320
Don’t leave.

342
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,390
Hello, Bawan. What’s the matter?

343
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,270
Ye, when are you coming to class?

344
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,120
Didn’t I tell you I won’t
take classes these days?

345
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,480
What’s wrong

346
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,720
with you two?

347
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,510
Sit properly.

348
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,910
I mean, you are here to be teachers.

349
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,200
We should tutor Bear.

350
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,910
Can you watch your attitude?

351
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,480
What’s wrong with our attitude?

352
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,630
Have we not behaved well?

353
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,960
That’s how Bai treats us.

354
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
How does he treat you?

355
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
With a pair of 4 and a bomb?

356
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,670
He would blow me up
even I play a pair of 3.

357
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,550
Are you…

358
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,790
If you want us
to have the right attitude,

359
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,390
you shouldn’t rehearse lines
with him behind the locked door.

360
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,910
The basic risk awareness is necessary.

361
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,510
Yeah.

362
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,000
I didn’t lock the door.

363
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,550
Can he lock the door as he wants?

364
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,550
Can’t you open the door and come out?

365
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,550
Monitor, you used to
hold Li He by his collar.

366
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah.

367
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,080
Now you’ve become a lamb.

368
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,840
Yeah.

369
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:46,870
No.

370
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,750
Well, I’m different from Ye Jingxi.

371
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,790
What? Are you on my side?

372
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,030
I’m on your side, but Ye Jingxi...

373
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,270
Fine. All right.

374
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,790
I’ll censor myself first.

375
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,750
I’ll try to be a good teacher for Bear

376
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,000
and correct my attitude.

377
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,480
I won’t be led by the nose.

378
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,840
That’s also what you two
should do, okay?

379
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,150
Okay.

380
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,670
Ye, this teacher is really good.

381
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,910
Are you not attending any class?

382
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,510
No.

383
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,840
Keep asking for leave for me.

384
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,200
Still?

385
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,030
Ye, Ms. Hua keeps asking me.

386
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,270
I can’t take it anymore.

387
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,870
Ye, don’t...

388
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,270
Hello, Ye?

389
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,120
How’s it going? Whose turn now?

390
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
Go on.

391
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,630
It’s your turn to recite your lines.

392
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,080
The three of us will
supervise you together.

393
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,390
Yeah.

394
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,200
Right now?

395
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Yeah.

396
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Do you hear that?

397
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,440
Take that thing off your nose.

398
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,670
Take that thing off your nose.

399
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,630
And the one on your head.

400
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,600
The one on your head.

401
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,120
Don’t copy me.

402
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,910
What a repeater.

403
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
Aren’t we on the same side?

404
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,360
Yuan, haven’t I just recited the lines?

405
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,270
We can...

406
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:54,870
Get started now.

407
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,750
What’s wrong?

408
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
Can’t Ye Jingxi come?

409
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,000
Sorry, Ms. Rou.

410
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,550
Jingxi still has a cold.

411
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,510
Is he still having a fever?

412
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,360
Yeah.

413
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,910
His fever has been lasting

414
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,150
for days.

415
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,720
All right, tell him to have more rest.

416
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,550
Thank you, Ms. Rou.

417
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,510
I owe you a lot.

418
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,440
It has been a hard day.

419
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,960
It’s pretty tiring.

420
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,390
It’s all right. It’s just like
a normal school day.

421
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,550
I’m going to

422
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,080
use a different way tomorrow

423
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,390
and let him familiarize himself with
his partner’s lines.

424
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,120
That is good.

425
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,200
Teach me. I also want to learn it.

426
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,120
No problem. It’s rare
that you want to learn.

427
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,000
Why are you sighing, monitor?

428
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,910
Ye Jingxi is getting better very fast.

429
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,790
-Yes.
-He is the best actor for this role

430
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,200
in terms of strength,
popularity and price-performance.

431
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Well...

432
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,590
-Won’t you two go home?
-I think he is right.

433
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,310
I’m about to get home.
Why don’t you go home?

434
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,160
Ah.

435
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,790
Ah.

436
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,070
I’ve been enjoying
the conversation too much

437
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,270
and haven’t noticed
that we have already gone so far.

438
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,270
Not noticed? I’ve told you many times.

439
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,550
Okay, let’s go. Let us walk you home.

440
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,510
Come back.

441
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,110
I don’t need you two to walk me home.

442
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,830
I can go home by myself, okay? Bye-bye.

443
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:36,550
Why are you laughing?

444
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,310
Just go home.

445
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,790
Are you not going home?

446
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,440
None of your business.

447
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,000
It’s hard to keep on studying.

448
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,400
You don’t need to
send monitor home tomorrow.

449
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,920
Thank you for your concern.

450
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,960
I think you should go home
and have some walnuts

451
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,680
for your brain’s sake.

452
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,440
I don’t even bother to argue with you.

453
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,720
You go back first.

454
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,400
Why should I listen to you?

455
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,240
Can’t you see who the third wheel is?

456
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,830
You mean I’m the third wheel?

457
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,440
Yeah.

458
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,920
I know what you are up to.

459
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,310
Old fox.

460
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,270
Well.

461
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,590
You can’t recognize

462
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,070
the way home without having walnuts?

463
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,720
Where are you going?

464
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,960
None of your business.

465
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,830
I’ll make a detour.

466
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,240
Why does it take you so long?

467
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,270
Did you climb your way back?

468
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,400
You are fast.

469
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,270
But you still have to wait for me
to open the door for you.

470
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,240
Ning Zeyu.

471
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,720
I team up with you
to deal with Ye Jingxi,

472
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,400
but it doesn’t mean
our problem is resolved.

473
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,830
Open the door for me.

474
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,350
Oh.

475
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,030
Hey!

476
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,640
What are you doing?

477
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,270
I don’t know if you are reminding me

478
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,590
or reminding yourself.

479
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,510
Or you misunderstood something.

480
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,000
Listen,

481
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,880
I’m good.

482
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,680
But the gap in our IQ

483
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,830
decides that we can never be friends.

484
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,880
Speak louder!

485
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,440
See you later, poor guy.

486
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,960
Speak louder, what?

487
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,160
Don’t go! Open the door!

488
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,030
Open the door!

489
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,750
Ning Zeyu!

490
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,240
Ning Zeyu!

491
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,830
Little brat.

492
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,030
Well...

493
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,920
Open the door, Zeyu!

494
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,720
Zeyu.

495
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,200
Ms. Rou. I’m so sorry.

496
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,000
Jingxi still has a cold.

497
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,640
Is he having a fever?

498
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,590
Yeah, his condition is really bad.

499
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,400
That’s why he can’t
come to take your class.

500
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,270
He doesn’t come to class.
Why did you even hire me?

501
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,000
It’s not like that. Ms. Rou, Ms. Rou!

502
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,750
Ms. Hua.

503
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,960
That’s nonsense.
You even run wild with him.

504
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,680
Did I hire you

505
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,110
to play with Ye Jingxi?

506
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,000
Don’t you know how important
the movie audition is?

507
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,920
Ms. Hua.

508
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,720
Actually,
his classmates are pretty nice.

509
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,920
They can help him a bit.

510
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,920
Help him?

511
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,160
Do they know how to act?

512
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,920
Do they know that Jingxi’s right cheek
looks better than his left cheek,

513
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,400
and he should face his right cheek
to the camera?

514
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Do they know Jingxi is easy to
get nervous before shooting

515
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,830
and he needs hot milk to fall asleep?

516
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,030
They know nothing.

517
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,640
A bunch of little kids.
They don’t know anything.

518
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,070
They thought they could help Jingxi.

519
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,200
Bawan.

520
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,070
Do you have a problem with your brain?

521
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,590
You really pissed me off!

522
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,640
Jingxi, open the door.
I know you are at home!

523
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,350
Open the door!

524
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,550
Yuan!

525
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,960
Don’t open the door.

526
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,830
I think Jingxi is not at home.

527
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,070
Why doesn’t he open the door?

528
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,750
Let’s go, Ms. Hua. He’s not at home.

529
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,640
What’s happening here?

530
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,160
What’s wrong?

531
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,000
What’s wrong?

532
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,400
He turned his phone off.

533
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,790
A woman?

534
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,270
She is my agent.

535
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,830
Then why don’t you open the door?

536
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,110
-I don’t open the door for your good.
-Let me ask you,

537
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,350
what has Jingxi been doing recently?

538
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,030
Why?

539
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,750
Nothing.

540
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:44,720
It’s for your good anyway.

541
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,590
Jingxi has been studying hard recently.

542
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,550
He better be.

543
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,960
Jingxi.

544
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,030
Listen,

545
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,480
you should know
when to stop horsing around.

546
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
You can try to skip

547
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,350
Ms. Rou’s class tomorrow.

548
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,510
She is threatening me again.

549
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,310
Jingxi.

550
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,040
Do you believe
I’ll take your phone away?

551
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,030
Open the door.

552
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,950
If you don’t open the door,

553
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,160
do you believe
I’ll take your phone away?

554
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,350
Ms. Hua, Jingxi is just getting cranky.

555
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,750
He’ll turn the phone on in a while.
And you...

556
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,550
Jingxi, open the door!

557
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:08,960
Ms. Hua.

558
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,550
You’ve been knocking the door
for a while and no one answers.

559
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,590
Jingxi is definitely not at home.

560
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,000
Ms. Hua, let’s leave.

561
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,350
It’s not good to make a big deal of it.

562
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Let’s go, Ms. Hua.

563
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,640
Don’t worry, you got me.

564
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,920
She seems to have left.

565
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,920
She left.

566
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,550
She almost got us.

567
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,350
Why didn’t you open the door?

568
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,920
I didn’t open the door...

569
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,440
It’s for your good.
Just keep it in mind.

570
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,640
Why hasn’t she left yet?

571
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,440
Don’t open the door!

572
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,000
Why are you here so late?

573
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,440
Why do you turn your phone off?

574
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,400
It’s you guys.

575
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,510
You are like this

576
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,790
to hide from your agent?

577
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,550
You really scared me.

578
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,920
Why didn’t you answer the phone?

579
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,160
My phone is in my bag. I didn’t hear it.

580
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,640
I thought you were rehearsing your lines

581
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
with monitor
behind the locked door again.

582
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,350
If you are really aboveboard,

583
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,750
just explain it to her.
Why couldn’t you do that?

584
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,110
What do you know?
I did it for Yuan’s sake.

585
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,440
You should make it clear
for her sake.

586
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
All right, let’s start to study.

587
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,790
Hurry up.

588
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,830
She asked you to study.

589
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,640
Recite your lines.

590
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,640
The special training is finally over.

591
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
Wait.

592
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,440
It’s not over yet.

593
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,300
Body management

594
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,070
won’t end until
the last day of your life.

595
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,680
You still can’t eat
whatever you want.

596
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,110
I’ll keep an eye on you.

597
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,240
-Yuan.
-Yeah.

598
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,790
Let’s go to the concert. I have tickets.

599
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:14,830
It’s a really popular boy group.

600
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,550
What’s good about the boy group?

601
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,110
It’s better to see me running.

602
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,350
I’m much hotter
than them when I’m running.

603
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,200
Don’t forget that our exam result
will come out tomorrow.

604
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,160
Zeyu is right.

605
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,550
We should wait

606
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,200
until the exam result
comes out tomorrow.

607
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,350
I’ll leave now.

608
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,240
Yuan, let me take you home.

609
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:35,750
-No need.
-No need.

610
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,270
Don’t bother, Bear.

611
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Someone will take me home today.

612
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,750
-What?
-What?

613
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,640
Yeah.

614
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,960
Surprise!

615
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,790
Do you miss me, guys?

616
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Hey.

617
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,270
That’s too much.

618
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,070
Li He.

619
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,070
Lin Chuan.

620
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,400
Chuan. Chuan.

621
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,830
What’s wrong?

622
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,680
Did I read this right?

623
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,590
You read it right.

624
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,960
I...

625
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:26,160
Passed the exam!

626
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:29,240
-I passed the English exam!
-You passed the English exam!

627
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,110
Wow.

628
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,510
One moment I thought I got 9 points.

629
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,590
But I got 90 points.

630
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,350
Monitor.

631
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,790
I passed my English exam.

632
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,680
Good.

633
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
How did you do that?

634
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,350
Oh my.

635
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,590
Monitor, Yuan, wait a minute.

636
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,120
Tell me,

637
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,790
when will I get more points
in my English exam?

638
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,480
What’s Ning Zeyu’s score?

639
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,590
He still gets the first place anyway.
What’s the difference?

640
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,960
Look at this question, this...

641
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,030
Our three-year friendship is not
as important as Zeyu’s English paper.

642
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Zeyu.

643
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,510
Did you throw the exam on purpose?

644
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,440
You are still number one,

645
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,750
but your score drops significantly.

646
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,000
Looks like I can surpass you soon.

647
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,750
I’m still number one
even my score drops.

648
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,640
Monitor, shouldn’t you reflect on it?

649
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,790
This is who you are.

650
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,480
Well, are you trying to motivate me
in a different way?

651
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,110
No.

652
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,830
I’m just mocking you.

653
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,400
Yuan.

654
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,270
Look at my score.

655
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,920
Well done, Bear. You’ve gotten
40 more points.

656
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,680
Thanks to your help.

657
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,310
To express my gratitude,

658
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,350
come to my house this weekend.

659
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,720
I’ll treat you to a fancy meal.

660
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,510
How is it?

661
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,510
Just do me the favor.

662
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,510
This weekend...

663
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,030
Yeah.

664
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,790
Okay.

665
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,030
I’ll do you the favor.

666
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,680
Hurry up.

667
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,920
Don’t hit me. I’m the one
with the green hat.

668
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:18,880
Go ahead.

669
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
It’s a waste of time.

670
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,960
E-sports games can relax the brain,

671
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
make the cerebral cortex more active,

672
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,790
stimulate the secretion
of the pituitary gland

673
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,270
so as to increase happiness.

674
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,070
You can play for a while

675
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,480
without affecting your study.

676
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,400
-Yuan Caixi.
-Yes?

677
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,350
Keep making up.

678
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,880
Playing games can increase happiness.

679
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,440
You can even make that up
to encourage me.

680
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,000
I’m really moved.

681
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,720
I just want you to recover soon.

682
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,000
The competition will be fun in this way.

683
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,920
Otherwise, I won’t feel accomplishment
even I win.

684
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,920
Fine.

685
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,350
I’ll take my monitor’s order.

686
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,640
I’ll go to recover myself.

687
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,240
Okay.

688
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay.

689
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,790
I think we can win this time.
You are number two.

690
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,200
I’m number two. Don’t touch me.
I’m number two.

691
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,830
I’m number two now. Don’t touch me.

692
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,270
I didn’t touch you.

693
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,200
I fell into the volcano.

694
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,160
Use the props, don’t...

695
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,000
Don’t save them.

696
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,760
If I don’t save the props,

697
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,160
how I can hit him for you

698
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,440
when someone tries to surpass you?

699
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,240
It’s right time to use it now.

700
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,310
Which one is the brake?

701
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,050
Are you serious?

702
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,880
You’ve been playing for so many days
and you still can’t remember the keys?

703
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
I forgot it.

704
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,320
You are about to be surpassed.

705
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
I have no props left.

706
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,310
I’ll use my ass to hit him.
You are really weak.

707
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,510
I’m weak?

708
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,070
Are you not weak? Number two.

709
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,790
Look who is weak.

710
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,200
I would have been number one
if it weren’t for you.

711
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,440
Didn’t I guard your back?

712
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,750
Fine, play by yourself.

713
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,790
You play with him. I’m not playing.

714
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,200
I’m pissed off.

715
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Why do you...

716
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,550
Maybe it’s called talent.

717
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,200
I’m gonna have a piece of pizza.

718
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,640
Well done, Zeyu.

719
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:17,960
Li He!

720
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,110
Don’t eat it!

721
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,960
-Monitor, what’s wrong?
-What’s wrong?

722
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,720
-I feel uncomfortable.
-How?

723
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,750
What’s wrong?

724
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,160
Pizza...

725
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,000
Pizza?

726
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,880
-What’s wrong with you?
-Does your stomach hurt?

727
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,200
Are you feeling uncomfortable, too?

728
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,880
There is a something wrong with
the pizza. Call 120.

729
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,750
It’s too late to call 120 now.
Let’s get a taxi.

730
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,880
Are you okay?

731
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,310
You go ahead first.

732
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,920
I’ll ask Bawan to pick me up later.

733
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,590
Are you going to wait for
Bawan at this point?

734
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,400
Go ahead.

735
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,030
The media will follow me if I go.

736
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,480
I don’t want Yuan to be exposed.

737
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Go now.

738
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,640
I’ve called a taxi for you.
It’ll be here in three minutes.

739
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,110
Take care of him.

740
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,240
Li He.

741
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,750
Take good care of monitor.

742
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,550
Rest assured.

743
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,790
Are you okay?

744
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,180
(The A&E Center)

745
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,440
(EM Observation Room)
Doctor!

746
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,240
Thank you.

747
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,160
You’re welcome.

748
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,060
(Emergency)

749
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,060
(In-patient)

750
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,200
Is she okay, doctor?

751
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,750
No big deal.

752
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,480
Fortunately, she didn’t eat a lot.

753
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,110
She spit it all out.

754
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,590
Just go home and rest for a few days.

755
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,720
-Thank you, doctor.
-You’re welcome.

756
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,550
What’s wrong? You look serious.

757
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,960
I’m worried about you.

758
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,440
Are you feeling better?

759
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,750
Yeah.

760
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,830
I’ll try the food first

761
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,880
next time.

762
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,830
Then nothing will happen to you.

763
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,000
Are you a Silver Needle?

764
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,830
All right, go to check Bear.

765
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,030
I want to know how he is doing.

766
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,110
Okay.

767
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,750
I’ll go first.

768
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,440
Have some rest.

769
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,830
Yeah.

770
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,880
Call me if you need anything.

771
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,440
Okay.

772
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,400
Why don’t you go inside?

773
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,200
They won’t let me in.

774
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,030
How is monitor doing?

775
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,720
She will be fine after some rest.

776
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,350
I mean,

777
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,510
you brought him here.
Why don’t they let you in?

778
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,110
I don’t know.

779
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,960
That’s strange.

780
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,350
We are not fans.

781
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,590
We are his classmates.

782
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,720
Why don’t they let us in?

783
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,270
You really can’t go inside.

784
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,960
Ms. Hua said no one is allowed in.

785
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,880
Please help me.

786
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,830
I’ll let you know as soon as
Jingxi wakes up.

787
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,830
I think his condition
is not that simple.

788
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,030
I want to check monitor first.

789
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,830
Doctor, how’s he doing?

790
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,000
Well, he is stable.

791
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,310
Look, his body temperature is normal.

792
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
Take medicine on time
and stay for observation for a few days.

793
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,880
He can be released
if nothing else is wrong.

794
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,000
Thank you.

795
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:08,960
Doctor.

796
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,350
Please pay more attention
to his privacy.

797
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
Of course, we know that.

798
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,030
When I was young,

799
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,590
my parents were busy with work

800
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,790
and they had no time to take care of me.

801
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,960
I had to order takeaway
when I was a kid.

802
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:46,960
For safety,

803
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,350
I always ordered a meal for three people

804
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,830
so as to let others know

805
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
that I was not home alone.

806
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,200
But one day,

807
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,920
I suddenly realized

808
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,880
that I didn’t need to
order a meal for three people

809
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,800
because I have three good friends

810
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,670
who are staying with me.

811
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,280
Ning Zeyu helps me with my study.

812
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,880
Li He helps me with my exercise.

813
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,400
Yuan’s mother makes soup for me.

814
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,880
Yuan

815
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,030
is my good friend.

816
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,510
Sister.

817
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,110
I find

818
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,800
that I am not alone anymore.

819
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,320
You ungrateful brat.

820
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,480
Bawan and I have been
staying by your side all the time.

821
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,590
Do we mean nothing to you?

822
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,320
Sister.

823
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,800
Can’t you show some sympathy?

824
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,960
I’ve been rehearsing it many times.

825
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,110
This is the most touching words
I can think of.

826
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,280
Why do you have no reaction at all?

827
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,400
What sympathy?

828
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,440
Wait for me.

829
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,230
Over there.

830
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,510
Are you okay?

831
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,000
How’s Bear doing?

832
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
Forget about him.
Take care of yourself first.

833
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,840
He should be fine, right?

834
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
He should be fine.

835
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,440
I guess it’s for his image’s sake,

836
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
they won’t let us visit him.

837
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,440
What?

838
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,150
Ms. Hua won’t let us in.

839
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,030
We can’t blame her.

840
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,010
Several girls out there

841
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,510
have recognize him.

842
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,400
They want to take pictures.

843
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
Bawan can’t stop them at all.

844
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,710
Just for a while,

845
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,150
there are all kinds of
photos of him online.

846
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,710
The most important thing

847
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,110
is that someone frames him
for having alcoholism.

848
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,360
I remember Bear said

849
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,000
that the happiest thing for him

850
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,000
is to come to Sen Yong and meet me.

851
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
Because he thinks
he finally has friends.

852
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,670
But at this point,

853
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
we can’t stay by his side or visit him.

854
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
What should we do?

855
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,670
-Hello, monitor.
-Hello, Bawan.

856
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,550
How’s Bear doing now?

857
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,150
He is awake now.

858
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,110
Well, Ms. Hua wants you to come.

859
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,670
Has the big star woken up?

860
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,000
First of all,

861
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,480
thank you for taking care of Jingxi.

862
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:37,840
It’s nothing.

863
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,480
You helped him a lot,

864
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,150
but I hope you can understand

865
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,190
that

866
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,110
he is not an ordinary person.

867
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,190
As a celebrity,

868
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,070
the company has plans for him.

869
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,590
He also has his responsibility
to the society.

870
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,480
We hired a teacher for him.

871
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,710
He can’t skip class as he wants.

872
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:55,960
And you

873
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,840
can’t decide on your own

874
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,190
that you are qualified

875
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,800
to teach a celebrity
how to act professionally.

876
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,360
You think you are helping him.

877
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,000
But what’s the result?

878
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,920
Help him get in the hospital?

879
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,070
Ms. Hua.

880
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,590
Yuan Caixi also got sick.

881
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,710
Would anyone get sick

882
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:13,710
if Jingxi took the classes
as I told him?

883
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,590
Jingxi is a celebrity.
He has responsibilities.

884
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,840
But

885
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,760
it’s only his profession
to be a celebrity.

886
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,920
No matter what,

887
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,800
he is still a nineteen-year-old
high school student.

888
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,070
I’ve been his agent for years.

889
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,110
Do you think I don’t know it?

890
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,190
You are still young.

891
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,920
You have many ideas

892
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,710
and a lot of things that you want to do.

893
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,230
But everyone

894
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,230
needs to bear the responsibilities
and consequences for their choices.

895
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,280
They need to figure out what they want

896
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,510
and pay the price for it.

897
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,800
Jingxi

898
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,150
chose to be a celebrity by himself.

899
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,920
Then he should
pay the corresponding price.

900
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,360
So do you.

901
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,230
We got it, Ms. Hua.

902
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,630
We will pay more attention to it.

903
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,760
All right, go inside.

904
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,280
Okay.

905
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,000
Be careful.

906
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,960
He just vomited.

907
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,110
Okay, Aunt.

908
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,880
Thank you.

909
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:23,840
Be careful.

910
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:26,960
Yuan!

911
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,320
Are you feeling better?

912
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,710
Thanks to you, she kept vomiting.

913
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,670
What do you mean by that?

914
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,320
How would I know
that the pizza has expired?

915
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,670
Besides,

916
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,590
I also suffered a lot, okay?

917
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,190
Remember to clear
your refrigerator next time

918
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,840
and don’t eat any expired food.

919
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,590
Do you hear that, Bawan?

920
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,400
We are telling to you.

921
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,110
Ye Jingxi.

922
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,670
Yeah.

923
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,920
In fact,

924
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,510
Ms. Hua asked us to come.

925
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,190
Ye Jingxi.

926
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,230
Bear.

927
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,110
Bear.

928
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,400
Yeah.

929
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,550
Maybe the things

930
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,880
aren’t as simple as we think they are.

931
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,190
We didn’t consider the consequences.

932
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,440
So,

933
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,440
you should listen to
Ms. Hua from now on.

934
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
Do whatever she asks you to do.

935
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,880
Don’t be rebellious, got it?

936
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,760
Oh.

937
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,710
You are also on the side of my company?

938
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,480
We are not on your company’s side.

939
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,190
We mean it.

940
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,280
At first,

941
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,840
I thought you took yourself

942
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,150
as a big star

943
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,230
and you looked like a smug.

944
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
Right now,

945
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,480
I realize it’s not easy for you, either.

946
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,070
Come on, I think you can make it.

947
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,360
Duh.

948
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,230
Duh.

949
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,110
What?

950
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
Time to get an injection.

951
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,550
Oh.

952
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,510
Time for an injection.

953
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,000
An injection, right. I should leave now.

954
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,320
You two should give me some privacy.

955
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,400
We are all men. What are you afraid of?

956
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,150
We are not your fans.
We won’t take pictures of you in secret.

957
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,400
Hurry up, take your pants off.

958
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,280
Turn around.

959
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,190
Give him an injection.

960
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,630
Thanks.

961
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,920
