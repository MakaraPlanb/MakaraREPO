Li He didn’t make into the final?

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,590
We don’t want to believe it, either.

19
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,230
But that’s the truth.

20
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,710
We’ve never expected that

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,560
Li He would lose a competition.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,040
Right. It’s as unbelievable as

23
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,590
Zeyu failing an exam.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
How’s he doing now?

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,360
I’ve never seen Li He act like this.

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,190
He’s so horrifyingly silent.

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Yuan, if only you were there…

28
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,380
My sister was there.

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,560
She could have watched the race
if she didn’t pass out.

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Yuan…!

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,900
I’m fine. I just fainted.

32
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,360
I just needed some rest.

33
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,710
I just don’t get you.

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,430
Now is the time you
need each other the most.

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,800
But you’re hiding from him
while he’s hiding from you.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,750
The result comes out on Friday.

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,710
Wait a bit longer.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,590
Yuan, I understand that
you didn’t tell him

39
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,680
because he were to
compete in the race.

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,190
But now Li He’s race is over.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,800
You can tell him the truth.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,870
Yuan, do you have any idea

43
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,630
how anxious I am being a bystander?

44
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,840
Okay.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,630
I promise you. I’ll tell him
when the result comes out.

46
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,630
Okay, Yuan, so you...

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,710
Han Yayi.

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,870
Fine. I’ll shut up.

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,470
Yuan, take care of yourself.

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,400
I’ll go now.

51
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,430
Come. Have some fruit.

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,470
I’ll pass, aunt.

53
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,870
What? You’re leaving?

54
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,800
Yes.

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
You just arrived.

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,120
Thank you, aunt.

57
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,240
Take some rest.

58
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,870
Ah. Okay.

59
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,680
Mrs. Yuan, I’ll go now.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
You’re both leaving so soon?

61
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Mrs. Yuan, goodbye.

62
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,430
Take it slow.

63
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,750
Only my son wants some fruit.

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,520

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,590

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,590
Come. Have some fruit.

68
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,400
Oh. I’ll pass. You two enjoy.

69
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,080

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,000

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
Zeyu is here.

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,190
Zeyu.

73
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,240
Look. He has been like this
after the race.

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,160
He shuts himself in his room
and he eats nothing.

75
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,510
He ignores us when we talk to him.

76
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,040
Aunt, uncle, don’t worry.

77
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,190
I’ll talk to him.

78
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,870

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,390
when we were in grade 3.

82
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,190

You were so popular that day.

90
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,630
The prettiest girls from other classes
were cheering for you.

91

You won the first champion
for our class.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,830

The record of running.

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,600
And the record of getting zero score
in both math and Chinese.

96
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,750
Zero score in two subjects.

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,430
How did you do that?

98
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,680
You couldn’t possibly get zero score

99

for every test question.

Why are you eavesdropping?

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,390

123
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,190

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,870
Can you kick the ball far?

136
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,790
Then go back and do your homework.

137
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,390

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Then,

139
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,360
I could only look at
the sight of your back on the bench.

140
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,240
To avenge myself,

141
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,910
I could only study hard.

No. 1 Ning Zeyu)

143
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,320
Why did you hold grudges like a girl?

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,510
Why can’t you just get my point?

145
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,440
Of course, I can.

146
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
You could only look at
the sight of other’s back.

Great. It’s my turn now.

148
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Now you’re happy?

149
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,270
If you say so, then I’m really happy.

150
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,440
But if your spirit is so down,

151
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,120
you’re unworthy to be my opponent.

155
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,080
Of course.

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,440
Even Han Yayi has known it.

157
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,240
She must be disappointed.

158
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,030
Dad, mom, you’re both at home.

159
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,840
You came back from the library?

160
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,440
Yes.

161
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,080
What books did you read?

162
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,600
Math and Chinese.

163
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,750
Did you help classmates with questions?

164
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,960
Yes, I did.

165
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,750
Who are the classmates?

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Mom.

167
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,480
Go back to your room.

168
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,480
I’ll call you when dinner is ready.

169
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,480
Okay.

170
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,840
Just say it.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,790
Stop beating around the bush.

172
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,960
You’re seldom at home.

173
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,630
But once you’re at home,

174
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,030
you wanna teach me
how to discipline the kid.

175
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,080
Aren’t you also against him
playing the computer?

176
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,360
I was.

177
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,630
But recently,

178
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,240
I handled a case of cybercrime.

179
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,670
Guess what?

180
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,080
Programming isn’t playing games.

181
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,150
If the kid wants to be a programmer,

182
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,480
just let him be.

183
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,000
He’s a grown-up now.

184
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,670
Whether he regrets it or not
in the future,

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,000
he will be responsible
for today’s choice.

186
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,360
You are

187
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,840
being too restrictive with him.

I’m being restrictive?

189
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,480
So, it’s my fault he’s picked up
bad habits over the last half year?

190
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,240
Explain what you mean.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,630
Stop.

192
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,550
You’re caught in anger right now.

193
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,200
Let’s not discuss this.

194
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,840
Calm down.

195
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,660
(You have a new message)

196
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,720
(Ye Jingxi)
Zeyu, did you win?

197
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,720
I didn’t forget that today’s your final.

198
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,510
You won without any suspense?

199
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,030
Don’t let Li He know.

200
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,440
His race is coming close.

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,630
Can’t let what happened to me
affect him.

202
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,080
I’m not important.
His race is important.

203
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Okay?

204
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,390
I’m begging you.

205
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,360
Please.

206
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,720
♪How lucky I am to be occupied by you♪

207
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,910
How’s the result of Li He’s race?

208
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,080
How are you feeling now?

209
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,240
Are you feeling unwell?

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,120
I’m fine. Where’s Li He?

211
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,550
I don’t know!

212
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,200
Yuan Caixi has known it?

213
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,270
She must be disappointed.

214
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,060
♪Luckily I once met you♪

215
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,360
♪Blinked at a light year away♪

216
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,250
♪The faint radiance is gradually fading♪

217
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,270
Stand up.

218
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,390
Good morning, Miss Luo.

219
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,750
Good morning. Please sit down.

220
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,240
Monitor, Li He asked for
a leave again today?

221
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,200
Ah. Yes.

222
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
Okay. I see.

223
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,120
Turn to Page 89.

224
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,750
Let’s review Unit 6 for the third time.

225
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,360
In the last class, we read an article.

226
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,870
Now, let’s form groups to discuss it.

227
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,790
Let’s brainstorm.

228
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,320
What’s the content?

229
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,440
You must answer the questions

230
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,390
on the blackboard.

231
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,510
Finish reading the article

232
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,600
on Page 132 before next class.

233
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
We’ll analyze its content
in the next class.

234
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,630
Class dismissed.

235
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,270
It’s been three days.

236
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,550
Yuan,

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,030
why don’t you text him

238
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,270
to comfort him?

239
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:43,360
You can just say...

240
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
I want to...

241
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,300
(Sent to Li He)

242
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,550
Why don’t you just ask him out?

243
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,240
Keep reading.

244
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,420
(I’ll wait for you
at the barbecue place at 7:30 PM)

245
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,360
Take care of yourself first.

246
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,630
When will the result come out?

247
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:13,960
The day after tomorrow.

248
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,030
Don’t forget to tell me
when you know it.

249
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,120
Okay.

250
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,200
How about Li He?

251
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,480
Will he get so defeated
that he quits running?

252
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,080
No, he won’t.

253
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,580
If he can’t get back on his feet,

254
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,240
he’s not the Li He we know.

255
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,670
Hey.

256
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,030
Li He has been absent from class

257
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,080
for a week.

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,390
Let him be.

259
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,440
I’m being serious.

260
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,910
I’m not messing around with you.

261
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,670
This is the first time

262
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,320
Li He didn’t even
make it to final since high school.

263
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,440
He has to overcome this barrier
on his own.

264
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,870
Otherwise, he’ll have bigger setbacks.

265
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,360
But we’re his teachers.

266
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,790
-At this point…
-We’ve done what we can.

267
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,390
We’ve comforted, encouraged,

268
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,390
and rooted for him.

269
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,550
We’ve done everything.

270
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,670
But it’s useless.

271
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,150
I told you. He has to
overcome this barrier himself.

272
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,030
Don’t worry.

273
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,000
He can do it.

274
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,750
Wow.

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
You’re eating already?

276
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,670
Bai!

277
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Diced chickens sautéed with peppers!

278
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,360
Let me have a taste.

279
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,670
I got a bit too excited.

280
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,270
Wow, this is great.

281
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,840
It’s tasty.

282
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,000
Wow. Not bad.

283
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,360
Miss Luo.

284
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,200
Sautéed broccoli with garlic.

285
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,720
Diced chickens sautéed with peppers.
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

286
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,080
You have the same dishes.

287
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
You’re cooking together?

288
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,670
Miss Luo,

289
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,910
I told you this won’t work.

290
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,320
You can’t always mooch meals off me.

291
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,240
I know you have an outstanding career.

292
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,640
You received your doctorate overseas.

293
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,880
But,

294
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,750
a girl had better

295
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,030
learn to cook on her own.

296
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:10,920
After all,

297
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,790
we should take care of ourselves.

298
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,240
Right?

299
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,720
What you said

300
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,720
makes a lot of sense.

301
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,510
Mr. Zhang.

302
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,110
Ah?

303
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,070
You haven’t had lunch, right?

304
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:26,750
Right.

305
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,920
Fine.

306
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,310
Let’s leave this to him.

307
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,350
I’ll buy you lunch.

308
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,920
You’ll buy me lunch?

309
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,720
Come on.

310
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,640
Bai,

311
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,440
I’ll enjoy myself then.

312
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,310
Thank you, Miss Luo.

313
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,920
Are you ready?

314
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,880
I’m ready.

315
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,030
Come on!

316
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,270
-Let’s go!
-Go!

317
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,830
Son.

318
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,590
What do you mean? Where are you going?

319
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,440
Home.

320
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,590
Home? But we agreed we’d run today.

321
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,400
It’s too embarrassing to run now.

322
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,110
Why’s that embarrassing?
Because you lost?

323
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,240
Losing is not embarrassing.

324
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,350
Keep the volume down, dad.

325
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Let’s do it another day.

326
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Another day.

327
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,720
This is so embarrassing.

328
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,680
Mom must be hungry.

329
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,790
Stop it.

330
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,590
Don’t use your mom as an excuse.

331
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,070
Come on.

332
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,680
Run.

333
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
Fine.

334
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,640
I’ll run. Who can’t run?

335
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,440
That’s the spirit.

336
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
Run.

337
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Come on.

338
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,000
Run.

339
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,550
I can’t.

340
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,920
Why?

341
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,030
I can’t run when I think about
the moment I lost.

342
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,590
What did you choose to be a runner for?

343
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,110
For being respected?

344
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,510
For being cool?

345
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Then what for

346
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
For…?

347
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,240
For attention?

348
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,400
No.

349
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,480
Then, what’s the reason?

350
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,750
Just tell me what’s on your mind.

351
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,480
Because I love running.

352
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,720
Running makes me feel free.

353
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,200
What’s more?

354
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,350
No more?

355
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,510
Because you love running.

356
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,890
Because running makes you feel free.

357
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,310
Because running makes you feel happy.

358
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,160
So the defeats, pain,

359
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,310
and setbacks for runners

360
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,680
are for others,

361
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,590
not for you?

362
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,440
How’s that possible?

363
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Son,

364
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,640
I hope you can learn a lesson from this.

365
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,680
Everything has two sides.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,480
The good side and the bad side.

367
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,830
The success and the failure.

368
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,830
To succeed,

369
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,110
you have to experience all of these.

370
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,160
Only men who can take failures
can be successful.

371
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,590
Do you understand me?

372
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,030
It’s easy for you to say so.

373
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,550
Our place is full of your trophy cups.

374
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,750
You’ve never lost.

375
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,070
Of course, it’s easy for you to say so.

376
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,920
Nonsense.

377
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,750
Would they give me a medal when I lost?

378
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,070
When I got punched and
my face was swollen,

379
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,200
when I lay there,
unable to get back on my feet,

380
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,790
would they give me a medal?

381
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,790
No one honors failure.

382
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,030
You’re only seeing the medals.

383
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,110
Come on.

384
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,480
It’s not like I don’t understand
your feelings.

385
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
You aspire for success.

386
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I was even more eager for success
than you’re.

387
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,000
I thought I could win

388
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,920
a thousand gold medals.

389
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,070
But I didn’t.

390
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,480
But it’s fine for me.

391
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,880
500 gold medals were replaced

392
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,960
by you.

393
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
The other 500 were replaced by your mom.

394
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,590
My life is good.

395
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,510
What’s the big deal?

396
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,920
This is just life.

397
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,110
I’m sorry, dad.

398
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,750
Don’t be sorry.

399
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,200
Mom and dad don’t want you to be sorry.

400
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,790
Mom and dad hope you can be tough.

401
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,350
You can be strong.

402
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,160
So strong that you can overcome
all the difficulties.

403
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,070
Wipe your tears.

404
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,720
Overcome the difficulties like a man.

405
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,110
Run.

406
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,030
Li He!

407
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,640
Come on!

408
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,310
Oh.

409
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,830
Thank you for walking me to school

410
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:26,790
and escorting me home these days.

411
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
Actually, you’re sick of me, right?

412
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,750
It’s fine. I know.

413
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,480
The result

414
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,030
will come out the day after tomorrow?

415
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,070
Yes.

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,780
It’s fine.

417
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,880
You’ll only have to bear with
my presence for two days.

418
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,960
Hold on there.

419
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,030
I hope it can come true.

420
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
Yuan Caixi.

421
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,790
Li He.

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,480
Why are you here?

423
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,510
Is your leg all right?

424
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,550
It’s my fault that I didn’t show up
for the appointment.

425
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,590
Can I still make it up to you?

426
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,350
I’ll leave the space to you now. Bye.

427
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,270
Monitor,

428
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,070
I don’t know why you suddenly
became so distant.

429
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,510
But I remember my promise to you.

430
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,310
I’ll trust you

431
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,790
and support you.

432
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,030
So, no matter what the reason is,

433
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,550
it’s fine.

434
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,790
If you’re willing to trust me

435
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,590
and tell me,

436
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,790
I’ll be very happy.

437
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,480
If you’re unwilling to tell me,

438
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,200
it’s also fine.

439
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,030
I’ll still trust you.

440
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,440
I’m sorry that
my performance in the race

441
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,920
made you worried.

442
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,720
From now on,

443
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,550
I’ll keep on training hard,

444
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,000
and focusing on

445
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,200
preparing for the exam.

446
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,830
If it’s because
you want to focus more on the exam,

447
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,160
I understand.

448
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
I’ll stop bugging you from now on.

449
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,000
I hope we can still be friends.

450
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,350
I’ve said everything.

451
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,510
From today on,

452
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,790
take good care of yourself.

453
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,440
Don’t pass out again.

454
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,270
I was wrong for keeping the secret.

455
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,110
Can I make it up to you now?

456
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,200
I have something to tell you.

457
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,750
Mom.

458
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,550
Sit down.

459
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,440
I have something to talk with you.

460
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,790
Zeyu,

461
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,790
during the winter vacation,

462
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,240
you said you went to the winter camp.

463
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,350
Actually, you joined the training
for programming contest.

464
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,590
Last time, you said
you went to the library.

465
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,550
In reality, you went to the final
of the programming contest.

466
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,790
Right?

467
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,480
Since you really like programming,

468
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,590
why did you quit

469
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,030
on the day of the final?

470
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:59,400
If Professor He hadn’t call me,

471
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,920
I wouldn’t have known that

472
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,240
you’re doing all this.

473
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,460
I didn’t compete in the final

474
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,270
because a classmate got ill
and passed out.

475
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,350
What did it have to do with you?

476
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,400
It’s your classmate who’s ill.

477
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,200
It’s not you who’s ill.

478
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,880
Mom, she has leukemia.

479
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,160
In that case,

480
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
it was none of your business.

481
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,350
Mom, how can you say that?

482
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,750
You think I’m heartless, right?

483
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,720
You think I’m unreasonable, right?

484
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,880
Fine.

485
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,510
Argue with me

486
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,440
after the exam.

487
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,020
Just hold back all your

488
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,590
anger, displeasure, and grudge.

489
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:38,160
I’ll let you vent it after the exam.

490
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Zeyu.

491
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,260
The College Entrance Exam
only happens once. Understand?

492
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,640
Only once.

493
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,960
You won’t want to study
another year and retake it.

494
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,480
That’s it.

495
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,240
Tomorrow,

496
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,960
I’ll take you to do the procedures
for transfer.

497
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,070
Okay.

498
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,720
I’ll do as you say.

499
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,720
But,

500
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,240
can we do it next week?

501
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,440
Can I get transferred next week?

502
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,070
Please?

503
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,240
So you agree to transfer?

504
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,590
If you think
it’s the best choice for me,

505
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,030
I agree.

506
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,790
Mom, I’ll go back to study.

507
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Biopsy?

508
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,070
You had a bone marrow biopsy?

509
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,640
Well, it’s just...

510
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,560
You didn’t tell me

511
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,350
and went to get a bone marrow biopsy?

512
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,070
And you.

513
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,640
You’re her brother.

514
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Yet you kept that a secret from me?

515
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,640
-Li He.
-Caixi. Caixi.

516
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,550
-Your pain is worse than your sister’s?
-Caixi, help me.

517
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,880
-Sister.
-Let go of him.

518
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,640
Let go.

519
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,440
So you passed out

520
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,590
and lost appetite because of this?

521
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,440
Well, not entirely. The result hasn’t…

522
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
It has been days.

523
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,790
Why didn’t you tell me?

524
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,920
So everyone knows,

525
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,070
except me?

526
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,110
No. I did this for a reason.

527
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:47,030
Yuan Caixi, how could you not tell me?

528
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,640
Because she didn’t even tell me.

529
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,070
Hello, aunt.

530
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,240
Hello.

531
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,030
Thank you for caring for my daughter.

532
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,030
But you mustn’t bully my son

533
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,350
because you care for my daughter.

534
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,920
Yes, mom.

535
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,510
Why are you so late?

536
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,070
He almost strangled me.

537
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,590
I’m sorry, aunt.

538
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,960
I’ll forgive you this time.

539
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,030
But you’re still alive.

540
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,640
You talked with him?

541
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,030
If I hadn’t,

542
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,510
would you talk to him?

543
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,790
You have to control
your negative emotions.

544
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,830
I’ve said everything.

545
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,030
What were his reactions?

546
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,310
He didn’t give much response.

547
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,110
He just said yes.

548
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,240
He gave up resisting?

549
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
Is what you did

550
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,240
too radical?

551
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,640
I was being radical?

552
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,030
Think about the way
you used to discipline him.

553
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,240
You almost turned our home
into a courtroom.

554
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,160
Now, you dare to accuse me
of being radical?

555
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
So,

556
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,680
what I did was wrong.

557
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,920
In the past...

558
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,880
I know

559
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,480
what I did in the past

560
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,680
is wrong.

561
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,440
I’m correcting myself now.

562
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,400
There are so many fields
that are unknown to us.

563
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,640
It’s wrong to hold prejudices.

564
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:26,830
If we really think about it,

565
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,440
our son is

566
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,750
a nice, well-behaved,
and outstanding kid.

567
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,240
We should have confidence in him.

568
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,110
It’s wrong to always force him.

569
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,000
Can you take the accountability

570
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,920
if he does badly
in the College Entrance Exam?

571
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,680
I...

572
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,350
Keep quiet if you can’t.

573
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,480
Go back.

574
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,590
Go to bed early.

575
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,110
Yeah.

576
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean it. Go back.

577
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
Li He.

578
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,310
Yes?

579
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,030
I’m sorry.

580
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
You lost the race

581
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,400
because of me.

582
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,960
Our Miss Monitor

583
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,720
knows how to apologize?

584
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,310
Stop messing around. I’m being serious.

585
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,480
Yuan Caixi.

586
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,880
Mmm?

587
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,000
Look at me.

588
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,440
Come on.

589
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,920
We can only have

590
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,110
a certain amount of

591
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,440
happiness and sorrow in our life.

592
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,920
Do you believe that?

593
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,110
My dad traded 500 counts of success

594
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,310
for my mom.

595
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,480
I dare not say I can have
500 counts of success too.

596
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,680
But if I do, I wish to

597
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,960
trade those for your health.

598
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,880
Besides,

599
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,960
logically,

600
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,750
the fate won’t be so harsh

601
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,510
and impose the tragedy on you again.

602
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,440
Right?

603
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,030
Mmm.

604
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,510
I’m relieved to see you smile.

605
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,640
Yuan Caixi.

606
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,920
Hmm?

607
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,640
Don’t worry.

608
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,750
No matter what the outcome is,

609
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,790
and no matter what happens
in the future,

610
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,270
we’ll all be there for you.

611
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,110
You have to promise me

612
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,350
that you’ll never hold things back
from me again.

613
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,270
Do you hear me?

614
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,070
Yes.

615
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,920
Good.

616
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,880
-Go to bed early.
-Okay.

617
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,680
I’ll go now.

618
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,150
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

619
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,110
Caixi.

620
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,960
Caixi.

621
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,150
Your mood is so good that
you’re humming in the early morning.

622
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,280
Yuan Haoxi.

623
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,150
It’s too early for you to bug me.

624
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:29,670
I’m not here to bug you today.

625
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,230
I’m just here to inform you.

626
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Someone is waiting for you downstairs.

627
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,550
It’s not Li He.

628
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,510
Then who is it?

629
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,150
I really don’t understand
what’s going on in the mind

630
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,280
of you scholar-lords.

631
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,400
Zeyu, you’re looking for me?

632
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,360
Yes.

633
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,880
Today, there’s a tech expo.
I want to invite you to go with me.

634
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,440
Tech expo?

635
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,280
Sure. Who else will come?

636
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,880
Just the two of us.

637
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,000
Just... us?

638
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,360
Yes.

639
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,230
Why don’t we take Han Yayi with us?

640
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,760
She must be bored at home.

641
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,190
Forget it then.

642
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,550
Yuan Haoxi, you always want
to go to a tech expo, right?

643
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,800
No. No. No.

644
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,190
What?

645
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,700
No.

646
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,550
Monitor,

647
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,070
we’ve known each other for a long time.

648
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,510
It’s just going to a show together.

649
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,480
It’s nothing, right?

650
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,190
I just...

651
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,110
Don’t worry.

652
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,800
Li He doesn’t like tech expos.

653
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,760
Han Yayi will do self-study sessions
with Lin Chuan.

654
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,360
I’ve asked them all. Don’t worry.

655
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,550
I’ll get dressed first. Wait a second.

656
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,110
Zeyu.

657
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,280
You really asked the others?

658
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,590
I think

659
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,550
you just want to spend some time

660
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,360
alone with my sister.

661
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,320
It’s wise to keep silent
when you find out the truth.

662
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,230
Oh! What is love?

663
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,150
But, Zeyu,

664
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,920
there’s already a winner.

665
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,070
I think you don’t stand a chance.

666
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,190
It’s fine.

667
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,550
I’m not giving up yet.

668
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,070
Come in.

669
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,030
Caixi.

670
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,710
I have to remind you something.

671
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,440
What?

672
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,480
I think Zeyu

673
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,510
has special feelings for you.

674
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,960
Have you really figured out

675
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,760
how to deal with your relationship?

676
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,800
Nonsense.

677
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,480
Who is Zeyu? How can
he have special feelings

678
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,760
for anything other than study?

679
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,320
We’re just good friends.

680
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,320
Would a good friend insist on
getting up early

681
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
to take detours every day for two years

682
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,920
so that he can walk to school with you?

683
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,760
A few days ago, I watched
the rebroadcast of programming contest.

684
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,190
Zeyu didn’t compete in it.

685
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,320
That day

686
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,320
was also the day of Li He’s semi-final.

687
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,510
Think about it yourself.

688
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,150
Will you still go out with him today?

689
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I think to keep going on like this

690
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,480
will not do anyone any good.

691
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,400
You’re right.

692
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,110
I’ll talk to Zeyu.

693
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,000
Let’s go.

694
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,230
Okay.

695
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,360
My sister is like a piece of hardwood.

696
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,440
Only a burning flame like Li He
can light her.

697
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,960
Warm water like you

698
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,670
can’t warm her up.

699
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,110
Are you hungry?
Shall we grab some food first?

700
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,630
I’m indeed a little hungry.

701
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:48,960
Come with me.

702
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,470
Mmm?

703
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:58,880
(Yuan’s Fried Chicken)

704
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,510
I often came here before.

705
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,360
Good for you.

706
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,580
I didn’t see this side of you.

707
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,840
I thought you

708
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,960
eat books only.

709
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,070
That would be quite repulsive.

710
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,550
In the past, when my mom and dad
went to the court,

711
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,440
I would eat at this place
when I got the chance.

712
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,140
The set meal of fried chickens,
coke, and French fries

713
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,280
really brought me so much joy.

714
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,070
So you have hidden personalities.

715
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,670
There are many sides of me
that are still unknown to you.

716
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,110
Excuse me. Here’s the food you ordered.
Please enjoy.

717
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,510
-Okay. Thanks.
-Thanks.

718
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,010
Listen.

719
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,550
Their fried chicken is so good with…

720
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,840
With pepper salt.

721
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,190
You had it before?

722
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,920
Yes. Li He took me here once.

723
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,760
He also made a joke. This restaurant…

724
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,880
-Is called Yuan’s, right?
-Mmm.

725
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,480
Mmm.

726
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,960
Let’s go straight to the show.

727
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,670
It’s still too early.

728
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,070
Let me take you to an interesting place.

729
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,510
Ah!

730
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
Yep. Let’s go.

731
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,400
(Simon Tree Baking Class
Parent-kid bakery)

732
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,190
This way.

733
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,710
Wait a second.

734
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,000
You took me here to make a cake?

735
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,400
Yes. Li He must have never
brought you here.

736
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,320
No. I can’t imagine

737
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,800
he brings me here to make a cake.

738
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,110
But I also can’t imagine

739
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,760
you bring me here to make a cake.

740
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,440
I told you there are many sides of me

741
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,550
that you still don’t know.

742
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,710
Come on.

743
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,330
Hello, everyone.

744
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,320
Today, in our class,

745
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,960
we’ll make a Chiffon Cake.

Just so-so.

765
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,030
Why are you so good at
making a Chiffon Cake?

766
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,190
You made it before?

767
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,710
Yes, I make it before.

768
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,070
Because my mom really likes it.

769
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,030
When I was little,
I always bugged my aunt and said,

770
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,070
“Aunt, aunt, please teach me
how to make a Chiffon Cake.”

771
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,550
But I couldn’t read it right back then.

772
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,280
So I would mistake “Chiffon”

773
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,400
for “Chicken”.

774
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,590
When I was in third grade
of primary school,

775
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,190
I once made a cake for my mom,
and I said,

776
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,190
“Mom, eat this Chicken Cake,

777
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,070

Aren’t you afraid of
the excessive sugar?

836
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,880
I might have
this kind of concern before.

837
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,590
But now, I don’t want to
have too much concern.

838
00:47:58,590 --> 00:47:59,670

839

843
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,480
That’s possible.

844
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,030

845
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:08,510

I believe that you won’t be diagnosed.

848
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,590
Fine. Even if you’re right,

849
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:18,710
after what happened this time,

850
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,760
I believe there are too many things
unpredictable in life.

851
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:23,510
Even if I’m not diagnosed,

852
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,190
I might in the future...
I mean it’s possible.

853
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,030
I might have a car accident,

854
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,230
or get hit by a fallen flowerpot.

855
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,110
Something like that.

856
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,710
So, in the past, I only wrote down

857
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:35,590
the things I want to do.

858
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,760
But now if I want to do something,

859
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:38,710
I will do it.

860
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,230
I want to live every day to the fullest.

861
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,670

862
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,590
I have something to tell you.

863
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,630
You don’t have to. I know it.

865
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,360
Yeah.

866
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,840
Being so awkward isn’t your style.

867
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,030
The result will come out tomorrow.

868
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:16,550
As your only friend and opponent,

869
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,710
I wish everything goes well with you.

870
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:21,230

877
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,550
She went out with Ning Zeyu?

878
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:44,510
Yes.

879
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,070
Seems that they went to see

880
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,510
the tech expo.

881
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,190
They went to the tech expo without me?

882
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,760
Wait, bro.

883
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,880
They didn’t go with you
because it’s a tech expo.

884
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:56,070
What? I like going to tech expos.

885
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,440

I guess they’ll be back soon.

890
