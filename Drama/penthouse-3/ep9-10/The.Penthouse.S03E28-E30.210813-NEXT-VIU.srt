Previously on The Penthouse 3.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,889
Your disguise was incredible.

3
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:20,560
It's simple. We'll use each other.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm the one doing everything I can to save Logan.

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,929
He might not get through the night.

6
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,729
Then we can't wait any longer.

7
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:28,040
Proof that you killed Logan...

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,440
will disappear forever.

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,440
We got rid of Su Ryeon, Logan Lee,

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,405
Jun Ki, and Yoon Chul all in one fell swoop.

11
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,310
We make such great partners.

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,274
It's your turn now, Joo Dan Tae.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,975
Turn the ambulance around.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,719
How could you betray my trust like this?

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:46,050
Tell me where that dashboard camera is now.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,155
Yoon Hee!

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,759
So that Yoon Hee's death isn't in vain,

18
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,660
we must reveal the truth.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,300
I will get revenge that will devastate them.

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,494
(Episode 10)

21
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,904
Joo Dan Tae!

22
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,304
Cheon Seo Jin!

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,744
How dare you mess with me?

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,505
Look who's talking.

25
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,919
Didn't we agree to bury that for good?

26
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,419
After asking me to get rid of Baek Jun Ki,

27
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:19,860
how could you stab me in the back like this?

28
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,759
Ruining my ceremony...

29
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,684
would harm Cheong A Group too. Don't you know that?

30
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,390
That's nonsense!

31
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,830
Why are you digging up the past then?

32
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,095
Do you have proof that I killed my father?

33
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,274
Get off me!

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,209
Did you kill your father...

35
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,544
so you could become the director?

36
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,544
And then you cried so hard at his funeral?

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,615
- You give me the creeps. - That's not true!

38
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,559
I don't know what nonsense Seok Kyung talked about,

39
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,660
but you can't accuse me without any proof.

40
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,300
Seok Kyung? Is she aware of it too?

41
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,559
I know you heard it from her.

42
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,169
Stop putting on an act!

43
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:06,470
You're the one putting on an act.

44
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,370
Why did you send me the footage of Logan's accident?

45
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,364
Are you really in the position to do that?

46
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,769
You hid him away and kept him barely alive.

47
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:14,674
Do you want me to tell his secretary everything?

48
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,375
Our cooperation is over.

49
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,945
Just hand over Cheong A Group and get lost!

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,750
You're finally being honest.

51
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,190
I'll never give up on Cheong A Group.

52
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,660
I want a divorce.

53
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,419
Apply for a divorce right now!

54
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,430
As long as we sign a confidentiality agreement, why not?

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,555
I'd love that, as long as the stock prices aren't affected.

56
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:39,794
You're trash! I'll kill you!

57
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,245
A dogfight has begun,

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,315
just like you predicted.

59
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,880
Hey! Come here!

60
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,215
Don't be surprised.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,919
We're all here...

62
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,755
to punish Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

63
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,600
They blew up Logan's car,

64
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,794
locked him up, and assaulted him.

65
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:12,565
They also murdered Yoon Hee...

66
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,065
out of malice.

67
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,505
Ms. Oh died...

68
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,704
a horrible death.

69
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:26,005
The primary culprit was Joo Dan Tae.

70
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:29,845
The secondary culprit was Cheon Seo Jin.

71
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,185
In addition,

72
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,625
Joo Dan Tae inflicted further harm...

73
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,424
by damaging Ms. Oh's dead body and mocking her death.

74
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,764
I disposed of Ms. Oh's body.

75
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,435
I'll do anything. I'm even ready to go to prison.

76
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,019
How could you do that?

77
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,220
Do you only care about your own family?

78
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,090
Don't you care whatever happens to Ro Na?

79
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,590
That's why he came here.

80
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,384
To right his wrong.

81
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:07,954
Stop!

82
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,725
There's no point in criticizing and blaming each other.

83
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:13,454
We're all...

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,495
responsible for Ms. Oh's death.

85
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,229
Including myself.

86
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:21,695
If you really want to atone for what you did to Yoon Hee,

87
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,710
please do as I say.

88
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,340
Let's just put them behind bars.

89
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,539
Let's send the dashboard cam footage to the police.

90
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,974
I trust neither the police nor the court anymore.

91
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,644
We must punish them ourselves.

92
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,685
First, we need to turn the two against each other completely.

93
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,255
D-Day is the day of the groundbreaking ceremony...

94
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:44,925
and Cheon Seo Jin's inauguration ceremony.

95
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,024
This might help.

A picture of Joo Dan Tae,

97
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,165
who was disguised as an old man, taking off in Secretary Cho's car.

98
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,464
I witnessed it myself.

99
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:05,280
Why did you let Joo Dan Tae walk all over you...

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,514
when you had this all along?

101
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,014
Let's use this to pressure Joo Dan Tae.

102
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:15,954
I apologize.

103
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:25,065
Congratulations on the Cheonsoo District groundbreaking ceremony.

111
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,815

Her inauguration ceremony happens to take place today,

123
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,375
so she couldn't make it.

124
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,115
But she sent me a congratulatory message.

He got away?

185
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:35,545
- What do you mean? - Those losers.

186
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,920
They couldn't handle that little twerp and lost him?

187
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,084
That's why their son died like that.

188
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:43,984
Send people out and find Jun Ki!

189
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,724
What?

190
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,905
What are you doing here?

191
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,614
I need to take you somewhere.

192
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,385
Do you have time?

193
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,994
Ms. Shim? What are you doing here?

194
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,300
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

195
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,135
I'm glad you're safe.

196
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,864
I have something to tell you.

197
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:36,035
It's very important.

198
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:39,704
Ro Na.

199
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,545
I think you should know the truth behind your mom's death.

200
00:10:43,619 --> 00:10:47,015
Wasn't it Mr. Joo Dan Tae?

201
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,454
It was.

202
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:52,285
But someone else killed her.

203
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:53,854
Who...

204
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,555
was it?

205
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,029
I'll punish everyone who did that to your mom.

206
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,864
Everything has been prepared.

207
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,840
If you'll end up being hurt...

208
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,004
by it becoming public knowledge,

209
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,874
we can bury the truth.

210
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,275
No.

211
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,675
Tell everyone...

212
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:16,275
everything that happened to Mom.

213
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,015
The person who pushed your mom off the cliff...

214
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:23,454
was Seo Jin.

215
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,925
Why? Why did Mom do that?

216
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,065
I don't understand.

217
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:38,109
You're saying Mom died...

218
00:11:38,109 --> 00:11:40,509
and left me behind just to save Eun Byeol.

219
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:43,574
I'm sure she didn't think she'd die.

220
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,744
She was wronged.

221
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,519
So why did she help a brat like her?

222
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,790
Who cares whether or not Eun Byeol dies?

223
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,344
Because she was a mom.

224
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:57,224
Because she had experienced the pain of losing her daughter.

225
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,395
She was Seo Jin's daughter, whom she despised,

226
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,395
but I'm sure she had no choice at that moment.

227
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:09,094
It was my fault.

228
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,874
I shouldn't have helped Eun Byeol back then.

229
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,145
I should've ignored it.

230
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,074
If I hadn't hidden her in our home, this never would've happened.

231
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,645
It was all my fault. It was me.

232
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,484
I'm so sorry.

233
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:35,824
Your mom died while trying to help me.

234
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,635
Mom.

Beef up security.

237
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,324
Jun Ki will come here first.

238
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,124
The boys are spread out throughout Hera Palace.

239
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:13,499
Where's Eun Byeol?

240
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,035
She's in the studio.

241
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,895
Go get her right now.

242
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,964
If Jun Ki fled, it means he's after me.

243
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,479
Make sure Eun Byeol doesn't leave home for a while.

244
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,675
Yes, ma'am.

245
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,114
Get the evidence you mentioned.

246
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,015
Evidence that Seo Jin had locked Logan up.

247
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,159
Are you sure it's in her home?

248
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,090
I told you that already.

249
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,700
If you're lying,

250
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,555
you'll rot in that mental hospital in Japan until you die.

251
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,695
Someone who betrays a person once is bound to do it again and again.

252
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,539
Are you talking about yourself?

253
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,104
I hear you're an expert at stabbing people in the back.

254
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:01,420
What are you doing?

255
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,080
Wherever you may be, whatever you do,

256
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,519
your location will be transmitted to us.

257
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,254
So don't even think about running.

258
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,190
Must you go this far?

259
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,525
Why are you asking for my help if you don't even trust me?

260
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:15,930
Watch it.

261
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,864
If I catch you trying to pull something,

262
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,895
forget the mental hospital. You'll end up six feet under.

263
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:24,604
We kept you alive for one reason.

264
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,680
Because you need a mad dog to catch a mad dog.

265
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,635
I know that much.

266
00:14:30,479 --> 00:14:33,974
That I need to work with you people right now to stay alive.

267
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,045
Don't worry.

268
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,344
I'll do as you say.

269
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,604
What was that?

270
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:00,935
Hey.

271
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,574
Hey!

272
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,344
Hey!

273
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,775
What's going on? Hey!

274
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:11,984
Hey!

275
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,320
Where is everyone?

276
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,555
Hey!

277
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,895
Jun Ki.

278
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,025
How have you been, partner?

279
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,604
Did you forget your promise to protect me no matter what?

280
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,945
Thanks to you, even Logan's family knows who I am.

281
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:41,045
You're all I have left now.

282
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,254
Because I'm about to die right now.

283
00:15:55,859 --> 00:15:57,600
Should I tell James everything?

284
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,300
That you made me do it?

285
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,369
What you did to Logan after abducting him,

286
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,869
the fact that you dumped it all on Su Ryeon,

287
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:04,665
and that you got paid for it?

288
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,709
Should I tell him everything?

289
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,080
Go ahead.

290
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,239
Who would believe a mental patient like you?

291
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,445
Didn't you run away because no one believed you?

292
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:29,124
It stayed nicely hidden.

293
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,565
- What is that? - What do you think?

294
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,265
It's evidence that will prove my innocence.

295
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:39,504
I hid it in your living room...

296
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,974
because I felt like it would be the safest here.

297
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,815
Why do you gamble if you're so bad at it?

298
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,015
What?

299
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,614
Do I look like someone who runs errands like this?

300
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,385
What if someone sees me?

301
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,084
Didn't you know I was like this when we joined forces?

302
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,054
You said you'd let me gamble as much as I want for life.

303
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,429
I even fooled Logan and came to Korea.

304
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:07,665
You shouldn't make me worry about money.

305
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,405
Must I regret betraying the rich boy...

306
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:14,875
and teaming up with you already?

307
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:19,504
Why did you even record this?

308
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,550
I need a way out.

309
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,875
I can't trust a viper like you.

310
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,615
Since the day your secretary visited me in the hotel in Japan,

311
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,590
every amicable conversation we had in this house...

312
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,325
is right here.

313
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,794
Shouldn't this be enough to make...

314
00:17:38,669 --> 00:17:40,264
Logan's family believe me?

315
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,935
No.

316
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,108
No, you can't. No, wait.

317
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:47,204
Wait.

318
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:49,974
I'm a fugitive because of you.

319
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,214
Do you have any idea how tenacious James is?

320
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,949
Talk to me. I will compensate you.

321
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,754
I'll smuggle you to a place Logan's family can never find you.

322
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:04,125
Those files. Give them to me.

323
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,554
Shall I fall for your tricks again?

324
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,155
Trust me.

325
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:12,095
I don't care for words.

326
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,294
Bring me 200 million dollars.

327
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,868
What?

328
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:18,504
For that much money,

329
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,875
I might think about it.

330
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,774
Won't I need that much to live in hiding forever?

331
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:26,510
It's not a discussion.

332
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,474
Bring me the money in three days.

333
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,784
Miss the deadline...

334
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,254
and these recordings will find their way to Logan's family.

335
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,685
Three days?

336
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,254
Do you think 200 million dollars is a joke?

337
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,595
You have just three days.

338
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:48,165
Do not talk back at me.

339
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,579
I should've killed him myself.

340
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,244
That little rat.

341
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:16,199
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

342
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:21,294
Wild rabbit, little wild rabbit

343
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,070
Where are you going to?

344
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,804
How did you get out?

345
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:33,474
Hop, hop, hopping on your way

346
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,314
I escaped, risking my life to do so.

347
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:40,645
I couldn't just die. That would be too unfair.

348
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:43,814
I have a few cards of my own.

349
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,784
I didn't get to play them yet.

350
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,469
Joo Dan Tae disguised as an old man.

351
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:54,135
What was he doing in your secretary's car?

352
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,905
Isn't this concrete evidence that you left a bomb in Logan's car?

353
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:02,540
This photo would make James fly right over...

354
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,474
from the US to get you.

355
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:09,774
He'd be furious that you lied to his face.

356
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:13,214
I doubt he'll let you live.

357
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,459
What is it you want?

358
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:18,325
What do you think it is? Nothing's better than money.

359
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,054
Two hundred million dollars.

360
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,554
You have just three days.

361
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,665
If you're even a day late,

362
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,139
these photos will go straight to James.

363
00:20:29,139 --> 00:20:31,935
I must give you 200 million dollars to fund your gambling habit?

364
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,179
Cheon Seo Jin set it all up, not me.

365
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:37,034
I know that.

366
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,814
I just talked to her.

367
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:45,244
I showed her proof that she had Logan locked up,

368
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,554
and she willingly offered to buy my silence with 200 million.

369
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:54,155
She's so magnanimous.

370
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,530
Cheon Seo Jin said that?

371
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,764
So I'm weighing my options.

372
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:04,270
Should I send James the evidence...

373
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,675
or take the money and disappear in silence?

374
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,974
What do you think I should do,

375
00:21:11,409 --> 00:21:12,575
Jun Ki?

376
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:16,445
You'll blackmail us both and get paid by both?

377
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:20,244
Don't you think 200 million dollars is too little to compensate me...

378
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,155
for my life full of suffering?

379
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,925
Fine.

380
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:30,095
For 200 million dollars,

381
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,625
give me the original photos too.

382
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,335
One more thing.

383
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,935
Give me the evidence that Seo Jin had Logan locked up.

384
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,704
I'll give you 300 million dollars.

385
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:46,645
Isn't it a sweet deal?

386
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,350
Logan's already dead.

387
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,085
Do you think that evidence...

388
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,284
will get James off your tail?

389
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,355
What do you say?

390
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,925
Why not do business with me?

391
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,665
I knew it.

392
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,429
Two hundred million from each person is 400 million.

393
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:37,764
On top of that, an extra 300 million dollars?

394
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,895
That's a pretty good deal.

395
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,905
Wherever you may be, whatever you do,

396
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,335
your location will be transmitted to us.

397
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:51,075
So don't even think about running.

398
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,314
You got me wrong.

399
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:57,615
I'm not that easy to control.

400
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,034
I knew you'd try something like this.

401
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,750
You really aren't worth trusting.

402
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,244
Who are you?

403
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,284
Remember this. Other than the chip in your arm,

404
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:34,284
there are eyes watching you everywhere.

405
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,609
What about Mr. Yoo?

406
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,274
What does he want to say?

407
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,979
What are you doing?

408
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,084
Ro Na.

409
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,545
I'm sorry.

410
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,124
I have wronged you terribly.

411
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,225
I took your mom...

412
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,264
Your mom...

413
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,504
Joo Dan Tae made my husband...

414
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,674
take your mom's body...

415
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,474
and dump it in a lake.

416
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:28,375
I'm sorry, Ro Na.

417
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,815
I deserve to die for it.

418
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,754
Does an apology...

419
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,754
make it go away?

420
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,565
You knew, didn't you, Ms. Kang?

421
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,064
Is that why you stayed with me and looked after me?

422
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,639
Did you think you could make up for what he did?

423
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:54,709
Did you?

424
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,175
It wasn't because of that.

425
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,725
I can't forgive him for what he did either.

426
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,325
But...

427
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,594
that was the only way to make up for it.

428
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,335
My wife didn't know anything.

429
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,070
She did nothing wrong. It was all me.

430
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,575
I'll pay for what I did.

431
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:15,004
I'll reveal what Joo Dan Tae did,

432
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,775
and I'll turn myself in and pay the price.

433
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,814
Ro Na. I'm sorry.

434
00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:28,355
How can you be so selfish?

435
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,624
How can you be so terrifying?

436
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,924
You give me the chills! You disgust me!

437
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:43,064
(Yoo Jenny)

438
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,779
The person you have reached...

439
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:52,644
What's going on? Why won't she pick up?

440
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,415
When did she go out?

441
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,954
Mom, where did you go without me?

442
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,155
Did you see Ro Na?

443
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,855
She left early to go to work.

444
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,424
At this hour?

445
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,125
Did she start another job without telling me?

446
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,964
Pack up. It's time for us to go home.

447
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,010
Is Dad quitting Chairman Joo's company?

448
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,345
Yes. Soon.

449
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,345
So...

450
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,380
we can't live here anymore.

451
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,885
That doesn't mean we can't live together.

452
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,315
I enjoyed living with Ro Na.

453
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,855
Then who'll cook for Ro Na?

454
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,655
I will, of course.

455
00:26:37,859 --> 00:26:40,825
Even if she says no, I will.

456
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:43,600
Even if she throws the plate saying the food is bad.

457
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,739
Even if she flips the table saying she doesn't want it.

458
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:49,165
I'll still act like a mom.

459
00:26:50,869 --> 00:26:52,475
Mom.

460
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,945
What's up with her?

461
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,785
Joo Seok Kyung. It's your mom. Open the door.

462
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,385
Seok Kyung.

463
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:12,125
She was there just a moment ago. Maybe she left for a second.

464
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,665
You're the one Seok Kyung wants to see the most right now.

465
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,795
Just wait a little while, and she'll reach out to you.

466
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,445
(I miss you, my beautiful daughter.)

467
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:41,790
(I miss you, my beautiful daughter.)

468
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,030
I miss you, my beautiful daughter.

469
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,524
Oh, please.

470
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,825
Please just leave me alone.

471
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,894
Don't come looking for me.

472
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,669
Don't text me.

473
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:57,864
Don't worry about me.

474
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,905
You just want to make me the worst daughter ever.

475
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:17,190
It will be difficult to secure enough money...

476
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,155
to raise Cheong A's shares before the shareholder meeting next week.

477
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:20,659
Three days.

478
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:23,268
We need 200 million dollars in three days, whatever it takes.

479
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:25,029
Sell every bond or real estate that we can...

480
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:27,095
and get as much money as possible.

481
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,139
Things have already been bad since Father's death.

482
00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:32,165
It's over once the shareholders learn about Baek Jun Ki.

483
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,275
Do you trust Baek Jun Ki?

484
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,550
Even if he gets the money, he might send the evidence to James.

485
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,579
He's not that dumb.

486
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,374
How will he survive, even if he tries to live off Logan's family?

487
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,849
You go deal with the Myeongdong building like I told you to.

488
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,085
Yes ma'am.

489
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,694
Mom.

490
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,025
- Hi. - You're still home?

491
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,734
You look really nervous.

492
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,665
I do? I'm not.

493
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:05,165
Is it because of yesterday?

494
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,979
Joo Seok Kyung told her dad, didn't she?

495
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,345
About Grandpa?

496
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,345
I'll deal with it. Don't you worry.

497
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,550
It's because of me.

498
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,884
I shouldn't have filmed that.

499
00:29:19,459 --> 00:29:21,260
There's no evidence.

500
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,959
No one will trust Seok Kyung.

501
00:29:22,959 --> 00:29:24,785
Of course not.

502
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,554
As long as you're okay, I am too.

503
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,300
Don't worry. Just go to school.

504
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,099
Okay. Bye.

505
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,234
Bye.

506
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,149
Baek Jun Ki and Joo Dan Tae...

507
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,114
I need to get rid of them both.

508
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,785
If not, Cheong A Foundation...

509
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,785
and Eun Byeol will both be hurt.

510
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,729
Things will work out easily...

511
00:29:59,729 --> 00:30:01,955
if we use Cheon Seo Jin's weakness.

512
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:04,829
How much money do we have on hand that we can use?

513
00:30:04,829 --> 00:30:06,899
I can get 500 million dollars.

514
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,570
Then use the Cheonsoo District as an excuse to get that money...

515
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,064
and send it to Baek Jun Ki.

516
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:12,579
It's too dangerous.

517
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:14,110
That's too big of an amount.

518
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,574
It doesn't matter.

519
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,709
We can send it under Cheon Seo Jin's name.

520
00:30:17,709 --> 00:30:21,074
If the divorce ends quickly, I won't be accountable.

521
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,490
If it works out, it's a chance...

522
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:27,285
to blow off Cheon Seo Jin and get my hands on Cheong A Group.

523
00:30:29,229 --> 00:30:30,990
You don't look like you agree.

524
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,295
It's a shareholders' meeting. It's dangerous.

525
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,430
If you want to be nominated as Cheong A Group's chairman again,

526
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,324
you need to avoid anything suspicious.

527
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,510
Very well then.

528
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,634
First, put it in a borrowed account under Lee Kyu Jin's name.

529
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,744
If we play it well,

530
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,244
I won't ever be put in danger.

531
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,374
Understood, Chairman.

532
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,655
Do you think Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin...

533
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,184
will really go with Baek Jun Ki's offer?

534
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:06,754
It's not a threat you can ignore.

535
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,225
No matter the cost, they need to hold on...

536
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,265
until the Cheonsoo District is sold.

537
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,765
We need to steal everything they own from them before that happens.

538
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,934
Make them even more nervous...

539
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,905
by creating a situation in which the two cannot trust each other.

540
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,779
I hope that Kang Ma Ri and Yoo Dong Pil...

541
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,905
lead this whole thing well.

542
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,529
Please...

543
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,955
The person you have reached is unavailable...

544
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:41,000
What should I do?

545
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,665
Sang A is ignoring me again.

546
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,570
Cheer up and eat.

547
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,909
Come on. You said you were a good cook.

548
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,039
This is just ramyeon.

549
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,639
Just ramyeon?

550
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:54,434
Look at what's inside.

551
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,950
Plus, you know I cooked in the military.

552
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,010
Please.

553
00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,279
I am the son of a culinary researcher.

554
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,619
My palate has high standards.

555
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,215
No matter how good the ramyeon is, it's still just ramyeon.

556
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,795
This is incredible!

557
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,304
Since the groundbreaking ceremony,

558
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,280
people have been saying that Chairman Joo is a murderer.

559
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,810
I don't know what impact that's going to have in the future.

560
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,979
Chairman Joo, if you look at him,

561
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:33,615
has more enemies than you think.

562
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,479
Did you take care of everything okay?

563
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:38,290
It's not that simple.

564
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,015
What, you think Chairman Joo actually killed Logan?

565
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,229
There's evidence that Joo Dan Tae is a murderer.

566
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,395
Evidence?

567
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:50,829
Why are you telling me such an important thing over ramyeon?

568
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:54,369
The Joo Dan Tae we know is not the real Joo Dan Tae.

569
00:32:54,369 --> 00:32:56,270
What do you mean he's not the real Chairman Joo?

570
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,804
You mean he's a clone?

571
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,108
Nonsense.

572
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,838
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

573
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,239
He's wanted?

574
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,045
The Joo Dan Tae we know...

575
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,950
is someone who is wanted for killing two people in Japan and fleeing.

576
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,180
And his name is Baek Jun Ki.

577
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,420
And the real Joo Dan Tae...

578
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,119
is that guy he said he knew from Japan, Baek Jun Ki.

579
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,615
So you mean...

580
00:33:13,989 --> 00:33:16,690
Baek Jun Ki is the real Joo Dan Tae,

581
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,190
and Joo Dan Tae is Baek Jun Ki?

582
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:19,759
The police are already on it.

583
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,025
It's only a matter of time before Chairman Joo gets caught.

584
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:24,129
Why do you think Baek Jun Ki came back here?

585
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:26,839
He wanted to regain his identity.

586
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:29,239
What a dirtbag.

587
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:33,304
What kind of a freak steals someone else's name?

588
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:38,375
You know, Dong Pil,

589
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,615
since when have you had access to such good information?

590
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,814
Ten billion dollars?

591
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,219
So? Spill!

592
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:48,859
After Yoon Hee died,

593
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:52,958
the ten billion she had disappeared.

594
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:57,570
Which means her death wasn't just an accident.

595
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,900
- Of course not. - Then what was it?

596
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,265
Did someone kill her?

597
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:06,040
That day, somebody...

598
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,535
pushed the car from behind.

599
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:10,609
To kill Yoon Hee.

600
00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:12,280
- My goodness. - No way.

601
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,579
Who does something so horrible?

602
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:16,420
I heard the dashboard camera was found,

603
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,049
and they're thinking about reopening the case.

604
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:20,060
Let's be real.

605
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:24,155
Who benefitted the most from Yoon Hee's death?

606
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,354
Isn't there one person you can think of?

607
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,629
Do you mean... Ms. Cheon?

608
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,800
- No way. - Goodness.

609
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,969
That's far-fetched.

610
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:35,070
For Ms. Cheon,

611
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,709
it's as if her biggest enemy died.

612
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,704
Even Eun Byeol went to SNU.

613
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,204
Everyone in Hera Palace has heard the rumor.

614
00:34:42,339 --> 00:34:45,245
That it was Ms. Cheon who killed Yoon Hee.

615
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,680
I even heard that the body...

616
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,814
is buried under Hera Palace's water fountain.

617
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,214
Haven't you heard?

618
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,615
What gibberish!

619
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,224
At least her ears work well.

620
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,295
- Let's get up. - Let's go.

621
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,724
Did you hear?

622
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,635
Don't you know it's a crime...

623
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,540
to disseminate obviously false information?

624
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,079
Why are you yelling?

625
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,709
You have something to hide?

626
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:18,944
People might think you actually did kill Yoon Hee.

627
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:21,119
- Kang Ma Ri. - Yes.

628
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,314
Stop it, you two. Don't fight.

629
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,560
If you spread rumors like that ever again,

630
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,155
I won't just take it.

631
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,054
I'll sue you.

632
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,400
Sue me. I'm not scared.

633
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,839
It's a democratic country.

634
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,365
I can say whatever I want.

635
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,934
Why is he repeatedly calling?

636
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:52,145
Who would spread a rumor like that?

637
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:54,915
Could it be Jin Bun Hong?

638
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,415
Why are you calling?

639
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,885
How's the money coming along?

640
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:09,670
A single check would be nice and neat.

641
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,900
Two hundred million dollars.

642
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,594
Let's meet tomorrow night.

643
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,964
I'll bring it to where you want.

644
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:26,965

645
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,314
I didn't know you were the punctual type.

646
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,655
Shut it.

647
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,854
Give me the recorder first.

648
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:51,865
I trust you didn't make any copies.

649
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,405
I don't have time for that.

650
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,145
I'll be busy spending my 200 million dollars.

651
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,415
Didn't you have fun...

652
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:06,390
working with me?

653
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,814
Never show up in front of me again.

654
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,385
The next time we meet,

655
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:13,255
we'll be in the fiery pit.

656
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:17,395
One more thing.

657
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:21,165
I prepared a goodbye gift for you.

658
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:25,235
You'll find something interesting in the recorder.

659
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,375
Enjoy.

660
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,745
One more thing.

661
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,814
Give me the evidence that Seo Jin had Logan locked up.

662
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,525
I'll give you 300 million dollars.

663
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,924
Isn't it a sweet deal?

664
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,700
Logan's already dead.

665
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,365
Do you think that evidence...

666
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,395
will get James off your tail?

667
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,934
What do you say?

668
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:57,339
Why not do business with me?

669
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:58,765
Joo Dan Tae.

670
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,174
You're trying to stab me in the back?

671
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,525
Mr. Joo, there's a problem.

672
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,365
The funds in Mr. Lee's account are gone.

673
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,900
"Gone?" How is that possible?

674
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,140
Are you sure?

675
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,599
Yes, I've confirmed it.

676
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:31,310
I was going to wire money to Baek Jun Ki,

677
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,604
but there was no money left.

678
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,950
The phone is turned off.

679
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,505
Son of a...

680
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,025
No way.

681
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,625
This can't be.

682
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,564
How did that jerk find out?

683
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,334
I don't believe this.

684
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,989
What's wrong with Dad?

685
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,089
He planned a family trip to cheer me up.

686
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:23,354
Try to understand him.

687
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:25,125
This is embarrassing.

688
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,854
I'll go get coffee.

689
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,729
Honey, you should cover your face too.

690
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:33,999
Why would you wear sunglasses at night?

691
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:36,140
We might not be able to set foot in Korea again.

692
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,405
What do you mean?

693
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,365
I thought we were going on a trip.

694
00:39:43,979 --> 00:39:46,545
"Bon-bi Holdings?" What company is that?

695
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:49,814
The CEO is Ko Sang A?

696
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:51,314
I...

697
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,255
stole Joo Dan Tae's money.

698
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,184
- What? - Five hundred million dollars...

699
00:39:57,089 --> 00:39:58,324
at that.

700
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,200
Did you say 500 million?

701
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,469
I don't want to be his minion for the rest of my life.

702
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:07,635
I want to live my life to the fullest.

703
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,265
How could you?

704
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,035
Hey, Lee Kyu Jin.

705
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,174
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

706
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,775
You should've discussed this with me first.

707
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,385
Sang A.

708
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:27,615
You had me scared there.

709
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,160
Do you approve of what I did?

710
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,224
Yes, you're the best.

711
00:40:34,959 --> 00:40:36,054
Sang A.

712
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,540
Goodness, you're clueless.

713
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,709
The rumor has spread everywhere.

714
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,640
Cheong A Group will go bankrupt...

715
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,109
as soon as Chairman Joo is arrested.

716
00:40:48,109 --> 00:40:50,604
Then what's going to happen to us?

717
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,350
Joo Dan Tae is setting up slush funds...

718
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,979
to save himself.

719
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:57,584
He's splitting and laundering his company funds.

720
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,489
I heard some money was transferred to your account.

721
00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:02,559
I have slush funds in my account?

722
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,330
I don't know how much it is, but you should look into it.

723
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:09,160
You might end up being accused of embezzlement.

724
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,965
At this rate, Joo Dan Tae will take everything away from us.

725
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:23,979
I didn't feel comfortable having the money in my name,

726
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:27,180
so I set up a paper company in your name and put it there.

727
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,749
Good job. Now that we have 500 million dollars,

728
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:32,789
you don't have to work for Joo Dan Tae, that jerk, anymore.

729
00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:37,225
With this money, all six of us can live like kings and queens.

730
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,955
All six of us? What do you mean?

731
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,154
Are there more people than us?

732
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,624
There they are.

733
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,005
Hey! Mom! Over here!

734
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:54,340
Are they coming with us?

735
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,239
What else can we do?

736
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:59,705
My dad divorced my mom because of me.

737
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,715
I should take responsibility.

738
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,644
Gosh. Just a second.

739
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:08,890
Kyu Jin! There you are. I looked everywhere for you.

740
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,554
Why are you dressed like this?

741
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,330
Son, are we moving abroad?

742
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,529
- Where are we going? - Hawaii? Europe?

743
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:16,864
Listen carefully.

744
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,999
We need to pull ourselves together.

745
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:22,140
First, we're going to Turkey via Japan.

746
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,739
Then to Romania.

747
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:25,539
After that, we'll spend three years in Poland.

748
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:27,935
- With 500 million dollars... - Ultimately, we're going to Russia.

749
00:42:28,009 --> 00:42:29,880
Do you have gowns and stuff?

750
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,374
Why are you dressed like this?

751
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,890
You'll have to change into different clothes.

752
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,144
We won't be able to communicate...

753
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,059
You still haven't found him?

754
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,985
What's taking so long?

755
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:45,489
It doesn't seem like he's left the country...

756
00:42:45,489 --> 00:42:48,854
while Ko Sang A and their son have left for Japan.

757
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,995
Japan?

758
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,370
Baek Jun Ki has been calling and asking for money.

759
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,465
What should we do?

760
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,864
Baek Jun Ki, that little...

761
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,535
Withdraw my slush funds from the Cayman Islands.

762
00:43:02,709 --> 00:43:06,309
If I don't pay him, he'll leak the pictures to the press.

763
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:08,319
All 500 million dollars?

764
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,644
I'll do anything to shut his mouth. Don't you understand?

765
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,789
I can make up for the loss once the stock prices go up.

766
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:16,884
Get out.

767
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,195
Father, you have a guest.

768
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:27,864
A guest?

769
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:32,965
How have you been, Chairman Joo?

770
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,049
What brings you here?

771
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:40,114
Our conversation isn't over, I believe.

772
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,314
Ms. Jin just arrived.

773
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,090
Okay. We don't know what she might do.

774
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,314
Keep a close eye.

775
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,054
Be careful.

776
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:54,725
Is it Jin Bun Hong's turn now?

777
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:59,564
I trust she can make Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin...

778
00:44:00,069 --> 00:44:01,735
tear each other apart.

779
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:04,265
She's a total psycho.

780
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:07,505
I trusted you.

781
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,539
How could you fail to keep Cheon Seo Jin under control...

782
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:11,445
and keep me waiting?

783
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:17,745
I'm not in the mood for bickering with you.

784
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,255
- Get lost. - Don't tell me what to do.

785
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,489
I decide whether I stay or leave, you jerk.

786
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:24,630
"Jerk?"

787
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,725
Yes, you're a jerk.

788
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:30,564
I don't think it's a good idea to be so cocky with me.

789
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,765
My dashboard camera footage of the day Oh Yoon Hee died...

790
00:44:34,769 --> 00:44:36,265
is right here.

791
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:41,074
You did a great job pushing her to the edge of the cliff.

792
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,175
Your dashboard camera footage?

793
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:47,644
You're lying. No such thing was found.

794
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,950
Yes, you're right.

795
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,120
But I had someone find it for me.

796
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,384
You shouldn't have underestimated me.

797
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,400
Stop, Joo Dan Tae!

798
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,499
- Hold on. - She's still in the car!

799
00:45:04,499 --> 00:45:06,564
Wait for the highlights.

800
00:45:14,309 --> 00:45:15,404
What?

801
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,775
It was Cheon Seo Jin who killed Oh Yoon Hee?

802
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,844
You're such a fool. How could you not know that?

803
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,114
Can't you do anything right?

804
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:30,084
How much...

805
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,584
do you want for that footage?

806
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,025
- I want 500 million dollars. - Five hundred million?

807
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,364
Are you kidding me?

808
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,465
If you're desperate, you'll have to prepare it.

809
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:44,009
Otherwise, I'll bring it to the police.

810
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:47,374
You're responsible for Oh Yoon Hee's death too.

811
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,505
Wait a second.

812
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:54,114
It's too expensive. Give me a discount.

813
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,215
What? This is embarrassing.

814
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,218
It's 500 million.

815
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:01,390
Prepare it within this week,

816
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:04,130
and this footage is yours.

817
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,225
The shareholders' meeting is around the corner.

818
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,360
If you manage to bring Cheon Seo Jin down using this,

819
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,370
all of Cheong A Group will be yours.

820
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:12,094
Who cares about 500 million?

821
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:20,164
Darn it!

822
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,804
If it weren't for that jerk Kyu Jin...

823
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:25,779
I need to get that video.

824
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:29,074
If I have that video, Seo Jin is done for.

825
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,245
It's 500 million dollars.

826
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,154
Where will I get 500 million dollars?

827
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,685
Father is starting to lose it.

828
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,525
Darn it. My 500 million dollars.

829
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,425
It's 500 million dollars.

830
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:47,538
I plan to dry up all of Joo Dan Tae's funds.

831
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,170
His properties, cash,

832
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,664
and the slush fund he has abroad.

833
00:46:52,069 --> 00:46:54,475
It's starting to get there.

834
00:46:54,809 --> 00:46:57,045
It's time to go after Seo Jin.

835
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,150
When did you hear the rumor about Oh Yoon Hee's murder?

836
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:04,090
I heard it through the grapevine,

837
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:06,245
so I can't remember exactly when it was.

838
00:47:06,289 --> 00:47:10,989
Still, the rumor was so detailed. That's why it seems credible.

839
00:47:10,989 --> 00:47:13,459
They say someone pushed from behind.

840
00:47:13,459 --> 00:47:15,759
They wanted the ten billion dollars.

841
00:47:15,759 --> 00:47:18,894
Why are you investigating that now?

842
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,600
The police received a tip too,

843
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,495
that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered.

844
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,370
It was damaged,

845
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,269
but we found the dashboard camera from the site.

846
00:47:26,269 --> 00:47:28,380
- Dashboard camera? - We're restoring it now.

847
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,380
No way.

848
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,450
Please call us if you hear anything else.

849
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:32,644
Of course.

850
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,275
Are you all right?

851
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,644
Of course. Let's go to school.

852
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,755
Scared?

853
00:47:50,229 --> 00:47:52,564
You should be, you evil witch.

854
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:06,080
The police received a tip too,

855
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,279
that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered.

856
00:48:07,279 --> 00:48:08,819
They say someone pushed from behind.

857
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,289
We found the dashboard camera...

858
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:11,850
They wanted the ten billion dollars.

859
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,719
We're restoring it now. The police received a tip too,

860
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:15,219
- that Oh Yoon Hee was murdered. - The ten billion dollars...

861
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:16,459
We're restoring it now.

862
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:17,759
We found the dashboard camera...

863
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:21,795
They say someone pushed from behind.

864
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:29,235
What's wrong, Mom?

865
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,775
Eun Byeol.

866
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:45,084
What's her problem?

867
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,154
Are you okay?

868
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:54,295
Yes.

869
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,529
I was speeding in case you were late.

870
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:58,064
Sorry. I'll slow down.

871
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:16,374
Why are you back here?

872
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,584
I came to uncover the truth...

873
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,755
about what happened the night Yoon Hee died.

874
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,590
It's a picture of Dan Tae...

875
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:26,955
following her car in his.

876
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,529
He was the one...

877
00:49:33,529 --> 00:49:36,164
who promised to get Eun Byeol for me.

878
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,205
He was also the one who made me lie to the press.

879
00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:42,675
Will you let him get away with it?

880
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,775
What are you getting at?

881
00:49:45,009 --> 00:49:47,914
I want to help you, that's why.

882
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,120
The video of Dan Tae...

883
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,249
chasing Yoon Hee that day in Gimpo.

884
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:55,515
My sworn statement that he paid me.

885
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,525
I'll give it all to you.

886
00:49:57,529 --> 00:49:58,755
Do you mean it?

887
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,930
In exchange, I want 500 million dollars.

888
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,094
What?

889
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:05,900
You really are insane.

890
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:07,600
You can have it by the end of the week, right?

891
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,569
If you consider it the price for Eun Byeol's life,

892
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,765
you should be more than willing to part with it.

893
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,505
Okay, then. I'll wait for your call.

894
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,675
What... That... You crazy little...

895
00:50:30,729 --> 00:50:32,854
Put the Cheongdam-dong building up for sale.

896
00:50:32,959 --> 00:50:34,630
Sell everything that's worth anything!

897
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,054
Within the week.

898
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,600
- I need 500 million dollars more. - Pardon?

899
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,100
Didn't you hear me? Go bring me money.

900
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,394
Do whatever it takes...

901
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:45,505
to get the money together.

902
00:50:47,279 --> 00:50:50,644
If I don't get rid of Dan Tae now, I'll be the one going down.

903
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:52,445
I'm the one...

904
00:50:55,049 --> 00:50:56,715
who will die.

905
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,084
(Cheong A Group)

906
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,229
Here are the supporting documents and the promissory note...

907
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,025
for lot 27 in Cheonsoo District.

908
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,164
(Promissory Note)

909

(Borrower - Joo Dan Tae, Lender - Song Hee Soo)

910
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,664
Your business must be struggling.

911
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:21,005
You haven't fully paid off the previous loan yet.

912
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,005
That's why I put the prime location in Cheonsoo District as collateral.

913
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:25,445
You know...

914
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,180
the value of lot 27 in Cheonsoo District.

915
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,445
That's why I'm lending it to you.

916
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:31,884
The full 500 million dollars.

917
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:37,925
(Bank check for 500 million dollars)

918
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:43,054
I'll pay it back with interest after this week's shareholders' meeting.

919
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:47,435
Will you become the leader of Cheong A Group?

920
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,035
Congratulations in advance.

921
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,134
Thank you.

924

Where's the video?

925
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,180
The money.

926
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,450
I'll wire it to you right now. Don't worry.

927
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,715
Do it now. I trust no one.

928
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,758
A whopping 500 million dollars.

929
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:47,930
(Transfer completed.)

930
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,094
Congrats.

931

Talk about striking gold.

932
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:56,564
You're the one who struck gold.

933
00:52:56,769 --> 00:52:58,069
With this,

934
00:52:58,069 --> 00:53:00,564
you can get rid of Seo Jin no problem.

935
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,374
Later.

936
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:08,614
Hey, mister. What are you doing?

937
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,914
You're surprisingly naive, Dan Tae.

938
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,215
How have you been?

939
00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:17,054
Yoon Chul?

940
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,090
How are you still alive?

941
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:22,054
Why? Did you think I had died?

942
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,795
I can't die until you die.

943
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,695
Darn it.

944
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,745
Sir.

945
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,485
Are you all right? Sir?

946
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,154
It's a bank check.

947
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:01,435
(Bank check for 500 million dollars)

948
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:04,269
It can't be traced, right?

949
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:06,535
Just give me the evidence.

950
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:21,489
This is a recording of Dan Tae ordering me to lie to the press.

951
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,215
Circulate that to the reporters.

952
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,054
Now that we've completed our business,

953
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,894
stay away from my daughter.

954
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:39,735
Is it over now?

955
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:42,675
There's one thing left.

956
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:46,945

958
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:56,059
Circulate this to every media company.

959
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,860
Move as quickly as possible so it can be breaking news.

960
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,025
Yes, ma'am.

961
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:15,695
What happened? What about that jerk?

962
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:18,199
We lost him. I'm sorry, sir.

963
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:20,034
You idiot!

964
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,205
Ha Yoon Chul's alive.

965
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:26,945
Why is he working with Jin Bun Hong?

966
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,445
Is Cheon Seo Jin behind this?

967
00:55:36,219 --> 00:55:37,414
I have bad news.

968
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:38,615
What is it?

969
00:55:40,529 --> 00:55:43,389
Oh Yoon Hee who was suspected of kidnapping and...

970
00:55:43,389 --> 00:55:45,600
threatening her daughter's friend before falling off a Gimpo cliff...

971
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,370
was said to have been murdered.

972
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:49,329
Police named Cheong A Group's...

973
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:52,139
Chairman Joo Dan Tae a likely suspect...

974
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:54,109
and have decided to bring him in.

975
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:56,740
This so-called "Ten-Billion-Dollar Murder"...

976
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:58,109
got the name because Ms. Oh...

977
00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:00,179
- had ten billion in a safe... - Ten billion dollars?

978
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:02,310
What nonsense is that?

979
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,079
I never saw the ten billion dollars!

980
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,374
We have to get out of here.

981
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,544
The police are on their way.

982
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,225
(Police)

983
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:25,365
- Follow me. - Okay.

984
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:28,065
Excuse me.

985
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:30,910
Hey, you! Stop!

986
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:32,675
- Stop! - Darn you!

987
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:33,875
Stop it!

988
00:56:37,179 --> 00:56:38,274
Get him.

989
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,645
- Get them! - Okay.

990
00:56:41,419 --> 00:56:42,514
Get him.

991
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,315
- Hold him. - Yes, sir.

992
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:00,705
Darn it.

993
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:02,235

(Cheong A Medical Center)

995
00:57:08,949 --> 00:57:10,815
- Hey. - What are you doing?

996
00:57:11,979 --> 00:57:13,544
- What are you doing? - Sorry!

997
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,185
Darn it.

998
00:57:19,419 --> 00:57:20,555
Get out.

999
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:28,025
Stop!

1000
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,924
- Get them! - Hurry!

1001
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,569
Get the plate number and broadcast it.

1002
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:34,470
We want Joo Dan Tae and Yoo Dong Pil.

1003
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,565
Yes, sir.

1004
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:40,234
I had no choice but to give into Chairman Joo Dan Tae's threats.

1005
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:42,174
I lied to the public...

1006
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:44,445
and spoke at a fake press conference.

1007
00:57:45,449 --> 00:57:47,644
My crime would shock the world, I know.

1008
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:53,014
It's not true that Oh Yoon Hee is the Admissions Murderer.

1009
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:57,359
I did as Chairman Joo told me to,

1010
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,695
and took Eun Byeol from Hera Palace and put her in my car.

1011
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:05,164
I then took her to a Gimpo orchard that Chairman Joo and I spoke of.

1012
00:58:05,269 --> 00:58:07,634
The police are searching the penthouse.

1013
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:09,764
And Dan Tae?

1014
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,375
He vanished.

1015
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,204
Did he dig a cave to hide in?

1016
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:19,674
Still, he's just a cornered little mouse.

1017
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:23,720
Summon a Cheong A Group emergency board meeting in one hour.

1018
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,954
Yes, Ms. Cheon.

1019
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:31,555
What should I wear?

1020
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:38,065
Should I wear red or blue?

1021
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,164
(Same genders only)

1022
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,870
Let's stay here for now.

1023
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,894
It can be traced, so do not turn on your phone.

1024
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:16,269
I'll go and get some supplies.

1025
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:18,005
Dong Pil, don't be long.

1026
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:19,735
I'm scared on my own.

1027
00:59:30,119 --> 00:59:31,590
Police arrested...

1028
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:34,355
Mr. Cho who worked closely with Chairman Joo Dan Tae.

1029
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:37,900
Mr. Cho is suspected of assisting in Chairman Joo's escape,

1030
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:41,729
and police are focusing efforts on locating the fugitive.

1031
00:59:41,729 --> 00:59:45,140
Police consider this a grave crime involving abduction,

1032
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,169
murder, and disposing of a corpse, which was planned,

1033
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:50,239
- and the Gangnam Police Station... - That darn Cheon Seo Jin...

1034
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,904
She killed Oh Yoon Hee and she's making me take the fall?

1035
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,080
I won't go down like this.

1036
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,679
- Hiding in a laundry hamper... - I won't!

1037
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:59,344
- to escape. - I'll kill you, Seo Jin.

1038
00:59:59,419 --> 01:00:03,090
Other than Mr. Cho, there was one more accomplice...

1039
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:04,460
who fled with Mr. Joo...

1040
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,584
It looks like Cheon Seo Jin will swallow Cheong A Group.

1041
01:00:07,989 --> 01:00:09,084
But...

1042
01:00:09,859 --> 01:00:11,795
that's what you want, isn't it?

1043
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,524
You'll take down Joo Dan Tae first, and in the end,

1044
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,039
it'll be Cheon Seo Jin.

1045
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,065
At Cheong A Group's shareholders' meeting,

1046
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,365
we will reveal all that she did.

1047
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:26,935
I'll also tear down Cheonsoo District.

1048
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,445
I plan to leave Seo Jin alone until then.

1049
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:51,435
Ro Na.

1050
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,735
I wondered who kept leaving stuff by the door.

1051
01:00:58,309 --> 01:00:59,704
It was you.

1052
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,344
I think you got the wrong apartment.

1053
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:07,344
Your daughter lives on the 85th floor.

1054
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,355
So take all this with you.

1055
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:18,695
Also, I'd rather not see you.

1056
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,195
I'd like you to be careful.

That's why...

1068
01:02:17,689 --> 01:02:20,884
you couldn't ignore Eun Byeol, right?

1069
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,654

01:03:12,609 --> 01:03:13,904
I'm wanted too.

1079
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,375
I think...

1080
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,650
I must confess to the police.

1081
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:18,745
What are you...

1082
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,514
You'll turn yourself in?

1083
01:03:21,689 --> 01:03:24,220
You promised to keep the secret forever.

1084
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,555
I can't do that anymore.

1085
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,425
I don't want to lie to my wife or daughter.

1086
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:33,154
You should give up now. The police got Mr. Cho too.

1087
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:37,535
Dan Tae. This is the last chance to turn things right.

1088
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,635
Killing Kim Mi Sook...

1089
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:42,040
Killing Oh Yoon Hee and stuffing her in the fountain...

1090
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,609
I'm an accomplice to all that, so let's both turn ourselves in.

1091
01:03:44,609 --> 01:03:46,974
You can't do this to me, Dong Pil.

1092
01:03:47,109 --> 01:03:48,950
When you were a thug in Jincheon,

1093
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:50,874
the one who got you out of the gang.

1094
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,474
It was me.

1095
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:55,145
When your gang members almost beat you to death,

1096
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:58,759
I'm the one who saved your life!

1097
01:03:58,759 --> 01:04:00,519
So I took the fall for murder...

1098
01:04:00,519 --> 01:04:01,984
and did time.

1099
01:04:02,259 --> 01:04:04,155
I broke my daughter's heart.

1100
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,364
Dan Tae. Let's pay the price...

1101
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,734
and live in peace.

1102
01:04:13,769 --> 01:04:15,204
It's different this time.

1103
01:04:15,409 --> 01:04:18,035
No, it's not.

1104
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:20,135
It's not different.

1105
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,945
Dong Pil. Help me out one more time.

1106
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,945
Let's say...

1107
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,315
you killed Oh Yoon Hee.

1108
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:30,984
If you do time for me,

1109
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,290
I'll give you everything I own.

1110
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:34,659
I have a fund stashed overseas.

1111
01:04:34,659 --> 01:04:36,259
I'll put it all in your name.

1112
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:38,795
You trust me, don't you? Don't you?

1113
01:04:39,629 --> 01:04:40,864
Just this once.

1114
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:44,994
Please, help me out one more time.

1115
01:04:45,369 --> 01:04:46,834
Just one more time.

1116
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,405
Okay.

1117
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:54,275
I got it. I'll think about it.

1118
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:57,675
This is a burner phone.

1119
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,744
Keep this and hide somewhere.

1120
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,785
I'll call if something happens.

1121
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:05,885
Dong Pil.

1122
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:07,555
Dong Pil.

1123
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:11,395
Dong Pil!

1124
01:05:12,529 --> 01:05:14,265
You have to help me!

1125
01:05:14,570 --> 01:05:15,665
You have to...

(Most students with perfect scores six years in a row)

1130
01:05:43,830 --> 01:05:46,094
Why are you taking me to my after-school class?

1131
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,769
Do you like it?

1132
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:50,600
I'm so happy you quit Seok Kyung's dad's company.

1133
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,040
I don't even care if you're jobless.

1134
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,104
As long as you don't work for him.

1135
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,635
I'd have quit sooner had I known my daughter wanted it this much.

1136
01:05:58,810 --> 01:06:00,109
I have to go.

1139
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,214
I'm going on a business trip...

1140
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,645
to tie up some loose ends.

1141
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,315
Business trip? Where to?

1142
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,324
Dubai.

1143
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:17,555
Dubai?

1144
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:21,665
You'll get along with your mom even without me, right, love?

1145
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:27,094
How long will it be this time?

1146
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,435
Umm...

1147
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:30,765
I'm not sure.

1148
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,574
I'll have to go to figure it out.

1149
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:40,015
Can I hug you just once?

1150
01:06:57,369 --> 01:07:00,035
Dad, I have to go now.

1151
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:01,905
Don't forget to eat.

1152
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,635

Darn it.

1163

Darn it.

1164
01:08:34,369 --> 01:08:36,265
You go that way. You that way.

1165
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,550
What happened?

1166
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,244
The police are here. Did you rat on me?

1167
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,785

- Go on. - Look at you.

1237
01:14:13,369 --> 01:14:15,905
You must be tired too. We can make the housekeeper do it.

01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,974
Be pretty!

1239
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,534

1249

My goodness.

1250
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:32,704
Did you prepare all this yourself?

1251
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:36,010
You did a beautiful job.

1252
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,175
Do you like it?

1253
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:39,514
Of course, I love it.

1254
01:16:39,949 --> 01:16:41,244
I can't believe this.

1255

1256
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,954
Sounds good.

This is...

1260
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,945
the happiest day of my life.

1261
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:08,564
(The Penthouse 3)

1262
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:09,909
I just need to get through the day.

1263
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:11,840
I'm going to reveal my mom's last moment.

1264
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,879
You killed Yoon Hee, didn't you?

1265
01:18:13,879 --> 01:18:16,010
I'll kill you. Is it painful?

1266
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:18,010
- Baek... Baek Jun Ki? - How do you feel?

1267
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,550
Do you have to destroy yourself even further?

1268
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,750
Don't come to see me again.

1269
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,350
After how much I struggled to escape...

1270
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,619
I must get out of here.

1271
01:18:23,619 --> 01:18:25,790
Something doesn't feel right.

1272
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:27,119
Are you not feeling well?

1273
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:29,554
See how it feels to live in misery.
