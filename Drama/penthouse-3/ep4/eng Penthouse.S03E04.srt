00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,379
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,579
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

3
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,419
Joo Dan Tae?

4
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,350
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

5
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,890
- "Baek Jun..."
- Seo Jin.

6
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,630
This is cheating.

7
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,870
Joo Dan Tae is wanted?

8
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,069
What happened? What is this about?

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,010
This man is...

10
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:19,609
Joo Dan Tae, right?

11
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,680
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,480
Why would Dan Tae be wanted?

13
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,390
It's obviously someone else.

14
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,620
It is Joo Dan Tae, isn't it?

15
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,659
But why is his name Baek Jun Ki?
Baek Jun Ki is...

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,730
your name.

17
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,500
You're keeping something from me,
aren't you?

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,310
What's your secret plan
behind moving into my house?

19
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,840
You're mistaken.

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,510
I'm tired. Can you leave?

21
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,079
Also, please don't go through
my room again.

22
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,390
Just ask me directly...

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,459
if you want to know something.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,339
Instead of peeping in like a rat,

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,080
why didn't you just come in
if you were curious?

26
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,948
I'm sure I saw this face
on that wanted poster.

27
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:32,580
His name is Baek Jun Ki,

28
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,999
but he looks exactly like Joo Dan Tae.

29
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,818
What's going on?
Shouldn't you explain it yourself?

30
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,589
Cut out the nonsense.

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,429
That guy is a crook.

32
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,699
I'm kicking him out soon,
and I need you to cooperate.

33
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,021
I knew it. The person who can
bring Joo Dan Tae down is...

34
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,539
Joo Dan Tae himself.

35
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,979
(Korean name, Baek Jun Ki)

36
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,030
(Logan Lee)

37
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,629
(7 months ago, Japan)

38
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,500
It's time for your medicine,
Baek Jun Ki.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,310
If you want to get out of here,

40
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,610
do as I say, Joo Dan Tae.

41
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,490
Who are you?

42
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,788
At 2 a.m. tomorrow,

43
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:47,689
when the shift changes, the power
will go out for one minute.

44
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,589
I'll leave the door unlocked.

45
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,759
Take the emergency stairs
to the parking lot.

46
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,129
There will be a car waiting
with the emergency lights on.

47
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,429
Get in the car.

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,099
What are you talking about?
Tell me who you are first.

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,110
This is your only chance.

50
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,216
Do you want to rot in a loony bin
for the rest of your life...

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,639
or come out into the world?
It's up to you.

52
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,909
Until we meet again,

53
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,909
lie low and pay your expenses
with this.

54
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,219
(Logan Lee)

55
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,590
Wait.

56
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,689
Stop there.

57
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:18,460
Wait.

58
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,520
Don't go.

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,189
(Logan Lee)

60
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:31,540
Logan.

61
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
(Shim Su Ryeon)

62
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,660
I hoped I was wrong.

63
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,199
Are you the one who took my seal?

64
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,529
Did Dad make you do it?

65
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:03,869
How far are you planning to go?

66
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,499
Shouldn't you know better?
How could you steal?

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,839
It's because you try
to take things away from me.

68
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,379
Why would I do that?

69
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:16,850
I know you have your eyes
on this penthouse.

70
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,649
Do you believe your dad?

71
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,219
He's trying to come
between you and me...

72
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,120
And you're trying to come
between me and Dad.

73
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,220
At least Dad tried to help me.

74
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,600
By stealing exam papers for you?

75
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,398
Is that what you mean?

76
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,269
At least he didn't kick me
out of school like you did.

77
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,398
You ruined my life, Mom.

78
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,869
You don't deserve to be my mom.

79
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,910
Stop blaming other people.
You're not a kid anymore.

80
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:47,610
What ruined your life is
the choice you made.

81
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,319
I'm tired of feeling
disappointed in you.

82
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,449
How much longer do you think
I'll tolerate you?

83
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,219
What you did is a crime and
should be reported to the police.

84
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,490
Go ahead and report it.

85
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,289
Put me behind bars like Dad.

86
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,459
That would settle this.

87
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:08,769
You're not even my real mom,
so why not?

88
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,439
You disgust me.

89
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Seok Kyung!

90
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,410
Seok Kyung!

91
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,819
Stay strong.

92
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,089
Stay strong.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,568
(Incident Log, Affidavit)

94
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,670
Yoo Dong Pil.

95
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,839
Yoo Dong Pil killed Kim Mi Sook?

96
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,769
Why? There must be a reason.

97
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,438
They met for the first time
that day,

98
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,480
so he didn't have a grudge.

99
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,850
They got into a fight. Supposedly,
he lost control and killed her.

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,179
That's ridiculous.

101
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,419
Why would he kill
Hye In's birth mom?

102
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,819
This is a coincidence?

103
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,490
But there is something
that's kind of suspicious.

104
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,430
What do you mean?

105
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,699
Before Yoo Dong Pil
turned himself in,

106
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,069
the police had suspected
someone else of the murder.

107
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,839
He sent the victim
a large sum of money.

108
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,040
And...

109
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,879
he spoke with her often
until just before she died.

110
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:28,680
(Call history)

111
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:31,620
The number's listed there.

112
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,019
Whose number is this?

113
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,519
The number...

114
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:39,290
is registered to the company
J King Holdings.

115
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,129
Joo Dan Tae.

116
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:53,999
I made this all night long.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,209
Have some, son.

118
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,379
I don't eat veggies!

119
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,779
I saw the news
about Cheonsoo District.

120
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

121
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,319
My gosh.

122
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,148
I looked down on it
for being a landfill.

123
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,089
But it'll be a new town again.

124
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,688
How many units did you buy there?

125
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,360
You took all of mine,
so it's more than 10, right?

126
00:08:20,829 --> 00:08:22,369
Give them back to me.

127
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:24,229
I'll pay a premium for them.

128
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,670
Seriously.

129
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:29,970
Let's set the record straight.

130
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:31,778
When the land was worth nothing,

131
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,078
you made your son pay you back
for every last cent.

132
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,180
But now, you want to buy it back?

133
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:41,019
I'm not interested. Get out.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,690
What did you just say?

135
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,159
Did you just tell your mom
to get out?

136
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,788
Kyu Jin decided...

137
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:52,398
to cut off even his parents.

138
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,959
Thanks to Cheonsoo District,

139
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,168
we can make a comeback easily
on our own.

140
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,700
Money isn't enough.
A person needs prestige.

141
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,939
You lost your post
as an assemblyman...

142
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,869
and lost your law license.

143
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,709
How will you make a comeback?

144
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,178
There's something called trends,
Madam Wang.

145
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:12,148
Cultural businesses are
all the rage now.

146
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,579
We're running...

147
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,819
to become the director
of Cheong A Art Center.

148
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,690
Director of Cheong A Art Center?

149
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:20,860
That belongs to Cheong A Group.

150
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,758
How... How will you become
the director?

151
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:25,459
Do you think...

152
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,830
they'll jump at the opportunity
and hire you?

153
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,230
Just wait and see!

154
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,699
If Min Hyuk gets into
Seoul University,

155
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,908
I'll let him have solo recitals
every day at Cheong A Art Center!

156
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,808
I, Kyu Jin, promise to run
for director!

157
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,778
I'll do anything and everything
for Min Hyuk.

158
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:46,850
Unlike someone who never visited
her son once in prison!

159
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,950
I won't be like you! Got that?

160
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,590
You'll be at the completion ceremony
for Cheong A Art Center, right?

161
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,230
Of course. It's mine.

162
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,128
What do you mean?
We haven't picked a director yet.

163
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,168
We're accepting applicants
as a formality for publicity.

164
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,570
It has been decided internally
that I'll be the director.

165
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,609
Publicize it well
so that our stock price will go up.

166
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,710
We'll have a music competition
when we have our grand opening.

167
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,079
If we make the prize
300,000 dollars...

168
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,979
and give them a chance to be hired
as a musician at Cheong A Art Hall,

169
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,089
the top musicians will line up.

170
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,659
Shouldn't the winner get
an exemption from military service?

171
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,590
Why is that? For Seok Hoon?

172
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,029
The competition can't be a front
for making Eun Byeol shine.

173
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,668
We want it to look fair.

174
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:42,710
It would look shady
if the director's daughter wins.

175
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,908
It's discrimination
if she can't win...

176
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,808
just because
she's the director's daughter.

177
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:51,548
Her skills aren't enough
to say it's discrimination.

178
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,048
You know that.

179
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,649
That's funny coming from
Seok Kyung's father.

180
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,689
Your daughter was expelled...

181
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,589
- and didn't even graduate.
- What?

182
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,289
I have to get ready for work.
Please leave.

183
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,058
You didn't forget our manual,
did you?

184
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:06,459
We must remain a distance
even at home.

185
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,559
Get lost.

186
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,970
Good morning.

187
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,449
How long will you cling on
like a leech?

188
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,449
I'll get you a hotel room,
so get out of my home!

189
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,789
Why? Are you uncomfortable?

190
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,490
I like living with you again.

191
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,190
It brings back memories.

192
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,470
How many years
did you freeload off of us?

193
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:45,139
Should I remind you,

194
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,669
Baek Jun Ki?

195
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,210
I dropped that name years ago.

196
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,740
Dropping it doesn't make it go away.

197
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,509
If you don't want to see me anymore,

198
00:11:56,809 --> 00:11:59,419
bring me 50 percent of the shares
of Cheong A Group.

199
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,120
I won't accept
a single percent less.

200
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,019
What right do you have
to covet my money?

201
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,059
You built the company
using my parents' money.

202
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,429
I think I have the right.

203
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,230
That's right.

204

Su Ryeon is as beautiful as ever.

205
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:19,138
She looks the same
as when she was young.

206
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,668
You met Su Ryeon? When?

207
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:24,009
It's sad she doesn't remember me.

208
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:26,710
But we were just so young.

209
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,250
She was my first love.

210
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,919
My father always said...

211
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,590
I should marry someone like her.

212
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,320
Was that why you wanted her
so badly?

213
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,528
Enough to steal my name,
Joo Dan Tae?

214
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,629
Shut it.

215
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,529
I thought the decor
looked familiar.

216
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,200
It looks a lot like our old home.

217
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,470
I hear your daughter is studying
classical singing.

218
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,110
You must've been jealous
that my mom was a classical singer.

219
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,249
You only listen to classical music,
enjoy wine,

220
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,519
and have severe OCD.

221
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:10,450
You're just like my father.

222
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,058
It must've been your dream
to live like my father.

223
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,659
I said to shut it.

224
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,029

226
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,240
Are you okay, Jun Ki? Oh my gosh.

227
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,668
I'm okay.

228
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,669
I teased him a little.

229
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,710
I said something that he hates...

230
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,610
and he got angry.

231
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,679
You know how proud he is.

232
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,819
That's probably how
he made a success of himself.

233
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,589

is the son of a successful
Korean-Japanese man.

236

I heard everyone in Osaka
knows his father.

237
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:51,429
Is that what he said?

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,129
If that's what he said,
it must be true.

six years ago...

about my time in prison,

00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,410
I applied too.

359
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,919
You too, Ms. Kang?

360
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,689
If Cheong A Arts
High School is child's play,

361
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,689
Cheong A Art Center
is a global game.

362
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,429
If you get everything you want,

363
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,730
would that be life?

364
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,629
You should weigh
your background first.

365
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,129
To be eligible for the position,

366
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,769
you must own over five percent
of shares in the center.

367
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,839
I heard Cheonsoo District's
value went up.

368
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:49,768
Are you all suddenly loaded?

369
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:52,439
The last thing
we rich people can invest in...

370
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,579
is art, isn't it?

371
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:55,779
Right.

372
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,599
Wait. Yoon Hee, you were
invited to the ceremony too?

373
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,130
It's nice to see you all.

374
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,039
I'm here to apply
to be the director.

375
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,970
You, the center director?

376
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:25,639
You're involved in everything.

377
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,508
Don't do this. You'll just look bad.

378
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:31,049
A murderer wants to get into
the art business?

379
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,380
Do you know the conditions to apply?

380
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,650
Of course, I do.

381
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,960
Don't you know
I own 20 percent of this place?

382
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,919
- 20 percent?
- What?

383
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,990
20 percent?

384
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,230
I guess none of you knew.

385
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,339
But then, maybe you didn't know
because my company bought it.

386
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,809
Seo Jin, I believe
you own about 15 percent.

387
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,839
If we count just the shares,

388
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,849
I could become director over you.

389
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,279
That's just nonsense.
How can you own 20 percent?

390
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
I love the feel of the stage.

391
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,950
It's fantastic.

392
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,930
It's time for the ceremony.
Shouldn't we head over?

393
00:23:17,289 --> 00:23:19,359
I'll go and take my seat first.

394
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,799
What on earth
are you up to, Oh Yoon Hee?

395
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,499
(Cheong A Art Center
Grand Opening Ceremony)

396
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,589
(Cheong A Art Center
Grand Opening Ceremony)

397
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,420
Thank you.

398
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,000
That's crazy.

399
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,969
Oh Yoon Hee took Logan's money?

400
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,269
Ten billion dollars of it?

401
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,169
How did his money end up with her...

402
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,568
and not Shim Su Ryeon?

403
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,479
While Su Ryeon was missing,

404
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,808
Yoon Hee befriended Logan in the US.

405
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:10,950
She got close to him on purpose.

406
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,649
That's how she got
JohnBIO's investment.

407
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,319
You're right. Logan owns JohnBIO.

408
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:22,890
That means that woman
stole the key to Logan's safe.

409
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:25,589
- What?
- How else could she...

410
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,529
have taken 10 billion dollars?
That much money...

411
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,369
Can you even imagine the amount?

412
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,239
Do you think Oh Yoon Hee
actually killed Logan?

413
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,969
Why don't I?

414
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,180
She's the only one
who benefited from his death.

415
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,548
How else could she ever buy...

416
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,450
as much as 20 percent
of this art center?

417
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,049
That makes no sense whatsoever.

418
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,119
Chairman Joo,
you need to tread really carefully.

419
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,990
Logan's dead anyway.

420
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,490
The rightful owner's gone.

421
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:02,568
Let's take the 10 billion
from Yoon Hee.

422
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:06,538
How can we do that when
we don't even know where it is?

423
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,539
We have bullets.

424
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,740
Bullet number one, Yoo Dong Pil.

425
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,710
He already has a record.

426
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,209
The first murder charge
is hard to take.

427
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,608
It gets easier from there.

428
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:20,119
Bullet number two, Ha Yoon Chul.

429
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,619
Bang. What do you think?

430
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,868
What happened?

431
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:38,529
Did you know Yoon Hee
bought Cheong A Art Center's shares?

432
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,339
What do you mean?

433
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,209
Did you two gang up against me?

434
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,440
To mess with me?

435
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,608
Tell the truth now...

436
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:48,509
or I will break our pact.

437
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,779
I'd never heard of it.

438
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,618
I didn't know she owned any shares.

439
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,980
You acted like
you were blood sisters.

440
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,519
What do you know about that woman?

441
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,089
A rumor's spreading
in Hera Palace...

442
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,889
that Yoon Hee
took 10 billion of Logan's money.

443
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,230
That's nonsense.

444
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,429
Don't fall for groundless rumors...

445
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,359
and keep a close eye on Dan Tae.

446
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,229
Other than killing Joo Dan Tae,

447
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,700
I care of nothing else.

448
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,469
You always get stabbed in the back
because you're so stupid.

449
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,639
The money Yoon Hee's spending
is Logan's, I'm sure of it.

450
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,539
You lost all that
and you don't care?

451
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,410
What an idiot.

452
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,349
(Bank of Seoul)

453
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,690
Turn everything here into one check.

454
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:37,289
Yes, ma'am.

455
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,930
(Bank of Seoul)

456
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,769
There she is.

457
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,430
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.

458
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,539
How's the store?

459
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,739
Where have you been?

460
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,849
The completion ceremony
for the Cheong A Art Center.

461
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:33,420
I'm running for the center director.

462
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,919
Ever since Cheonsoo District got
reselected as the new town,

463
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,720
everyone has been eyeing
the center director position.

464
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:40,920
But...

465
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,029
how did you afford to buy the share?

466
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,559
Got investment from someone I know.

467
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:48,559
Investment?

468
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:51,670
I thought the value would rise a bit
once Cheong A Art Hall opens.

469
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:57,470
What was it you wanted to discuss?

470
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:59,609
Did Seok Kyung do something again?

471
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,849
Joo Dan Tae...

472
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:06,119
asked Seok Kyung to steal my seal.

473
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,349
What?

474
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:11,450
Now he's making his daughter steal?

475
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,390
He is insane!

476
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:16,660
So what did he do with the seal?

477
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,659
The owner of lot 27...

478
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,799
and the penthouse has changed.

479
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,368
They're now jointly owned
by Joo Dan Tae and Seok Hoon.

480
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,400
Joint name with Seok Hoon?

481
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,339
Why would it be under Seok Hoon
when Seok Kyung stole the seal?

482
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,169
And Seok Hoon hates his father.

483
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,240
I don't know why.

484
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,549
Whether it's to make Seok Hoon and
Seok Kyung turn against each other.

485
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:43,420
I don't understand how someone...

486
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,960
can use their children
to this extent.

487
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,890
Joo Dan Tae is just human garbage.

488
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,289
How can a father...

489
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,740
No way. It can't be.

490
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,170
What?

491
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,380
Su Ryeon, the hospital where
you had your baby...

492
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,839
didn't you say it closed?

493
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:11,879
Yes, I heard it closed...

494
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,450
because the director passed away.

495
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,690
So there's no way
to check the files now.

496
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,119
What about them?

497
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,759
Su Ryeon, there's something...

498
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:29,130
I haven't been able to tell you.

499
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,400
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

500
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,868
I didn't know someone was here.
I can come back...

501
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:41,338
No, no. I was leaving.

502
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:42,539
Come in.

503
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,750
I'll talk to you soon, Su Ryeon.

504
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,990
What happened?

505
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:01,229
What if people see you?

506
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,970
I'm sorry. There's something urgent
I needed to discuss.

507
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,039
I think Cheon Seo Jin realized
who Joo Dan Tae is.

508
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:11,508
She saw the wanted poster I had.

509
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,579
We can't hide it forever.

510
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,180
Don't worry.

511
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:20,720
She won't be able to talk
to Dan Tae that easily.

512
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,319
You wore the ring.

513
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,900
How is the investigation
for Logan's case going?

514
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,499
The dashcams and CCTVs
have all been burned,

515
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,369
so there's not much left.

516
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,069
It's not easy to prove it was
Dan Tae wearing an old man costume.

517
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,240
It must be hard.

518
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,019
You can cry if you want.

519
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:55,420
I know how it feels.

520
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,119
When you lose someone you love
right in front of your eyes...

521
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,789
I've been there.

522
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,700
You might not remember,

523
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:11,028
but I've seen you when I was young.

524
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:12,839
At the Simoon Construction picnic.

525
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,400
You did?

526
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
I don't remember at all.

527
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,279
Your father really trusted
and liked my father.

528
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,250
That's why he allowed
for the marriage, I assume.

529
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,579
He was very upset...

530
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:30,459
when he heard he unfairly
passed away in Japan.

531
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,359
You were just as beautiful then.

532
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:43,170
I hope you can smile a lot as well,
just like you used to.

533
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,900
Let me take care of Joo Dan Tae.

534
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,279
Can we talk for a second?

535
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,490
Sorry, but I have plans.

536
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,518
I happened to see you this morning,

537
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,720
talking to Mr. Yoo...

538
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,029
about things you shouldn't
be talking about.

539
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,460
Watch what you say.

540
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:18,599
I hate it when other people
mention my name.

541
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,200
You must be really
paranoid about something...

542
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,970
to decide to come see me at work
and tell me to shut my mouth.

543
00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:30,479
Mr. Yoo feels that he was
treated unfairly in many areas.

544
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,210
Watch yourself.

545
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:35,750
If you're living an undeserved life
with someone else's money,

546
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,990
just take care of your daughter
and stay quiet and out of the way.

547
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,390
Ah.

548
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,190
You're wondering about...

549
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,400
the 10 billion Logan left behind?

550
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:54,939
You're still you.

551
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,209
Didn't change at all.

552
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,170
Straightforward. Making people
feel uncomfortable.

553
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,809
Joo Dan Tae. You haven't
changed at all, either.

554
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,880
Smells some money and
jumps at it as if it's all yours.

555
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,220
It's you spending the money
as if it's yours.

556
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,619
Did you kill Logan
to get his 10 billion dollars?

557
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,799
Do you want to know
where the money is?

558
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:24,470
If you answer my question correctly,

559
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:26,940
I'll let you know where it went.

560
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:29,740
One of the twins...

561
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,410
that Su Ryeon had in America.

562
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,279
What did you do with her?

563
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:42,749
What are you talking about?

564
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,390
Not Seol A, whom you
exchanged with Hye In.

565
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,690
There was one more.

566
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,660
Su Ryeon thinks that the child
died while giving birth,

567
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:53,299
but she was born perfectly healthy.

568
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:55,959
You did something at that hospital
in America, didn't you?

569
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,130
What did you do? Did you kill her?

570
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,598
Did you kill her like
you killed Seol A?

571
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,239
Don't talk gibberish.

572
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,169
You told Yoo Dong Pil to kill
Hye In's birth mother, didn't you?

573
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,240
Or, did you kill her yourself?

574
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,079
What kind of threats were you under,

575
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,279
to send her that much money
and then kill her later?

576
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,118
What was the reason you
had to kill Kim Mi Sook?

577
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,650
You little...

578
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,090
Always so annoying.

579
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,889
Just stay in your place.

580
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,360
I swear...

581
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,800
Su Ryeon will end up dead
because of you.

582
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,170
Watch it happen.

583
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,038
You scumbag...

584
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,300
You scumbag!

585
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,369
Yes, let's see what happens!
Let's see who ends up dying!

586
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,949
Su Ryeon had twins.

587
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,819
Did you know that?

588
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,119
Twins?

589
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,960
No, I had no idea.

590
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,659
After her ex-husband was
murdered in America,

591
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,000
She had twins in a coma.

592
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,469
She said she had
a miscarriage with one,

593
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:09,869
and miraculously gave
birth to the other.

594
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:13,409
But I've secretly been looking into
this at that hospital in the US.

595
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,009
They said one kid was born 2.5kg,
a relatively healthy weight,

596
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,549
and was released early in
a self-breathing state.

597
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,019
And the kid who was born 1.4kg...

598
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,849
and was then transferred to Korea...

599
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,289
was Seol A.

600
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
So then...

601
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:34,500
Seol A's twin is alive?

602
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,699
Where is she?

603
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,940
Are you sure she's alive?

604
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,539
We must tell Su Ryeon immediately.

605
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,009
She would be so happy...

606
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,909
if she found out that a child she'd
known to be dead is actually alive.

607
00:35:48,409 --> 00:35:49,880
But I have a feeling...

608
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,118
that child may already be dead.

609
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,449
If Joo Dan Tae had already
worked on it back then.

610
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,719
I don't want Su Ryeon
to get hurt again.

611
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:05,389
We can look into it first,
and then tell her later.

612
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,360
Can you help me...

613
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,969
look for that child?

614
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,900
Please.

615
00:36:14,969 --> 00:36:17,739
I don't care if you use all
the money to look for that child.

616
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,679
I promise to find that child and
bring her back to Su Ryeon.

617
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,710
I swear.

618
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,619
Darn it.

619
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,920
How much does she really know?

620
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,020
She couldn't possibly know...

621
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:40,059
that child happens to be alive?

622
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:48,869
Ha Eun Byeol!

623
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,638
Can we talk?

624
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,209
Eun Byeol is busy.
And she has nothing to say to you.

625
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,139
When are you going to apologize?

626
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:57,139
You tried to kill me
with that trophy.

627
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,609
Even if you pretend nothing
happened, the truth doesn't change.

628
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,248
This is unfair.

629
00:37:01,249 --> 00:37:02,779
You ruined my performance test.

630
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,249
Aren't we even now?

631
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,789
Don't even react to her. Let's go.

632
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,160
Where do you think you're going?

633
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,958
- Is she serious?
- Withdraw your appeal.

634
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:16,030
I was unfairly disqualified
because of you.

635
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,558
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

636
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:18,629
You knew you weren't good enough,

637
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,911
so you played a trick
to have me disqualified, didn't you?

638
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,399
- Hey! Let go!
- What's going on?

639
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,610
- Calm down.
- Eun Byeol!

640
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,768
- Eun Byeol!
- Let go!

641
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:31,038
- Hey, Bae Ro Na! Stop right now!
- My gosh.

642
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,180
Hey, move!

643
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:37,249
- Eun Byeol!
- Oh, my.

644
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:41,050
Eun Byeol!

645
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,019
Hey, get out of my way!

646
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,430
Let go! Move!

647
00:37:47,689 --> 00:37:49,058
Her head is bleeding.

648
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:50,829
What? Bleeding?

649
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,130
Hey! Move!

650
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,570
Eun Byeol.

651
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,539
Hey! What did you do?

652
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:01,740
What did you do to my daughter?

653
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:04,138
Are you going to hit her?

654
00:38:04,139 --> 00:38:05,879
- Let go!
- Take her to the infirmary.

655
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,010
Let go!

656
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,019
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

657
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,090
Jenny!

658
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,888
Did you just push her?

659
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,989
- Eun Byeol!
- Hold her.

660
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:21,328
- Hold her.
- Eun Byeol!

661
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:23,429
This counts as assault.

662
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,998
- Eun Byeol, your mom is here!
- Why are you just standing?

663
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,569
- Hold her tight.
- Eun Byeol!

664
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,039
(Infirmary)

665
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,070
Eun Byeol, are you okay? Eun Byeol!

666
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:35,539
Eun Byeol...

667
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,979
Where did she go?

668
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,990
Wait at my place. Here.

669
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,760
We'll keep her distracted. Stay put.

670
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,490
Do you understand?

671
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,069
If I get caught, she'll kill me.

672
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,768
That's not going to happen.
Don't open the door to anyone.

673
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:04,169
She might track you down.
Keep your phone turned off.

674
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,709
Eun Byeol!

675
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,439
Sir, please leave.

676
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,879
Hey, it's your doing, isn't it?
Where's Eun Byeol?

677
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,110
What are you doing?

678
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,848
- What happened?
- I know you hid her away.

679
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:20,119
Where's Eun Byeol? Tell me!

680
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,659
What are you talking about?

681
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,558
I just took her to the infirmary.

682
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,328
Stop lying. Do you think I'm stupid?

683
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:31,899
Eun Byeol must have run away
so she wouldn't have to apologize.

684
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,369
Tell her this when you find her.

685
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,529
If she doesn't kneel
and apologize immediately,

686
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,669
I'll let the entire country know
what she's done.

687
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:41,410
Let's go.

688
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:43,339
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

689
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
Tell me where Eun Byeol is!

690
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,249
Eun Byeol. I need to find her.

691
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,780
Where could she be? Eun Byeol...

692
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,660
- How do I look?
- You look so pretty.

693
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:05,970
Let's try these on.

694
00:40:06,499 --> 00:40:07,499
Okay.

695
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,780
She's still following us.

696
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:19,550
Pretend you don't notice her.

697
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,880
She won't give up
unless we completely ignore her.

698
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:30,660
Have you been following
what Mr. Yoo is up to?

699
00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:33,789
- There's nothing suspicious.
- "Nothing suspicious?"

700
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:35,188
After having dinner with Jenny,

701
00:40:35,189 --> 00:40:36,829
he's relaxing at home now.

702
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:39,099
I understand.

703
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,169
You know how much I
care about you, right?

704
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,740
Of course, Mr. Joo.

705
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
Go ahead.

706
00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:02,490
Here's what Yoo Dong Pil's been
up to for the past week.

707
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,728
On Monday at 3 a.m., using a crowbar,

708
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,630
he damaged the fountain drain
on purpose.

709
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,659
It was also him...

710
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,899
who put a fish head in the fountain
on Tuesday and created an odor.

711
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,470
Since Wednesday, he's been
repairing the fountain,

712
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:16,070
and here are some pictures.

713
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,209
Just what is hidden
in that fountain?

714
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,349
Why does Mr. Yoo
have to go this far?

715
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:28,209
And you.

716
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,079
I wonder why...

717
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,689
you lied to me.

718
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,700
He's been stuck
in that fountain all day,

719
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:47,630
and you're telling me
he had dinner with Jenny at home?

720
00:41:48,169 --> 00:41:49,938
During the five years
Yoo Dong Pil was away,

721
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:52,239
I thought you became my guy.

722
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,570
But you're apparently still his guy.

723
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:58,610
You left all the important
information out.

724
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:02,479
Did that thug tell you to do that?

725
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,849
I... I'm sorry, Mr. Joo.

726
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,389
Don't you want to see them again?

727
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,229
I mean your parents
in your hometown.

728
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,400
Please forgive me. I beg you.

729
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,099
Please forgive me, Mr. Joo.

730
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:26,639
I'll never lie to you again.

731
00:42:26,939 --> 00:42:30,539
I'm way too soft-hearted.

732
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,010
I already feel...

733
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,680
What should I do with this guy?

734
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,919
Find out what Mr. Yoo hid
in that fountain. Also,

735
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,490
find out what Oh Yoon Hee's plan is.

736
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:52,900
This is your last chance
to save your family.

737
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
Understood?

738
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,700
Take him away.

739
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,888
Come to think of it, that woman's
body was never found...

740
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:16,389
when we scoured
the entire Cheongpyeong Dam.

741
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,559
Why?

742
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:21,590
The fountain?

743
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:25,900
The very fountain where the woman
died stopped working?

744
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,840
Yoo Dong Pil.

745
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:44,650
The owner of lot 27
and the penthouse has changed.

746
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,849
They're now jointly owned
by Joo Dan Tae and Seok Hoon.

747
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:52,160
Whether it's to make Seok Hoon and
Seok Kyung turn against each other.

748
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,559
I don't understand how someone...

749
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,130
can use their children
to this extent.

750
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,740
No way. What am I thinking?

751
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,539
Hold on. A psycho
like Joo Dan Tae...

752
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,079
might want to keep his enemy close
and torture them.

753
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:15,050
I need to find out.

754
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,619
Ro Na.

755
00:44:19,689 --> 00:44:21,650
Why are you eating so much at night?

756
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:25,788
Now that my performance test
is over, I feel so relieved.

757
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:27,360
I keep feeling hungry.

758
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:30,529
All right. Don't stay up too late.

759
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,530
Okay.

760
00:44:44,479 --> 00:44:45,579
Eat.

761
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:52,150
Don't worry. I got rid of Ms. Jin.

762
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,590
She won't come here for a while.

763
00:44:56,889 --> 00:45:00,559
But...
Why is she like that toward you?

764
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:02,529
I don't know.

765
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,799
She loses it and gets angry
if I even mention my mom.

766
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,769
She's becoming more and more
obsessive.

767
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,598
She can't handle it
if she can't see me for a minute.

768
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,470
She calls 100 times a day.

769
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,979
I think she was the one
who put my cell phone...

770
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,010
in your pocket in the waiting room.

771
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,748
What? Why would she do that?

772
00:45:21,749 --> 00:45:23,450
I don't know.

773
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:25,280
I can't read her.

774
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:30,990
Did you call your mom?

775
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:36,160
Eat and then call her.

776
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,260
I'm sure she's waiting for you.

777
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:49,610
That psycho...

778
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,510
Who is it at this hour?

779
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,450
What? The security office.

780
00:45:58,249 --> 00:45:59,990
They said to pick up a package.

781
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,889
Who is this?

782
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,459
Mom.

783
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,329
Eun Byeol?

784
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:11,160
Is something wrong? Are you sick?

785
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,970
Well...

786
00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:18,900
Why are you calling so late?

787
00:46:19,669 --> 00:46:20,809
Can you...

788
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,309
come get me now?

789
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:26,426
I thought you were doing well
living with Ms. Jin.

790
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,309
You're the one who yelled at me
not to come.

791
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:30,550
I'm busy with work too.

792
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:33,449
We have a guest staying with us,
so stay there for the time being.

793
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,419
The CSAT is coming up too.

794
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,959
It's bad to change your environment.

795
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,729
What's wrong?
Is your mom coming right now?

796
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,329
Mom...

797
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,169
Hey. What's wrong?

798
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:05,050
Why did Eun Byeol call?
Does she want to come home?

799
00:47:06,019 --> 00:47:07,389
She can't come here!

800
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:10,059
No. Don't worry about it.

801
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,160
I'll go pick up my package.

802
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:20,769
That psycho.

803
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,349
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you come here?

804
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,219
Is... Is my Eun Byeol there?

805
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,490
What are you talking about?

806
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:45,320
Eun Byeol... Eun Byeol is missing.

807
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,729
I think Seok Hoon and Ro Na
took her away,

808
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,399
but I can't find her anywhere.

809
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,999
She isn't here.
Seo Jin doesn't seem to know either.

810
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,400
Where did my daughter go?

811
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,970
Make sure to find her.

812
00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:00,839
I said to keep an eye on her.
She's Seo Jin's only weakness.

813
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,309
If you don't find her,
our deal is over.

814
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,910
Deal?

815
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,449
I don't need any of that.
As long as I have my Eun Byeol.

816
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,079
I only helped you because you said
we could leave the country.

817
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,549
Do you think I care at all
about you?

818
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,990
I never once saw you as a man.

819
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:20,459
Once I find my Eun Byeol,
we'll hide where no one can find us.

820
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,998
Eun Byeol. My Eun Byeol.

821
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:24,860
Eun Byeol. Eun Byeol.

822
00:48:27,729 --> 00:48:29,740
She won't be useful for very long
either.

823
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,340
Why are there so many
psycho wenches in my life?

824
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,110
Did you not sleep well?

825
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,209
You don't look well.

826
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:44,680
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

827
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:46,689
I'll be fine soon.

828
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,188
I got this for you.

829
00:48:54,189 --> 00:48:55,689
Read it when you can't fall asleep.

830
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,200
("Paradise Lost")

831
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:05,400
Thanks. I can't wait to read it.

832
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,610
Want to stay for breakfast?

833
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,539
Should I?

834
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,809
I'll go wash my hands.

835
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:16,538
Ms. Oh is at my place.

836
00:50:16,539 --> 00:50:18,109
She is? That's a relief.

837
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,779
Eun Byeol, you can come out.

838
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,410
My mom isn't home.

839
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,850
It's not much, but dig in.

840
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:31,249
Why are you being so nice to me?

841
00:50:32,589 --> 00:50:35,260
Bae Ro Na, why do you always
have to be the good one?

842
00:50:35,459 --> 00:50:37,660
You always make me look bad.

843
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,429
And I hate you for that.

844
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,829
Criticize me and hate me.

845
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,569
That would make me feel better.

846
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,870
What am I supposed to do?

847
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,609
I still hate you.

848
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,649
And you still owe me
a proper apology.

849
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:01,879
But for now,
I just want to help you.

850
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:03,419
That's how I feel.

851
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,619
I don't care if I'm being nosy
or a pushover.

852
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,318
What I know is that
you're not happy right now.

853
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,689
So stop crying and eat.
I'm tired of your whining.

854
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,899
Please. Get it together, okay?

855
00:51:21,169 --> 00:51:22,870
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

856
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,280
(Diagnostic Test Lab)

857
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:06,919
(Diagnostic Test Lab)

858
00:52:08,249 --> 00:52:10,350
Oh Yoon Hee just arrived
at a DNA test lab.

859
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,619
She came from the penthouse.

860
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,289
I think she's doing a test
on the kids.

861
00:52:14,919 --> 00:52:16,559
Stop the test by all means.

862
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,228
No one can find out the truth.

863
00:52:18,229 --> 00:52:20,510
Tamper with the test or something.
Oh Yoon Hee can't know!

864
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:29,200
(Diagnostic Test Lab)

865
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
She knows everything.

866
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,600
That pain Oh Yoon Hee.

867
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,208
Life can be so tenacious.

868
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:05,870
(Shim Su Ryeon's baby)

869
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:10,850
(Kim Mi Sook's baby)

870
00:53:13,479 --> 00:53:15,979
Well done. You did the right thing.

871
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:20,319
Again?

872
00:53:20,859 --> 00:53:22,990
You're out of money already?

873
00:53:23,089 --> 00:53:25,459
How much to make you
shut your mouth?

874
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:28,259
Today, I'm not here
to talk about Hye In.

875
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,700
I found out something
more shocking and interesting.

876
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:35,539
The twins' birth mom's name is...

877
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,970
Na Ae Gyo.

878
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:39,839
What?

879
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,510
She looks just like Shim Su Ryeon.

880
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:46,680
I happened to hear about Na Ae Gyo.

881
00:53:47,379 --> 00:53:50,220
That you two were friends
since childhood.

882
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,819
But...

883
00:53:52,189 --> 00:53:55,220
Na Ae Gyo never gave birth to twins.

884
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,728
Her birth was a hard one,

885
00:53:57,729 --> 00:54:00,060
so all the OB-GYN nurses
remember her.

886
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,969
Just to be sure,

887
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,300
I compared your DNA to the twins'.

888
00:54:07,499 --> 00:54:08,899
One of them...

889
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,939
isn't yours.

890
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:15,140
The result is...

891
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,479
right here.

892
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,120
You put in a lot of work.

893
00:54:24,749 --> 00:54:28,088
But you did something pointless
just to take more money from me.

894
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:29,189
So...

895
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:32,159
your point is,
pay you more this time, right?

896
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,200
I'm glad we're on the same page.

897
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,930
I really hope your beautiful wife
Shim Su Ryeon...

898
00:54:38,169 --> 00:54:40,600
never has to suffer
a dreadful shock.

899
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,038
One of the twins
she gave birth to...

900
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,539
was swapped out
with another baby and abandoned,

901
00:54:46,879 --> 00:54:49,680
while the other thinks
their real mom is their stepmom.

902
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,720
Doesn't this make you
a monster, not a husband?

903
00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:04,959
Not to mention you have an ex
who looks just like her...

904

(Adhere to safety protocol)

905
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:11,499
If you know too much,

906
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,399
this is what happens, Kim Mi Sook.

907
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,838
You sucked me dry for 10 years.

908
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:18,669
It's time you got sick of it.

909
00:55:20,479 --> 00:55:22,580
But your head exploded
before your stomach did.

910
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:35,359
(No entering without safety hats)

911
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,100
Chairman Joo.

912
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,228
What happened?

913
00:55:42,229 --> 00:55:43,700
Don't let anyone come inside.

914
00:55:44,269 --> 00:55:46,538
The workers are returning
from their break.

915
00:55:46,539 --> 00:55:48,269
Just stop them!

916
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:52,240
Did you kill her?

917
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,050
Mr. Yoo, I need your help.

918
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,089
Deal with her body for me.

919
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,318
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of your life.

920
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,459
We've been colleagues for years.

921
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,830
No.

922
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:15,300
Dong Pil, my friend.
You'll help me, won't you?

923
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,530
You are all I have.

924
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,499
You promised you wouldn't let me
get blood on my hands.

925
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,609
Please, Dong Pil. Bro!

926
00:56:26,979 --> 00:56:29,550
Get out of here.
I'll deal with everything.

927
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,079
You have to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

928
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,280
Take her far away,
where no one can find her.

929
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,288
So that no one finds
any prints or anything.

930
00:56:37,289 --> 00:56:38,450
Get out!

931
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:40,220
Okay.

932
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,260
(Adhere to safety protocol)

933
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:00,580
Oh Yoon Hee.

934
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,479
If you keep poking around,

935
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:07,720
blood will flow in Hera Palace.

936
00:57:08,819 --> 00:57:11,289
Please, don't do anything.

937
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,589
If not,

938
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,789
you will die.

939
00:57:29,069 --> 00:57:31,740
I'll get a few things
Eun Byeol needs.

940
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,878
You stay at home.
She'll be scared on her own.

941
00:57:34,879 --> 00:57:36,709
She's inside. It's fine.

942
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:41,319
I don't like sending you out alone.

943
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,649
Shall we go together?

944
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,029
I wondered where he was all day,

945
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,769
and he was with Ro Na?

946
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,899
Why is Eun Byeol here anyway?

947
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:06,310
- Are you hungry?
- No.

948
00:58:06,609 --> 00:58:08,039
Shall we buy something?

949
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:10,309
How about that tteokbokki?

950
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:11,379
Tteokbokki?

951
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:19,349
What are you doing here?

952
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,319
Let go of me. I'm busy.

953
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,589
Ha Eun Byeol.
Are you looking for her?

954
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,129
Do you know where my Eun Byeol is?

955
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:33,470
I think I can help you.

956
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,279
Did Oh Yoon Hee say
when she'd be back?

957
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:51,119
No. She asked me to get the results
as soon as possible,

958
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,450
but she hasn't been by yet.

959
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:55,789
When she comes,
give her the result I gave you.

961
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,700
Hello, sir. She hasn't shown up yet.

962
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,708
You idiot.

963
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,438
What's the point
in waiting for her there?

964
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:14,780
She'd have come for it already
if it were urgent!

965
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:19,720
She caught on.

966
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,419
She went somewhere else.

967
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:23,450
Find her immediately. Now!

968
00:59:25,249 --> 00:59:27,260

971
00:59:57,189 --> 00:59:59,589
I need it as soon as possible.
There are two samples.

972
00:59:59,689 --> 01:00:01,959

I'm at home.

976
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:34,188
Don't go anywhere
and don't meet anyone.

977
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:35,490
I'll come over right now.

978
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:37,088
What's the matter?

979
01:00:37,089 --> 01:00:38,229
Well...

980
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,530
No, Su Ryeon. Let's talk in person.

981
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,269
It's very important.

982
01:00:45,129 --> 01:00:47,470
Right, Seok Kyung.
Where is she right now?

983
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,370
She's not home yet.

984
01:00:49,399 --> 01:00:52,240
Call her and tell her
to come home now.

985
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,639
Tell her to ignore
all calls from Dan Tae, okay?

986
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,608
I'm less than 30 minutes out.
I'll be there soon.

987
01:00:57,609 --> 01:01:00,180
Hello? Yoon Hee.

988
01:01:01,419 --> 01:01:02,580
Was that Oh Yoon Hee?

989
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:05,350
What is she up to?

990
01:01:05,649 --> 01:01:08,858
She must have no care in the world
now that she has 10 billion dollars.

991
01:01:08,859 --> 01:01:11,560
She said it's important,
that she's coming over.

992
01:01:13,129 --> 01:01:14,560
I have a question.

993
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,970
Did you send over
someone called Baek Jun Ki?

994
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:20,538
Why do you think so?

995
01:01:20,539 --> 01:01:22,169
Tell me the truth.

996
01:01:22,899 --> 01:01:26,108
How do you expect to work together
when you have so many secrets?

997
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:28,438
If this is how you do things,
I quit working with you.

998
01:01:28,439 --> 01:01:31,950
You and Yoon Hee both,
I just cannot trust.

999
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:35,819
You're right.

Logan brought him here.

1002
01:01:41,689 --> 01:01:42,789
Logan?

1003
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,030
He holds Joo Dan Tae's weakness,

1004
01:01:46,129 --> 01:01:48,700
and he's capable
of truly bringing him down.

1005
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,970
I know you searched his room.

1006
01:01:52,229 --> 01:01:54,299
Whatever you saw, whatever you know,

1007
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,769
keep your mouth shut
and don't tell Dan Tae.

1008
01:01:57,310 --> 01:01:58,870
Things could go wrong.

1009
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,510

when Yoon Hee's here.

and tteokbokki set to go, please.

I see. Can I follow you
to your place?

go surprisingly well together.

1027
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:24,990
Come with me.

Are you well?

Eun Byeol! What's going on?

1037

Eun Byeol!

1038
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,039

(TOEFL Preparation Institute)

1040
01:04:53,649 --> 01:04:55,080
I found Eun Byeol.

1041
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,640
I'm being followed by Oh Yoon Hee.

1042
01:04:56,789 --> 01:04:58,189
I'm trying to shake her off.

1043
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:59,519
Help me.

1044
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:00,990
Oh Yoon Hee?

1045
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,530
Oh Yoon Hee is there?

1046
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:08,629
Then I should, of course, help you.

1047
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:11,829
I'll send you an address.
Lure her there.

1048
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:12,999
I can take care of the rest.

1049
01:05:15,769 --> 01:05:18,240
Get the car ready, punk!

1050
01:05:18,970 --> 01:05:19,970
Yes, sir.

1051
01:05:20,609 --> 01:05:21,609
Hold on.

1052
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,350
Are you keeping an eye on Mr. Yoo?

Yes, sir.

1054
01:05:27,081 --> 01:05:28,450
Then call Seok Kyung...

1055
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,730
and tell her to meet me
at the cottage in Gimpo.

1056
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:36,788
To get rid of Oh Yoon Hee,
I need people to help me.

1057
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:40,229
Yoo Dong Pil, Jin Bun Hong,
and Joo Seok Kyung.

1058
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,499
What's taking so long?
She said she only needed 30 minutes.

1059
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:47,870
Something must have happened.

1060

Mom, there's a problem.

1061
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:54,539
- What's wrong?
- Eun Byeol is missing.

1062
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:56,538
She was at Ro Na's place
until a while ago.

1063
01:05:56,539 --> 01:05:58,079
But she disappeared
while we stepped out for a moment.

1064
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,450
The door was left open,
and her phone was left behind.

1065
01:06:00,519 --> 01:06:01,680
What are you talking about?

1066
01:06:01,979 --> 01:06:03,518
Why was Eun Byeol at Ro Na's place?

1067
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,049
It seemed like Ms. Jin was
abusing Eun Byeol,

1068
01:06:06,050 --> 01:06:07,818
so I hid her at my place.

1069
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:09,419
Why are you telling me this now?

1070
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,829
Where's Eun Byeol now?

1071
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,589
You should've told me sooner!

1072
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,430
Didn't Eun Byeol call you
and ask you to come?

1073
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,039
Oh Yoon Hee,
why aren't you here yet?

1074
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,740
Eun Byeol has been kidnapped
by Ms. Jin.

1075
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:31,479
Kidnapped?

1076
01:06:34,649 --> 01:06:36,349
Where is she?

1077
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:37,889
I think they're heading for Gimpo.

1078
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:39,688
I'll tell you more when I arrive.

1079
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:41,958
Report to the police right now.

1080
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:43,359
Eun Byeol is in danger!

1081
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:46,229
Stop her. You must stop her.

1082
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:49,199
Stop her by all means. Eun Byeol...

1083
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,168
Oh Yoon Hee,
you can't lose Eun Byeol.

1084
01:06:52,169 --> 01:06:56,068
Please save Eun Byeol.
I beg you, Oh Yoon Hee.

1085
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:57,640
Hang up. I can't talk right now.

1086
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,510
Wait...

1087
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:33,038
Pick up, Jin Bun Hong!

1088
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,538
Why aren't you picking up?
Jin Bun Hong!

1089
01:07:35,539 --> 01:07:37,379
We should report to the police.

1090
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:41,019
Hello?

1091
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:43,049
A person has been kidnapped.

1092
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:44,449
Her name is Ha Eun Byeol.

1093
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,359
I need to go.
Eun Byeol must be so scared.

1094
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:49,519
Eun Byeol!

1095
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:52,229
- Eun Byeol!
- Seo Jin!

1096
01:07:53,629 --> 01:07:55,729
Is my mom following Eun Byeol?

1097
01:07:56,129 --> 01:07:57,999
What if something happens to her?

1098
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:02,870
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

1099
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:14,550
Dad.

1100
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,490
Dad, where are you?

1101
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:19,720
Dad!

1102
01:08:22,919 --> 01:08:24,530
My gosh!

1103
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,599
You startled me!

1104
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,770
You're home. Mr. Joo isn't home yet.

1105
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:34,669
Have this while you wait for him.

1106
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:39,709
Put this away.

1107
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:02,930
Why am I so sleepy?

1109
01:09:24,989 --> 01:09:26,789
What do we do now?

1110
01:09:29,159 --> 01:09:30,759
- What's going on?
- Take her away.

1111
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,288
Let go!

1112
01:09:32,289 --> 01:09:33,629

Get her!

1117
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,190
Get out!

1118
01:09:58,690 --> 01:09:59,919
Stop!

1119
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:10,060
Those useless jerks.

1120
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:27,419
Oh Yoon Hee.
You must have a death wish.

1121
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,199
Darn it.

1122
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,739
Eun Byeol! Wake up!

1123
01:10:51,869 --> 01:10:53,640
Eun Byeol, can you hear me?

1124
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:56,779
Eun Byeol, please wake up!

1125
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:00,449
Oh Yoon Hee, that little...

1126
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:05,350
I need to tell Su Ryeon.

1127
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,190
That Seok Kyung is
her biological daughter.

1128
01:11:08,789 --> 01:11:10,829
That her daughter is alive.

1133
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:34,579
Wake up, Eun Byeol!

1134

Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

1135
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:45,320
Where am I?

1136
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,759
What do you mean you still haven't
found her, Secretary Do?

1137
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,429
Find Yoon Hee's car first.

1138
01:12:56,430 --> 01:12:58,790
Find it, even if that means you
have to search all of Gimpo.

1139
01:12:59,629 --> 01:13:01,039
What about Oh Yoon Hee?

1140
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,169
She's not answering.

1141
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:05,239
It's my fault.

1142
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:08,339
I shouldn't have sent
Eun Byeol there.

1143
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:11,279
She called me and
asked me to pick her up,

1144
01:13:11,379 --> 01:13:13,850
but I hung up on her.

1145
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:15,480

me the bad guy?
