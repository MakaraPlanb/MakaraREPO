00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,250
Thank you.

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,190
(Cheong A Arts Center Director Cheon
Inauguration Performance)

6
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,790
Congratulations, honey.

7
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,628
Director Cheon,
first of all, congratulations.

8
00:01:55,629 --> 00:01:57,698
Many are praising
your comeback performance...

9
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,468
at your inauguration ceremony today.

10
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:02,108
How do you maintain your voice
in such perfect condition?

11
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:05,740
Even after I retired,
music is everything to me.

12
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,626
I'd like to dedicate
today's performance...

13
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,680
to all my fans in the country.

14
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,118
From now on,
I'm going to commit myself...

15
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,019
to raising Korean classical singing
to a world-class level.

16
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,820
Your daughter recently had
an unfortunate experience.

17
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,559
Is it true that the kidnapper is
your old rival?

18
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,399
Rumor has it that...

19
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,070
she's also the ghost singer
who forced you to retire.

20
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,739
Sir, you seem to be starting
a rumor yourself.

21
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,838
The kidnapper is just...

22
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:35,270
one of my wife's classmates
who admired my wife.

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,108
I do sympathize with her wish...

24
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:44,119
to get her incompetent daughter
into Seoul National University.

25
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,118
But I can never forgive her...

26
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:49,859
for committing such a horrible crime
out of a sense of inferiority.

27
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:53,130
Not all students should strive
to get into Seoul National University.

28
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,830
To prevent this tragedy
from occurring again,

29
00:02:56,229 --> 00:02:59,359
it's time we reformed
our education system.

30
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,830
One second, please.

(Cheong A Art Center Director Cheon
Inauguration Performance)

33
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,450
Didn't I say you didn't
have to attend the ceremony?

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,188
This is prima donna Cheon Seo Jin's
comeback performance.

35
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,950
Her husband should,
of course, be there.

36
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:27,059
Come to think of it,
you're one lucky woman.

37
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,889
With Oh Yoon Hee dead,

38
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,360
the truth of the ghost singer
is buried forever.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,969
I feel sorry for that poor woman.

40
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,240
You must know why Cheong A Group's
stock prices have skyrocketed.

41
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,739
Cheong A Arts Center has attracted
500 million dollars from abroad.

42
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,510
Out of which, how much is
from Oh Yoon Hee?

43
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,349
I have a question.

44
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,319
How come Oh Yoon Hee's shares
have become yours overnight?

45
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,818
It's almost as if you've been
waiting for her to die.

46
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,089
What about you?

47
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,789
Why did Jin Bun Hong lie
at the press conference?

48
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:04,700
You think I don't know
who's behind her?

49
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,599
I'll never forgive you for messing
with my daughter using her.

50
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,599
Be prepared.

51
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,339
If you know that,
why are you letting it slide?

52
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,379
The worse Oh Yoon Hee looks,

53
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,450
the more beneficial it is to you.

54
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,219
Is that it?

55
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,619
We're in the same boat now.

56
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:28,618
As the shareholders
of Cheong A Group,

57
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,559
we have no choice
but to help each other.

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,558
You don't want the boat we're in
to sink, do you?

59
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:35,930
You crazy jerk.

60
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,270
Who's calling who crazy?

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,819
Eun Byeol!

62
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,379
Eun Byeol!

63
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:01,549
You're here. Everything seems fine.

64
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,459
Her memory has returned, too.

65
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,789
Thank you.

66
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,490
Thank you so much.

67
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,229
Eun Byeol, are you okay?

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,428
I'm so relieved that you woke up.

69
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:16,299
You have no idea how worried I was.

70
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:19,370
I have great news.

71
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,010
You...

72
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,679
got into Seoul National University.

73
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,139
It was proved
that Bae Ro Na cheated,

74
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,679
so the professors unanimously agreed
to accept you back.

75
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,020
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

76
00:05:33,549 --> 00:05:35,919
Seoul National University
has been your dream.

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,319
You don't have to worry
about anything anymore.

78
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,488
Leave all the bad memories behind...

79
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,060
Those eyes are haunting me.

80
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:45,359
What eyes?

81
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,270
Ro Na's mom's eyes
right before she died.

82
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,700
If you make eye contact
with a dying person,

83
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:53,570
you're supposed to lose your soul.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,279
That means, soon,
I'll either go insane,

85
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,049
die, or become a monster.

86
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,650
What do you mean?

87
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,190
Where did you see Ro Na's mom?

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,289
Why did you do it?

89
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,219
What?

90
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:16,130
You killed her.

91
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,630
You pushed her off the cliff
with your car.

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,200
Eun Byeol! Wake up!

93
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,179
Eun Byeol! Please wake up!

94
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,548
Stop it!

95
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:36,510
She's still in the car!

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,250
Ms. Oh. You can't leave me.

97
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,659
Please save me.

98
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,120
Eun Byeol!

99
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,729
I got you.

100
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,200
Here...

101
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:58,799
Seo Jin! Help...

102
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,310
Goodbye.

103
00:07:28,429 --> 00:07:30,570
She tried to save me.

104
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,109
She kept trying to wake me up
and never left me.

105
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,108
How could you kill someone
who was trying to save me?

106
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,408
How could you?

107
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:41,080
No! You're mistaken.

108
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,418
You must've had a nightmare.

109
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,349
I'll ask for a sedative.

110
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,520
Thanks to Ro Na,

111
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,789
I was finally able to get free
from Ms. Jin.

112
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,099
But I've betrayed her again.

113
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,669
I killed the woman who saved me!

114
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,969
I did it for you.

115
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:07,839
For me?

116
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,839
You killed Grandpa and Ms. Oh for me?

117
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:17,749
Life isn't that easy.

118
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,548
You win some, you lose some.

119
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:21,489
How long will you throw tantrums
like a child?

120
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,858
Do you know what I did
to get back here?

121
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:25,719
Do you know the humiliation
I suffered?

122
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,606
I was treated like garbage in prison
for the first time in my life.

123
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,929
I was insulted
by scums of the earth.

124
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,899
But I hung in there and survived.

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,000
That's what you need to do!
You can do it!

126
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,640
I can't do it. I just can't...

127
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,409
What if Ro Na's mom follows me
for the rest of my life?

128
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:45,440
What if I go crazy?

129
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,179
I'm scared.

130
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,210
I'm terrified.

131
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,650
Stop being weak!

132
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,489
If you can't handle it,
turn me in yourself.

133
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:59,320
If you want me to go back to jail,
turn me in!

134
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,929
Mom... I want to live.

135
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:06,400
Get me that drug.

136
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:10,029
You remember that drug from before
that erased my memory.

137
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,968
Get that for me.

138
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,109
Then I'll forget everything.

139
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,609
That's the only way I can live.

140
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,479
I want to go to SNU.

141
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,049
I want to get a boyfriend.

142
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,150
I want to be happy.

143
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,519
I'm begging you.
Please get me that drug...

144
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,890
that will erase my memory.

145
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:36,860
Please save me.

146
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,959
Get it together!

147
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,828
Beat it on your own.

148
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,469
Everyone has a hardship
that they have to live with.

149
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,039
You have everything!

150
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,568
You got into SNU.

151
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:48,708
I'm the director of Cheong A Arts Center.

152
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:51,409
Your life is all set now!

153
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,709
So...

154
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,520
shouldn't you bury a small flaw
that your mom,

155
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,189
who did the best she could for you?
Isn't that a given?

156
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,199
A flaw?

157
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,599
You are...

158
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,130
a monster!

159
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,298
It sickens me
that I'm your daughter!

160
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:19,668
- Eun Byeol!
- What if...

161
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:21,539
I become a monster like you?

162
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,840
Don't come near me!

163
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,240
Eun Byeol.

164
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,619
You killed Grandpa...

165
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,579
and Ms. Oh!

166
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,490
You make me sick!

167
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,689
Eun Byeol!

168
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:41,859
Please come quickly.

169
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,599
Give her a sedative. Please.

170
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
What is it?

171
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,370
Mr. Do.

172
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,439
Remember the drug
Eun Byeol took before?

173
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,208
- Get some for me.
- What? But that's...

174
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,939
Don't say anything. Just get it.

175
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,240
As soon as possible.

176
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,179
No!

177
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,150
No, don't.

178
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,590
No more... No more drugs.

179
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,459
That's insane.
I must've lost my mind.

180
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,770

for your birthday.

202
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,449

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,559
I was bored. I'm glad you called.

359
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,899
Hera Palace has been weird lately.

360
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,499
I'm too scared to drink
even at home.

361
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,268
Because someone
called Oh Yoon Hee died?

362
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,269
Oh. You won't know the full story.

363
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,478
Oh Yoon Hee was
Hera Palace's troublemaker.

364
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:44,079
There never was a quiet day
since she moved in.

365
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,880
All the residents disliked her.

366
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,790
All but Su Ryeon.

367
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,119
The two seemed pretty close.

368
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,089
It was no joke.

369
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,360
She coddled the woman
who killed her own daughter.

370
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:01,168
Shim Su Ryeon had a child
before she was married.

371
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:03,830
Oh Yoon Hee pushed the girl...

372
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,300
and she fell to her death.

373
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,309
The fountain was covered in blood.

374
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,610
It was such a dreadful sight.

375
00:23:12,209 --> 00:23:14,179
It must've been hard on Su Ryeon.

376
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,080
Bad things kept happening
to people around her.

377
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,850
That must be just her luck.

378
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,089
Her mother died
as soon as she got married,

379
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,918
then her father died of heartache.

380
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,529
Then the great Simoon Construction
went belly up.

381
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:32,300
I think Chairman Joo and her
just weren't a good match.

382
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:36,729
Hey.

383
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,070
Are you interested in her?

384
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:44,110
What man wouldn't be interested in
a woman as beautiful as her?

385
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,610
Our parents were very close,

386
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:49,949
and she was my first love.

387
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,579
Hey. Traitor Ha, Seo Jin,

388
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,718
Joo Dan Tae, Shim Su Ryeon, and you?

389
00:23:54,719 --> 00:23:56,718
That's the worst kind of mess.

390
00:23:56,719 --> 00:24:00,820
Plus, you said you and Dan Tae
were closer than brothers.

391
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,259
We're really tight.

392
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,860
Enough to share everything.

393
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:08,269
How cool.

394
00:24:10,669 --> 00:24:15,069
Then tell me a little dirty secret
from Dan Tae's past.

395
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,809
I really won't tell anyone
that I heard it from you.

396
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:22,478
Look at me.
I'm really good at keeping secrets.

397
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:25,620
He's interested in Shim Su Ryeon?

398
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,790
I'm sorry, Su Ryeon.

399
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,530
I need you to save me.

400
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,400
I don't even know where to start.

401
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,999
It began...

402
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:50,269
with a woman called Kim Mi Sook.

403
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,709
Let me ask something first.

404
00:24:52,979 --> 00:24:56,280
Why did your husband
kill Kim Mi Sook?

405
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,149
You knew about that?

406
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:01,689
Jenny's dad had no reason
or motivation to kill her.

407
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,219
If he took the fall for murder,

408
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,890
there's only one answer.

409
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,229
Joo Dan Tae.

410
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:11,800
You're right.
Joo Dan Tae killed her.

411
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,030
My husband took the fall
and did time in prison.

412
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,099
He made a deal with that punk...

413
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,208
so his daughter
could have a nice house.

414
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:26,840
Now he might have to take the fall
for Yoon Hee's murder too.

415
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,009
What are you saying?

416
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,850
Yoon Hee fell foul with Joo Dan Tae.

417
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,949
Dan Tae had put Yoon Hee's body...

418
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,919
in the fountain downstairs.

419
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:43,089
And now he's saying that
my husband killed her.

420
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,360
Dan Tae killed Yoon Hee?

421
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,800
It wasn't an accident?

422
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,669
I guess so.

423
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,400
Though I have no proof.

424
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:53,339
I'm sure it involves
Yoon Hee's death.

425
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,669
It doesn't make any sense.

426
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:59,580
Yoon Hee's body
was pulled out of the water.

427
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,580
Yoo Dong Pil, that dummy,

428
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,479
disposed of Yoon Hee's body...

429
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,449
by throwing it in the water.

430
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,018
He had to because Joo Dan Tae
was blackmailing him.

431
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,530
Everyone is insane!

432
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,560
Everyone's gone insane!

433
00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:20,069
I know I did something
that cannot be forgiven.

434
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,870
I am not going to make excuses.

435
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,839
I am begging you.

436
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,569
But not for my husband's life.

437
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,939
What I want...

438
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:32,110
is to kill that scumbag Joo Dan Tae
with my own hands.

439
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,380
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

440
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:37,080
Please let me help you uncover...

441
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,150
the truth behind Yoon Hee's death.

442
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:41,189
I'll help you.

443
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,959
I'm not afraid of
humiliation or death.

444
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:49,959
I can't live...

445
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,130
in such a submissive manner anymore.

446
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,698
If it's true that he got rid of
Yoon Hee's body,

447
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,469
how am I supposed to believe you?

448
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,400
When he did something
so animalistic?

449
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,810
Your husband's an animal.

450
00:27:06,739 --> 00:27:08,580
I can't believe it.

451
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,850
What will it take
for you to trust me?

452
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,689
What should I do?

453
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:27,300
The one and only card
I have in my life,

454
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,130
I will use it for Yoon Hee.

455
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,239

I need to tell all of you.

462
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,919
That promise you made that
you would one day help me out.

463
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,060
It still stands, right?

464
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,330
Have you seen me break a promise?

465

I...

467
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:10,909
I have a sister whom I owe a lot to.

468
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,678
A little while ago,
she was murdered by someone.

469
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:15,909
Murdered?

470
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:18,009
Did you catch the culprit?

471
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,419
I have a feeling as to who it is,

472
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,120
but I can't do anything because
I don't have evidence against him.

473
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,158
Please help me catch him.

474
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:29,039
Are you sure that's what
you want to use it for?

475
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,728
It's not your own issue.

476
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:34,300
I want to help her get revenge.

477
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:38,169
Only then would I be able to live.

478
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:40,570
Please help me.

479
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,370
I beg of you.

480
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:46,340

judgment on character.

Supposedly the murderer
drove around for hours,

485
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,489
but there is not a single
camera footage of him.

486

How does that make sense?

487

If it doesn't,
you should make it make sense.

- Yes.

I told you I've never
had a daughter like you.

534
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:14,179
Tell your father this.

535
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:18,889
I will change the name that
the penthouse is under,

536
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,790
even if it leads to litigation.

537
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,790
Same with this company.

538
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,459
You get your mind straight.

539
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,530
Act...

540
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,100
only after knowing...

541
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,410
whether your so-called father
really cares about you.

542
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:46,708
(Name Change Certificate)

543
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:48,820
(Joo Seok Hoon)

544
00:32:50,449 --> 00:32:51,949
Joo Dan Tae.

545
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,850
Joo Seok Hoon?

546
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,199
Explain yourself.

547
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:04,998
Why is the penthouse
under your and Seok Hoon's name?

548
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,829
Why is my name not there?

549
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,998
You told me the penthouse
and mom's company were all mine.

550
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,640
Did you lie to me?

551
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,738
You stupid brat.
All you want is money.

552
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:15,780
What?

553
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,179
What did you just say?

554
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,320
Were you talking to me?

555
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:24,350
Your ears seem to work perfectly.
Why couldn't you use them to study?

556
00:33:24,689 --> 00:33:26,219
I'm tired.
We'll talk about this later.

557
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:28,820
You better answer me.

558
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,929
You told me to steal the seal,
and now you're ignoring me?

559
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,630
If mom sues me for theft,
I might get arrested.

560
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:43,169
Are you that scared to get arrested?

561
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,438
Why would you tell her
that you stole the seal?

562
00:33:47,439 --> 00:33:49,379
You should have
denied it till the end.

563
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,449
You ruined everything,
you stupid brat.

564
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,050
Mr. Cho, come in!

565
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:56,149
Take her to the cottage.

566
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,179
Yes, sir.

567
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,689
Let me go!

568
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,819
How can you do this to me?

569
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,819
I did everything you told me to!

570
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,259
You were using me this whole time?

571
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:07,859
You coward. You think I'm just
going to stay put?

572
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,428
I won't take this from you.

573
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:11,429
Take what? You little...

574
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,610
Don't be so loud.

575
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,540
Just stay quietly in the cottage.

576
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,110
If we lose that land again,

577
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,179
you're done.

578
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:29,880
Take her out!

579
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,820
Dad... Dad!

580
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,919
Let me go!

581
00:34:36,019 --> 00:34:37,459
Dad!

582
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,829
Perhaps it's time to get rid of her...

583
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,769
since I've used her for a while.

584
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,439
What else is left under her name
that I can use?

585
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,050
(Cheong A Arts Center)

586
00:35:01,419 --> 00:35:03,449
How dare you show up here?

587
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,820
You're shameless.

588
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:09,220
Can't I be here?

589
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,530
I thought you'd be grateful to me.

590
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,769
Eun Byeol got into SNU thanks to me.

591
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:21,939
How could you say that?

592
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,868
What was your plan
after kidnapping Eun Byeol?

593
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:27,910
Kidnapping her? Me?

594
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,209
When did you start
working with Joo Dan Tae?

595
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,409
What did he want from you?

596
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,619
Did he tell you
to turn her into a fool?

597
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,689
Or to stop her
from getting into SNU?

598
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,748
You put that cell phone
in her pocket, didn't you?

599
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:41,990
Did you think I wouldn't know?

600
00:35:43,459 --> 00:35:45,130
Is that what you think?

601
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:48,200
Then why don't you go ahead
and say that to the police?

602
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,469
Tell them that the person
who tampered with the test...

603
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,030
wasn't Oh Yoon Hee, but me.

604
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,510
I can tell from your face
that you want this buried.

605
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,308
Once the truth is out,

606
00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:05,110
Eun Byeol will suffer
the consequences.

607
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,619
- Shut it.
- Admit it.

608
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,789
I care about Eun Byeol
as much as you do.

609
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:15,888
Let's face it,
you weren't even there...

610
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:17,388
when Eun Byeol was
taking the entrance test.

611
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,058
You didn't do anything.

612
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:21,129
It's because Oh Yoon Hee
died a kidnapper...

613
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,800
that Eun Byeol got into SNU.

614
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,729
What do you want from Eun Byeol?

615
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,739
I love Eun Byeol.

616
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,269
Unconditionally.

617
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,139
That's what sets me apart from you.

618
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,010
Can I visit Eun Byeol
when she wakes up?

619
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:43,820
Jin Bun Hong.

620
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,289
Jin Bun Hong!

621
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:50,719
Jin Bun Hong, don't you ever
show up in front of Eun Byeol.

622
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,430
Do you think I'll fall for it again?

623
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,630
Answer me, you crazy wench!

624
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:56,329
You're out of your mind.

625
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,970
You're insane!

626
00:37:08,939 --> 00:37:11,550
She's letting the woman who abused
her daughter off the hook?

627
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,419
What does the woman have on her?

628
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,458
Hello, Ms. Kang.
Have you found out anything?

629
00:37:26,459 --> 00:37:28,329
I found the jerk.

630
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:29,999
There.

631
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:32,369
That's him. It's Joo Dan Tae, right?

632
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:35,070
He was driving Yoon Hee's car.

633
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,709
There's not an area not covered
by Chairman Song's business.

634
00:37:39,939 --> 00:37:41,910
Gimpo, Incheon, Paju...

635
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:43,880
They scoured the entire region.

636
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,209
Joo Dan Tae was in Gimpo that day?

637
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Does that mean...

638
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,949
Jin Bun Hong teamed up
with Joo Dan Tae...

639
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,418
and made a false statement?

640
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:54,559
That's right.

641
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,189
Yoon Hee was killed
by Joon Dan Tae, wasn't she?

642
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:03,959
Well, what now?

643
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,229
Do we bring this to the police
right away?

644
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:09,169
We should take action before
he can destroy any evidence.

645
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:10,539
No.

646
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,840
Legal punishment doesn't mean
anything anymore.

647
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:17,579
We've already done that before.

648
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,808
After all our efforts
to put them behind bars,

649
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,720
they all got released one by one.

650
00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:24,519
We let them get away
with what they did ourselves.

651
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,660
I trusted the useless law...

652
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,130
and lost so many people
in my life as a result...

653
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,130
while the guilty ones walk free.

654
00:38:36,499 --> 00:38:37,800
Then what's your plan?

655
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,269
Only a demon...

656
00:38:41,769 --> 00:38:43,639
can handle a demon.

657
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,610
You don't have to die
to end up in the pit of fire.

658
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,010
(Joo Dan Tae)

659
00:38:53,011 --> 00:38:54,149
(Yoo Dong Pil)

660
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,150
(Gave birth to twins?)

661
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:57,820
Yoon Hee made this?

662
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,019
That day, Yoon Hee told me she had
something important to tell me.

663
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,320
And she was followed by Joo Dan Tae.

664
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,329
To stop her
from telling you something?

665
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,259
That's the only possible
explanation for now.

666
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,599
What was she going to tell you?

667
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,929
Why did he have to kill her
to shut her mouth?

668
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,269
Why go that far?

669
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:16,700
I don't know.

670
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,740
Everything's tangled up right now.

671
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,139
But I'll untangle it by all means.

672
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:25,450
On Yoon Hee's behalf.

673
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,748
To me, Cheon Seo Jin seems
just as suspicious as Joo Dan Tae.

674
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,188
But she's a victim in this case.

675
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:34,220
She also benefited more than anyone.

676
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,160
That's right.

677
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,529
See how Cheong A Group's
stock prices skyrocketed today.

678
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,558
Those scum.

679
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,630
So there is more than one person
to go after.

680
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:50,169
By the way, who's the person
in the red circle?

681
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,339
"Baek Jun Ki?"

682
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,540
(Entered Korea with Logan Lee)

683
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:00,180
Baek Jun Ki. I'll start with you.

684
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,419
I need to find out who you are.

685
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,519
I lost again.

686
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,280
Seo Jin told me to come over.

687
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,949
She said she'd be here soon.

688
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,349
Please have a seat.
I'll get you some tea.

689
00:41:13,889 --> 00:41:15,820
(Baek Jun Ki)

690
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:21,329
(VIP Dealer Yoon Jae Pil)

691
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,729
Ms. Cheon, you're back.

692
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,099
Eun Byeol will be discharged soon
so get her room ready.

693
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,018
What were you doing here
without me?

694
00:41:44,019 --> 00:41:45,449
You wouldn't pick up your phone,

695
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,248
so I had no choice but to come over.

696
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,720
Is Eun Byeol coming home?

697
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,360
I heard she was too ill
to be questioned by the police.

698
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,458
She must be feeling better now.

699
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:55,958
Her treatment isn't over.

700
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:59,499
Are you going to sit back and watch
Yoon Hee lose her reputation?

701
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:03,069
Eun Byeol has to open her mouth
for the truth to come out.

702
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:05,639
There you go again. Please stop now.

703
00:42:06,439 --> 00:42:08,579
Only Oh Yoon Hee knows the truth.

704
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:11,950
Ask her when you see her
in your dream, or...

705
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,549
leave right now.

706
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:15,950
It wasn't a coincidence.

707
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:18,549
You becoming the director
of Cheong A Arts Center...

708
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,650
or Eun Byeol getting into SNU.

709
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,688
It's become clear now.

710
00:42:23,689 --> 00:42:25,430
What are you implying?

711
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,530
You know my alibi
better than anyone.

712
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,368
I was with you the entire time
on the day Eun Byeol was kidnapped.

713
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,639
No. You were away for ten minutes.

714
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,610
Are you saying...

715
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:42,009
I killed Oh Yoon Hee
during those ten minutes?

716
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,479
I don't believe you.

717
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:46,509
Wake up Eun Byeol
so that the police can question her.

718
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:48,419
Leave the sick girl alone.

719
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:51,788
Oh Yoon Hee hurt my kid
to get back at me.

720
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:54,760
She even killed a person
for her kid.

721
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,618
Her criminal record proves it.

722
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:58,059
Watch your mouth.

723
00:42:58,329 --> 00:43:00,288
You'd do anything
for your kid as well.

724
00:43:00,289 --> 00:43:01,800
I'm a victim.

725
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,969
I still can't forgive Oh Yoon Hee
for what she did to Eun Byeol.

726
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,869
My only regret is that I couldn't
put her behind bars myself.

727
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:11,970
But I do feel sorry...

728
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:17,309
for her untimely death.

729
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:20,649
She sure was good at sweet-talking
to you and Logan.

730
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,949
I'll give her that.

731
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,519
Mark my words.

732
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:27,220
Even though Yoon Hee
can't be brought back to life,

733
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:30,719
I'll get to the bottom of why
and how Yoon Hee died...

734
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,729
by all means.

735
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,729
I'll risk my life to find out...

736
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,169
who made her end up
in that freezing lake.

737
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:43,099
Go ahead.

738
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,669
Whatever I say,

739
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,010
you won't believe me, Shim Su Ryeon.

740
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,160
Is that why she came here?

741
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:18,309
What does Baek Jun Ki have
that she's looking for?

742
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,379
Did you want to see me, sir?

743
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,380
Yes.

744
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,450
My offer regarding Baek Jun Ki...
Have you given it some thought?

745
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,360
I'm still thinking.

746
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:37,459
Have a seat.

747
00:44:40,959 --> 00:44:44,130
I'll make the decision
easier for you.

748
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:46,229
I've come up with a way...

749
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,099
to take care of it
without getting blood on our hands.

750
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,240
What is it?

751
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,579
Baek Jun Ki is crazy about gambling.

752
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,348
He used to empty out his parents' safe
before he was 20...

753
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:03,050
and blow it all on gambling.

754
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,919
Even while he was locked up,

755
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,450
I made sure
he could play now and then.

756
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,130
His addiction should be
much more severe by now.

757
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,260
He has a tendency to lose it
if he runs out of money.

758
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,269
If you use that well,

759
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,439
it'll be much easier than you think.

760
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
Ten.

761
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,490
Eight.

762
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,189
Banker.

763
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:52,369
Insufficient funds.

764
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,550
Bring me some money. I'm all out.

765
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:12,919
What?

766
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:15,490
You won't do that for me?

767
00:46:16,019 --> 00:46:18,530
You don't care if I talk,
is that it?

768
00:46:19,959 --> 00:46:23,459
You brought me to Korea,
so you need to take care of me.

769
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,999
I hate waiting, so make it quick.

770
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,579
- Ro Na.
- Eun Byeol.

771
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,550
I hear you're going home soon.

772
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:48,789
I heard you've recovered a lot.

773
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,820
I'm so glad.

774
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:52,458
What is it?

775
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,490
I've been waiting for you
to wake up.

776
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,260
Let's go to the police

777
00:46:56,729 --> 00:46:59,269
If it's too hard for you,
you can just fill out a statement.

778
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:01,699
That I took you to my home
to help you,

779
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,269
and that my mom didn't kidnap you...

780
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:06,909
What are you talking about?

781
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,439
You helped me?

782
00:47:09,479 --> 00:47:12,880
I'm speechless.
Since when were we so close?

783
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,880
What's wrong with you?

784
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,019
Don't you remember?

785
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,650
When Ms. Jin hurt you at the school,

786
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:23,019
Seok Hoon and I got you out.

787
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,630
Did you hurt your head or something?

788
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:30,959
Or are you making stuff up
because you're desperate?

789
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:35,038
I saw it on the news...

790
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:37,570
that your mom kidnapped me
and tried to kill me.

791
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,139
That's ridiculous.

792
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:42,509
Why would my mom kill you?

793
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,450
She was probably angry
that you didn't get into SNU.

794
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:49,419
Everyone says your mom was
the Admissions Murderer.

795
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,149
How could you of all people
say that?

796
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:55,559
My mom went to help you.

797
00:47:55,619 --> 00:47:57,220
That's why she died!

798
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,759
Your mom...

799
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,200
even killed Seol A to get you into
Cheong A Arts High School.

800
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:04,559
She would've done anything
to get you into SNU.

801
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:14,910
I'll beg you, Eun Byeol.

802
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,539
Please tell the truth.

803
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,449
That Ms. Jin took you.

804
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:20,780
You got into SNU,
so it doesn't matter to you!

805
00:48:22,349 --> 00:48:25,519
I'm not here to argue about you
getting into SNU.

806
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,089
Give me a break.

807
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,289
You sound like I'm lying because
I want to go to SNU.

808
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:33,959
Are you that jealous that I got in?

809
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:37,760
You don't get into a college
because you're talented.

810
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:41,769
They know who will get
more financial support.

811
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,740
They can tell.

812
00:48:45,139 --> 00:48:46,669
You witch.

813
00:48:54,579 --> 00:48:56,280
Let go!

814
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,820
What are you doing?

815
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,090
Hey!

816
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,320
Hey! Ro Na! Stop it right now!

817
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,228
Have you lost your mind?

818
00:49:07,229 --> 00:49:09,630
How could you attack a patient
in a hospital?

819
00:49:09,829 --> 00:49:11,769
Get out before I call the police.

820
00:49:12,329 --> 00:49:14,229
Are you trying
to disgrace your late mom?

821
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:19,209
I was a fool.

822
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:22,939
I never should've helped
someone like you.

823
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,880
If I hadn't,

824
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:27,650
my mom wouldn't have died.

825
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:38,189
If you do this,
I won't show you mercy.

826
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,529
I'll restore my mom's reputation,

827
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,169
and I'll get you out of SNU.

828
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:48,070
Whatever I do...

829
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,599
from now on is all your fault.

830
00:49:57,209 --> 00:49:59,550
She still hasn't learned her lesson.

831
00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:04,079
My baby. You must've been scared.

832
00:50:06,389 --> 00:50:07,889
I'm okay.

833
00:50:08,689 --> 00:50:11,059
Thank goodness I came.

834
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,360
Don't worry.

835
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:16,030
She's just like her mom.

836
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:21,599
But...

837
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:24,439
Do you really not remember anything?

838
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,340
What?

839
00:50:26,539 --> 00:50:29,709
Ro Na's mom dragging you away
and trying to kill you.

840
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:33,510
No, I don't.
I found out from the news.

841
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,780
Really?

842
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,349
It's better to forget bad memories.

843
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,348
It's late. Go to sleep.

844
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:41,689
I came to tuck you in.

845
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:02,979
Wait a little while.

846
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,579
I'll erase all the bad memories,
my sweet baby.

847
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:16,360
We should love each other
and get along like we used to.

848
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,439
Hey.

849
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:48,150
What took you so long?
I said to hurry.

850
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:50,689
Give me the money.

851
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:57,999
I warned you...

852
00:51:58,099 --> 00:51:59,900
that only I can call.

853
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,240
I had no choice. It was urgent.

854
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,808
Did you blow all the money
that Logan gave you?

855
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:10,680
I bottomed out today.

856
00:52:10,939 --> 00:52:12,748
I started out well,

857
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:15,049
but I lost it all in the last hand.

858
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,579
This is the last time.

859
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:19,419
Do I look like someone
who runs errands like this?

860
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:22,220
What if someone sees me?

861
00:52:22,789 --> 00:52:25,689
Didn't you know I was like this
when we joined forces?

862
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:29,559
You said you'd let me gamble
as much as I want for life.

863
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,969
I even fooled Logan
and came to Korea.

864
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,169
You shouldn't make me worry
about money.

865
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,498
Must I regret
betraying the rich boy...

866
00:52:37,499 --> 00:52:39,740
and teaming up with you already?

867
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:44,809
(Su Ryeon)

868
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,220
Take it.

869
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,349
Su Ryeon searched your room.

870
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,320
I think she suspects you.

871
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:57,220
Hello?

872
00:52:57,919 --> 00:52:59,189
Is something wrong?

873
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,599
Sorry for calling so late.
It's urgent.

874
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,228
I need you to go
to the police station right now.

875
00:53:05,229 --> 00:53:07,599
The police station? Why?

876
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,938
They need you to give a statement
about Logan's death.

877
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:12,309
A witness statement?

878
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,138
Isn't the case closed already?

879
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:17,079
They found new evidence.

880
00:53:18,479 --> 00:53:21,579
They found remnants of a bag
in the car that wasn't Logan's.

881
00:53:21,709 --> 00:53:24,320
They found something suspicious
in the bag.

882
00:53:24,579 --> 00:53:28,189
They say the killer may have been
someone else, not Dan Tae.

883
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:30,059
There's another killer?

884
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,130
I don't know the details.

885
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,099
You need to work with the police
on the investigation first.

886
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,369
Okay. I'll let you know
after I get back.

887
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:52,880
What happened?

888
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:54,910
Did you deceive me?

889
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,650
This was your plan
from the get-go, wasn't it?

890
00:53:59,689 --> 00:54:01,089
What did Su Ryeon say?

891
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,459
That I'm about to be accused
of the murder.

892
00:54:04,059 --> 00:54:05,958
What was in that bag?

893
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:07,788
Did you put in explosives
or something?

894
00:54:07,789 --> 00:54:09,260
Don't be ridiculous.

895
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,099
You must've seen what was inside.

896
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:15,769
Were you trying to kill Logan
without telling me?

897
00:54:15,869 --> 00:54:17,669
What are you talking about?

898
00:54:19,139 --> 00:54:22,280
Then why are you nervous?
Dan Tae is the killer.

899
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,309
In other words, they'll find nothing
even if they investigate you.

900
00:54:27,749 --> 00:54:30,319
If you're thinking of stabbing me
in the back,

901
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,550
I'll tell Su Ryeon everything.

902
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:37,389
That you knew Logan
was going to die that day.

903
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:43,130
You idiot.

904
00:54:43,499 --> 00:54:45,530
Do you think she'll leave you alone?

905
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,070
We showed our cards already.

906
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,740
Watch yourself unless you want
to go back to the mental hospital.

907
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:54,369
Tell the police
only what you have to.

908
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:56,180
If you slip,

909
00:54:57,479 --> 00:54:58,780
you and I both die.

910
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,180
Follow me.

911
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,559
You'd better not mess up.

912
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,380
When you were Na Ae Gyo,

913
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:11,820
I thought you were cool.

914
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:13,550
What do you mean?

915
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:16,519
To be honest, I almost fell for you.

916
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:18,760
You were proud, full of confidence,

917
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,958
and spoke your mind.

918
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:21,760
That wasn't me.

919
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:24,459
It was me pretending to be Ae Gyo.

920
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:28,470
From now on, you should
live like her, like Na Ae Gyo.

921
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,169
Don't stay stuck in the penthouse
just being a good mom.

922
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,039
I'm still full of questions,

923
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,209
but one thing is sure.

924
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:44,510
Who I must kill.

925
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:51,579
Can I do this?

926
00:57:54,019 --> 00:57:57,320
Yoon Hee, help me.

927
00:57:59,789 --> 00:58:01,360
I miss you.

928
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,599
Yoon Hee.

929
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,539
Yoon Hee!

930
00:58:15,309 --> 00:58:16,880
Yoon Hee!

931
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:20,450
Yoon Hee!

932
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:26,820
Yoon Hee!

933
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:41,059
(6 months later)

934
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:43,468
Come and eat!

935
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:45,670
I'm coming.

936
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:47,569
Why is it just you?

937
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,209
Come and eat.

938
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:51,439
Yes, I'm here too.

939
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Good.

940
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,738
What's your schedule for the day?

941
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,779
Class finishes at six,
then I have a lesson.

942
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,049
- Ro Na?
- I'm applying for an audition.

943
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,519
Again? What's the point
if you always apply?

944
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,618
You never reach the audition stage.

945
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:07,288
They don't care for you
because you're a killer's daughter.

946
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:11,530
Ms. Cheon and the media are doing
all they can to tear you down.

947
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,658
How will you ever pass an audition?

948
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:15,629
Still, I should keep trying.

949
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,299
It's so infuriating.

950
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:20,038
Why don't you just quit singing?

951
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:22,808
You're smart. It might be quicker
for you to get into med school.

952
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,139
Why should she quit?

953
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,078
You should learn from her.

954
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:30,109
You need this kind of tenacity
to become something eventually.

955
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,379
Eat up, Ro Na.

956
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,879
You're comparing us over breakfast?

957
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,518
I'm sick of it.

958
00:59:34,519 --> 00:59:37,189
How do you act like
you might change but never do?

959
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:40,760
A person must be consistent.

960
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,259
Eat up quickly. I have to go out.

961
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,860
Why are you so busy these days?
You come home late too.

962
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,198
Do you have a boyfriend?

963
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,999
Don't be silly.

964
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,969
I'm sick of men now.

965
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:53,769
I got a job.

966
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:55,710
A job?

967
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:07,249
- Honey.
- Don't talk to me...

968
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,479
until you sign the divorce papers.

969
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,619
Jenny.

970
01:00:09,789 --> 01:00:10,789
Honey.

971
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,630
Welcome.

972
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,328
Do we have the VIP room?

973
01:00:19,329 --> 01:00:20,659
Yes, you do.

974
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,829
Ma Ri.

975
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:31,268
Why do you care so much
about your looks?

976
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:34,038
Are you separated
from your husband...

977
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:35,980
because you have a man?

978
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,920
Did you hear a mad dog bark?

979
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,420
A what?

980
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:45,488
My husband says...

981
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:48,829
Mr. Yoo's acting like
a poor bachelor.

982
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:52,089
You're not divorced
or amicably separated,

983
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:53,629
so why bunk with Ro Na...

984
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:55,529
when you have your own home?

985
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,669
Who's bunking with whom?

986
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,368
Ro Na lives alone,
so I just go over to cook for her.

987
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:04,010
You should cook for Mr. Yoo too
since you live across the hall.

988
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,538
He's the CEO
of Cheong A Constructions.

989
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:07,880
I feel sorry for him.

990
01:01:08,309 --> 01:01:10,609
If you feel that bad for him,
you can live with him.

991
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,709
What?

992
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:14,118
Whether he's the CEO of Cheong A
Constructions or whatever,

993
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:15,889
you can take him in.

994
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,690
Did she really
fall out of love for him?

995
01:01:21,989 --> 01:01:23,859
She loved him so much.

996
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,230
What happened?

997
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,699
The materials used to build
the Cheonsoo District apartments.

998
01:01:30,969 --> 01:01:33,300
Could you please order them from us?

999
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,569
Please, Mr. Lee.

1000
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,868
- Please, sir.
- Please sir.

1001
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:39,439
It's not like I have any influence.

1002
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,238
But you do.

1003
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:44,309
You're CEO of Cheong A
Investment and Development.

1004
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,718
I heard you're
the Cheong A heavyweight.

1005
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:49,320
I'm no heavyweight.

1006
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:53,018
I'm such a fair person.

1007
01:01:53,019 --> 01:01:55,488
I don't care
for shortcuts or favors.

1008
01:01:55,489 --> 01:01:58,529
I heard your son attends
Seoul National University.

1009
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,000
How did you manage to raise
such a great son?

1010
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:03,229
I'm so very jealous.

1011
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:06,339
Isn't it easy to get into
Seoul National University nowadays?

1012
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,109
But how did you hear about that too?

1013
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,469
Darn it!

1014
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:12,339
I'm not in rehab after an injury.

1015
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,340
Get out.

1016
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,509
- Mr. Oh.
- Yes?

1017
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,848
Give it to me.

1018
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:17,849
Come on.

1019
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,159
Let's eat. It's on me.

1020
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,959
The food there was nice.

1021
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,960
Yes.

1022
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,460
Secretary Cho,
make me a milk coffee.

1023
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,400
What good food are you eating...

1024
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,038
that your skin is so nicely oiled?

1025
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,609
Don't be like that.

1026
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,839
I have so much work to do
that I'm losing weight.

1027
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
Look at me.

1028
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,808
About Cheonsoo District.

1029
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:54,649
We should get a famous
private school to move there.

1030
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:55,689
So today,

1031
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,888
after much work, I arranged a meet
with the Minister of Education.

1032
01:02:58,889 --> 01:03:01,259
Chairman Joo, back me up.

1033
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,089
So what if you build
apartment complexes?

1034
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:05,698
It's worth nothing
without a good school.

1035
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:07,058
I'm in the middle of...

1036
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:09,098
making a deal to move
a boys' and girls' high school.

1037
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:12,500
Already? Then it's game over.

1038
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:16,368
The moment that happens,
the housing prices will skyrocket.

1039
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:19,839
Why don't we recruit
a private elementary school too?

1040
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,379
Area One of Cheonsoo District
that we're trying to bid for.

1041
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:25,649
Dohae Construction
seems to be showing interest.

1042
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:27,149
It's Dohae again?

1043
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,289
They've been getting on my nerves.

1044
01:03:30,019 --> 01:03:33,259
I heard they have a lobbyist
working for them.

1045
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,829
I asked around, and I just
can't figure out who it is.

1046
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:38,388
Don't mind them.

1047
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:41,630
They're a new company
that can't keep up with us.

1048
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,229
There's no way they can beat
the great Cheong A Constructions.

1049
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:49,739
Whenever you speak
with such confidence,

1050
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:51,739
Kyu Jin feels really uneasy.

1051
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,139
What is this feeling?

1052
01:04:01,949 --> 01:04:03,920
You two look so beautiful.

1053
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,189
You've been winning all contests,

1054
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,989
and you're also famous for
being SNU's queen.

1055
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:11,729
You must be familiar
with the praise...

1056
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,558
that you are a born-to-be star...

1057
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,869
who has both talent and beauty.

1058
01:04:15,929 --> 01:04:17,198
You flatter me.

1059
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,868
I still need to learn and work hard.

1060
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:23,038
My goal is not to harm
my mother's reputation.

1061
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,408
I heard that Cheong A Arts Center,
the biggest in size in Asia,

1062
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:28,380
is hosting the first audition
to find its resident musician?

1063
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:29,749
Yes.

1064
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,808
If you are selected as
Cheong A's resident musician,

1065
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:34,550
not only will we host three concerts
for that person every week,

1066
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:38,149
but provide any support needed...

1067
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,310
for that person to grow into
an international musician.

1068
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,189
The application will open today.

1069
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:45,058
I will try my best to make it
the fairest audition...

1070
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:48,829
where only the talent matters.

1071
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:54,340
I'm here to apply.

1072
01:04:54,469 --> 01:04:55,469
Okay.

1073
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:01,880
You're applying?
You didn't even get into college.

1074
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,118
I don't think there's
a requirement on education.

1075
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,288
If a vocalist who's supposed to make
the world's most beautiful sounds...

1076
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:13,059
got to her current place
only by harming others,

1077
01:05:13,789 --> 01:05:15,829
aren't those the sounds
of an evil being?

1078
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,130
You're the one to say.

1079
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:26,800
My shoulders still have wounds...

1080
01:05:27,099 --> 01:05:29,340
from when you slammed them
with your trophies.

1081
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,840
It'll be much quicker if you quit.

1082
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:34,578
I see you still can't
acknowledge you lost.

1083
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:37,480
It's not over yet
for who the best is.

1084
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,780
No matter how hard you try to stop me,
I will never give up.

1085
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:45,820
I swear I will step on Ha Eun Byeol
and become the best.

1086
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,689
Then I will prove to the world...

1087
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:51,590
that my skills are not fake.

1088
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:09,079
(Application)

1089
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,800
- Let's toast.
- Cheers!

1090
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:37,509
Minister, in order to
bring the rent prices...

1091
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,939
at Cheonsoo District to a level
even higher than those at Gangnam,

1092
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,480
we really need to move
Gangnam's Eighth District.

1093
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,808
We will provide for free...

1094
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:47,550
33,000m² of land
in the First District,

1095
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,419
which is the richest area of all.

1096
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,650
33,000m² for free! Let's go!

1097
01:06:53,820 --> 01:06:56,230
I heard your daughter...

1098
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:58,829
is in her prime for marriage.

1099
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:03,030
She's in eighth grade.

1100
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,229
I see. That's what I mean.

1101
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,146
Soon she'll be in her
senior year in high school.

1102
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:09,238
And soon it'll be time
for her to get married.

1103
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:11,439
That's why we already prepared
everything for you...

1104
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,609
with a huge apartment
in Cheonsoo District's best area...

1105
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:16,509
so that you can win in advance.

1106
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:17,549
It's the Royal Floor.

1107
01:07:17,550 --> 01:07:20,649
The chance to buy the place
is 1 in 3,000.

1108
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:21,880
Jackpot!

1109
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,590
You did your research.

1110
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,500
I'm thoroughly impressed.

1111
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,968
Let's have a drink!

1112
01:07:41,969 --> 01:07:43,468
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1113
01:07:43,469 --> 01:07:45,709
Live together, be happy together.

1114
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:48,510
- Live together, be happy together.
- Live together, be happy together.

1115
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:49,610
Cheers!

1116
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,079
Not bad.

1117
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,820
Minister, have another drink.

1118
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,360
Come right now.

1119
01:08:05,489 --> 01:08:06,960
I can't. I'm at a gathering.

1120
01:08:07,429 --> 01:08:09,399
You don't need to be there.

1121
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,500
However,

1122
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,139
you do need to be here.

1123
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,800
You're keeping an eye on me?

1124
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,210
Where are you right now?

1125
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:39,429
Sorry I'm late.

1126
01:08:40,099 --> 01:08:41,360
Hello.

1127
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:45,230
I'm honored to meet you like this.

1128
01:09:23,539 --> 01:09:24,770
Status report?

1129
01:09:25,569 --> 01:09:26,680
The worst.

1130
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,779
I can't regenerate the skin.

1131
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:30,949
Chances of survival?

1132
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,649
Less than ten percent.

1133
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:35,379
What have you done
in the past six months?

1134
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:37,319
We don't have time. Hurry up!

1135
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:40,818
I'm trying my best.

1136
01:09:40,819 --> 01:09:43,019
I'm the one who wants to save him
more than anyone else!

1137
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:49,630
What on earth is your relationship
with this person?

1138
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,970
Why is this person lying here?

1139
01:09:53,739 --> 01:09:55,300
It's been six months.

1140
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:58,439
How much longer are you going
to stay hidden and give orders?

1141
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:01,340
Show yourself.

1142
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,050
Who...

1143
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:06,550
are you?

1144
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:16,760
You can meet me...

1145
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,130
when the patient wakes up.

1146
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,659
So bring him back to life.

1147
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,529
Ha Yoon Chul.

1148
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,438
(Seven months ago)

1149
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:35,739
I'm going to go use the bathroom.

1150
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:37,750
I'll wait at the parking lot.

1151
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:53,930
What is this?

1152
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,699
Joo Dan Tae got out of jail today.

1153
01:10:57,029 --> 01:10:58,430
He's after Logan.

1154
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,869
Given that Secretary Cho
just bought a bomb,

1155
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:02,599
today is the day.

1156
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:06,079
So this will prove that Logan died?

1157
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:10,949
Leave this in the car
when you get out.

1158
01:11:12,079 --> 01:11:13,250
Be careful.

1159
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:18,890
Keep your promise that you'll give
me money to last me a lifetime.

1160
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:31,399
I'm going to go smoke a cigarette.

1161
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:33,199
I'm a bit nervous.

1162
01:11:33,569 --> 01:11:34,840
Sure. Go ahead.

1163
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,389
Get Logan's body no matter what.

1164
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:34,229
He needs to be kept alive.

1165
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:47,380
Everyone will think Logan died.

1166
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:48,840
Tell your boss...

1167
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,908
to keep his promise.

1168
01:12:50,909 --> 01:12:51,949
(Secretary Do)

1169
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,310
Logan.

1170
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,720
Save Logan, no matter what.

1171
01:13:32,090 --> 01:13:33,988
I'm not expecting him to properly
function like a human being.

1172
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:35,719
I just need him alive.

1173
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,760
That's all.

1174
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:40,300
That's why I got you out of jail.

1175
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:15,460
(The Penthouse 3)

1176
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,429
You must do better than me.

1177
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:18,698
An audition? I'll win.

1178
01:14:18,699 --> 01:14:19,999
Accept me as your dad.

1179
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,639
I can't do this anymore.
Let's break up.

1180
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,868
I'm not a moron like you.
I'm not afraid of Joo Dan Tae at all.

1181
01:14:24,869 --> 01:14:26,509
- What will be your collateral?
- The penthouse.

1182
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:29,139
You know why my mom died.
What's the truth of that day?

1183
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,179
I have something urgent to tell you.
I'll save her no matter what.

1184
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:32,948
The Dohae Construction lobbyist.
That's me.

1185
01:14:32,949 --> 01:14:35,578
I can kill Joo Dan Tae
and take off whenever I want.

1186
01:14:35,579 --> 01:14:36,919
You don't deserve to live.

1187
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,220
I'll make sure
you can't do anything anymore.
