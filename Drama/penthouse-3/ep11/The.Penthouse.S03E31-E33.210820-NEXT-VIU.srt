00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,875
(All characters, organizations, places, and events are fictional.)

2
00:00:08,219 --> 00:00:10,115
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

3
00:00:10,249 --> 00:00:14,289
We're all here to punish Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin.

4
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:17,490
First, we need to turn the two against each other completely.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,129
Nothing's better than money. Two hundred million dollars.

6
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,300
- I want 500 million dollars. - Are you kidding me?

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,594
I plan to dry up all of Joo Dan Tae's funds.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
It's a picture of Dan Tae following Oh Yoon Hee's car in his.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,940
Circulate this to every media company.

10
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,540
Move as quickly as possible so it can be breaking news.

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,474
I'll kill you, Seo Jin.

12
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:37,209
I've looked up a boat that smuggles people to China.

13
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,650
They're all gone.

14
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:41,680
The final winner is you, Cheon Seo Jin.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,320
I'll erase all your bad memories.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,385
I've been saving all my pills just for you.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,025
(Episode 11)

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,310
We're leaving soon, so stay in here.

19
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,804
In here?

20
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,244
Yes.

21
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:15,875
Darn it.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,364
He'll rot there for the rest of his life.

23
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,265
He'll pay for what he's done.

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,804
I don't know how long he'll live,

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,075
but he'll wish he was dead, for sure.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,845
What?

27
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,925
What is this?

28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,515
Let's go.

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,244
Let's get going.

30
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,485
Hey, you.

31
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,024
Hey, you.

32
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,925
Where am I?

33
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,795
What is this place?

34
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,334
Hey.

35
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:53,639
Are you awake,

36
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,075
Mr. Baek Jun Ki?

37
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,045
Baek... Baek Jun Ki?

38
00:03:58,809 --> 00:03:59,975
What...

39
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:05,015
Baek Jun Ki.

40
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:11,359
What is this place?

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,755
Why am I here?

42
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,660
What is this?

43
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,825
Hey! Unlock this!

44
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,865
Hey.

45
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,805
Seok Kyung?

46
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,344
Was it you?

47
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,914
To get revenge?

48
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,115
You really are Su Ryeon's daughter.

49
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:41,214
Is this how you repay me for raising you?

50
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,530
Is that what your mom taught you?

51
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,424
I learned it from you.

52
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,854
You know I'm your Mini-Me.

53
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:53,199
You locked me up and dumped me because I didn't share your genes.

54
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,094
What could I have learned from you?

55
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,505
How does it feel?

56
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,379
Don't tell me...

57
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:03,205
you want to treat me like a daughter now that you're locked up.

58
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,214
I don't care what people say. I'm not ashamed.

59
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,949
I raised my enemy's child...

60
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,584
to the best of my ability for 20 years.

61
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,619
I even decided to kill Ro Na...

62
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:15,685
so that you'd win the Grand Prize...

63
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,284
at the Cheong A Art Festival. That's not all.

64
00:05:18,429 --> 00:05:20,360
I had your competition eliminated one after another...

65
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,770
since you were too dumb to get into SNU on your own.

66
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,524
For you!

67
00:05:26,429 --> 00:05:27,639
Did you forget?

68
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,470
Even your birth dad couldn't have done all that.

69
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,404
What more do you want from me?

70
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,305
I never asked for that.

71
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,404
You're the one who turned me into a monster.

72
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:42,550
Because of you, I killed my twin sister...

73
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,189
and harassed and hated my mom.

74
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:47,115
I can't even go to my mom because of you.

75
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,885
What?

76
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,424
I despise you so much.

77
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,900
If you hated me so much, you should've abandoned me.

78
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,524
Why did you live like that? Why?

79
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,565
I don't have time to chit-chat with you.

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,305
Get me out of here now.

81
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,439
I have a lot of work to do in Seoul.

82
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,135
I can't do that.

83
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,544
I wasn't the one who sent you here. It was Logan.

84
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,445
He doesn't know I'm here.

85
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,989
I happened to find out, so I followed you.

86
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,185
Logan?

87
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,984
What do you mean, Logan?

88
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:26,154
That's right. I guess you don't know yet.

89
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:28,154
Logan is alive.

90
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,654
Mom's just fine too.

91
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,739
I bet they're back in the penthouse by now.

92
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:35,935
Su Ryeon came back?

93
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,610
How is that woman alive? How?

94
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,435
How could she die? She'd be too angry to die.

95
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,875
Her husband, daughter, and friend all died by your hands.

96
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:57,024
I came to say bye. I thought it was my duty as your daughter.

97
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,024
Goodbye forever.

98
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,029
Seok Kyung. Wait.

99
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,935
Don't do this. Please don't.

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,034
We were close.

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:12,765
I must've lost my mind for a minute.

102
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:16,104
I sent you there not because I hated you,

103
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,449
but because I was mad at your mom.

104
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,044
So I took it out on you, that's all.

105
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:24,318
You know how much Daddy loves you.

106
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,920
I always liked you and looked out for you...

107
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,354
more than Seok Hoon, my flesh and blood.

108
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,989
Seok Kyung. Please get me out of here.

109
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:35,024
I'm sorry for everything.

110
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:39,030
Seok Hoon, you, and I can go back to the way things were.

111
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,600
I'll make it happen.

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,305
I'll fix everything. Absolutely everything. Seok Kyung.

113
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,234
How pathetic.

114
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,745
Do you think I came here just to see that?

115
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,914
You've lost. Give up.

116
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,389
In both Korea and Japan,

117
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,784
you're a murderer and a fugitive.

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,995
It's probably more comfortable to stay in there.

119
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,825
I won't come by again.

120
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,395
Live the rest of your life as Baek Jun Ki.

121
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,205
Seok Kyung!

122
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,974
You can't just go!

123
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,579
Seok Kyung! You have to get me out of here!

124
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,245
Seok Kyung!

125
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:33,615
Seok Kyung!

126
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,054
Hey, Logan.

127
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,929
You really want me to take care of Baek Jun Ki and Jin Bun Hong...

128
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:43,454
just like you said to?

129
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,434
Baek Jun Ki betrayed me and joined Seo Jin,

130
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,505
but he's a victim too. Dan Tae killed his parents.

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
He was locked up in a mental hospital...

132
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,434
and gave up on life for 27 years.

133
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,640
So?

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,605
I may give him another chance...

135
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,515
once he loses his gambling addiction.

136
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,990
Step aside. I need to talk to Logan.

137
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,215
Logan! Please! Don't send me to my husband.

138
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:11,255
I'd rather die by your hands right here and now.

139
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,095
I don't want to be beaten to death in the house where my daughter died.

140
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:16,495
I'm begging you.

141
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,069
I won't do anything to Eun Byeol.

142
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:21,835
I'll just watch from afar. I swear.

143
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,404
Eun Byeol is my life.

144
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,674
I'll die if I can't see her.

145
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:32,074
I may have lost Michelle, but I can make Eun Byeol happy.

146
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:35,245
I can't send her to that woman Seo Jin.

147
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,784
Look.

148
00:09:39,219 --> 00:09:41,184
Get psychiatric treatment first.

149
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,554
And you can never go near Eun Byeol ever again.

150
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:49,495
I'll decide what to do with you after you complete your treatment.

151
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,429
- No. - Mr. Hong.

152
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,740
No. Please, I'm begging you.

153
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,240
Logan! No.

154
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,404
No. Logan!

155
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,209
- I feel sorry for her too. - Logan!

156
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,774
She left home to escape from her abusive husband.

157
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,044
Her daughter, Michelle,

158
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:08,245
waited for her to come home...

159
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,245
and froze to death.

160
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,015
Michelle...

161
00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:16,615
looked a lot like Eun Byeol.

162
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,024
Alex.

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,294
Yes?

164
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:25,824
I need you to do something before you go back to the US.

165
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:57,924
My goodness.

166
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,225
Did you prepare all this yourself?

167
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,540
You did a beautiful job.

168
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,540
Do you like it?

169
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,005
Of course, I love it.

170
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,774
I can't believe this.

171
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,005
Mom, shall we drink?

172
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,605
Sounds good.

173
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,054
You made a good choice.

174
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:29,824
It's so sweet.

175
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,395
This is...

176
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,534
the happiest day of my life.

but don't remember anything.

you can be happy too, Mom.

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,944
Then you won't have to do any more bad things for me,

183
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,444
and you won't feel tormented.

184
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,454
I'll make that happen.

185
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,184
By the way,

186
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:34,229
how's your headache? Has it gone?

187
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:36,229
It's gone away completely.

188
00:12:36,229 --> 00:12:37,495
That's a relief.

189
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,934
Who's that?

190
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,465
I'll go and see.

191
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,145
Mom, it's our photo.

192
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,115
Our portrait?

193
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,885
Let's see.

194
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:07,454
- My gosh. - Don't we look lovely?

195
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,895
Eun Byeol, how come you're so pretty?

196
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:16,794
You might not remember even me one day.

197
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:20,005
When that day comes, I'll look after you.

198
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:22,235
I'll be your mom.

199
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,105
I won't ever leave you.

200
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:26,375
I promise.

201
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,520
You look so happy.

202
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,215
You bet I am.

203
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,284
I was sitting with you.

204
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,589
Where should we hang this?

205
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:37,855
Well...

206
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:42,729
Secretary Do, I'm chatting with Eun Byeol.

207
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:43,729
Unless it's urgent...

208
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:45,000
Rumors are spreading...

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,030
that Cheong A Constructions will go bankrupt.

210
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,465
Financiers heard of the financial problems.

211
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,735
Stop it somehow.

212
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,444
Stall the banks and media for as long as you can.

213
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,319
Alex called about buying Cheong A Constructions.

214
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,414
What shall I do?

215
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,314
Alex?

216
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:14,359
I didn't know you were interested in buying Cheong A Constructions.

217
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:18,024
Yeah. I've been in contact with Mr. Joo for a while.

218
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,495
Didn't you know?

219
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,170
I guess there's no business talk between the two of you...

220
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,804
under the same roof.

221
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,904
My husband was in charge of the construction business.

222
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,904
It's the perfect opportunity for your father to enter Korea.

223
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,914
Cheong A Constructions is quite hot right now.

224
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:39,145
Because of Cheonsoo District.

225
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,390
That may be true, but unfortunately,

226
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,784
Mr. Joo Dan Tae has been involved with some unwanted attention.

227
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:50,595
So I don't know if I should go through with this contract anymore.

228
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,274
The Cheonsoo District project has huge merit.

229
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,444
You'll regret losing out on it.

230
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,674
Yeah?

231
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,314
Well, if it's such a sweet business,

232
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,044
then why are you trying to sell?

233
00:15:10,219 --> 00:15:13,485
Because I want to focus on culture and arts.

234
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,284
I don't have the energy to run a construction business too.

235
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,255
The Cheonsoo District project already broke ground.

236
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,755
If they can take on the existing team,

237
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,424
many people other than you would want to buy the company.

238
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,804
One.

239
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,745
I do have one condition.

240
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,719
If for any reason,

241
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:48,215
you happen to be involved in any form of crime,

242
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:51,385
you best know this contract is dead.

243
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,024
What crime?

244
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,259
Don't worry. That'll never happen.

245
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,294
Well, good, then. Name your price.

246
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,235
Three billion dollars. I don't think that's a bad price.

247
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,505
If you think so.

248
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:12,105
So the Cheong A Group presidential inauguration is coming up, right?

249
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:13,949
So why don't we announce...

250
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,875
the takeover of Cheong A Constructions...

251
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,385
on the same day?

252
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,160
Can you give me a thirty percent down payment?

253
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,755
Whatever you want.

254
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,465
Goodbye.

255
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,485
You did well.

256
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:54,284
We'll go bankrupt if we don't pay the bills this week.

257
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,314
I think we can get through it.

258
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,554
Logan helped me in many ways.

259
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,795
Things will get sorted out easier than I thought.

260
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,924
Logan Lee was actually a benefactor.

261
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,895
You still haven't located Dan Tae?

262
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:11,664
Even the police are looking for him.

263
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,375
You'd better stay in hiding, Joo Dan Tae.

264
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,914
Don't suddenly show up and ruin it for me.

265
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,315
Now, am I left with just one more problem?

266
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,414
Bae Ro Na.

267
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,724
Can you open the door? I'd like to interview you, Ms. Bae.

268
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,568
Ms. Bae, come outside. We just want to confirm something.

269
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:43,940
Is it true you bribed the pianist at the arts center audition?

270
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,040
We got a report that those who auditioned were all connected.

271
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,379
Comment on that.

272
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,579
There's also talk that you threatened Ms. Cheon.

273
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,744
What's the truth?

274
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,280
- Ms. Bae. - Ms. Bae.

275
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,520
- Ms. Bae. - Ms. Bae.

276
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,980
- Is it true? - Say something.

277
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,089
- Did you threaten... - Come outside and talk.

278
00:17:58,089 --> 00:17:59,720
- Shoot. - You people!

279
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,659
What are you all doing here?

280
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,490
Why are you yelling at a door with no one behind it?

281
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,089
Who let you in? How did you come inside?

282
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:11,569
Since when did Hera Palace's security become this useless?

283
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:14,540
This is an invasion of privacy. So what if you're reporters?

284
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,609
Can you torture someone about groundless rumors?

285
00:18:17,609 --> 00:18:19,470
Shall I report you to the police?

286
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,040
Jenny, did you call security?

287
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,835
What's taking them so long?

288
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,909
- Here they come. - Get this lot out of here!

289
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:29,849
How are we to live in peace with security this lax?

290
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:30,944
I apologize.

291
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,149
Get out of here, okay?

292
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:34,585
Get out, now!

293
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:36,190
Come on, drag them out!

294
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,730
- Come along. - Wait.

295
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,589
- Get out of here! - Just a moment!

296
00:18:39,589 --> 00:18:41,800
How did you come in? Get out!

297
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
- Let go. - Move!

298
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,795
Get out now.

299
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,264
- Okay. - Walk!

300
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,434
I swear Cheon Seo Jin called them.

301
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,504
She thinks she can do what she wants because you're not around.

302
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,139
She must've lost her mind.

303
00:18:56,139 --> 00:18:59,875
How else could she even think of going after that little girl?

304
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,545
It looks like Seo Jin went too far.

305
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,214
I'll let Ro Na take care of the reporters.

306
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,385
Mom.

307
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,684
She checked out already.

308
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,960
Where did she vanish to? Do you have any guesses?

309
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,565
I'll track the phone and credit card I gave her.

310
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,309
Why did you ask to see me?

311
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,980
I saw on the news...

312
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,474
what Joo Dan Tae did to your mom.

313
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:35,115
You must be in shock.

314
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,944
I was very worried.

315
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,815
Thank you for worrying about me.

316
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,285
Sure.

317
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,829
I asked to see you to discuss a detail...

318
00:19:45,829 --> 00:19:47,825
in the artist in residence contract.

319
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,025
I'll send you abroad to study.

320
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,494
This is a great and special benefit.

321
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,635
Italy or the US.

322
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,595
Where will you go?

323
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,065
Why are you trying to send me away?

324
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,875
What do you want to hide?

325
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,105
You sent the reporters to my house, didn't you?

326
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,075
You act like you're being generous,

327
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,514
but you want me to back off, do you?

328
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,619
You want to disparage my name...

329
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:16,119
to block me from working in this industry, is that it?

330
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,125
Misunderstanding one's intent.

331
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,129
You're just like your mom.

332
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:23,254
I have no intention of going abroad to study.

333
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:27,994
There's something I must stay here and do.

334
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,899
Something you must do?

335
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:31,865
Clear my mom's name.

336
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:36,105
- Wait. - No, you can't go inside.

337
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,014
I called them.

338
00:20:45,649 --> 00:20:47,315
Thank you for coming.

339
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,315
You seemed to be curious about me.

340
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,325
I thought it best I explain, so I asked you all to come here.

341
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,795
Where Center Director Cheon is too.

342
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,035
What do you think you're doing?

343
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:08,474
Today, I will reveal the last moments of my mom...

344
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:11,105
who was called the Admissions Murderer.

345
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:13,379
- What do you mean? - Is there a video?

346
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:16,680
- What is this about? - Show their face. Ms. Cheon?

347
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,845
Three people appear in this video.

348
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,355
My mom, Chairman Joo Dan Tae, and...

349
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,329
Center Director Cheon.

350
00:21:26,329 --> 00:21:27,825
- What? - No way.

351
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:30,030
- What? - Is that true?

352
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,530
What happened?

353
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:35,795
I reached the location after Oh Yoon Hee fell.

354
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:38,069
I didn't see anything.

355
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,404
That's a lie.

356
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,575
Center Director Cheon was there when my mom was alive.

357
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,845
And she stayed silent until now.

358
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:47,045
My mom was called an abductor...

359
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,674
and Admissions Murderer, and you said nothing.

360
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:52,615
Why was that?

361
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,250
Were you...

362
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,184
working with the murderer, Joo Dan Tae?

363
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,030
Or did you help him murder my mom?

364
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,484
What are you...

365
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,795
What are you talking about?

366
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,924
It's not true.

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,565
I'm a victim.

368
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:11,805
Joo Dan Tae did everything on his own.

369
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,805
Really? Are you sure?

370
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,210
Yoon Hee!

371
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,904
- Hey, get that! - Film it!

372
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,089
Hurry up!

373
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:28,089
- She was trying to save Eun Byeol. - Make sure you get everything.

374
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,154
- I'm getting everything. - Oh, my.

375
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,154
Oh, no!

376
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,125
There is a car standing precariously over the edge of a cliff.

377
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,865
It looks like it's about to fall off at any moment.

378
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:43,369
This is the dashboard cam footage...

379
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,669
from the Ha Eun Byeol Abduction Case which became the talk of the town.

380
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,305
Stop it!

381
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,480
Eun Byeol is in the car!

382
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,545
Eun Byeol!

383
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,145
- Get Eun Byeol out first! - Oh Yoon Hee!

384
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,315
Eun Byeol!

385
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:02,720
Get her out!

386
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,159
I'll move when you get her out, so do it now!

387
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:06,855
Hold on a second!

388
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,399
Eun Byeol, wake up!

389
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:10,954
Oh, no. Eun Byeol...

390
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:21,010
The dashcam footage from the case where Oh Yoon Hee was suspected...

391
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,734
to have abducted her daughter's friend has been revealed.

392
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,210
In the footage, after Chairman Joo Dan Tae of Cheong A Group...

393
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:28,450
is seen pushing Oh and disappearing,

394
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,780
we are able to see that Oh was still alive...

395
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,444
thus causing controversy.

396
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,290
Ms. Oh Yoon Hee has gone from an assailant to a victim,

397
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,659
and until the moments before her death,

398
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,290
she did everything she could to help her daughter's friend...

399
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,855
shocking many people.

400
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,300
As it turns out, the person who was with Oh until the end...

401
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,164
was Chairman Joo Dan Tae's wife, Center Director Cheon Seo Jin.

402
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,240
With the reveal that she was a witness in the case,

403
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,970
the fact that she had taken a passive stance regarding Oh,

404
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,805
who saved her daughter's life, has turned into suspicion.

405
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:56,540
- Eun Byeol. - After the fact that Oh Yoon Hee...

406
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,409
was falsely charged had been brought to light,

407
00:23:58,409 --> 00:24:00,379
people have begun to raise their voices for an investigation.

408
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:02,149
- Why are you watching this? - Some say...

409
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,585
The dashcam video doesn't show you pushing Ro Na's mom.

410
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:08,419
- Thank goodness. Right? - What?

411
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,754
You know that I remember everything.

412
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,690
I was just pretending to have forgotten.

413
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,855
Don't you dare say that to anyone.

414
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,500
The culprit has been revealed anyway. It's Joo Dan Tae.

415
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,224
But reporters will still harass you.

416
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,694
See? People are already calling.

417
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,809
Turn off your phone too. There's no need to create trouble.

418
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,575
The best thing to do right now is to ignore it.

419
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,645
Once the Cheong A Group Chairman Inauguration ceremony ends,

420
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,450
- I can handle everything. - How?

421
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,444
I told you! The culprit is Chairman Joo.

422
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:44,984
So don't worry about anything and just trust me.

423
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,385
Do you understand what I'm saying?

424
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:07,404
Why isn't the medicine working?

425
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,775
She needs to lose her memory before the investigation.

426
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:13,819
What happened?

427
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,159
How did Ro Na get her hands on the dashboard camera footage?

428
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,030
You said it was broken, so how did they fix it?

429
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,424
The police received a tip under the name Jin Bun Hong.

430
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,424
It seems that they recovered it through digital forensics.

431
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,424
Jin Bun Hong, that witch!

432
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,535
How much of it was filmed?

433
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,964
Was what was covered on the news everything? What about after that?

434
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,608
The moment when Oh Yoon Hee fell wasn't on it.

435
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:36,909
The footage seems to have been edited,

436
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:39,244
but the edge of the cliff can't be seen from the angle of the camera.

437
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,780
They may have chosen not to reveal that part of it.

438
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,345
If that's the case, they would've called you in already.

439
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,645
Seeing as to how nobody has called, what you saw was probably all of it.

440
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,914
You can relax.

441
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,960
Jin Bun Hong's about to ruin...

442
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,129
my plan to make Joo Dan Tae take the fall for everything.

443
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:56,754
Why did this happen now?

444
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,300
What about Jin Bun Hong?

445
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,764
She went totally off the grid after the press conference.

446
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:04,904
I gave her 500 million dollars, but she stabbed me in the back?

447
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:06,764
Do you think...

448
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,740
she gave Joo Dan Tae that footage too?

449
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,404
And received money from both sides?

450
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:16,815
She's a conniving woman. I wouldn't put it past her.

451
00:26:17,649 --> 00:26:20,045
What if Joo Dan Tae has the latter half...

452
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,014
of that footage?

453
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,454
What if he took it and ran?

454
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:27,684
He'll come back.

455
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,724
I'm sure of it.

456
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:31,865
Joo Dan Tae.

457
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,605
Cheon Seo Jin...

458
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,075
will do anything she can to hold out until the inauguration ceremony.

459
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,204
She is deluded enough to think that as the leader of Cheong A Group,

460
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,375
she will have the power to cover this whole thing up.

461
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:52,845
Since she believes that Su Ryeon and I are gone for good,

462
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,355
I'm sure she will do that.

463
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,214
Come tomorrow, Cheon Seo Jin...

464
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,025
will also find out the truth.

465
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,254
That Yoon Hee didn't just die.

466
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,025
That killing Yoon Hee...

467
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,395
was the biggest mistake in her life.

468
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,939
I've told the reporters that...

469
00:27:48,939 --> 00:27:50,939
you will hold a press conference after the inauguration ceremony.

470
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:53,109
Good job. What about the sale of Cheong A Constructions?

471
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,975
I set a meeting for 10am.

472
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:58,045
You have to sign the promissory note within the day, so it's urgent.

473
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,380
Pay back the loan as soon as the down payment comes in.

474
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,744
Once we get the three billion dollars,

475
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,345
our financial difficulties will be resolved immediately.

476
00:28:05,189 --> 00:28:06,284
What about Eun Byeol?

477
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,859
She'll be going to the ceremony straight from the practice room.

478
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,685
Make sure she has bodyguards with her.

479
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:13,894
Joo Dan Tae might show up.

480
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,865
We need to finish the deal before the ceremony.

481
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,939
Make sure there are no issues.

482
00:28:19,939 --> 00:28:21,095
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,275
I just need to get through today. If I do,

484
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:33,515
everything will go back into place perfectly.

485
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:47,295
How annoying. Give me the keys.

486
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,444
There's a hole in the tire!

487
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,745
What's going on?

488
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:18,885
Dad?

489
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,340
Alex? I'm about to leave right now.

490
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,574
Did you check the contract?

491
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,544
I am so disappointed in you.

492
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:43,615
Unfortunately, I'm going to have to go and cancel this contract.

493
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,444
What are you talking about?

494
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,419
What do you mean you're going to cancel the contract?

495
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:51,159
I specifically said in my terms...

496
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:54,500
that the owner should not have any criminal background.

497
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,159
But it just so happens to be...

498
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,465
that the person who was keeping my brother, Logan, captive...

499
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:01,734
happened to be you.

500
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,438
Who on earth would say such nonsense?

501
00:30:04,439 --> 00:30:06,979
It's not true. It's nothing but a baseless rumor!

502
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:08,680
- It was all Shim Su Ryeon's... - Yes, well...

503
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,110
We'll see if it's a rumor or not pretty darn soon,

504
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,775
but until then, this contract is on hold.

505
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,345
Goodbye.

506
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,659
Got you.

507
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:21,814
Alex?

508
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,724
Alex?

509
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,895
What on earth did he hear?

510
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,595
No, this can't happen.

511
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,324
Without that money,

512
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:34,264
I can't become the chairman.

513
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,275
Why are you in such a rush?

514
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:43,345
Move. I don't have time for this.

515
00:30:45,409 --> 00:30:47,845
Were you on your way to the inauguration ceremony?

516
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,150
The ceremony got canceled.

517
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,914
You can't go.

518
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:54,984
Nonsense. Why would it be canceled?

519
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:57,324
You want to know why? I'll tell you.

520
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,555
Oh Yoon Hee. You killed her, didn't you?

521
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,925
Why?

522
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,425
Why did you kill an innocent woman?

523
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,995
You're being ridiculous!

524
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:09,539
Where do you think you're going?

525
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,865
Let go of me!

527
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,520
- Why isn't she here yet? - What's going on?

528
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,120
- When is she coming? - What do we do?

00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,065
It must be quite familiar to you.

539
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:15,565
You set up this place yourself to torture Logan.

540
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,565
Here, you gave the order...

541
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,005
to keep him barely alive.

542
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:24,845
Save Logan,

543
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,674
no matter what.

544
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,645
I'm not expecting him to properly function like a human being.

545
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,284
I just need him alive.

546
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:37,885
Let me go. Now!

547
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,595
This is impressive.

548
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,600
But your luck ends here.

549
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,364
You'll soon get caught and torn into pieces.

550
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,465
You shouldn't underestimate James's family.

551
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:53,575
Just worry about yourself.

552
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,374
How far were you willing to go?

553
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,949
In addition to killing Yoon Hee,

554
00:32:58,949 --> 00:33:01,315
you even tried to get rid of me and Logan?

555
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,389
Did you think, if you got rid of everyone,

556
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:05,949
everything would be yours?

557
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:07,354
I didn't do it.

558
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:09,319
Joo Dan Tae is the one who killed Oh Yoon Hee.

559
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,955
He is also the one who blew up Logan's car.

560
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,255
You're insane.

561
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,494
Let me go!

562
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,164
Eun Byeol!

563
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,304
Oh Yoon Hee.

564
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,145
Our ill-fated relationship ends here.

565
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,374
Goodbye.

566
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:57,965
It's not true.

567
00:33:59,139 --> 00:34:02,505
No, it's not true. That footage is fake.

568
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,145
Look me in the eyes. That demon is you.

569
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,120
Yoon Hee was trying to save your daughter,

570
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,244
and you pushed her off the cliff.

571
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:12,345
Why did you do that?

572
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,560
What did she do so wrong?

573
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,924
I don't know! It has nothing to do with me!

574
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,965
I knew you'd deny it.

575
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,635
It doesn't matter.

576
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,335
In the end,

577
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,104
your daughter will pay for everything you've done.

578
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,135
What? Not my daughter.

579
00:34:36,709 --> 00:34:38,104
Where is Eun Byeol now?

580
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:40,914
Leave her alone, or I'll kill you!

581
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,374
Let me go!

582
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,715
If your daughter's life is so precious to you,

583
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,054
how could you do that to Yoon Hee?

584
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,424
You'll lose everything.

585
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,724
From money, which you value more than anything,

586
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:58,629
to Cheong A Group, Cheong A Foundation,

587
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,364
and Cheong A Arts Center... All of it.

588
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,205
On top of that,

589
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,075
the person you love more than anyone else,

590
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,874
your daughter, Ha Eun Byeol.

591
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,015
No!

592
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:16,784
I'll kill you, Shim Su Ryeon!

593
00:35:17,189 --> 00:35:19,620
Bring my daughter to me. She didn't do anything wrong!

594
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,585
Let me go! Now!

595
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,290
Let me go!

596
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,354
Eun Byeol... Bring her to me!

597
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,965
One more thing.

598
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,709
I'll take away your voice...

599
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:38,765
so you can stop lying so shamelessly.

600
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,575
No. Don't do that.

601
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:43,040
Please. Don't.

602
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,645
Su Ryeon, please.

603
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,775
Don't do that. Please.

604
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,289
No! Don't!

605
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:53,114
No! Please...

606
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,185
What?

607
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,555
Is it painful?

608
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,565
Is the pain too much to bear?

609
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,165
Didn't you know that...

610
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,634
when you made others suffer?

611
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,864
Feel the pain thoroughly.

612
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,974
Realize what you've done to others.

613
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,604
Stop that.

614
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,509
Min Hyuk, isn't this place wonderful?

615
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:27,144
It's paradise.

616
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,450
Do you want to go shopping?

617
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,545
Or should we get something to eat?

618
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:35,389
No. Let's just have something delivered to our hotel room.

619
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:38,090
It seems like suite guests can order special meals.

620
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,325
When are we going home?

621
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:40,899
We're not going to live here forever, are we?

622
00:37:40,899 --> 00:37:42,595
We are leaving.

623
00:37:42,899 --> 00:37:44,465
For the next country.

624
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,565
I've already booked everything.

625
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,070
In Hawaii, we'll relax in a villa with a private pool.

626
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:52,110
In Switzerland, we'll go skiing.

627
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,610
In Paris, we'll see fashion shows.

628
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,035
In Italy...

629
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:59,309
Son, should I buy you an opera house?

630
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:01,679
Mom, aren't you even worried about Dad?

631
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,345
I feel so bad being here without him.

632
00:38:04,419 --> 00:38:06,759
Why would I worry about him?

633
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:10,055
I know he can survive anywhere in the world.

634
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,825
You're right.

635
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,724
Anyway, let's order a little food first.

636
00:38:15,029 --> 00:38:16,724
Excuse me.

637
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:20,840
- What? - What?

638
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,610
Are you Ms. Ko Sang A, CEO of Bon-bi Holdings?

639
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,535
- What? - What is he saying?

640
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,539
- I don't know. - You're under arrest...

641
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:29,835
for embezzling Cheong A Group's funds.

642
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,974
What?

643
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:33,175
I embezzled their funds? I didn't!

644
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,915
Let's take her away.

645
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,490
- Mom. - Son!

646
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,019
Min Hyuk!

647
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,884
Let go of me!

648
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,595
My goodness.

649
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,399
I must have been out of my mind.

650
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:52,970
I shouldn't have stolen Chairman Joo's money.

651
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,795
Before I could even touch it...

652
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,095
Gosh, I'm starving.

653
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,305
This is driving me crazy.

654
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,435
(Detective)

655
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,845
Oh, dear.

656
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:15,055
How did the mighty Lee Kyu Jin end up like this?

657
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,754
(Ant Real Estate)

658
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,134
(Ant Real Estate)

659
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,840
I'm in a bit of a situation.

660
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,580
I need to sell the 55th floor of Hera Palace...

661
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,279
in Samseong-dong immediately.

662
00:39:35,279 --> 00:39:39,309
Hera Palace is in Samseong-dong. Why did you come to Namyangju?

663
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,620
I had no choice.

664
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,320
I know all realtors are connected in a network.

665
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,720
At such a cheap price, it'll be sold in no time.

666
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,460
And I want the down payment in cash.

667
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,624
Please.

668
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:55,759
- Oh, my. - Lee Kyu Jin.

669
00:39:55,759 --> 00:39:58,399
You're under arrest for embezzling Cheong A Group's funds.

670
00:39:58,399 --> 00:39:59,830
Move! Go away!

671
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,935
Cuff him.

672
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,570
You have the right to remain silent...

673
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,404
- and the right to an attorney... - I'm an attorney myself!

674
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:09,774
My salary used to be paid by taxpayers too!

675
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,315
Mr. Baek Jun Ki. It's time for your medicine.

676
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:22,490
Who says I'm Baek Jun Ki?

677
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,185
I'm Joo Dan Tae!

678
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,224
After everything I did...

679
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,254
to abandon that name, to break free from it...

680
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,994
How...

681
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,465
How did you...

682
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,705
Where's my money?

683
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,104
Give me my money,

684
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,004
and I'll spare your life.

685
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:49,415
You're not even worth killing.

686
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:52,144
Okay. I'll give it to you.

687
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,514
I'll give you the money, the house, everything.

688
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,555
Don't do this, Jun Ki.

689
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:58,758
This isn't you.

690
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,398
You're a good kid.

691
00:41:00,399 --> 00:41:03,764
I don't need to be good. Just give me my money!

692
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,695
Hey!

693
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:09,835
Hey!

694
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:16,509
I took in a worthless bum,

695
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:19,110
fed and clothed him, and made a decent person out of him,

696
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,874
and you want money?

697
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,984
This is why you shouldn't be kind to orphan rats.

698
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,490
You ingrate.

699
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,055
I don't owe you anything.

700
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:35,055
You sucked the life out of me.

701
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,565
How could you steal from me...

702
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,364
of all people?

703
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,299
You built this nice house...

704
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,595
and want to live in luxury by yourself?

705
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,065
Give me my money now!

706
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,419
You can just save up again.

707
00:41:54,419 --> 00:41:56,774
That chick Na Ae Gyo is good at begging.

708
00:41:57,149 --> 00:42:00,384
You two were an amazing pair.

709
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,785
You'll be millionaires in no time.

710
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,984
Please, I'm begging you.

711
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,500
I didn't eat or buy anything I wanted...

712
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,595
and saved every cent I made from begging...

713
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:14,965
since I was ten years old and gave it all to you.

714
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:16,864
You said you'd buy me...

715
00:42:16,899 --> 00:42:19,665
a house in the middle of Seoul.

716
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,004
You said you'd let me...

717
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,205
build a house on the land where my mom died!

718
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:28,675
What is this annoying loser babbling about?

719
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:31,845
Where's my money?

720
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,014
Where is poor Ae Gyo's money?

721
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,815
Shut it, jerk.

722
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,254
Hey.

723
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,894
Wash your sneakers, will you?

724
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:46,799
Seeing these dirty sneakers kills my appetite.

725
00:42:46,799 --> 00:42:48,535
How many times must I tell you that?

726
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:53,435
Don't spread your disease and get lost, you jerk.

Open the safe now!

You freak.

730
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,754
Open the safe!

731
00:43:20,169 --> 00:43:21,595
You scumbag.

732
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:32,305
I can't go down like this.

733
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:35,144
I did nothing wrong.

734
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,388
All I did was work hard.

735
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:40,918
I built Hera Palace by working my fingers to the bone.

736
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:43,219
I won't let jerks like Su Ryeon...

737
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,654
and Logan taint it.

738
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:47,654
I need to get out of here.

739
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,754
I must get out of here somehow.

740
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:02,935
Hurry! Please send help!

741
00:44:04,379 --> 00:44:06,974
- Stop it! - Bring it.

742
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,945
Stop it!

743
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:38,575
Let go of me.

744
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,650
You people are dead.

745
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,114
Let go of me!

746
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,414
I want to go back!

747
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,154
Let go.

748
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,868
She's fine?

749
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:05,805
Yes. Look.

750
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:09,839
Her MRI and brainwave scans...

751
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,575
all came back normal.

752
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:14,775
How about early-stage dementia or anything unusual?

753
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,914
No, nothing.

754
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,890
You're worried for nothing.

755
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:21,285
Are you sure she took that drug?

756
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,025
I didn't take the drug.

757
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,295
I didn't take the drug that erases memories.

758
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,624
So don't worry.

759
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,838
Then why did you take them from Bun Hong?

760
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:36,769
It must have been at least 100 pills.

761
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:38,664
I was going to take them, but I threw them out.

762
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,204
Did you bug me all day long just to check that?

763
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,104
Are you done? May I go now?

764
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:47,414
It's Mom's inauguration. I'm late.

765
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:51,450
You need to live with me now. You can't live with Mom.

766
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:53,384
No. Why should I?

767
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,890
Mom needs me.

768
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:56,884
How much worse do you want to get?

769
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,654
If you didn't take that drug,

770
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,454
it means you remember.

771
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:04,495
You know what your mom did to Ro Na's mom on the cliff!

772
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,694
You know everything. So why won't you say anything?

773
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:10,835
Don't you feel bad for Ro Na?

774
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,150
Exactly. So forget this terrible daughter.

775
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,674
I'm a monster who can't be reformed!

776
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,745
Eun Byeol.

777
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:23,874
Go to Ro Na.

778
00:46:24,019 --> 00:46:25,950
Don't worry about Mom and me.

779
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,285
Go be a dad to Ro Na.

780
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,354
She has...

781
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,225
no one else but you now.

782
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,964
You knew too?

783
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:45,065
When Ro Na's mom...

784
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:47,335
risked her life to save me.

785
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:49,505
That's when I realized.

786
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,475
That was the only reasonable explanation.

787
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,575
Because I was your daughter.

788
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,184
She liked you a lot.

789
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,954
So go. Just go!

790
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,025
I'm sorry to Ro Na's mom,

791
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,624
but I can't leave Mom.

792
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,795
I have to protect her.

793
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,864
If I leave her too,

794
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:20,775
I'd feel so sorry for Mom.

795
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,975
She did it for me.

796
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,204
So how can I hate her?

797
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:30,714
I'm going to live with Mom, just the two of us.

798
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,725
So don't come to me ever again.

799
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,624
Eun Byeol.

800
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,735
(Cheong A Medical Center)

801
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,565
Eun Byeol.

802
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:30,634
Eun Byeol.

803
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,045
I'm supposed to meet her at the inauguration.

804
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,265
What's wrong with her?

805
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:27,864
Hey...

806
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:30,864
Eun Byeol.

807
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,604
Eun Byeol!

808
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:36,278
Eun Byeol. Where are you?

809
00:49:36,279 --> 00:49:37,575
Eun Byeol!

810
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,444
Eun Byeol...

811
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:48,285
Logan?

812
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,624
How are you...

813
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,095
I wondered...

814
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:59,725
who had taken me just to torment me.

815
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:03,434
You manipulated Jun Ki into betraying me...

816
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,210
and got Ha Yoon Chul out to prolong my life?

817
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,634
I never even imagined it would've been you.

818
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:11,805
And then you dumped all the blame on Su Ryeon?

819
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,220
How could you do that?

820
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,075
That's not true. You've been lied to.

821
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,684
Su Ryeon did all of this.

822
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,460
That woman...

823
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,255
tried to kill you to avenge her daughter's death.

824
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,825
It wasn't me.

825
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,055
Do you still not get it?

826
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,765
You're dumber than I thought.

827
00:50:34,299 --> 00:50:36,265
I'm disappointed.

828
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:38,204
What's going on?

829
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,505
Did you two conspire together and pretend to be dead?

830
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,775
Was I,

831
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,874
Cheon Seo Jin, fooled?

832
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:51,545
I saw you.

833
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:54,585
You injected poison into my arm.

834
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,085
Fortunately, Ha Yoon Chul saved me.

835
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,424
Ha Yoon Chul?

836
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,325
Cheon Seo Jin.

837
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,624
You...

838
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,670
You were the person behind the altered voice.

839
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,464
I realized that a little too late.

840
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,869
If I'd known, even if it meant rotting in prison,

841
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,864
I wouldn't have accepted your help.

842
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,735
I didn't get to kill you before Yoon Hee died.

843
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,204
That's my only regret. Do you know that?

844
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,614
The purchase of Cheong A Constructions is off the table.

845
00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:28,684
I don't have to explain, do I?

846
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,285
I don't do business with criminals.

847
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,894
Oh, and you provided the cause for the deal to fall through.

848
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,025
Be prepared to pay the penalty.

849
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:41,964
No.

850
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,740
I can't go down like this.

851
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,434
You're already ruined.

852
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,180
You failed to repay...

853
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,904
the promissory notes by today.

854
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,404
You planned this from the start, didn't you?

855
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:54,005
To bring me down.

856
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,450
You brought in Jin Bun Hong and Baek Jun Ki...

857
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,585
to set all this up, didn't you?

858
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,414
I don't want to ruin the likes of you.

859
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,654
Because I will kill you.

860
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,664
The board of directors fired you today.

861
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,464
Don't be too upset.

862
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:20,904
The company's not even worth a piece of paper now.

863
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,680
I was fired?

864
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,404
I will take over Cheong A Arts Center.

865
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,420
The 20 percent of shares that Yoon Hee had...

866
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,944
were in my company's name.

867
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,450
The owner's back.

868
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,089
It's only right you return it to me.

869
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:35,184
Shut your mouth.

870
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,730
I'm the chairwoman of Cheong A Group!

871
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:41,454
The arts center and foundation are all mine!

872
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,924
I waited for this day for so long!

873
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,730
I will never fall.

874
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,995
Secretary Do. Where is he?

875
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,640
Summon the directors now!

876
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,835
I'll have the inauguration ceremony!

877
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,904
Secretary Do!

878
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:03,515
You finally show yourself, Ms. Cheon Seo Jin.

879
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,315
Who are you people?

880
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,255
You're Joo Dan Tae's wife, aren't you?

881
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:13,255
I'm here for the money he borrowed from us.

882
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,900
He looked so desperate,

883
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,765
so I lent him 50 million dollars.

884
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:23,434
He shouldn't vanish without repaying his debt.

885
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,864
Why should I give you the money he borrowed?

886
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:28,740
I have nothing to do with him.

887
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,335
If his wife has nothing to do with him,

888
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,674
then who does have something to do with him?

889
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:36,345
Give me that.

890
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:40,585
Look at this.

891
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,354
(Bond of Debt)

892
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,954
(Debtor: Joo Dan Tae, Guarantor: Cheon Seo Jin)

893
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,654
Don't you see you're the guarantor?

894
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,525
That's your seal.

895
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,025
I don't know about this.

896
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,894
I never affixed it on this.

897
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,369
You didn't lend the money to me, so get lost!

898
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:00,104
Move. Get out of my way!

899
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,674
Secretary Do!

900
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,015
Cheon Seo Jin. We're the police.

901
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,184
We must question you about Joo Dan Tae who's in hiding.

902
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:14,589
Come with us.

903
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,990
I don't even know where he is.

904
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:18,954
He's behind all this!

905
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,785
Why are you all doing this to me?

906
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,099
I must get my daughter. I have no time to waste.

907
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,369
We must force you to come with us, then. Take her.

908
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:27,099
What are you doing? Let go of me!

909
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,795
I said let go of me!

910
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,835
They're the worst of the worst among the loan sharks.

911
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:34,035
They never give up.

912
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,575
With Joo Dan Tae missing,

913
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,750
Cheon Seo Jin will have to repay his debt for the rest of her life.

914
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,880
- The interest will snowball. - I'll kill you all!

915
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,444
It's a depressing amount.

916
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:48,654
She won't even have the freedom to choose death.

917
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,785
If she dies,

918
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:55,025
Eun Byeol will end up inheriting the debt.

919
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:59,130
Whether she spends the rest of her life...

920
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,565
as a fugitive or a debtor,

921
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:03,164
she'll live in extreme poverty.

922
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,934
Until the moment she dies.

923
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:08,835
Don't get Eun Byeol involved.

924
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:12,104
I'll persuade her somehow to get her to leave.

925
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,644
Our plans don't involve the kids.

926
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,949
I made them promise.

927
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,114
We can trust them.

928
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:23,184
Cheon Seo Jin had so much money she could never spend it all.

929
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,854
Now she has a debt so big...

930
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:28,325
she can never pay it off.

931
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,599
I can't let her spend the rest of her life...

932
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:32,924
sitting in a cell in comfort.

933
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,035
Joo Dan Tae and Cheon Seo Jin...

934
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:40,005
must experience what living in torment is like.

935
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:49,724
The deeds for the penthouse and Cheonsoo District lot 27.

936
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,230
Dan Tae failed to repay the debt on time,

937
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:54,864
so legally, they belong to you now, Ms. Shim.

938
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:56,665
Thank you, ma'am.

939
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,835
I didn't do anything.

940
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,934
They got what they had coming.

941
00:56:01,370 --> 00:56:02,805
Thank you so much.

942
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:05,875
I don't know how I can ever repay you.

943
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:10,244
You saved my life, Ms. Jincheon.

944
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,485
How can I not do this much for you?

945
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:18,185
Oh, I have to go. I stayed too long.

946
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,329
Will you let me treat you to a meal one day?

947
00:56:22,329 --> 00:56:25,994
If you have the time to do that, go and check in on your husband.

948
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:28,765
I did hire him a good lawyer,

949
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,835
but we'll have to see how things go.

950
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:37,280
Why is this so special...

951
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,074
that everyone's fighting to keep this?

952
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,985
Don't you feel dizzy if you're up this high?

953
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:56,284
People must live closer to the ground.

954
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:58,095
So that there's no more fighting,

955
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:02,965
we must end this place too.

956
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,564

957
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,314

958
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,265

Get out the way.

961
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:58,685
Nice.

962
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:01,330
- Not bad. - That was nothing.

963
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:03,229
- Was that nice? - Yes.

964
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,129
- You must have it in you. - Try again.

965
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:07,264
Get out of the way.

967
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:20,280
What are my charges?

968
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,775
Why did you bring me here?

969
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,645
You're the fugitive Joo Dan Tae's accomplice.

970
00:58:25,819 --> 00:58:27,884
That's why you're here.

971
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:29,145
Accomplice?

972
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,120
He and I are total strangers.

973
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,984
We're divorced.

974
00:58:34,129 --> 00:58:36,090
We didn't tell because we were sworn to secrecy,

975
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:37,860
but the papers were signed.

976
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,095
You didn't know?

977
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:42,595
The court didn't approve your divorce.

978
00:58:42,729 --> 00:58:46,294
Someone said you were faking a divorce to avoid repaying debts.

979
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,509
Here.

(Applicant and witness Shim Su Ryeon)

984
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,944
Shim Su Ryeon. To the very end...

985
00:58:58,419 --> 00:59:00,789
Your husband embezzled 500 million from the company...

986
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:03,585
and borrowed from loan sharks. You knew about that, didn't you?

987
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,055
He owes over one billion dollars.

988
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,185
There's no way he spent all that on his own.

989
00:59:10,659 --> 00:59:12,294
Where did you hide it?

990
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,095
You two.

991
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:17,465
Aren't you perfect business partners before being a married couple?

992
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:20,234
Joo Dan Tae, that lunatic.

993
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:24,974
Sir.

994
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:28,979
Will you please let me see Eun Byeol?

995
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:31,879
That mad woman Shim Su Ryeon kidnapped her.

996
00:59:31,879 --> 00:59:33,645
Don't change the subject.

997
00:59:34,289 --> 00:59:35,914
Tell me where Joo Dan Tae is.

998
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:39,514
There's no way you two are getting out of this.

999
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,758
I really don't know!

1000
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:44,595
I never saw or touched the money.

1001
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:47,645
Ms. Cheon.

1002
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:51,314
You can't even run away.

1003
00:59:51,619 --> 00:59:53,284
You're banned from leaving the country.

1004
00:59:54,489 --> 00:59:57,184
Did you know that Cheong A Constructions...

1005
00:59:57,689 --> 00:59:58,985
filed for bankruptcy?

1006
00:59:59,089 --> 01:00:00,255
What?

1007
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:02,955
Bankruptcy?

1008
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,695
How could you do that to Yoon Hee?

1009
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:13,635
You'll lose everything.

1010
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:17,075
From money, which you value more than anything,

1011
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,009
to Cheong A Group, Cheong A Foundation,

1012
01:00:19,009 --> 01:00:20,579
and Cheong A Arts Center... All of it.

1013
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,949
Everyone that lent Joo Dan Tae money has filed a lawsuit against you.

1014
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:26,414
There are over ten people including Haeyeon Group's Chairman Song.

1015
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,185
Ms. Cheon. Are you listening to me?

1016
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,784
Stop putting on an act and cooperate with the investigation.

1017
01:00:31,989 --> 01:00:33,455
Listen here, Ms. Cheon.

1018
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:35,154

1019
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,094
Ms. Cheon!

1020
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,395
Listen here, Ms. Cheon.

1021
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,265
Ms. Cheon!

1022
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,205
Ms. Cheon!

1023
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:50,780
It seems like a temporary state of shock.

1024
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,904
Her respiration is very unstable too.

1025
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,745
She should try to get some rest.

1026
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,515
Getting questioned in this state is impossible.

1027
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,515
Let's call it a day.

1028
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:05,185
Once she gets better, she will cooperate the best she can.

1029
01:01:05,189 --> 01:01:06,885
She can't leave the country anyway.

1030
01:01:07,129 --> 01:01:08,524
When you receive a call from us,

1031
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,670
you have to come right away.

1032
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:11,964

You're in the hospital.

1037
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:29,815
You collapsed during your questioning.

1038
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:31,685
Don't you remember?

1039
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,524
What about Eun Byeol? Where's Eun Byeol?

1040
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:51,705
Mom.

1041
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,534
Eun Byeol!

1042
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:57,410
My dear daughter. Where did you go?

1043
01:01:57,410 --> 01:01:59,050
Do you know how worried I was?

1044
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,350
Is everything okay? Did you get hurt?

1045
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,474
No. I'm fine.

1046
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,745
What about you? How did you end up at the hospital?

1047
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,059
Are you sick?

1048
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,984
No. I must've been anemic.

1049
01:02:12,389 --> 01:02:14,695
Secretary Do made a fuss for no reason.

1050
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,424
You don't have to worry.

1051
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:18,799
Let's go home.

1052
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,224
The thing is...

1053
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,664
I don't think you can go home for the time being?

1054
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,464
What do you mean? Why?

1055
01:02:25,569 --> 01:02:28,734
Loan sharks came charging into our house and caused a scene.

1056
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,075
It was so scary, and I couldn't pack anything.

1057
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:35,015
We can't go home right now.

1058
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,315
I got a place for you to stay for the time being.

1059
01:03:36,509 --> 01:03:40,005
I'll take care of Eun Byeol and bring her someplace safe.

1060
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:43,984
I thought you might get caught easily if you were together.

1061
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:47,185
How can I live in a place like this?

1062
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:49,455
You want me to sleep in this smelly, tiny room...

1063
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,024
on those dirty blankets?

1064
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:54,195
Get me a room at a hotel.

1065
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:56,294
Hotels are easy to track, so it's dangerous.

1066
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,695
This place is on the outskirts of the city, so it'll be safer.

1067
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:01,265
They're tenacious people, so keep your cell phone off too.

1068
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,635
Eun Byeol can never live in a place like this.

1069
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:06,664
Make sure you take care of her.

1070
01:04:07,139 --> 01:04:10,234
Don't worry about Eun Byeol and bear with it for the time being.

1071
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,249
My accounts have all been frozen as well,

1072
01:04:15,249 --> 01:04:16,914
so I couldn't get any money.

1073
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,385
I'm sorry. This is all I could get.

1074
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:23,985
Thanks.

1075
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:27,154

1077
01:05:09,699 --> 01:05:10,804
Oh Yoon Hee!

1078
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:14,434
Oh Yoon Hee! Please don't do this!

1079
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,304
Go away!

1080
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:21,215
Don't do this. Oh Yoon Hee!

1081
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:23,074
Go away, please.

1082
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:27,314
I really had no idea.

1083
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:29,659
My husband is the CEO of Cheong A Industries,

1084
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:31,490
and I'm just a housewife.

1085
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:33,024
What could I possibly know?

1086
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:36,454
I just trusted my husband who told me to take a trip,

1087
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:40,024
and I went on vacation with my son.

1088
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,199
How could a housewife embezzle funds?

1089
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:45,235
Five hundred million dollars at that?

1090
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,235
How does this make sense?

1091
01:05:47,939 --> 01:05:49,380
Lee Kyu Jin, that jerk,

1092
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,375
committed the crime alone, unbeknownst to me!

1093
01:05:52,979 --> 01:05:54,215
Ko Sang A!

1094
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:56,674
Ko Sang A!

1095
01:05:57,219 --> 01:06:00,914
Hey. How could you do this to me?

1096
01:06:01,059 --> 01:06:02,920
I heard people went crazy in front of money,

1097
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,459
but how could you betray me and run away?

1098
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:07,530
You even took the only son of the Lee Clan with you!

1099
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,024
This woman knew about everything!

1100
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,235
Even still, you and I really loved each other.

1101
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,569
I wanted to buy you a nice house!

1102
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:21,875
Why did you do it? Why did you do it, woman?

1103
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,645
Did you think I would go with you willingly?

1104
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,050
I got married into the Lee family,

1105
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,520
and for 20 years, I lived like a slave for your family.

1106
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,115
But you want me to go abroad and do it some more?

1107
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,654
Five hundred million dollars?

1108
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,054
I wouldn't even do that for five billion dollars!

1109
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,890
Even if it's a paradise nicer than Hawaii,

1110
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,125
I refuse to live with your family!

1111
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:44,030
You go ahead and live with your mom and your sisters!

1112
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,395
I'm going to live with my son.

1113
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,135
Hey, Lee Min Hyuk. Be straight with me.

1114
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:54,034
If your mom and I get a divorce, who do you want to live with?

1115
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,304
It's me, right?

1116
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,005
What are you talking about?

1117
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:00,250
It's me, right?

1118
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,774
Please stop this already.

1119
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,645
I'm so embarrassed.

1120
01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:08,219
I don't want to live with either of you.

1121
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:09,654
I'm going to live alone.

1122
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,784
Darn it.

1123
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:21,965
What are you doing?

1124
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,704
I should try to sell these to make some money.

1125
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,804
Figure out a way to send Eun Byeol abroad.

1126
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:30,280
She can't move around and stay with other people forever.

1127
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,010
Eun Byeol will refuse to go.

1128
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:34,774
She keeps demanding that she wants to be with you...

1129
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:37,520
and refuses to eat or sleep. All she does is cry.

1130
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,215
Don't bring her here.

1131
01:07:39,819 --> 01:07:41,115
She can't come here.

1132
01:07:42,189 --> 01:07:45,324
I'm willing to sell my heart if it means I can get her flight.

1133
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:48,395
I need to send her abroad at all costs.

1134
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,924
She just needs to do...

1135
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:56,395
one thing before she goes.

1136
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,135
That's all.

1137
01:08:01,939 --> 01:08:04,475
My final wish is to see Eun Byeol succeed.

1138
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:07,845
If we wait, Eun Byeol will be able to get back Cheong A Foundation...

1139
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:10,115
left for us by my father.

1140
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:29,635
Where should I take you?

1141
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,704
Where do you want to go?

1142
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,015
What?

1143
01:08:46,089 --> 01:08:47,654
Where was I planning to go?

1144
01:08:49,059 --> 01:08:50,485
Ma'am.

1145
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:00,664
Hera Palace.

1146
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:04,064
Take me to Hera Palace in Samseong-dong.

1147
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:27,024
Mom.

1148
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:32,625
Seok Kyung...

1149
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,495
Where is she right now?

1150
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,495
Well...

1151
01:09:38,209 --> 01:09:40,564
I did it all by myself.

1152
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:44,550
I don't have a family.

1153
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,849
My mom is dead,

1154
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,245
and it's been a while since I cut ties with my brother.

1155
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:50,274
So just send me to prison.

1156
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,645
I did it all by myself, I swear.

1157
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,885
Seok Kyung.

1158
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:11,965
What was it?

1159
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,414
(Calling)

1160
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:24,745
Hello?

1161
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,345
Are you there?

1162
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:28,959
Hello?

1163
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,660
(Seized)

1164
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:32,755
Eun Byeol.

1165
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,924
Eun Byeol, are you there?

1166
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,125
Eun Byeol!

1167
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:43,395
Eun Byeol! Can you hear me?

1168
01:10:47,609 --> 01:10:49,174
Where did she go?

1169
01:10:52,109 --> 01:10:53,204
Eun Byeol!

1170
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,515
Eun Byeol!

1171
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,544
I don't have time for this.

1172
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:00,615
- Eun Byeol! - What?

1173
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:03,885
Is it okay for her to be here?

1174
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,890
The loan sharks are everywhere.

1175
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:06,985
Eun Byeol!

1176
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:11,824
Eun Byeol!

1177
01:11:13,729 --> 01:11:14,895
Eun Byeol!

1178
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,095
Eun Byeol!

1179
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:21,804
Eun Byeol!

1180
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:24,745
Eun Byeol!

1181
01:11:25,979 --> 01:11:27,245
Eun Byeol!

1182
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,145
Oh, my goodness.

1183
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,314
- Eun Byeol! - Oh, dear.

1184
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:34,044
Eun Byeol!

1185
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:36,284
Ms. Cheon!

1186
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,125
Where is she? Eun Byeol!

1187
01:11:48,839 --> 01:11:50,895
Dr. Ha, it's me.

1188
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,069
Seo Jin showed up at Hera Palace.

1189
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:56,204
But there's something off about her.

1190
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,774
Something doesn't feel right. You should come over right now.

1191
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,215
Eun Byeol.

1192
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:05,345
Where is she?

1193
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:07,885
Eun Byeol.

1194
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:10,414
Eun Byeol.

1195
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,694
Eun Byeol.

1196
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,524
There you are.

1197
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,694
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1198
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:23,034
Ms. Cheon.

1199
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,335
We have no time to lose.

1200
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,709
It's my inauguration ceremony today.

1201
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:27,910
Our outfits are ready.

1202
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,635
Come. We'll be late.

1203
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:32,010
Ms. Cheon, let go of me.

1204
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:33,605
I'm not Eun Byeol.

1205
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:35,550
Why won't you listen to me?

1206
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:36,914
Do as I say!

1207
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:39,284
You're my daughter. You must attend the ceremony.

1208
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:42,160
Everything I have will be yours. Come now.

1209
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,184
Come! Hurry!

1210
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:45,859
Listen to me!

1211
01:12:45,859 --> 01:12:47,359
- Ms. Cheon, why are you... - Come!

1212
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,859
- Come, Eun Byeol. - I'm not Eun Byeol.

1213
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:51,994
Hurry. Come.

1214
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,740
Stop it, Seo Jin.

1215
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:57,369
Why are you here?

1216
01:12:57,369 --> 01:12:59,010
Are you here to take Eun Byeol away from me?

1217
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,875
You can't! I'll never let that happen!

1218
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:05,180
What are you doing? She's not your daughter!

1219
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:08,645
Yes, she is! You can't take her away!

1220
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,075
Move!

1221
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,649
Eun Byeol, come to your mom.

1222
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:14,119
Ro Na, run, now!

1223
01:13:14,119 --> 01:13:15,819
No! Eun Byeol!

1224
01:13:15,819 --> 01:13:17,585
- Get it together, Seo Jin! - Eun Byeol!

1225
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,825
Ro Na, are you okay?

1226
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:24,025
Are you out of your mind? Where are you taking her?

1227
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,295
She's my daughter!

1228
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,825
Ro Na!

1229
01:13:31,069 --> 01:13:33,365
Mr. Ha, are you okay?

1230
01:13:34,339 --> 01:13:36,105
Eun Byeol!

1231
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,079
We don't have time for this. Come with me now.

1232
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,649
Why are you so stubborn?

1233
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:43,180
- Eun Byeol! - Ms. Cheon.

1234
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,645
Come with me.

1235
01:13:46,250 --> 01:13:47,414
Eun Byeol!

1236
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:06,494
(The Penthouse 3)

1237
01:15:06,899 --> 01:15:08,700
I can't let it end like this.

1238
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,040
I'll go back by all means.

1239
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,540
He's coming back to kill me.

1240
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,909
Your life isn't just yours. I love you.

1241
01:15:13,909 --> 01:15:15,379
I'm getting engaged to Logan next week.

1242
01:15:15,379 --> 01:15:17,780
If I can't have it, no one can, okay?

1243
01:15:17,780 --> 01:15:19,309
There will be too many victims.

1244
01:15:19,309 --> 01:15:21,849
I'll chase him to the ends of the earth and destroy him.

1245
01:15:21,849 --> 01:15:24,914
Shim Su Ryeon, I miss you. Come here quickly.
